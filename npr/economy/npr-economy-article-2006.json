I'm Alex Chadwick.      It's a happy new year on Wall Street.  The Dow industrials had their      biggest one-day gain since the end of October.  Joining us is      \"Marketplace's\" Bob Moon.      Bob, we're seeing happy days on Wall Street.      BOB MOON reporting:      Well, indeed, we are.  It's a Wall Street axiom, Alex, that was really      borne out as the stock market headed toward the closing bell yesterday      afternoon. Traders fear the unknown, so as trading kicked off yesterday,      the market was drifting.  Well, then the Federal Reserve released the      minutes from the most recent session of monetary policy-makers, and those      minutes revealed some of the behind-the-scenes thinking that has really      been behind the central bank's credit-tightening moves.  Some of the      notes from that meeting strongly suggested the Fed may be nearly finished      with its long string of interest rate increases.  Specifically, traders      were focusing on one key passage from the minutes, and I quote here,      \"Given the information now in hand, the number of additional firming      steps required probably would not be large. \"      Now that's the strongest indication so far that the Fed is close to      backing off its efforts to cool down economic growth and keep inflation      in check. Some traders say what happened to the market then--a 129-point      jump in the Dow--suggests that the market is primed to move higher this      year if it can just get behind--or get past, I should say, the      uncertainty of how many more interest rate hikes there will be.      CHADWICK:  `The number of additional firming steps probably would not be      large'?      MOON:  Well, that suggests that they're trying to figure out just how      many more interest rate hikes they're going to need to keep inflation in      check. Let me give you another Wall Street axiom here:  As January goes,      so goes the rest of the year.      CHADWICK:  Oh!      MOON:  There's nothing definitive in that; it's just a hunch that a lot      of traders have about January and, in particular, this opening week of      the new year.  So the way the market's going right now, that could be a      harbinger of things to come.      CHADWICK:  So traders--they heard what they wanted to hear yesterday from      the Federal Reserve.  What about, well, February?  It's winter.  Maybe      there's something out there that's a little more souring than what you've      given us so far.      MOON:  Well, time will tell, as they say, Alex.  There are some mixed      economic signals that really are tempering some of the optimism on Wall      Street. There's still some fear that the Fed may already have tightened      credit too much.  There's a report from the Institute for Supply      Management that shows US manufacturing's growth rate slowed in December      from November.  On the other hand, the Commerce Department reported today      that factories posted their biggest gain in three months during November.      So there are mixed signals there.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're taking a look at some bold,      new plans in Las Vegas.      CHADWICK:  Well, a good place to look.  Bob Moon, thank you.

Economists rely on those numbers to judge      how the US economy is doing and how it might do in the future.  We asked      NPR's Adam Davidson to look at the economic outlook for 2006 and the      unusual methods used by some forecasters.      ADAM DAVIDSON reporting:      Sung Won Sohn runs Hanmi Bank.  He got a grand accolade this week.  He      was announced the most accurate economic forecaster of the 2005 economy.      He says all the official economic data told him the economy wouldn't do      terribly well. But then he was talking to a customer who runs a company      that makes 250-dollar pairs of designer jeans.      Mr. SUNG WON SOHN (Hanmi Bank):  And so I actually went to a department      store or two in LA to find out if those jeans were selling.  To make long      story short, I found out that not only were they selling well, but also      they can't make them fast enough.      DAVIDSON:  He decided if so many people can buy absurdly expensive jeans,      then the economy's got to be doing better than the official data      suggests.  He was hearing similar things from other places, so he      upgraded his assessment and he was right.      Daniel Gross writes the Money Box column for the online magazine Slate.      He's become perhaps the leading exponent of obscure economic indicators.      For example, take thoroughbred horses bought at the Keeneland auction in      Kentucky. A multimillion-dollar horse only pays off over many years.      DANIEL GROSS:  So the willingness of people to make long-term investments      in these expensive products should give us a sense of who's really      feeling optimistic about the long term, not just, you know, `I had a good      year so I'll buy some horses today. '      DAVIDSON:  Gross has a long list of obscure economic indicators.  He's      gotten good information out of Mexican mortgage rates.  He says counting      the inventories of Belgian factories can give you three months' advance      word on how the global economy's doing.  Or consider the title of his      article on copper.      GROSS:  \"The Metal That Tells Us Almost Everything We Need to Know About      the Global Economy. \"      DAVIDSON:  Copper goes in lots of things, from new home construction to      iPods, so if the price goes up because copper is in demand, it's a good      sign that the economy's humming along.      Many economists have their own personal favorite obscure economic      indicator. Some look to cardboard box sales to predict manufacturing      output.  Others say the sale of men's underwear, or the use of      dry-cleaning stores gives a good snapshot of individual wealth.  Charles      Steindel is a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  He      says there is no such thing as a secret indicator that makes the economic      future crystal clear.      Mr. CHARLES STEINDEL (Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York):      No. No, that's the problem.  If there was one, people would know about      it.      DAVIDSON:  Steindel says there aren't any shortcuts.  To get a good      picture of the economy, you've got to do the hard work and slog through      the official data.  But, he says, he's human.  He knows that can be      boring and these obscure indicators are a lot more fun.      Adam Davidson, NPR News.      INSKEEP:  Here's an indicator of the program you're hearing.

I'm Michele Norris.      MELISSA BLOCK, host:      And I'm Melissa Block.      US businesses slowed the pace of hiring in December.  The monthly      employment report released today by the Labor Department shows that      108,000 jobs were added to payrolls last month.  That's about half what      was expected.  But the weak showing in December followed a boom in      November and job creation averaged about 150,000 a month during the last      quarter of 2005.  NPR's Jack Speer reports.      JACK SPEER reporting:      In the US job market there are always winners and losers.  People get      jobs and lose jobs.  Companies go out of business and new companies are      formed.  And as the books close on 2005, on balance it appears the labor      market was in good shape.  Stuart Hoffman is with PNC Financial Services.      Mr. STUART HOFFMAN (PNC Financial Services):  The economy created two      million jobs.  That's certainly not a great year, but it's a good year.      The unemployment rate fell consistently.  At the end of 2004, I believe,      it was 5. 4 percent, and here it ended December at 4. 9 and averaged around      that, around 5 percent in the fourth quarter.  So not a great year for      the job market but definitely a solid year.      SPEER:  And that solid jobs growth occurred in an economy that faced      considerable head winds in 2005.  Interest rates were on the rise,      hurricanes battered the Gulf Coast, and the damage sent energy prices      spiraling.  Still, economists were hoping job creation would end the year      on a strong up note. That didn't happen.      Mr. JIM GLASSMAN (Senior Economist, JP Morgan):  I was a little      underwhelmed myself.      SPEER:  Jim Glassman is senior economist at JP Morgan.  Like many      observers, he'd expected an additional 200,000 jobs last month.  But even      for Glassman there were bright spots.  Take manufacturing, for instance.      Mr. GLASSMAN:  Manufacturing employment is now up for three months      running. And production workers--I think we've got about, over the last      three months, 70,000 more production workers.  That's the first sign of      hope that I've seen in the factory sector.  We lost about three million      jobs in the last five years and it's really been going nowhere.      SPEER:  Much of that hiring was in industries that make durable goods:      appliances and the like designed to last three years or more.  Bill      Zollars is CEO of YRC Worldwide, a Kansas-based transportation and      trucking company.  He isn't surprised by the jobs numbers.      Mr. BILL ZOLLARS (CEO, YRC Worldwide):  About half of our business is      with companies that do manufacturing.  So, you know, we really have seen      pretty strong growth there throughout 2005 and now into 2006.      SPEER:  One of those companies that has seen strong growth is RPM      International, a manufacturer of industrial coatings and sealants based      in Medina, Ohio.  CEO Frank Sullivan says that translated into additional      hiring last year.      Mr. FRANK SULLIVAN (CEO, RPM International):  2005 was a good year for us      businesswise and that drove about a 2 1/2 percent improvement in our core      employment base, and if the economy continues to grow our overall      employment will probably pick up from the 2 1/2 percent increase over the      last year.      SPEER:  But while manufacturing added jobs last month, there were job      losses in retail and in construction.  As for what lies ahead for 2006,      most economists expect payrolls to continue expanding this year.  It's      not clear how the Federal Reserve will view the December jobs report.      Many analysts expect at last one more interest rate hike from the Fed,      then perhaps a pause at midyear.  Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Madeleine Brand with more news about bird      flu. In China, an eight-year-old boy has been hospitalized with bird flu.      It's China's eighth case.  And in Turkey, health officials have      confirmed 14 people now have the virus.  The news out of Turkey has      spurred the European Union to impose another import ban on bird products.      And joining us to talk about this from the \"Marketplace\" European desk      in London is Stephen Beard.      And, Stephen, tell us about these new human cases of bird flu.      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      Well, five cases, Madeleine, occurred along Turkey's Black Sea coast and      this news follows yesterday's confirmation of three other cases around      the capital Ankara.  And what's worrying the European Union is that bird      flu is clearly moving westward and it seems to be moving pretty fast.  At      this rate, the fear is it could reach Europe within weeks.      BRAND:  And so how are Europeans trying to prevent that?      BEARD:  Well, today's measure, on the face of it, sounds a little bit      feeble. It's a ban on the import of all untreated bird feathers from      countries neighboring Turkey, like Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and so on.      However, imports of whole birds--that's wild birds and poultry--have      already been banned from these countries and they were banned from Turkey      last October.  So today's measure really is the sort of last piece of the      jigsaw, closing, as the EU sees it, the final chink in the armor.      BRAND:  Well, what about wild migrating birds, though?  Can't they just      fly into Europe?      BEARD:  They certainly can and, in fact, it's believed that that's      precisely how H5N1 spread from poultry flocks in Southeast Asia to China      through Russia and now to Turkey.  The EU, of course, has no defense      against this.  It has tested more than 25,000 wild birds since last fall      and none of them has tested positive to the virus.  But some EU countries      are taking no chances and they've ordered their entire poultry flocks to      be kept indoors away from any contact with wild birds while the current      threat remains.      BRAND:  But, Stephen, in spite of all the anxiety this is causing, it is      still very difficult for humans to contract this virus, right?      BEARD:  That's right.  I mean, millions of birds have caught it, but      there still have only been around a hundred and fifty confirmed human      cases, and, as you said, one more confirmed in China today.  But of      those, more than half of the people have died.  And, of course, the fear      is that if this virus mutates into something that spreads easily between      people, then this could be a catastrophic, a major pandemic.  But, you      know, there's been some very interesting research just published by a      Swedish institute suggesting that there could have been hundreds of cases      in Vietnam where humans caught H5N1 but suffered only mild flu as a      result.  So this raises the possibility--the theoretical possibility that      in many, perhaps most cases of human infection, the virus mutates into      something rather less lethal than the bird variety.      BRAND:  Stephen Beard with public radio's daily business show      \"Marketplace,\" and \"Marketplace\" is produced by American Public Media.       MADELEINE BRAND, host:       Back now with DAY TO DAY.  I'm Madeleine Brand with more news about bird      flu. In China, an eight-year-old boy has been hospitalized with bird flu.      It's China's eighth case.  And in Turkey, health officials have      confirmed 14 people now have the virus.  The news out of Turkey has      spurred the European Union to impose another import ban on bird products.      And joining us to talk about this from the \"Marketplace\" European desk      in London is Stephen Beard.       And, Stephen, tell us about these new human cases of bird flu.       STEPHEN BEARD reporting:       Well, five cases, Madeleine, occurred along Turkey's Black Sea coast and      this news follows yesterday's confirmation of three other cases around      the capital Ankara.  And what's worrying the European Union is that bird      flu is clearly moving westward and it seems to be moving pretty fast.  At      this rate, the fear is it could reach Europe within weeks.       BRAND:  And so how are Europeans trying to prevent that?       BEARD:  Well, today's measure, on the face of it, sounds a little bit      feeble. It's a ban on the import of all untreated bird feathers from      countries neighboring Turkey, like Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and so on.      However, imports of whole birds--that's wild birds and poultry--have      already been banned from these countries and they were banned from Turkey      last October.  So today's measure really is the sort of last piece of the      jigsaw, closing, as the EU sees it, the final chink in the armor.       BRAND:  Well, what about wild migrating birds, though?  Can't they just      fly into Europe?       BEARD:  They certainly can and, in fact, it's believed that that's      precisely how H5N1 spread from poultry flocks in Southeast Asia to China      through Russia and now to Turkey.  The EU, of course, has no defense      against this.  It has tested more than 25,000 wild birds since last fall      and none of them has tested positive to the virus.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      China's economic power is still growing according to foreign trade      figures released today.  The country's trade surplus with the rest of the      world tripled last year to more than $100 billion.  The figures are      likely to fuel further concern here in the US where critics claim that      the Chinese have an unfair trading advantage.  Joining us from London,      home to the world's biggest currency market, is \"Marketplace's\" Stephen      Beard.      And, Stephen, what do analysts there say about those figures?      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      That they confirm what we all know, that China is experiencing the      fastest industrial revolution in history, that is becoming like Britain      in the 19th century and the US in the 20th; the workshop of the world.      And it's flooding the US, Europe and Japan with cheap but increasingly      good-quality products.      BRAND:  But is it doing all this with an artificially low currency?      BEARD:  Yes, the yuan is low.  It's pegged against the dollar; it's held      down against the dollar.  As a result of American pressure, the Chinese      allowed it last year to appreciate fractionally, but some economists here      believe that if it were floating freely, we could see maybe a 10-percent      increase in the yuan, maybe more, and that would obviously make Chinese      products more expensive and perhaps less desirable in the US and in its      other export markets.      BRAND:  And that would help reduce America's trade deficit, right?      BEARD:  Yes.  Although actually we should say there doesn't seem to be      any sign that the Chinese authorities are going to do it.  And it must be      said China doesn't account for the whole of America's trade deficit; it      accounts for only about a quarter.      You know, there's been a tendency in the US in some quarters to demonize      the Chinese and their impact on the world economy, but Neil McKinnon of      the ECU currency management group here says that in many ways the Chinese      effect has been benign.      Mr. NEIL McKINNON (ECU Currency Management Group):  Many consumers in the      US and elsewhere have benefited from the low prices of consumer goods      that China has been producing, but it's also attributed to keeping global      inflation at a relatively low level.      BEARD:  And that has helped keep global interest rates low, too.  And      because they've been holding the yuan down against the dollar by plowing      their dollars back into US government bonds, the Chinese have helped keep      long-term US interest rates especially low as well.      BRAND:  And so do the figures today suggest that China's trade surplus      will continue to expand?      BEARD:  No.  There are separate figures for December, which suggests that      imports into China are rising faster than exports.  So the surplus, in      fact, could narrow during 2006.  Some analysts here are forecasting quite      a sharp decline in Chinese export growth over the next year, but that's      not necessarily good news for the US I'm afraid.  It's predicated on a      decline in American demand because of a cooling of the US economy.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      A nuclear standoff with Iran continues today.  The US and some European      states believe Iran is now developing nuclear weapons.  President Bush      said this morning the United States would seek a diplomatic solution to      that dispute, but Iran also made its own statement warning that all snap      inspections of its nuclear facilities would end if the United Nations      threatens sanctions.  This tension is making oil markets more volatile.      Joining us now from London is \"Marketplace's\" Stephen Beard.      And, Stephen, there's a meeting in London next week, I believe.  What is      that meeting likely to accomplish?      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      It's very difficult to tell, Madeleine.  The five permanent members of      the UN Security Council will be here--the US, the UK, France, Russia and      China--but they're not all singing from the same hymn sheet.  The US,      Britain and France are probably the most determined to confront Iran, but      China and Russia are more ambivalent.  The Chinese are buying a lot of      oil from Iran, and Russia is selling the Iranians quite a bit of civilian      nuclear technology, so they don't want to rub the Iranians up the wrong      way.      BRAND:  So we're a bit away from seeing UN sanctions against Iran.      BEARD:  Quite a long way, I would say.  The UN's nuclear watchdog, the      International Atomic Energy Authority, would have to agree to refer this      to the Security Council, but the Authority's board isn't scheduled to      meet until March.  Now the EU is pressing for an earlier meeting, but      really this could all take months.      BRAND:  Well, in general, what's the appetite there for sanctions against      Iran?      BEARD:  I think there's a lot of nervousness about this.  I mean, Iran,      after all, is the world's fourth biggest oil exporter, two and a half      million barrels a day.  And the world can't afford to lose any of that      oil at the moment.  Now it's highly unlikely that the Security Council      would try to cut Iranian oil exports.  It's more likely to punish Iran in      other ways, imposing a UN ban on foreign investment in Iran, for example.      But inside Iran, this has become a matter of national pride, and there      must be a danger that UN sanctions could tip the country into retaliating      by withholding some or a lot of its oil from the market.      BRAND:  And the price of oil has been rising recently.  How much of this      is related to this standoff with Iran?      BEARD:  Probably quite a bit.  It's now--the price is now hovering around      $65 a barrel, when some analysts say that the economic fundamentals      suggest it should be more like in the mid-50s.  The market's deepest      fear--I mean, the real nightmare scenario--is that Israel might get      involved and take the kind of direct action against Iran that it once      took against a nuclear facility in Iraq and bomb it.  That would inflame      the Muslim world and could provoke an OPEC oil embargo with catastrophic      consequences.  So even the remote possibility of that happening is likely      to underpin the oil price for some months to come.

US markets are closed today for the Martin Luther King holiday.  Starting      tomorrow, though, there's going to be a lot of activity, lots of      fourth-quarter profit reports from corporations, plus the latest figures      on housing and inflation.  \"Marketplace's\" Tess Vigeland is here with us.      Tess, let's start with inflation.  What are analysts expecting from the      consumer price index?      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Well, last Friday the government released the producer price index, and      that's what manufacturers and stores are paying for the goods that they      sell, and it jumped 5. 4 percent last year.  So most economists are      expecting that we'll see a bump in the consumer numbers on Wednesday,      mostly because of the spike in energy and gas prices.  And that presents      something of a dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which, of course,      signaled at its last meeting that it might be taking a breather from      these interest rate hikes that we've seen the last couple of years.  Hugh      Johnson is the chief economist at First Albany.      Mr. HUGH JOHNSON (Chief Economist, First Albany):  The real issue for      them is: Will the rise in energy prices spread through to the rest of the      economy?  We still have to be vigilant.  We still have to keep a      so-called tight grip on things, and that's particularly true now.      VIGELAND:  And Johnson is predicting that the CPI is going to show an      increase of between . 4 and . 6 percent for December.  Again, we'll find      out on Wednesday.      CHADWICK:  OK.  What about housing starts?  Are we still waiting for the      dreaded drop in new home sales?      VIGELAND:  Yeah, that's really been the question for the past couple of      years now.  And most economists will tell you that we are seeing some      softening in the housing market, although it's really more of a slowing      of the red-hot growth than an actual slowdown.  The consensus forecast is      that we will see a decline in housing starts for December but not to the      extent that it'll show a real break in either home sales or the price of      homes.      CHADWICK:  OK.  Finally, corporate earnings season, lots of big-name      companies reporting how they did in the last quarter of last year.  What      is Wall Street expecting?      VIGELAND:  Well, we do have lots of big names issuing their quarterly      reports this week.  Tomorrow we have Intel, Yahoo! and IBM, among others;      on Wednesday, Apple Computer, eBay, Southwest Airlines and a couple of      banks; and later this week, Motorola, Merrill Lynch and GE.  Now Hugh      Johnson says Wall Street is expecting the growth rate of earnings to ease      off a bit.      Mr. JOHNSON:  A little bit of a slowdown, of course, is, in part, because      of the impact--some impact of Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, slowing      of the economy somewhat that we saw.  But we're going to watch energy      very, very closely.  What happened with the rise in energy price, what's      going to be the impact on energy stocks?      VIGELAND:  And he says technology stocks are going to be another      bellwether, and with all those names I mentioned earlier, this is the      week to be watching those earnings reports.      And later today on \"Marketplace,\" the first of our week-long broadcasts      live from China.  Today we're looking at the pace of that country's      growth.      CHADWICK:  All right.

But we're going to watch energy      very, very closely.  What happened with the rise in energy price, what's      going to be the impact on energy stocks?       VIGELAND:  And he says technology stocks are going to be another      bellwether, and with all those names I mentioned earlier, this is the      week to be watching those earnings reports.       And later today on \"Marketplace,\" the first of our week-long broadcasts      live from China.  Today we're looking at the pace of that country's      growth.       CHADWICK:  All right.

Oil is not the only commodity that's pricey these days. Copper and aluminum are expensive now too because of hurricane reconstruction and building booms in China and India. But here's the downside, materials like aluminum siding and electrical wiring are attracting a lot of attention from thieves. John Dimsdale joins us from Marketplace's Washington bureau. And John, what's your evidence of these materials have become so expensive? Mr. JOHN DIMSDALE (Marketplace): Well, police in Montgomery, Alabama arrested a guy who stole all the copper downspouts from a church. Streetlights in Tucson, Arizona went out when somebody took eight miles of copper power cable. A bunch of aluminum light poles went missing in Maryland. Air conditioners, solar panel tubing, radiators are missing, all this kind of theft has taken place before of course, but there appears to be a rash recently caused largely by record-high prices for copper and aluminum and also lead and zinc. BRAND: So what do people do with this material once they've stolen it? Mr. DIMSDALE: Well, they're reusable, so there's always been a thriving market for old materials. Scrap yards are used to trucks pulling up with pipes or wiring from construction sites, or when a building or house is being torn down. Scrap copper goes for as much as $1. 80 a pound these days which is double what it was a year ago. Bob Garino with the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries says, in such an active market for used metals it's tough to screen for stolen material. Mr. BOB GARINO (Director of Commodities, Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries): At the lowest level, say the peddler level where the guy is, you know, drives around with a pickup truck looking for material, all we have to do is listen to the radio or see a newspaper and you'll pick up on this. There's always demolition going on somewhere, somehow. So people are attuned to what's going on in the marketplace and they're opportunistic and entrepreneurial. BRAND: So John, is there a solution, a way to crack down on this? Mr. DIMSDALE: Well, the experts say that the volatile price for used metals should solve the problem. High prices for scrap are always, or usually anyway, temporary, and as they fall, so does theft. But some are predicting that these high prices and big demand for used metals will be around for a while, and in that case, scrap metal dealers are gonna have to start registering their suppliers and tagging and tracking materials like siding and electrical wire. It's all gonna make overall construction much more expensive. Coming up later today on Marketplace, it's our last day of hosting the show from China and we asked, should the U.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: And I'm Alex Chadwick. Coming up, reactions from around the country to today's announcement that the Ford Motor Company will be cutting tens of thousands of jobs. BRAND: That's the lead today, plant closings and massive job cuts at the nation's second largest carmaker. The Ford Motor Company will be cutting at least 25,000 jobs and closing 14 facilities, all in North America. Ford executives are calling today's announcement The Way Forward. It's a long-term restructuring plan aimed at stemming billion dollar losses in its North American plants. CEO Bill Ford spoke this morning at Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Mr. BILL FORD (CEO, Ford Motor Company): These cuts are a painful last resort. And I'm deeply mindful of their impact. They're going to affect many lives, many families, and many communities. And we'll do everything we reasonably can to ease the burdens. CHADWICK: That's the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, Bill Ford, speaking this morning to employees and shareholders. BRAND: We're going to get reaction now from two locations. In a moment, we'll hear from Ford's Hapeville plant. That's outside Atlanta, Georgia. First, though, to reporter Matt Sepic with member station KWMU in St. Louis. And Matt, tell us about the Hazelwood assembly plant there. How many jobs are affected? Mr. MATT SEPIC (Reporter, KWMU): There are more than 1,400 workers at the Hazelwood assembly plant here in the St. Louis area. They make Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer SUVs. BRAND: And this plant had already been reduced to one shift already, I understand. Mr. SEPIC: That's correct. Back in 2003, then Missouri Governor Bob Holden, and other local officials in the St. Louis area, worked out a deal with the Ford Motor Company to keep the plant open on one shift, and keep those jobs here, in exchange for tax incentives for Ford, as well as some training opportunities for the employees here at the plant. BRAND: You said one of the trucks they make is the Ford Explorer. I thought that was a pretty popular model. Mr. SEPIC: Well, the Ford Explorer and the related Mercury Mountaineer are truck-based SUVs. They don't get as good of gas mileage as what many automakers are moving toward now, which are SUVs based on a car chassis. And they are not as fuel-efficient as some of the smaller models. BRAND: Matt Sepic from member station KWMU in St. Louis. Thank you very much. Mr. SEPIC: You're very welcome. CHADWICK: And joining us now, reporter Charles Edwards. He's near Ford's Hapeville plant, which is outside Atlanta. Charles, what is going on there? Bad news again here for this plant? CHARLES EDWARDS reporting: There is bad news. And right now there are people honking their cars, honking their horns, I should say, coming out of the plant with their thumbs down, obviously a sign from workers that they're very displeased at the news that they heard from the Webcast this morning. CHADWICK: So, what specifically is going to be happening at Hapeville? EDWARDS: Well, this plant is actually going to be closing down by 2008, and the 2,100 workers here at the Ford plant, they're known for producing the Ford Taurus, which is, as we've heard reported, one of the models that Ford is looking to slow down or even cease production of in the near future. So, things aren't looking good right now for the plant here in Hapeville. CHADWICK: This has to be an enormous kind of turnaround for them, because not very long ago the Taurus was the most popular car in America. And times must have been pretty good. EDWARDS: Times were good. And you're right, it is an amazing turnaround, because I was talking to a fellow reporter who said that he found that you couldn't even find a Taurus nowadays on a showroom floor, that a lot of the Tauruses are now being used just for rental purposes. CHADWICK: Twenty-one hundred jobs lost there in the plant. For Hapeville, this is bad news. EDWARDS: I was talking to Hapeville city government officials just earlier, and Hapeville is a major employer here in this southern part of Atlanta. It brings in a million dollars a year in tax revenue for Hapeville city government. So, as soon as this plant closes down, the mayor and city officials, and even the governor of Georgia will be working hard to try to bring a new plant to this facility, because they'll need to fill that tax space. CHADWICK: Reporter Charles Edwards in Hapeville, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, more news on the Ford plant closings. Charles, thank you. EDWARDS: Thank you.

I'm Ed Gordon. According to the Economic Policy Institute, nearly one-half of Americans now live in states that require wages higher than the nine-year-old federal minimum wage of $5. 50. But in other states, the federal minimum wage is still the standard. Advocates say this so-called living wage helps lift people out of poverty. Critics say hiking the minimum wage pushes low skilled workers out of the market and punishes small businesses. Coming up, two economists look at the issue. But first, the struggle to make ends meet. Los Angeles was one of the first cities to enact a living wage law in 1997. Some companies that do business with the city, like airport restaurants and parking lots, must pay workers at least $9. 08, with health benefits. The law covers 10,000 workers. Reporter Robin Urevich introduces us to one of them. ROBIN UREVICH reporting: On this day, 56-year old Maria Mosquerra(ph) is at home doing chores and tending to her pet bird. (Soundbite of Maria Mosquerra talking to her bird) UREVICH: Most days, Mosquerra is on the job at L. A. International Airport. She's one of the people you see pushing wheelchair bound passengers or shepherding kids traveling alone through the airport. She loves her job. But before L. A. 's living wage law kicked in, she was making California's minimum wage, $5. 75 at the time. She and her husband, a welder, were raising three teenage boys, counting their pennies and barely scraping by. Ms. MARIA MOSQUERRA (Worker, L. A. Airport): And then with the living wage ordinance I think everything changed. It was like $2. 50 more per hour, and then some of the things we couldn't afford before we started to afford. UREVICH: One of those things was their own home in a working class suburb just south of downtown L. A. Maria shows off the living and dining room, still new looking, with gleaming white paint and fresh carpet. Ms. MOSQUERRA: And the house has three bedrooms upstairs; there's a little garden.  It's not very. . . (laughter) UREVICH: Oh, show me the garden. Ms. MOSQUERRA: Well, we need to fix too many things, because this is a small area. But for us it's more than enough. UREVICH: Three years ago, Maria, her husband and one of their grown sons pooled their incomes and applied for a mortgage. She says that if it weren't for the living wage, about 5,000 additional dollars a year, the family wouldn't have qualified. Ms. MOSQUERRA: I couldn't believe it when they called us and they said, you got the house. Oh, my goodness, it was hard for me to believe. Thank God, thanks to the living wage, and thanks to my sons and my husband. UREVICH: The 10,000 workers covered by L. A. 's living wage are a tiny fraction of the city's low wage work force. And $10. 00 an hour has barely lifted most of them out of poverty. Still that's a huge accomplishment, says Madeline Janis-Aparicio, who heads the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, the group that led the living wage fight. And she says the campaign has also had a broader impact. Ms. MADELINE JANIS-APARICIO (Executive Director, Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy): What the living wage has done and the movement for a living wage is really lift up this idea that we have to be paying people at least enough to survive. And so even Republicans like Governor Schwarzenegger are acknowledging that we need to raise up the minimum wage. Even the L. A. Chamber of Commerce, for example, has agreed that we need to raise the minimum wage somewhat. UREVICH: Indeed, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is proposing to raise the state minimum wage to $7. 75. Nine years ago, L. A. 's living wage law faced fierce opposition from business groups who argue that companies would lay off workers or even close up shop if they were forced to pay the living wage. That didn't happen, says one living wage opponent, economist Jack Keyser. Still he argues, rules and regulations like the living wage hamper private business and ultimately hurt the working poor. Mr. JACK KEYSER (Economist): Maybe the best way to do it is to look at how we can be very, very friendly to business, grow your economy, create somewhat of a labor shortage, and then everybody gets an increase, because they have to pay more to attract workers. UREVICH: One thing both sides agree, the living wage law has done little to encourage employers to provide health insurance, even though it allows them to pay $1. 25 less if they provide benefits. Airport worker Maria Mosquerra says a major illness could wipe out the security she now enjoys. Still as she holds her first grandchild, nine-month old Kevin, on her lap, she says she has high hopes for the future. Kevin is going to college someday, she says, and maybe she'll be able to help pay for it. For NPR News, I'm Robin Urevich in Los Angeles.  ED GORDON, host:  From NPR News, this is NEWS AND NOTES.

For the past 18 years, he has been arguably the most powerful man in the U. S. economy, guiding the Fed's interest rate policy and presiding over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. NPR's John Ydstie has this look back at Alan Greenspan's record. JOHN YDSTIE reporting: Alan Greenspan's steady hand on the tiller through boom times and crisis has inspired fans from presidents to investors to dub him the maestro, the oracle, a legend. As reporter Bob Garfield demonstrated in a story on this program several years ago, his aura even on the street outshines many celebrities. BOB GARFIELD reporting: What do you think of Alan Greenspan? Unidentified Woman #1: I heard that whatever he says, the market follows. GARFIELD: What do you think of Dennis Hastert? Unidentified Woman #1: I don't know who that is. GARFIELD: What do you think of Alan Greenspan? Unidentified Man: I think he's doing a good job. GARFIELD: How about Vladimir Putin? Any thoughts? Unidentified Man: Don't know him. GARFIELD: What do you think of Alan Greenspan? Unidentified Woman #2: I think he's doing a good job. GARFIELD: With the. . . Unidentified Woman #2: With the market and the situation, yeah. GARFIELD: And what about Justin Timberlake, how do you feel about him? Unidentified Woman #2: Don't know him. YDSTIE: Given his celebrity status, it's difficult to remember that back in the mid 1990s, Mr. Greenspan was weathering criticism from some quarters for holding interest rates too high. Here's Senator Byron Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota. Senator BYRON DORGAN (Democrat, North Dakota): Our country could and should have more robust economic growth, which means more jobs and more economic opportunity, except for the fact that Mr. Greenspan and his friends at the Fed seem to view themselves as a set of human brake pads whose sole mission in life it is to slow down the American economy. YDSTIE: In fact, Greenspan's failure to reduce interest rates more quickly during the recession of the early 1990s contributed to a slow recovery going into the 1992 election year. That may have cost the first President Bush a second term. But Alan Greenspan apparently learned from that error and was much more deft at managing interest rates after that. And, overall, he compiled an economic record unmatched by any previous central banker, says economist Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University. Dr. ALLAN H. MELTZER (Carnegie Mellon University): They're the two longest periods of peacetime expansion in the history of the United States, punctuated by two very mild recessions. That's quite an achievement. YDSTIE: The first expansion began under Greenspan's predecessor, Paul Volcker, and Greenspan is handing a third long expansion to his replacement, Ben Bernanke. In addition, under Greenspan, unemployment reached its lowest level in 30 years at the same time, says Princeton economist Alan Blinder, inflation declined. Dr. ALAN S. BLINDER (Princeton University): Alan Greenspan came into office with a four percent inflation rate and he's going out with a two percent inflation rate despite a quite strong growth record, and I think that's the real achievement. YDSTIE: Blinder, an adviser to President Clinton and vice chairman at the Fed in the mid 1990s, says Greenspan is arguably the best central banker ever. Alan Greenspan has his critics, too. The editors of The Economist magazine, for instance, argue he gets too much credit for keeping inflation low. During the past two decades, they say, globalization was the most important force pushing inflation down, both in the U. S. and around the world. Greenspan's critics also argue the chairman should have pricked the stock market bubble of the late 1990s. The chairman didn't ignore the bubble. In a famous speech in December of 1996, he pondered whether and how a central bank should respond to such events. Mr. ALAN GREENSPAN (Chairman, Federal Reserve Board): How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions, as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy? YDSTIE: Despite his apparent concern, Greenspan didn't take any direct action, and the stock bubble continued to grow for three and a half more years. Then it burst on its own, costing investors trillions of dollars. Greenspan has also been criticized for not doing something to prevent the rapid run-up in housing prices in some parts of the country. Allan Meltzer, who's completing a two-volume history of the Federal Reserve, defends Greenspan's hands-off policy. Dr. MELTZER: The Fed's job is not to prevent people from doing stupid things or from making mistakes. That's what a free enterprise market is about. People make mistakes and they lose their money. YDSTIE: Through it all, however, Alan Greenspan remained popular. His steady handling of the 1987 stock market crash, the Asian financial turmoil, and the economic fallout of 9/11 cemented the public's confidence in him. And, says Alan Blinder, his reputation meant that when he spoke about matters even beyond monetary policy, people listened. Dr. BLINDER: Greenspan's tacit endorsement of the Clinton budget deficit reduction program in 1993 helped it get through Congress just as Greenspan's endorsement of the Bush tax cut in 2001 helped that get through Congress. Greenspan's been a very influential person for a long time. YDSTIE: But Allan Meltzer thinks Greenspan strayed too far into areas that weren't a Fed Chairman's business. Dr. MELTZER: I think there's a tinge of politics involved in both the support for the Clinton tax increases and the support for the Bush tax cuts. There's a fine line there between the Federal Reserve as an independent agency, and the Federal Reserve as a political agency. Certainly wherever that line is, Alan Greenspan was over the line. YDSTIE: Alan Blinder agrees. He says the next Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, would be well advised to steer clear of political disputes. In some ways, Greenspan celebrity too crossed the line and became a distraction says Blinder. Dr. BLINDER: What you really want from a social point of view is confidence in the Federal Reserve. And what, what's been built up to a great extent over the last 18 plus years, has been confidence in Alan Greenspan. So there is some danger in the cult of personality. YDSTIE: Hopefully, says Blinder, some of the confidence in Greenspan has rubbed off on the institution. We'll soon find out because on Wednesday morning Alan Greenspan will no longer be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. John Ydstie, NPR News. Washington.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  At one minute past midnight on Wednesday, February 1, Alan Greenspan leaves his post as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. For the past 18 years, he has been arguably the most powerful man in the U. S. economy, guiding the Fed's interest rate policy and presiding over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. NPR's John Ydstie has this look back at Alan Greenspan's record.  JOHN YDSTIE reporting:  Alan Greenspan's steady hand on the tiller through boom times and crisis has inspired fans from presidents to investors to dub him the maestro, the oracle, a legend. As reporter Bob Garfield demonstrated in a story on this program several years ago, his aura even on the street outshines many celebrities.  BOB GARFIELD reporting:  What do you think of Alan Greenspan?  Unidentified Woman #1: I heard that whatever he says, the market follows.  GARFIELD: What do you think of Dennis Hastert?  Unidentified Woman #1: I don't know who that is.  GARFIELD: What do you think of Alan Greenspan?  Unidentified Man: I think he's doing a good job.  GARFIELD: How about Vladimir Putin? Any thoughts?  Unidentified Man: Don't know him.  GARFIELD: What do you think of Alan Greenspan?  Unidentified Woman #2: I think he's doing a good job.  GARFIELD: With the. . .  Unidentified Woman #2: With the market and the situation, yeah.  GARFIELD: And what about Justin Timberlake, how do you feel about him?  Unidentified Woman #2: Don't know him.  YDSTIE: Given his celebrity status, it's difficult to remember that back in the mid 1990s, Mr. Greenspan was weathering criticism from some quarters for holding interest rates too high. Here's Senator Byron Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota.  Senator BYRON DORGAN (Democrat, North Dakota): Our country could and should have more robust economic growth, which means more jobs and more economic opportunity, except for the fact that Mr. Greenspan and his friends at the Fed seem to view themselves as a set of human brake pads whose sole mission in life it is to slow down the American economy.  YDSTIE: In fact, Greenspan's failure to reduce interest rates more quickly during the recession of the early 1990s contributed to a slow recovery going into the 1992 election year. That may have cost the first President Bush a second term. But Alan Greenspan apparently learned from that error and was much more deft at managing interest rates after that. And, overall, he compiled an economic record unmatched by any previous central banker, says economist Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University.  Dr. ALLAN H.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Some new numbers out today show the U. S. economy was surprisingly weak in the fourth quarter of last year. The Commerce Department's first look at the gross domestic product has the economy expanding at an annual rate of 1. 1 percent. That's well below the previous quarter, and less than half of what was expected. Most economists agree on what's behind the slowdown, but, as NPR's Jack Speer reports, they differ on what it means. JACK SPEER reporting: The economists we talked to today all agreed on one thing. The slowdown was brought to you by rising energy prices. Bernard Baumohl is executive director of The Economic Outlook Group. He says higher oil and gas prices, along with increased borrowing costs, left consumers with little choice but to rein in their spending. Mr. BERNARD BAUMOHL (Director, The Economic Outlook Group): Consumers now have this huge debt load, and they face rising interest rates in terms of servicing that debt. They've had higher energy costs, virtually no personal savings, and the household income has been growing below the rate of inflation, and when you put it all together, something had to give. SPEER: And it was that slowdown in consumer spending, especially for so-called big ticket durable items such as cars and trucks, that was one of the major factors weighing on the economy. But a number of analysts also view the latest numbers with some suspicion. Joel Naroff is head of Naroff Economic Advisors. He thinks the sales incentives offered by the major automakers last year artificially boosted GDP in the third quarter while reducing it in the final months of the year. Mr. JOEL NAROFF (President, Naroff Economic Advisors): We had the employee discounts in July. We had record sales in July. And they slowly came down from that point. So we had an artificially high consumer number in the third quarter and an artificially low consumer number in the fourth quarter. And really, if you average the two quarters together, you probably have growth somewhere in the 2-1/2 percent range, and that's where I think the economy is at at this point. SPEER: And that view was echoed by Dudley Devorkin (ph), a Washington, D. C. area Chevy dealer. Devorkin says he witnessed firsthand the power of incentives, which at his dealership helped prop up SUV sales even as gas prices were spiraling upwards. Mr. DUDLEY DEVORKIN (Automobile dealer, Washington, D. C. ): I think right now manufacturers, they turn the faucet on and off. When they want to sell or move merchandise, I think they, you know, open up the rebates or the low interest rates, and it attracts people. And when they turn them off, business slows down. SPEER: Still, Devorkin says it's clear consumer spending is taking a hit as prices for gasoline, natural gas and home heating oil all rise. Higher interest rates have also cut down on home refinancings, a recent source of ready cash for consumers. But not all economists believe the weak assessment released today is a sign the economy is necessarily headed for trouble. Some say there are already signs things have begun picking up in the first quarter of this year. Nariman Behravesh is chief economist at Global Insight. Dr. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH (Chief Economist, Global Insight): We are very much in the camp that we think there will be a rebound in the first quarter. We're right now saying growth in the first quarter will be around 3. 8 percent. We think autos will bounce back. We think defense spending, which is one of the sources of weakness in the fourth quarter, will bounce back. SPEER: With the numbers released today, it's now possible to calculate a growth rate for the entire year. The U. S. economy expanded at a respectable pace of 3-1/2 percent in 2005. Still not clear is how the Federal Reserve will react to the slowdown when it meets next week. Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

It happens tomorrow. As Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Greenspan presided over the two longest peacetime periods of growth in the nation's history. He also led the way through financial storms, including the stock market crash of 1987. NPR's John Ydstie takes a look at Greenspan's legacy. JOHN YDSTIE reporting: When the United States economy was booming in the summer of 2000, Alan Greenspan was warmly welcomed to Capital Hill by the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Senator PHIL GRAMM (Republican, Texas): We're very glad to have you here again Mr. Chairman. You have become a national phenomenon.  YDSTIE: As he greeted Greenspan at the hearing's opening, Senator Phil Gramm marveled at what he described as the strongest economy in United States history. Senator GRAMM: There are many who would be quick to take credit, but I think if you had to narrow it down to who deserves more credit than anybody else on the planet, that person is sitting before us today, and his name is Alan Greenspan.  YDSTIE: That kind of praise for Greenspan was common during the boom years of the late 1990s. While the tributes may not be as fawning as they once were, there's broad agreement that Alan Greenspan is among the best, if not the best, central banker ever. Professor Allan Meltzer, of Carnegie Mellon University, is finishing a history of the Federal Reserve. He says after Greenspan took over at the Fed in 1987, he preserved his predecessor Paul Volker's hard-fought victory over inflation, and then, with a combination of mastery of data and shrewd judgments, he presided over an unprecedented period of growth. Mr. ALLAN MELTZER (Professor of Political Economy and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University): So that we've had these 25 or 30 years of low inflation and stable growth punctuated by two very small recessions, and we've seen per capita income in the United States go from $25,000 to $37,000. So we've done remarkably well. YDSTIE: Princeton University Economist Alan Blinder, an advisor to President Clinton and then vice-chairman at the Fed under Greenspan, praises the chairman too. Blinder says one of the reasons for the economy's remarkable performance under Greenspan was his willingness to challenge one piece of economic orthodoxy. In the second half of the 1990s, Greenspan refused to raise interest rates as unemployment fell to levels that economic theory suggested would spark inflation. Mr. ALAN BLINDER (Gordon S. Rentschler Memorial Professor of Economics at Princeton University): I don't think you could have found one economist out of one thousand that in 1996, say, would have said, You know, we can let the unemployment rate drift all the way down to 4 percent and we won't have any inflation as a consequence. Nobody believed that. I doubt that Alan Greenspan believed that in 1996, but he was willing to watch and wait as the unemployment drifted lower and lower and lower and lower, and we still had no inflation. YDSTIE: Part of the reason Greenspan took that risk, says Blinder, was that he perceived the boom in American productivity before the evidence was in. That higher productivity helped keep inflation low, even as the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time in 30 years. Another element of Greenspan's success, says Blinder, was his love of arcane data; from the number of cardboard boxes being produced to the output of steel ingots. As he was reappointed to the Chairman's post by Bill Clinton in January of 2000, Greenspan thanked the President and acknowledged the addiction. Mr. ALAN GREENSPAN (Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve): I must say I've enjoyed every minute of it. It's really been an extraordinary challenged, and especially for an economist who likes to get into the nitty-gritty and every statistic you'd ever seen. As I said to the President before, it's like eating peanuts: you keep doing it, keep doing it, and you never get tired.  YDSTIE: Greenspan's reappointment by Clinton is evidence of the political skill he brought to the job of Fed Chairman. After all, he was first appointed by Ronald Reagan, then by the first President Bush, then by Clinton, and finally by George W. Bush. That's proof that he pleased other constituents as well, from Wall Street to Main Street. One President, though, George Bush the elder, wasn't happy with Greenspan. The reason, says Blinder, is that Bush-One suffered from one of Greenspan's mistakes. During the recession of 1990 and 1991, the Chairman didn't drop interest rates fast enough. That meant the economic recovery leading up to the 1992 election was very weak. Mr. BLINDER: The President and the President's men thought that the high interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve was going to cost their guy, President George H. W. Bush, reelection. And, they were probably right. So, yeah, it did get testy. YDSTIE: Greenspan also lost standing more recently, especially among Democrats, when he supported the current President Bush's big tax cuts. Greenspan had previously resisted the idea of using the surpluses to cut taxes, arguing surpluses should be used to pay down the national debt. But in January of 2001, as surplus projections grew, he changed his mind. Mr. GREENSPAN: It never entered my mind that we could get to the point where debt reduction was not the prime purpose of employing surpluses. I still hold, number one priority is reducing the debt. The problem is we're going to get that out of the way far sooner than any of us imagined. YDSTIE: That cleared the way for the 2001 tax cuts. But as we all know, the surpluses evaporated and now deficits are back in record territory, at least in dollar terms. Greenspan's change of heart led Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to call him a political hack. Alan Blinder doesn't agree with Reid's characterization, but he believes Greenspan crossed the political line. Mr. BLINDER: I think he strayed into areas pretty much disconnected from monetary policy that were intensely political, and he took a partisan position. And I don't think that's a good thing for a Federal Reserve Chairman to do. YDSTIE: Allan Meltzer, who's a fellow at the Conservative American Enterprise Institute, agrees. And Meltzer also believes even Greenspan's support of Bill Clinton's deficit reduction program was too political.  Mr. MELTZER: I believe he went over the edge. And the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve would be well advised to pull back; that is, to talk about things which have to do with monetary policy. YDSTIE: Some critics also fault Greenspan for not acting to burst the stock market bubble and to slow the more recent run up in housing prices. Defenders say he had no surgical way to do that without harming the rest of the economy. In any case, Allan Meltzer says, Greenspan's successor, Ben Bernanke, has a tough act to follow. On the one hand, he says, Bernanke is a respected monetary economist and has the support of lots of constituencies from academia to Wall Street. Mr. MELTZER: What we don't know about him, and we didn't know it about Greenspan either in 1987, was, when economic theory doesn't tell you exactly what to do, you have to make a judgment. How good are you at making those judgments? YDSTIE: Ben Bernanke will take over for Alan Greenspan at one minute past midnight on Wednesday. Chairman Greenspan, who is 79-years-old, will reportedly set up a consulting business in Washington. John Ydstie, NPR News.

Mr. ALLAN MELTZER (Professor of Political Economy and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University): So that we've had these 25 or 30 years of low inflation and stable growth punctuated by two very small recessions, and we've seen per capita income in the United States go from $25,000 to $37,000. So we've done remarkably well.  YDSTIE: Princeton University Economist Alan Blinder, an advisor to President Clinton and then vice-chairman at the Fed under Greenspan, praises the chairman too. Blinder says one of the reasons for the economy's remarkable performance under Greenspan was his willingness to challenge one piece of economic orthodoxy.  In the second half of the 1990s, Greenspan refused to raise interest rates as unemployment fell to levels that economic theory suggested would spark inflation.  Mr. ALAN BLINDER (Gordon S. Rentschler Memorial Professor of Economics at Princeton University): I don't think you could have found one economist out of one thousand that in 1996, say, would have said, You know, we can let the unemployment rate drift all the way down to 4 percent and we won't have any inflation as a consequence. Nobody believed that. I doubt that Alan Greenspan believed that in 1996, but he was willing to watch and wait as the unemployment drifted lower and lower and lower and lower, and we still had no inflation.  YDSTIE: Part of the reason Greenspan took that risk, says Blinder, was that he perceived the boom in American productivity before the evidence was in. That higher productivity helped keep inflation low, even as the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time in 30 years.  Another element of Greenspan's success, says Blinder, was his love of arcane data; from the number of cardboard boxes being produced to the output of steel ingots. As he was reappointed to the Chairman's post by Bill Clinton in January of 2000, Greenspan thanked the President and acknowledged the addiction.  Mr. ALAN GREENSPAN (Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve): I must say I've enjoyed every minute of it. It's really been an extraordinary challenged, and especially for an economist who likes to get into the nitty-gritty and every statistic you'd ever seen. As I said to the President before, it's like eating peanuts: you keep doing it, keep doing it, and you never get tired.   YDSTIE: Greenspan's reappointment by Clinton is evidence of the political skill he brought to the job of Fed Chairman. After all, he was first appointed by Ronald Reagan, then by the first President Bush, then by Clinton, and finally by George W. Bush. That's proof that he pleased other constituents as well, from Wall Street to Main Street.  One President, though, George Bush the elder, wasn't happy with Greenspan. The reason, says Blinder, is that Bush-One suffered from one of Greenspan's mistakes. During the recession of 1990 and 1991, the Chairman didn't drop interest rates fast enough. That meant the economic recovery leading up to the 1992 election was very weak.  Mr. BLINDER: The President and the President's men thought that the high interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve was going to cost their guy, President George H. W. Bush, reelection. And, they were probably right. So, yeah, it did get testy.  YDSTIE: Greenspan also lost standing more recently, especially among Democrats, when he supported the current President Bush's big tax cuts. Greenspan had previously resisted the idea of using the surpluses to cut taxes, arguing surpluses should be used to pay down the national debt. But in January of 2001, as surplus projections grew, he changed his mind.  Mr. GREENSPAN: It never entered my mind that we could get to the point where debt reduction was not the prime purpose of employing surpluses. I still hold, number one priority is reducing the debt. The problem is we're going to get that out of the way far sooner than any of us imagined.  YDSTIE: That cleared the way for the 2001 tax cuts. But as we all know, the surpluses evaporated and now deficits are back in record territory, at least in dollar terms.  Greenspan's change of heart led Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to call him a political hack. Alan Blinder doesn't agree with Reid's characterization, but he believes Greenspan crossed the political line.  Mr. BLINDER: I think he strayed into areas pretty much disconnected from monetary policy that were intensely political, and he took a partisan position. And I don't think that's a good thing for a Federal Reserve Chairman to do.  YDSTIE: Allan Meltzer, who's a fellow at the Conservative American Enterprise Institute, agrees. And Meltzer also believes even Greenspan's support of Bill Clinton's deficit reduction program was too political.   Mr. MELTZER: I believe he went over the edge. And the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve would be well advised to pull back; that is, to talk about things which have to do with monetary policy.  YDSTIE: Some critics also fault Greenspan for not acting to burst the stock market bubble and to slow the more recent run up in housing prices. Defenders say he had no surgical way to do that without harming the rest of the economy. In any case, Allan Meltzer says, Greenspan's successor, Ben Bernanke, has a tough act to follow. On the one hand, he says, Bernanke is a respected monetary economist and has the support of lots of constituencies from academia to Wall Street.  Mr. MELTZER: What we don't know about him, and we didn't know it about Greenspan either in 1987, was, when economic theory doesn't tell you exactly what to do, you have to make a judgment. How good are you at making those judgments?  YDSTIE: Ben Bernanke will take over for Alan Greenspan at one minute past midnight on Wednesday.  Chairman Greenspan, who is 79-years-old, will reportedly set up a consulting business in Washington.  John Ydstie, NPR News.

He's expected to mark his departure by raising interest rates one more time before he hands over the job to Ben Bernanke. David Wessel is The Wall Street Journal's Deputy Washington Bureau Chief. Steve Inskeep asked him how the transition is going. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal): Pretty smoothly, it seems to me. Unlike all the sturm and drang over the Supreme Court nominees, Mr. Bush's appointment of Ben Bernanke to replace Mr. Greenspan has been pretty well received, both on Capitol Hill and on Wall Street. STEVE INSKEEP, reporting:  How solid is the economy at this moment? Mr. WESSEL: You know, the fourth quarter turned out to be very disappointing, only 1. 1% growth. So, Mr. Bernanke has to decide, is the economy slowing down precipitously, is the housing bubble about to burst, is business investment running out of steam? Or is inflation about to take off? The fourth quarter GDP numbers had a little bit of noise about inflation, and I'm sure that's something that Mr. Bernanke will be worrying about, because he needs to establish his credibility as an inflation fighter right out of the box. INSKEEP: So, he has to decide, do I raise interest rates even again or keep them steady, or even lower them a little bit? How soon dose he have to decide? Mr. WESSEL: Mr. Greenspan will preside over one more rate increase at today's meeting. The next meeting doesn't come until March 28. So he's got almost two months to figure out what's going on. INSKEEP: Now, David, we've talked a lot in the past about Greenspan being difficult to read. Are people already trying to figure out how to read Ben Bernanke? Mr. WESSEL: Yes, and they will be. In the middle of February, he has to appear before Congress and deliver the Fed Semiannual Monetary Policy Report. And it won't be like any other testimony he's given. When you become Chairman of the Fed, you get an incredibly powerful megaphone, and in my experience, Fed officials, Treasury officials, they never understand just how loud the megaphone is until they speak into it the first time. INSKEEP: Does that mean that even though the guy's been warned, he's almost sure to say something that's going to cause stocks to go tumbling, or soaring, or something? Mr. WESSEL: Almost sure, yes. And it, it's likely to be an inadvertent remark. You know, every Fed Chairman wants to move the markets when he thinks they're going the wrong direction. The danger is you inadvertently move them. You say something that you think is, like reading an economic textbook, and you'll discover that, all of a sudden, it has enormous import on the market. INSKEEP: Can we learn anything from the last transition between Fed Chairmen back in 1987 when Paul Volcker left, and Allan Greenspan took over? Mr. WESSEL: Mr. Greenspan was not seen as nearly as capable as Mr. Volcker when he was appointed. The stock market crashed two months after Mr. Greenspan took over. He and his colleagues at the Fed did a great job of managing it, and we came through it without much economic pain. That established Mr. Greenspan's credibility. Now, I doubt that Mr. Bernanke is praying for a stock market crash in his first couple of months, but he will surely be tested in some crisis. And if he does well, his credibility will go up.

And Tess, first let's review how the labor department gathers these statistics each month, and how do they do that? Ms. TESS VIGELAND (Host, Marketplace): Well, the labor department conducts two separate surveys to come up with these statistics. For the unemployment figure, they poll 60,000 households. They just call them up and ask, is there anyone in the house who is looking for work?  The other figure is the number of new jobs that companies create within a month, and this is the one that economists really pay the most attention to. They tally up all the people on company payrolls across the country, everybody except farms, and they figure out if there are more or fewer jobs than the month before. BRAND: And so, where does the math allegedly go wrong? Ms. VIGELAND: Well, the issue here, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, is the people who choose not to participate in the phone survey. John Schmitt is the lead author of this report. Mr. JOHN SCHMITT (Economist, Center for Economic and Policy Research): The people who are not participating are just proportionally not likely to be employed, and we're not capturing that in the survey, and that's creating some distortion in the numbers that are coming out of this very good, very well done survey that we rely on to get the data and to understand the economy of the world that we live in. Ms. VIGELAND: And now, because of that, the center says that the deposit is undercounting the number of people who are unemployed by about three million. Again, this is because people are not picking up the phone or they're deciding not to answer these survey questions. Assuming that that is the case, the three million people, the current unemployment rate would actually be 6. 4 percent instead of 4. 9 percent, and that is a pretty big difference.

Mr. JOEL NAROFF (Chief Economist, Commerce Bank): Well, we understand that the unemployment rate is not a perfect number.

Americans faced with higher heating bills have gotten a big break this winter from the weather. The cost of staying warm is still high, but the Energy Department says things would have been a lot worse if the weather wasn't so unusually warm. Bob Moon is joining us from the Marketplace News Bureau in New York. And Bob, what's the latest word on how much it's costing people to heat their homes this winter? Mr. BOB MOON (New York Bureau Chief, Marketplace): This is one of those times it's good news and bad news all in the same number. The Energy Department now figures that on average heating bills will total 17 percent more this winter than last winter. That is a big jump, the biggest increase in three years in fact, but it's only a little more than half of what the government was forecasting back when the six-month-long heating season began in October. As recently as a month ago the energy department was warning of a 25 percent jump in heating bills. So 17 percent is a considerable improvement over that. The Energy Information Administration attributes that to temperatures that were 27 percent warmer than normal last month. This by the way is not only good news on the energy front, but it's good news for the overall economy because it means that we should be able to spend more on other things than heating our homes. BRAND: Well, I imagine things could turn poorly if the weather gets colder. Mr. MOON: Yeah, dare we out of the most overused cliche in reporting, only time will tell; but that really is true. Colder weather is really setting in here in the northeast right now. A lot of New Yorkers in fact have been walking around with light jackets on and they've been enjoying the mild weather with really a sense of wonder until just a few days ago when it started to really chill off again. There is some reason to worry about what's ahead. Let me read you this line from the government report we've been talking about. It says, should colder than normal weather occur for the remainder of the heating season, expenditures could be significantly higher than currently projected; but for now at least the outlook is better than it had been. BRAND: Well, Bob, I'm wondering if this is having any affect on the overall price of oil and gasoline, for example. Mr. MOON: Yeah, oil prices did drop by $2 a barrel after this report came out. And today there's another government report out that's likely to have even more of an affect. This report shows crude oil inventories are well above average for this time of year; so where's the shortage? Even better news, gasoline inventories are up twice as much as expected to 4. 3 million barrels. Speculators have been anticipating this news; crude oil prices have fallen more than five percent this week.

BRAND: Well, I imagine things could turn poorly if the weather gets colder.  Mr. MOON: Yeah, dare we out of the most overused cliche in reporting, only time will tell; but that really is true. Colder weather is really setting in here in the northeast right now. A lot of New Yorkers in fact have been walking around with light jackets on and they've been enjoying the mild weather with really a sense of wonder until just a few days ago when it started to really chill off again. There is some reason to worry about what's ahead. Let me read you this line from the government report we've been talking about. It says, should colder than normal weather occur for the remainder of the heating season, expenditures could be significantly higher than currently projected; but for now at least the outlook is better than it had been.  BRAND: Well, Bob, I'm wondering if this is having any affect on the overall price of oil and gasoline, for example.  Mr. MOON: Yeah, oil prices did drop by $2 a barrel after this report came out. And today there's another government report out that's likely to have even more of an affect. This report shows crude oil inventories are well above average for this time of year; so where's the shortage? Even better news, gasoline inventories are up twice as much as expected to 4. 3 million barrels. Speculators have been anticipating this news; crude oil prices have fallen more than five percent this week.  And today in the Marketplace newsroom we're looking into a new mission for the army, protecting the environment.  BRAND: Bob Moon of Public Radio's daily business show Marketplace.

SCOTT HORSLEY reporting: It might not feel like it, if you spent your weekend shoveling snow, but this has been an unusually mild winter so far. November and December were both warmer than average, and last month was the warmest January on record. That's helped cut the price of natural gas in half since mid-December. Economist Neil Gamson, of the Energy Department, predicts this winter's heating bills will still be higher than last year's, but only about $180. 00 higher, not two or three times that, as had been forecast last fall. Mr. NEIL GAMSON (Department of Energy): We sort of dodged a big one. The fact that the winter has turned out warmer than normal meant that expenditures are not going to be as high as we had earlier thought. HORSLEY: Natural gas is used to heat more than half the homes in America, and the price skyrocketed after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ripped through the Gulf of Mexico, where 20 percent of the nation's natural gas is produced. So6me of those drilling rigs are still out of service, but thanks to the mild winter, customers haven't needed as much gas to heat their houses. And even if the rest of the winter brings cooler temperatures, there should be enough natural gas left in storage to avoid another price spike. Rollercoaster prices can make it hard for consumers to know whether to lock in a price with a long-term contract. Janine Migden-Ostrander is Consumers Council in Ohio, where natural gas customers are now allowed to shop around. Ms. JANINE MIGDEN-OSTRANDER (Ohio Consumers Council): It's possible that prices may drop on the spot market for a few months, but then they could pick back up and be higher. I think, overall, that you're going to see that, while prices might drop some, higher prices are here to stay in Ohio.

His testimony comes at a time when many Fed followers have been looking for signs the Fed will end its 19-month battle against inflation. So far this morning, Bernanke his told lawmakers that recent expansion in the economy has quote, \"A lot of staying power. \" And he left open the possibility that interest rates would go up. David Wessel is Deputy Washington Bureau Chief of the Wall Street Journal, where he spent years reading between the lines of Alan Greenspan's pronouncements. He joined us to talk about what this appearance means for Mr. Bernanke. Good Morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, Wall Street Journal): Good morning. MONTAGNE: David, it has been almost two decades since the new Fed Chairman made his first appearance before a Congressional committee. That's a long time. Looking back, what are the big risks one would be taking? Mr. WESSEL: Mr. Greenspan had a lot of practice at saying what he meant, and rarely saying more than he meant to say. He, once in a while, he would say something and the markets would move, that he didn't intend. But that's a practiced skill. Mr. Bernanke's risk is that he will say something that he thinks is completely innocuous, that's just like reading from an economics textbook, and he'll discover that on the markets, people will think, oh, he meant he's going to raise interest rates more, he's going to raise interest rates less. So, his big risk is, he says something that isn't meant to send a signal, but the markets will hear it as a signal. He will use some adverb that he thinks is just a rhetorical flourish, and they will take it as a sign of something significant. MONTAGNE: Well the Fed, of course, influences the economy by moving interest rates. What, in the end, does it matter what adverb, verb, adjective, that the Fed Chair uses in testimony? Mr. WESSEL: Because the markets know that he's not going to raise interest rates this week. What they're wondering about is what's going to happen at the end of March, and what's going to happen in June, and what's going to happen in December. So, they will take these little clues as a way to change their expectations about what is the likely course of interest rates in the weeks and months ahead. MONTAGNE: And, do you, would you know what's going on through the minds of members of Congress as they listen to the Fed Chair talk about the economy? Mr. WESSEL: Well, that's a great question. Just once, I wish that they'd let the reporters ask the questions, instead of the members of Congress. Many members of the House or Senate banking committees, which conduct these hearings, are more interested in hearing themselves speak than ever getting an answer. Some of them read questions, and when the witness doesn't answer them, they don't have a clue how to ask a follow-up question. But there are always a few people who are very incisive in their questions, who challenge the Fed Chairman, who press him to take positions on things that he'd rather not talk about, or confront him with contradictions about things that he or his colleagues have said in the past. And it's at those moments that the hearings can get really interesting, and we can actually learn something about what's going on at the Fed. MONTAGNE: Do you have an example? Obviously, it would be under Alan Greenspan that you would have heard something like this, but anything that comes to mind? Mr. WESSEL: Well, Barney Frank, who's the congressman from Massachusetts, a very fast-speaking, very sharp guy. . . MONTAGNE: Liberal Democrat. Mr. WESSEL: . . . liberal Democrat, pressed Alan Greenspan a number of times on concerns about the widening inequality, the gap between rich and poor in the United States. And I always find it interesting that Mr. Greenspan, despite his conservative, almost libertarian tendencies, would talk about why he worried about that gap between rich and poor.

S. economy or actually whether we should be worried at all. Even by conservative estimates, U. S. economy created two million more jobs last year than it lost. That statistic might surprise a lot of Americans nervous about the employment picture. NPR's Mike Pesca has this report on why our perception of the economy often doesn't square with the actual numbers. MIKE PESCA reporting: Maybe you remember the Christmas before last, seeing all those stories about how rich Europeans were taking advantage of the weak American dollar by flying to New York on weekend buying jags? Rich Europeans, weak American dollar. Implication? How dare they? But even if you missed that one, you certainly heard all the talk about jobs and job loss. There's the pre-Copernican theory of the world being flat, and statements like this one are still reverberating. Senator JOHN KERRY (Democrat, Massachusetts): President Bush is now certain to be the first President since Herbert Hoover in the Great Depression who didn't create a single new job. PESCA: John Kerry would have been right, if he'd won. But since 2005, the economy has added at least two million jobs. The dollar has strengthened. Even oil, yes, oil has gotten a little cheaper lately. But more importantly, oil prices haven't affected the over all economy in a way that shocks most economists. Things are looking up, or not. And maybe not for a good reason, says Charles Wheeler, an economist at the University of Chicago. Mr. CHARLES WHEELER (Economist, University of Chicago): In aggregate, the numbers are actually quite respectable. But the fact is that it's not good for everybody. And there's certainly a lot of uncertainty, both among folks who don't have jobs, but also those who feel that they're at risk. And I think that's why you see this seeming divide between good news in the aggregate, and a lot of folks saying things just don't feel that great. PESCA: Arnold Kling, formerly an economist with the Fed and later Freddie Mac, and author of Learning Economics, cites studies which show that the public tends to be more pessimistic than do economists. Mr. ARNOLD KLING (Author, Learning Economics): One of the ways in which laymen are different is that they have what's called Make Work Bias. They fear that jobs will disappear. Economists believe that jobs can be created by the market, but typical lay people are much more worried about losing jobs. PESCA: Princeton economist Alan Blinder, who was Vice Fed Chairman under President Clinton, says the statistics about the average worker don't comfort the below average worker or the non-worker. He says the fretful worker has a lot of justification in his uncertainty. Although Blinder also concedes maybe the average American is just plain wrong, just like they were in 1992. Mr. ALAN BLINDER (Economist, Princeton University): The elder President Bush, when he ran for re-election in 1992, faced an electorate that thought the economy was horrible. But the truth is that the economy of 1992 was growing pretty strongly. But most Americans thought we were still in a recession and they felt bad about it. PESCA: And Blinder says the media have not been helpful in clarifying today's jobs picture. Mr. BLINDER: It makes a much better story to write about job loss and hardship than it does about job gains and normality, normalcy. Normalcy is boring. PESCA: What makes a really boring story just may be the most important statistic in all of economics, at least according to Alan Blinder, Arnold Kling, and here Charles Wheeler. Mr. WHEELER: In 2010 you took somebody out of a box and they wanted to know how the economy had done, and they were only allowed one figure. Productivity growth would be the one that they would look at. PESCA: And productivity growth has been phenomenal for years. It's the engine of capitalism. It means the same amount of work yields better and better results, even if it yields worst headlines than plant closings and call centers in India. If you want something to cheer, it's productivity, although last quarter productivity was down for the first time in five years. The new Fed Chairman predicted a turnaround. In a couple months, we'll know if there's really something to worry about. Which is to say, if for a change, our worries and our statistics sync up. Mike Pesca, NPR News, New York.

I'm Ed Gordon. Wal-Mart CEO, Lee Scott made news yesterday at the National Governors Association winter meeting. He previewed a series of new healthcare initiatives that will expand coverage to more of its 1. 3 million employees. The move comes in response to growing criticism of the world's largest retailer. Less than half of Wal-Mart's employees are currently covered by the company's healthcare plan, and five percent of its workers depend on Medicaid. More than 20 states are working on bills that would force large employers like Wal-Mart to put profits back into employee health benefits. Maryland's legislature recently passed the first such bill, but not without starting an unprecedented legal battle that could last for years. From member station WAMU in Washington, D. C. , Sarah Hughes reports. SARAH HUGHES (Reporter, WAMU): About 17,000 people work at Wal-Mart stores in Maryland, including 49-year old Cynthia Murray. For about the past five years, she has worked in the fitting room at a Wal-Mart in the suburbs. Ms. CYNTHIA MURRAY (Wal-Mart Employee): I really like my job. I like to help people who come in and want to try different clothes on. They may ask my opinion, or they may need something else besides what they're trying on. HUGHES: But Murray says she doesn't like her healthcare options. When she looked into the health plans provided by Wal-Mart a few months ago, she couldn't find one she could afford. She took into account the cost of the monthly payment and the deductible and her salary of about $9. 50 an hour. Ms. MURRAY: I didn't think it was feasible for me, for my budget that I live on. And I mean, I don't have a high budget here. I'm just a normal person paying rent, gas, electric, you know what I mean. HUGHES: Murray decided to go without insurance. Many lawmakers in Maryland say it's the responsibility of big companies like Wal-Mart to help workers like Murray get out of the tight spot. Senator Brian Frosh. Senator BRIAN FROSH (Democrat, Maryland): I don't think it's asking too much for one of the largest corporations not just in the United States, but in the world, to help shoulder some of the burden of their employee's health and welfare. HUGHES: Maryland lawmakers in January approved the bill requiring private companies with more than 10,000 employees in the state to spend at least eight percent of their payroll on health insurance, or pay into the state's health program for the poor. The law is scheduled to go into effect next year. Wal-Mart is calling the law bad policy. A company spokesperson declined an interview, but a statement voiced by Sarah Clark and posted on the company's website contends that the bill will not solve Maryland's uninsured problem. Ms. SARAH CLARK (Spokesperson, Wal-Mart): There are 786,000 uninsured people in the state of Maryland, and less than one half of one percent work for Wal-Mart. HUGHES: Wal-Mart also says it's generally doing more to help workers access health insurance across the country. In an email, company spokesperson Dan Fogelman wrote that Wal-Mart will make a health plan with a lower premium of $11. 00 a month available to more of its workers, and he wrote that Wal-Mart recently enrolled 70,000 of its workers in a health plan, and that about 80 percent of those surveyed said they were previously uninsured. Wal-Mart is not challenging the Maryland law, but a trade group that represents Wal-Mart and other large retail companies is. Mr. PAUL KELLY (Spokesperson, Retail Industry Leaders Association): We see the Maryland law as a threat to our industry and to the potential growth of other retail and other businesses in that state. HUGHES: Paul Kelly is the spokesperson for the Retail Industry Leaders Association or RILA. It filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Baltimore earlier this month. Kelly says the law lets states micromanage large companies. He says state government isn't in the best position to decide how to manage company health plans, the company is. Mr. KELLY: Retailers and other businesses need the flexibility to design a benefits package in a way that meets the unique aspects of their workforce. The retail workforce is unique. It is younger than most other industry workforces. There is more turnover. And in addition, there are more part-time workers. So we have to have the flexibility to develop a package that meets those needs. HUGHES: In its lawsuit, RILA is arguing that the Maryland bill does not apply to Wal-Mart and other large employers because it's preempted by a federal law on health plans. Supporters of the Maryland bill say they're not worried about the lawsuit. Naomi Walker is with the AFL-CIO, which helped craft and abdicate for the Maryland bill. Ms. NAOMI WALKER (AFL-CIO): We had several prominent lawyers in the field take a look at the Maryland bill and they think it's fine and doesn't violate the federal law on this issue. HUGHES: Walker says the Union is using the Maryland law as blueprint for other similar proposals around the country. Ms. WALKER: We see the Maryland bill as a model for our work in other states. We've taken the Maryland bill, turned it into a model piece of legislation, gotten it around to state legislators and activists all around the country; and so far it's been introduced in 24 states. HUGHES: Groups representing large retail companies like RILA say they are also organizing and will fight the proposals. For NPR, I'm Sarah Hughes.

For about the past five years, she has worked in the fitting room at a Wal-Mart in the suburbs.  Ms. CYNTHIA MURRAY (Wal-Mart Employee): I really like my job. I like to help people who come in and want to try different clothes on. They may ask my opinion, or they may need something else besides what they're trying on.  HUGHES: But Murray says she doesn't like her healthcare options. When she looked into the health plans provided by Wal-Mart a few months ago, she couldn't find one she could afford. She took into account the cost of the monthly payment and the deductible and her salary of about $9. 50 an hour.  Ms. MURRAY: I didn't think it was feasible for me, for my budget that I live on. And I mean, I don't have a high budget here. I'm just a normal person paying rent, gas, electric, you know what I mean.  HUGHES: Murray decided to go without insurance. Many lawmakers in Maryland say it's the responsibility of big companies like Wal-Mart to help workers like Murray get out of the tight spot. Senator Brian Frosh.  Senator BRIAN FROSH (Democrat, Maryland): I don't think it's asking too much for one of the largest corporations not just in the United States, but in the world, to help shoulder some of the burden of their employee's health and welfare.  HUGHES: Maryland lawmakers in January approved the bill requiring private companies with more than 10,000 employees in the state to spend at least eight percent of their payroll on health insurance, or pay into the state's health program for the poor. The law is scheduled to go into effect next year.  Wal-Mart is calling the law bad policy. A company spokesperson declined an interview, but a statement voiced by Sarah Clark and posted on the company's website contends that the bill will not solve Maryland's uninsured problem.  Ms. SARAH CLARK (Spokesperson, Wal-Mart): There are 786,000 uninsured people in the state of Maryland, and less than one half of one percent work for Wal-Mart.  HUGHES: Wal-Mart also says it's generally doing more to help workers access health insurance across the country. In an email, company spokesperson Dan Fogelman wrote that Wal-Mart will make a health plan with a lower premium of $11. 00 a month available to more of its workers, and he wrote that Wal-Mart recently enrolled 70,000 of its workers in a health plan, and that about 80 percent of those surveyed said they were previously uninsured.  Wal-Mart is not challenging the Maryland law, but a trade group that represents Wal-Mart and other large retail companies is.  Mr. PAUL KELLY (Spokesperson, Retail Industry Leaders Association): We see the Maryland law as a threat to our industry and to the potential growth of other retail and other businesses in that state.  HUGHES: Paul Kelly is the spokesperson for the Retail Industry Leaders Association or RILA. It filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Baltimore earlier this month. Kelly says the law lets states micromanage large companies. He says state government isn't in the best position to decide how to manage company health plans, the company is.  Mr. KELLY: Retailers and other businesses need the flexibility to design a benefits package in a way that meets the unique aspects of their workforce. The retail workforce is unique. It is younger than most other industry workforces. There is more turnover. And in addition, there are more part-time workers. So we have to have the flexibility to develop a package that meets those needs.  HUGHES: In its lawsuit, RILA is arguing that the Maryland bill does not apply to Wal-Mart and other large employers because it's preempted by a federal law on health plans. Supporters of the Maryland bill say they're not worried about the lawsuit.  Naomi Walker is with the AFL-CIO, which helped craft and abdicate for the Maryland bill.  Ms. NAOMI WALKER (AFL-CIO): We had several prominent lawyers in the field take a look at the Maryland bill and they think it's fine and doesn't violate the federal law on this issue.  HUGHES: Walker says the Union is using the Maryland law as blueprint for other similar proposals around the country.  Ms. WALKER: We see the Maryland bill as a model for our work in other states. We've taken the Maryland bill, turned it into a model piece of legislation, gotten it around to state legislators and activists all around the country; and so far it's been introduced in 24 states.  HUGHES: Groups representing large retail companies like RILA say they are also organizing and will fight the proposals.  For NPR, I'm Sarah Hughes.

Mr. Kelly, thanks for joining us. What do you tell people who say government has to step in, that ultimately, the Wal-Mart business model is not good for American workers? Mr. PAUL KELLY (Senior Vice President of Federal and State Government Affairs, Retail Industry Leaders Association): Thank you, Mr. Gordon, for the opportunity. Our position on this is that the federal government has been very clear in passing a law that says multiple state employers like those RILA represents, that their health plans are governed by federal law, not state law. That's why we've stepped in to challenge the Maryland law, because it clearly violates the federal statute. GORDON: And what of those who say, for instance, Wal-Mart makes it known by its commercials and the like that they put their employees first. But there will be those who will say that they are putting profit before employees? Mr. KELLY: Well, our association represents many companies, large employers, large retailers. They work very hard to provide benefits packages that meet the unique needs of their work force. They are in competition with other businesses for good workers. So they want to provide good benefits, good health benefits, good wages. They do the best they can in a competitive environment. But the real reason we've brought these lawsuits is because we think the Maryland law and those like it which are being proposed around the country really miss the point. The point should not be to force businesses to pay more for health care. We want lawmakers and politicians to focus on bringing down healthcare costs so everyone can afford it, the companies I represent, people who want to go into the individual market and buy their own policy, and even state governments. GORDON: And what of those who are very concerned, quite frankly, that this will become a trend not only of large retailers, but it will become a watershed that other companies will use to move in this direction? Mr. KELLY: Well, I would just say that companies continue to work very hard to provide good benefits to their employees. We're concerned, frankly, about a precedent in the other direction where states might start to think this is a good idea. It really represents a failure on the part of politicians, in our opinion, to address the real problems, the real challenges in healthcare. Simply forcing a sector of the economy to pay a specific amount of really expensive healthcare doesn't make any sense. Let's address the root causes, which is healthcare costs are too high; we need to figure out a way to bring them down so my members can afford to provide better benefits, and state governments can afford to provide better benefits, as well. GORDON: All right. Paul Kelly is senior vice president of federal and state government affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. I thank you very much for joining us. I appreciate it. Mr. KELLY: I appreciate the opportunity. GORDON: I'm joined now by William Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University. All right, Professor Rodgers, you heard the piece that we just aired and heard from Paul Kelly. Is there some middle ground, in your opinion, that can be found? Professor WILLIAM RODGERS (Public Policy, Rutgers University): I hope so, and this is a, it's an issue that I agree with your previous guest that, you know, the government, really, at the end, shouldn't be involved, that this is a, should be a relationship between the Wal-Mart workers and the communities in which the stores are located and management. However, it was grown to the, the problem has escalated to the situation where these people in these communities don't have a collective voice to be able to push back and to express their concerns. GORDON: In your opinion, how do you find that happy medium? The idea that no one, I think, wants government intervention, necessarily, but some will suggest that corporate America, big business has really, as I suggested earlier, put profit before the human being, and there is a concern that who will watchdog that? Prof. RODGERS: Yeah, I think instead of also focusing on what you call the bad actors(ph). I mean there are some good actors out there. One example that gets trumpeted a great deal is Costco. They run an excellent model where they have input from collective bargaining process, but they also have a unique corporate philosophy where they have a long-run model. It's based upon treating workers as assets to be invested in, and one of their statements is that they feel there's a, if you loyal and well-compensated workforce, that means that you'll, people will be efficient, but they'll also be productive, and their strategy does seem to be working, where they're offering wages and benefits that are above the, sort of, industry average, and you're seeing less shrinkage, which is the industry phrase for less stealing, much lower than what Cos. . . --much lower than what the industry, and it's also much lower than what Wal-Mart reports. GORDON: Well, prognosticate for me, if you will. If you had to juxtapose the Costco model to the Wal-Mart model and project that across America, which do you think we're headed? Which way do you think we're headed? Prof. RODGERS: Mm hmm. I think we're headed towards the Costco model for the very reason in that this is an issue, healthcare is an issue that is near and dear to the hearts of most Americans. And then also, you've also brought in the issue around children, that children of these parents and family members who don't have healthcare. And again, there's been ample studies to show how, you know, investing in people's healthcare not only improves their productivity, but their well-being. And if we just take a longer-term view, which I think--these views are galvanizing around that, we'll move in the direction of the more Costco model, which is the one that's more sustainable in the long run. GORDON: All right. William Rodgers is a professor of public policy at Rudgers University. We thank you very much for joining us. Appreciate it. Prof. RODGERS: Thank you.

The commerce department announced this morning that sales of new homes fell five percent in January. That's bigger than expected. It's also the second time in three months that sales have dropped, with higher interest rates making it harder for people to afford to buy a house. The question now is whether that will affect the broader economy. And we're going to explore that with David Wessel, whose is deputy Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, and a regular guest here. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: Let's start with a basic question. First, how much of the average American's wealth is tied up in their home? Mr. WESSEL: A huge amount. I mean, nearly 70 percent of all Americans own their own house today, and it's typically their very largest asset. And when the Federal Reserve did its latest calculations, they say that the net worth of the average homeowner is $185,000, but the net worth of the average renter is only $4,000. INSKEEP: Wow. So, a huge amount of net worth in the house, there. And we should mention that, in recent years, a lot of those Americans have been feeling rather wealthy, haven't they, because home prices have gone up and up and up. Mr. WESSEL: Right. It's not only feeling wealthy, they have been wealthy. One of the changes in the economy in the last decade is it's very easy to take out your home equity and spend it without selling your house. In the old days, you had to sell your house, and then you had the cash, and you could use that to buy a retirement village, or a car, or a vacation. But now you can pull it out in the form of a home equity loan, and that was really one of the most important drivers of consumer spending over the last decade. When wages at the middle didn't go up very fast, people were able to keep spending, because they could essentially pull home equity out of their houses. INSKEEP: Well, what happens now if prices stop going up, or start going down? Mr. WESSEL: Well, that's a good question, and it's one that when Ben Bernanke, the new Fed chairman, testified on Capitol Hill, and he listed the things that worried him, that was one of his big worries, that the housing market would slow. Now, the effect really depends, first, on how much it slows. Obviously, a flattening is one thing, a crash is another. A crash seems unlikely. But there's a really interesting debate among thoughtful economists about how bad this is. One group, there happened to be some people at Goldman Sachs, say that if housing prices just flatten, that would mean a big downward pressure on consumer spending, and it will hurt. Other economists, there's a group at JP Morgan, say that, actually, it's okay if housing slows, because consumer spending will keep going as long as wages climb, interest rates don't get too high, the stock market goes on. They say that this really isn't so important. And that's really one of the big questions about the economy this year, is how much will a slow down in housing hurt consumer spending? INSKEEP: Okay. Let's go a little deeper in the dismal science here. How does anybody figure out, or at least make a reasonable prediction of whether a change in housing prices would affect consumer spending? Mr. WESSEL: It seems to me from the recent evidence that housing equity has been a huge driver of consumer spending, and there's every reason to believe if housing prices level off, that Americans will spend a little less. The question really is how much is a little less? INSKEEP: Is this a good point to ask, if in the end, it's really all about faith, or about salesmanship. Mr. WESSEL: What's hard to figure out in the housing market is how much is reasonable supply and demand, people making sound investments, and how much is the kind of speculative bubble where people are buying houses in the anticipation that it will be worth a lot more a year from now, and they can sell it? But it's very hard to determine how much of what's gone on recently, and how much is going on now is that sort of gambling aspect, and how much is simply the desire of Americans to have bigger and better homes, which seems to be very strong? INSKEEP: David Wessel of the Wall Street Journal. Thanks very much. Mr. WESSEL: Thank you.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Here's another sign that the housing market may be softening.

NBC launched Deal or No Deal in earnest this week. Versions of the game have run in some 40 countries. In the U. S. it features models holding numbered briefcases. The host is actor Howie Mandel. (Soundbite of show 'Deal or No Deal') Mr. HOWIE MANDEL (Actor): Okay, there are 26 cases held by 26 lovely ladies. Hello, ladies. WOMEN: Hi, Howie. BLOCK: The cases all contain money, from one penny up to a million dollars or more. There are no trivia questions, no bugs to eat, just contestants taking calculated risks. And that's why the game has drawn the interest of some economists. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports. DAVID KESTENBAUM reporting: Deal or No Deal may seem made for America, but it was born far away in the Netherlands. Dr. THEIRRY POST (Economist, Erasmus University) The show is called (speaks foreign language) and if you translate it literally it means The Chase for the Millions. KESTENBAUM: That is Theirry Post. He is an economist at Erasmus University in the Netherlands. He studies how people decide what risks they are prepared to take. A typical experiment, he and his colleagues brought students into the lab and had them assess different financial risks. But there really wasn't much at stake. The researchers couldn't afford an award of more than, say, $10. 00. Then one day, one of his colleagues saw the game show on TV and said, hey, you should study this. Dr. POST: The nice thing about this show is that there are really large amounts of money at stake. You can really go home a millionaire or empty handed, of course. (Soundbite of music) KESTENBAUM: The reward in the U. S. game is at least a million dollars. There's one contestant. The show kicked off this week with a police officer Peter Montesanti, in a crisp, blue shirt. Mr. PETER MONTESANTI (Contestant): I am sweating right now. This is making me more nervous than breaking down and door and going to catch bad guys. KESTENBAUM: The game goes like this. Montasanti picks a single briefcase to hold on to. As the game proceeds, more and more of the cases are open, and he gets a better idea of how much money he might have in his briefcase. At the end of each round, a shadowy figure known as The Banker calls saying something like, quit now and I'll offer you $200,000, deal or no deal? The contestant can take a sure thing and go home or keep playing, gambling that his briefcase contains more than the bank's offer. The audience, and Monsante's wife in this case, join in. (Soundbite of show Deal or No Deal) Mr. MANDEL: Deal or no deal? Mr. MONTASANTI: No deal. Unidentified Woman: Baby, what are you doing? KESTENBAUM: This is the kind of emotion the economists never got in the lab. Thierry Post and his colleagues watched every edition of the show they could get their hands on, versions from Hungary, India, Turkey. They found a pattern they did not expect. When the game starts out well for the contestant and the bank keeps offering more and more money, the players typically are cautious and make a deal early. But if the numbers go against them, contestants throw caution the wind. Thierry Post says doing poorly makes them want to take more risks. Dr. POST: That's the basic message. KESTENBAUM: Why do you think that is? Dr. POST: Well, it may be for a very simple reason, but this reason is not reflected in the textbook theories. They are just willing to put more money at stake, to escape from this uneasy feeling of being a loser. KESTENBAUM: Economists have seen hints of this behavior in other places. Post says one study shows that financial traders who lose money before lunch take more risks in the afternoon. The game show is just a particularly clear example. People, he says, are not simple, calculating machines. So what about Peter Montasanti, the police officer who played this week? He did well early on. In the ninth round he had the option to go home with $359,000 or continue with a one-third chance of basically losing it all. Mr. MANDEL: Deal or no deal? Mr. MONSTASANTI: Will this change our lives? Absolutely. Am I greedy? A couple of minutes I was. Am I now? Heck no. (Soundbite of crowd cheering) KESTENBAUM: That's the choice Post and his colleagues would have predicted, and it's a good choice, it turns out. Montasanti's briefcase only contained $25. David Kestenbaum, NPR News. BLOCK: You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  It's been called brilliantly simple and the dumbest game show ever. NBC launched Deal or No Deal in earnest this week. Versions of the game have run in some 40 countries. In the U. S. it features models holding numbered briefcases. The host is actor Howie Mandel.  (Soundbite of show 'Deal or No Deal')  Mr. HOWIE MANDEL (Actor): Okay, there are 26 cases held by 26 lovely ladies. Hello, ladies.  WOMEN: Hi, Howie.  BLOCK: The cases all contain money, from one penny up to a million dollars or more. There are no trivia questions, no bugs to eat, just contestants taking calculated risks. And that's why the game has drawn the interest of some economists. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports.  DAVID KESTENBAUM reporting:  Deal or No Deal may seem made for America, but it was born far away in the Netherlands.  Dr. THEIRRY POST (Economist, Erasmus University) The show is called (speaks foreign language) and if you translate it literally it means The Chase for the Millions.  KESTENBAUM: That is Theirry Post. He is an economist at Erasmus University in the Netherlands. He studies how people decide what risks they are prepared to take. A typical experiment, he and his colleagues brought students into the lab and had them assess different financial risks. But there really wasn't much at stake. The researchers couldn't afford an award of more than, say, $10. 00.  Then one day, one of his colleagues saw the game show on TV and said, hey, you should study this.  Dr. POST: The nice thing about this show is that there are really large amounts of money at stake. You can really go home a millionaire or empty handed, of course.  (Soundbite of music)  KESTENBAUM: The reward in the U. S. game is at least a million dollars. There's one contestant. The show kicked off this week with a police officer Peter Montesanti, in a crisp, blue shirt.  Mr. PETER MONTESANTI (Contestant): I am sweating right now. This is making me more nervous than breaking down and door and going to catch bad guys.  KESTENBAUM: The game goes like this. Montasanti picks a single briefcase to hold on to. As the game proceeds, more and more of the cases are open, and he gets a better idea of how much money he might have in his briefcase. At the end of each round, a shadowy figure known as The Banker calls saying something like, quit now and I'll offer you $200,000, deal or no deal?  The contestant can take a sure thing and go home or keep playing, gambling that his briefcase contains more than the bank's offer. The audience, and Monsante's wife in this case, join in.

In Vienna today, the Iranian government said it would cause harm and pain to the United States if it brings Iran before the U. N. Security Council and imposes sanctions on its nuclear program. The statement was made at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency. One government official left open the possibility today that his country might consider cutting back production in retaliation against the United States. MARKETPLACE New York Bureau Chief Bob Moon joins us now. Bob, how serious is this bluster? How serious is Iran sounding about cutting back oil production? BOB MOON reporting: Well, that's indeed the question, here. Is it bluster, or is it more? When you've got the Deputy Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council talking about his country being capable of inflicting harm and pain on the U. S. , the rhetoric is, at least, hotter than ever on the political side. This warning came today at this meeting of the International Atomic Energy Association that's trying to figure out what to do about Iran's refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment program. The U. S. and European allies are stepping up the pressure on the other side of the stand off. They say Iran's inflexibility leaves the world no choice but to ask for action from the United Nations Security Council. And Iran is firing back with its own strong words. Quoting here again, \"If that's the path the U. S. wishes to choose, let the ball roll. \" Now, of course, this all comes against the backdrop of a world that has very little wiggle room when it comes to pumping oil as fast anybody can, really. And there's Reuters dispatch from Vienna today that makes this point: it says, \"Oil consumers have not felt this vulnerable for decades. \" ADAMS: Well, the market watchers surely heard about all this. Did the oil prices go up? MOON: Well, they actually did dip a little bit--in part, thanks to another meeting that was going on in Vienna at the same time that that tough talk was coming from across town. OPEC officials met in Vienna today, and they pledged to keep output close to the limit to bring prices within what they view as a more comfortable range. Interestingly enough--or maybe just confusingly enough--Iran's oil minister was striking a softer tone at that meeting. Now he said, \"We have no intention of reducing any of our exports. \" So, this was the same time that Iranian defense official was saying the country would have to review its oil policies if world pressure grows. And the reassurances from OPEC may have balanced all that out. ADAMS: So you think OPEC, this promise by OPEC is enough to stabilize prices? MOON: Well, there was a bit of good news from the Energy Department today. It says crude oil inventories here in the U. S. have climbed beyond expectations to their highest level in seven years. So, that should help. On the other hand, here's the latest assessment from Reuters: \"World oil prices are at their highest level in real terms in 25 years. \" Today in the MARKETPLACE newsroom, we're watching a new stock on the New York stock exchange.

America's trade deficit has hit another record high. It's even worse than many analysts had expected. The latest figures from the Commerce Department show the deficit was up by more than 5 percent in January, to an all-time high of more than $68 billion. Bob Moon joins us from the MARKETPLACE News Bureau in New York to talk about what this means. How bad does this represent things for the U. S. 's overall economy? BOB MOON reporting: Well, it's a troubling indicator of some possible turbulence ahead, you might say. As you mentioned, this trade gap is a lot wider than many experts were anticipating, and some economists are already saying today that it might cause them to rethink their estimates of the country's economic growth in the first quarter of the year, and to have to adjust them downward, although it's still a bitter way to know just how much of an overall effect that this is going to have. There is something of a silver lining to this gray cloud today. There were, at the same time, record exports. Those were fueled by stronger foreign demand, and that robust growth is at least one way of hope that the country's gross domestic product is going to be on track for the kind of performance that many economists have been predicting. Still, this is the biggest trade deficit ever for the country, and that's something that, unquestionably, puts a big drag on the overall economy. ADAMS: Yeah, bad news for economy. Does that carry any political fall-out, do you think? MOON: Yeah, move aside the economic analysts, and bring in the political analysts, because they see this as yet another problem for the Bush administration's trade policies. We've been hearing this throughout the Bush years, and, frankly, back to the Clinton administration, that there has been a problem that's been created by the pursuit of global free trade agreements. It's put American workers at a disadvantage, according to these critics, and brought on unfair competition from low-wage countries, and that's, they say, what fuels this trade gap. Almost three million manufacturing jobs have been lost here in the U. S. in recent years, and, by the way, there is more bad news on the jobs front today. A higher than expected number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits just today. Those claims were up to 303,000 in the past week. That's a rise of about 8,000 from the week before, and that's the most since the start of the year. ADAMS: Bob, how big a factor in this story is U. S. trade with China? MOON: It's really quite a big factor. America's deficit with China surged by almost 10 percent in January, to $17. 9 billion. That was largely due to a big jump in imports of cell phones, along with clothing, textiles, and shoes. Today, in the MARKETPLACE newsroom, we'll be following more of the fall-out from this big trade gap. ADAMS: Bob Moon of Public Radio's daily business show, MARKETPLACE.

ADAMS: And I'm Noah Adams. In a few minutes, a gangsta's memoirs turn into a smoking gun. BRAND: But first, what happens when a country throws open its borders to new immigrants? Great Britain, Ireland, and Sweden have been allowing open immigration from new European Union member states that joined in 2004. A report form the European Commission says the three nations have done pretty well despite fears that new immigrants would create big social and economic problems. NPR's Rob Gifford reports from London. ROB GIFFORD reporting: If you've been to London lately and bought a coffee or had a pint in a pub or stayed in a hotel, you might have noticed: there are not many native-born Brits providing those services. In fact, almost none. As a wealthy European nation, Britain has always been a destination for migrants, and residents of the European Union have been able to work legally here, without visas, for several years. But with the accession of the new EU countries in May 2004, the numbers have expanded. Nearly 300,000 people came in the first year. But Julie Smith of Cambridge University's Center for National Affairs says the British economy seem to have absorbed them amazingly well. Ms. JULIE SMITH (Center for National Affairs, Cambridge University): The nay-sayers would say, ah, these figures fundamentally under-represent the actual picture. We've got five times as many migrant workers coming here from Poland than the government suggested, so it's still a disaster. But in practice, what we're seeing is that a relatively small number of people have come to work, and they're doing jobs that actually we couldn't fill before, so they're filling a real gap in the market, and that's actually good for the British economy. GIFFORD: One area where the immigration has been most pronounced has been in the building trade. Those opposed to the implementation of a European constitution in France last year used the Polish plumber as the symbol of the low-wage laborer they feared would sweep in and take French jobs. In Britain it seems the Polish plumbers have been a little more welcome. At a hardware store in London's West Norwood district, 30-year-old Pole Thomas Skripchek(ph) from Krakow is stacking shelves. He has an engineering degree, but he arrived from Poland three years ago to illegally work on construction sites in London. Since the law changed in May 2004, he has registered, and now works legally. Mr. THOMAS SKRIPCHEK (Polish Immigrant): I came here because London now is the country of better opportunities for Polish people, I mean generally for everybody. It's really much easier to get a job than in Poland and the wages are still much better than, the money's much better than in Poland. GIFFORD: There's bee such an influx of Poles working in the building trade in London, that Skripchek's employer has created several job specifically for them to help better serve their Polish customers in the building trade. Some of the British builders who come into the store are philosophical about the influx of much cheaper Eastern-European workers, but some, like contractor Peter Norton, say it's caused a lot of anger in the building trade. Mr. PETER NORTON (Contractor): Working for 50 pound a day, cashing their end, you say, well, they're not going to get, most painters that I employ, because I don't do painting, they're 100 pound a day and pay tax on it. There's a hell of a difference, isn't there. And of course it's obviously doing us out of work. I mean, it must be doing us out of work. It must be, mustn't it. There's so many of them. GIFFORD: Most analysts seem doubtful that the EU report will force other European countries, especially the so-called Big Three, Germany, France and Italy, to change their policy before they're forced to do so in the year 2011, when all borders must be opened. William Barter(ph) is professor of European political economy at the London School of Economics. He says the continental Europeans are in denial, and in the end open labor markets will force huge structural changes on European welfare systems and their economies in general. Mr. WILLIAM BARTER (Professor of European Political Economy, London School of Economics): This is just one more, I think, nail in the coffin of the continental European model of labor markets and also, I think, social support, and you cannot have the kind of welfare state that the French like to run, or for that matter, the Germans, with free mobility of labor in Europe. It's a very powerful catalyst. GORDON: Barter and other say of course the debate about whether to let in Eastern-Europeans is an important one. But with all barriers set to come down within five years, like it or not, the end result is not in question. What will prove a larger problem in the long run, he says, and he compares it to the U. S. relationship with Mexico, is what to do about would-be migrants from Africa. Rob Gifford, NPR News London.  BRAND: This is DAY TO DAY, I'm Madeleine Brand.  ADAMS: And I'm Noah Adams.

His net worth grew from 46. 5 billion to $50 billion, a billion here, a billion there; pretty soon, it adds up, you know. No. 2 on the list is Warren Buffett, the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. That's the company that owns a collection of businesses, including GEICO Insurance, Fruit of the Loom, Dairy Queen, among many others.  All in all, Forbes figures the number of billionaires around the globe grew by about 102 people over the past year, and that means there are now a record 793 billionaires with a combined wealth of $2. 6 trillion. Now, the Top 10 did change a bit. Oracle's Larry Ellison and Wal-Mart chairman Robson Walton are no longer among the elite of the elite. BRAND: And any surprises among those who have fallen off this list? MOON: Well, maybe not a surprise, but Martha Stewart, who had made her debut on the list last year, is now no longer on the list at all. You can apparently blame her conviction for lying about that stock trade. Her net worth fell in the past year from $1 billion to about half that, and since they've been having a bit of a feud over who was to blame for the lackluster ratings of Stewart's version of The Apprentice, we might note here that Donald Trump is still very much on the list. He's worth a cool $2. 6 billion, according to the magazine. BRAND: Well, the stock market hasn't been performing so well recently. Has that affected the rankings this year? MOON: Well, indeed, it has. It has hurt some of the wealthiest shareholders, if you will, with the stock market gaining just about 1 percent over the past year. Take, for example, Robson Walton of the Wal-Mart Empire; he fell all the way from 10th to 19th on the list. A number of other members of the Walton family also slid down the list, and that's no surprise, when you consider the fact that stock in Wal-Mart lost about 10 percent of its value over the past year. Some of the big gainers were in Russia. Russia's stock market jumped 108 percent between February 2005 and February 2006, and that's where a lot of those billionaires were added to the list.  Today in the Marketplace newsroom we're watching a new promise from China to crack down on product piracy.  BRAND: Thank you, Bob Moon of public radio's daily business show, Marketplace, and Marketplace is produced by American Public Media.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  Back now with DAY TO DAY. I'm Madeleine Brand. Forbes Magazine is out once again with its rankings of the world's richest people, and this year's wealthiest person in the world will come as no surprise. It's Microsoft founder Bill Gates. But this time, a lot of other people have joined him on the list of billionaires.

(Soundbite of music) MONTAGNE: The latest consumer inflation figures were released this morning. After a sharp jump in January, inflation increased only a tenth of a percent in February. But with energy and food prices still volatile, and wages growing at their fastest pace in five years, there's also talk that inflation could soon turn into a problem. To find out why, we turn to David Wessel, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for The Wall Street Journal. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal): Good morning. MONTAGNE: So what, David, could cause inflation to take off? Mr. WESSEL: Well, any number of things could go wrong. We could have another spike in energy prices, unemployment rates could fall to the level where workers could finally begin to get some significant raises. There could be strong demand for goods and services that would make it easier for businesses that have been eager to raise prices, but haven't been able to do so, to finally raise prices. If any or all of these things happen, it could push the inflation rate up, and maybe even push it up higher than what the Fed considers price stability. MONTAGNE: And what would determine, though, the point which inflation would become a problem? Mr. WESSEL: Right now, inflation's running at roughly, by the official measure, at 2. 5 percent a year, and that's in the manageable range. What would determine if it got worse would be worker productivity--the amount of output we make for every hour we work on the job--might not rise as much as it has been. That would mean that wage increases would be more likely to translate into price increases. Another thing might be some declines in competition among businesses, perhaps because of trade barriers, perhaps because of mergers, any number of things. And finally, it really matters what people expect in terms of inflation. Price stability can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if everybody believes that prices are going to be stable. MONTAGNE: Do you ever hear from your readers at The Wall Street Journal that the Consumer Price Index, the CPI, doesn't accurately reflect the inflation that they see all around them? Mr. WESSEL: Absolutely. Every time I use the word Consumer Price Index or inflation in the paper, I get emails about that. And some of it is because people don't understand the way the index is constructed. The fact that it's an average, and nobody is average, or the fact that if you're paying college tuition or have high medical bills, you are experiencing a higher rate of inflation than the average in the country. But the other thing, I think, is that people don't do a very good job of balancing out the ups and downs. When the price of something goes up, they say, ah-ha, that's inflation. When they get a deal on something, like a good air fare, because they shopped on the Internet, they don't see that as an offset--they say that's just because I'm a good shopper. So, people don't psychologically work the way the Consumer Price Index looks at things. MONTAGNE: And just, finally, what would the fed do if it thought inflation was taking off? Mr. WESSEL: If they thought inflation was really beginning to be a problem, they would just keep raising interest rates, in effect, to put a break on the economy, so that inflation won't get worse than it is right now. MONTAGNE: David Wessel is Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for The Wall Street Journal. Thanks, very much. Mr. WESSEL: Thank you.

Is gas going to get even more expensive, and could your grocery bill get even higher? If you look at new numbers on inflation, you might think prices are going down. The government is reporting that, in February, we had the biggest decline in wholesale inflation in three years. But what we pay at the store or at the pump may still be going up. Joining us is MARKETPLACE's John Dimsdale. John, if wholesale prices are down, why are economists still worried about inflation? JOHN DIMSDALE reporting: Well, probably because the trends that we're seeing in this February report don't necessarily reflect what's going on in stores. This report's a snapshot of the prices that producers of goods--what they paid in the early and middle parts of February, but things have changed a lot since then. It certainly has for gasoline, which has gone up . 25 cents a gallon, just since the third week of February. And looking ahead, gas prices don't look so good. Supplies are tight, and spring is when refineries close for maintenance, especially after the hurricanes. They deferred some of the maintenance. So, before you get too ready to celebrate the good news about the falling wholesale prices in this report, be aware that there's plenty for the-glass-is-half-empty crowd. For example, business Professor Peter Morici at the University of Maryland sees warnings of higher inflation in the future. Professor PETER MORICI (Business School, University of Maryland): \u2026which particularly troubling. Two months in a row, the core numbers for producer prices. That is the price is less. The volatile food and energy sectors are up a lot. This is a dramatic departure from months past, and indicates that inflationary pressures may be building in the core of the economy. We haven't seen that in consumer prices yet, but we've seen it in wholesale prices, and that is troubling. CHADWICK: John, if food and energy prices were dropping, what products were costing more to push up that core rate? Mr. DIMSDALE: Well, there's a list of products that jumped in cars and trucks, pharmaceuticals, newspaper supplies, tobacco. The real question for consumers is whether these wholesalers will pass the higher costs on to the retail level, and that depends on productivity. Is technology going to keep improving so that producers can absorb these higher costs of supplies without raising their prices? Productivity's had a pretty good run over the past couple of years, but it slumped in the last part of last year, so there's some concern that core prices might be heading up. CHADWICK: And speaking of the real question, how about the Federal Reserve Board and interest rates? Mr. DIMSDALE: Yeah, well, if core prices are going up, you're going to see higher interest rates. Everyone expects the Fed to raise at least a couple more times this year, and the next meeting is next week.

If you're not an aware investor, this may come as news. It's big news. The Dow yesterday closed at its highest point since May of 2001. The index now is just a little more than 400 points shy of its all-time record in January 2000. Joining us is John Dimsdale at Marketplace's Washington Bureau. John, what's happening? Mr. JOHN DIMSDALE (Marketplace): Well, there's a lot to like in this economy, Alex. Unemployment is low; inflation is tame; growth is healthy; profits are excellent; people are beginning to use that terms goldilocks economy again, where the growth is not too hot, not too cold, and companies have been making good money for some time now. Diane Swonk, the Chief Economist with Mesirow Financial in Chicago, says investors are finally convinced that these profits are for real. Ms. DIANE SWONK (Chief Economist, Mesirow Financial in Chicago): Many people looking at the quality of profits, after years of being deceived by profit performance, are now convinced that not only are profits good, but they're as good as their word. The quality of profits today are judged to be the best in 30 years; in fact, companies no longer are monkeying around to try to inflate profits like they did in the late 1990s. We're actually seeing these are solid profits. CHADWICK: Well, okay, but what about an expensive war that's going on; ongoing worries in the Middle East; high oil prices, rising interest rates; don't people, why aren't they worried about this?  Mr. DIMSDALE: You're right on all counts, but you know, while the interest rates have been going up, there are signs the Fed's just about finished raising rates, plus the long bull run in housing seems to be over, and investors are pulling some of their money out of real estate, and therefore putting them into stocks. And as for defying really expensive oil and gasoline, I have to go to the experts on this. David Weis is the Chief Economist with Standard and Poors. Mr. DAVIE WEIS (Chief Economist, Standard and Poors): It surprised us that the market has totally ignored oil prices. You know, usually you expect that when oil prices go up like this, there's some pressure on consumers, but we responded to the price of oil in, you know, a very robust manner by just continuing to live beyond our means. CHADWICK: Well, John, how long do people think this stock market rally's going to last? Mr. DIMSDALE: Many analysts see it as a broad-based increase that's going to last for the rest of the year; in fact, stock markets around the world are doing pretty well. If anything, the U. S. markets are a little late to the global party. Some point to the similarities to the mid-1990s. When the Feds stopped raising interest rates there was a pop in the stock market. The fundamentals in the U. S. economy are so solid right now, the only thing that could derail a rising market would be some sort of external shock, and if there's one of those, the Fed now has a cushion, meaning they could lower some interest rates to help the economy weather a surprise.

That's a record, according to a new figure from the Administrative Officer of the U. S. Courts. The search in filings came as a new tougher bankruptcy law went into effect at the end of the year. Marketplace's Tess Vigeland joins us now to discuss this story, and, Tess, how much of an increase was this? TESS VIGELAND: Well, Madeleine, this figure is about 30 percent more than the number of folks who filed for bankruptcy in 2004. That year, it was just over 1. 5 million, and last year, as you said, it went over 2 million, 2,039,214 to be precise, and I spoke with Greg McBride, who's the Senior Economist at BankRate. com. He points out that the bulk of those filings did come just in the weeks before the implementation of that new bankruptcy law on October 17. GREG MCBRIDE: This was not a surprise at all because of the fact that there was a real rush to file bankruptcy by the October deadline before the new, more stringent bankruptcy law took effect. BRAND: And, in fact, the figures for the last quarter of last year show a huge surge in people entering bankruptcy, more than 560,000, and that's as opposed to 254,000 in the same period the year before, and remind us about this new law, the details in it. VIGELAND: Well, the biggest change is that it eliminated the ability to automatically file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. That's the kind that essentially wipes out all of your debts. Anyone with an above-median income for their state is now subjected to a means test. A bankruptcy judge basically determines whether you're able to repay at least $100. 00 a month. If you can, then you have to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and that basically puts you on a five-year repayment plan. The law also imposed higher fees to file, and it requires people to take credit counseling, which they also have to pay for. BRAND: And, Tess, is there any evidence that the law is doing what Congress intended; that is, cracking down on people using bankruptcy to avoid repaying their debts? VIGELAND: Well, it's kind of hard to say since we're still just in the first quarter of the new year, and McBride says we really won't know for a little bit now. MCBRIDE: Maybe it's going to be some period of time before we get a real read on bankruptcy statistics because so many people rushed to file last year. I think it'll probably take much, if not all, of 2006 before we get a feel for what's the current breakdown under the new law and how people are filing. VIGELAND: And coming up later today on Marketplace, we'll be taking a look at those new immigration bills moving through Congress. BRAND: Thank you, Tess.

VIGELAND: Well, the biggest change is that it eliminated the ability to automatically file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. That's the kind that essentially wipes out all of your debts. Anyone with an above-median income for their state is now subjected to a means test. A bankruptcy judge basically determines whether you're able to repay at least $100. 00 a month. If you can, then you have to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and that basically puts you on a five-year repayment plan. The law also imposed higher fees to file, and it requires people to take credit counseling, which they also have to pay for. BRAND: And, Tess, is there any evidence that the law is doing what Congress intended; that is, cracking down on people using bankruptcy to avoid repaying their debts? VIGELAND: Well, it's kind of hard to say since we're still just in the first quarter of the new year, and McBride says we really won't know for a little bit now. MCBRIDE: Maybe it's going to be some period of time before we get a real read on bankruptcy statistics because so many people rushed to file last year. I think it'll probably take much, if not all, of 2006 before we get a feel for what's the current breakdown under the new law and how people are filing. VIGELAND: And coming up later today on Marketplace, we'll be taking a look at those new immigration bills moving through Congress. BRAND: Thank you, Tess.

They say the workers do jobs Americans won't do. That view is echoed by President Bush, who's pushing for a guest worker program. But economists say the reality is a lot more complicated. To find out more, NPR's Chris Arnold went to the fishing piers of New Bedford, Massachusetts. CHRIS ARNOLD: The harbor in New Bedford is lined with fish processing warehouses where immigrants, many of them illegal, find work. They stand on their feet for long hours in the cold, sharpening fillet knives and slicing up and de-boning the monkfish, cod and halibut that the fishing boats bring in. Anthony, who didn't want to use his last name, came here illegally from El Salvador six months ago to make money to send home. He says he could only make five dollars a day back home and some days couldn't afford food for his three young kids. ANTHONY: (Through Translator): It's very difficult for him leave the family over there. Sometimes they really miss him. Daddy please if you can come home, I really miss you. That's what the daughter tells him all the time. ARNOLD: Anthony says he doesn't know what to tell his two-year-old daughter on the phone except to lie to her and say he'll be home soon. But crossing the border is too risky and expensive to try very often. Another woman working along the docks here didn't see her young son for 10 years. Workers here say this is one of their greatest hopes for immigration reform that they could get some type of legal status and be allowed to travel to see their families. FRANK FERREIRA: Well I'm glad they're going to, they're going to try to do something. ARNOLD: Further up the waterfront, Frank Ferreira is the general manager of the fish processing plant, AML International. He says he supports the proposal in the Senate to legalize the seven plus million undocumented workers across the country. FERREIRA: I think that they should make it a little bit easier for these people 'cause these people are doing jobs that a lot of people normally would not do. ARNOLD: Ferreira says for eight bucks an hour he just doesn't get anybody besides recent immigrants in applying for his fish cutting jobs. He says there is so much competition from cheap foreign fish producers that companies like his in the U. S. would go under without immigrant labor. Economists say he may be right, but they say without the millions of illegal immigrants, many employers in construction and other industries could afford to raise wages to attract American workers. VERNON BRIGGS: Illegal immigration is a virus and it has got to be wiped out. ARNOLD: Cornell University Economist Vernon Briggs feels very strongly that illegal immigrant workers hurt the most vulnerable American workers. Those without a high school degree and few skills. BRIGGS: The low skilled workers, citizen workers in the United States, native born and naturalized citizens will always lose in the competition from, with illegal immigrants. ARNOLD: But just how much have wages for Americans been pushed down? There aren't a whole lot of good numbers out there. But UC San Diego Economics Professor Gordon Hanson has studied the combined impact of both illegal and legal low skilled, low wage immigrants. GORDON HANSON: Well the best estimate we have is that they've reduced wages for low skilled U. S. native workers by about eight percent over the last 20 years or so. ARNOLD: And Hanson says it's only the very bottom 10 percent of the labor pool that's seen that impact. HANSON: So when you look at the aggregate impact of illegal immigration on U. S. wages, it isn't all that large. ARNOLD: Economists say there are some much more powerful forces keeping down wages. The biggest is technology. Alex Tabarrok is a professor of economics at George Mason University. ALEX TABARROK: It's technology, computers and robots, which have raised the wages of high skilled workers and pushed down the wages of low skilled workers. So if you're against immigration, then you ought really to be against computers because they're much more important in the big picture. ARNOLD: Some economists say even with tougher enforcements, as long as there is a demand for low wage immigrant labor in the U. S. and a supply of willing workers, immigrants will continue to find a way across the border. The question remains what to do with them. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

I'm Ed Gordon. This week immigration protest and politics have dominated the news. In a moment, we'll speak Congresswoman Maxine Waters about the ongoing legislative struggle over immigration. But first the debate. One side argues that these undocumented workers are taking jobs from U. S. citizens and putting a strain on America's economic system.  The other side says these workers provide valuable services and take jobs that U. S. citizens will not. But is it really that simple? Lawrence Katz is a labor economist at Harvard University and co-author of the 2005 study, The Evaluation of Mexican Workforce in the United States. He points out that the American work force has changed significantly in the last 20 years because of a number of factors, including the waning influence of labor unions and the staggering growth in the number of foreign workers. Mr. Katz explained his findings to NPR's Farai Chideya. Mr. LAWRENCE KATZ (Labor Economist, Harvard University): What we attempted to do is we tried to look at the hypothetical of what would have happened over the last 25 years if there had not been such a large increase in the number of immigrants, particularly from Mexico coming in to work in the United States.  And what you see is when you get large shocks of workers coming across the border entering particular occupations is the vast majority of Americans benefit because the increase in supply of workers of these occupations lowers the prices. It's cheaper to get your walls plastered; it's cheaper to buy childcare services; it's cheaper to get food processed. On the other hand, so most of us benefit, but workers directly competing are paying the cost, because they receive lower wages and they get discouraged from entering these occupations and fields. So two groups gain big time. The immigrants themselves have huge increases in income. Most Americans benefit as consumers, but a small group of the most vulnerable Americans pay the cost. CHIDEYA: Do you have any more information on how undereducated workers, these low wage workers, break down by race and ethnicity, the ones who are U. S. citizens? Mr. KATZ: Well, the U. S. citizens who are competing with immigrants are disproportionately African American, disproportionately Hispanic, you know, born in the United States.  CHIDEYA: Is it conceivable that Mexican immigrants who have legal status are also losing out in wages? Mr. KATZ: It's not only conceivable, it's highly probable. Most studies actually find the groups whose wages are most affected are the earlier wave of immigrants with similar sort of characteristics. And in some cases they're moving up the ladder, becoming the supervisors of new immigrants.  But I think most Americans do benefit from this, and the question is, is there a way that we can find to help out the more vulnerable workers while most of us continue to receive the benefits?  CHIDEYA: In some of the cities where we've seen these major immigration protests, the people who you talk about as the most vulnerable are living side by side, neighborhood by neighborhood, with the people who may be benefiting. So in Los Angeles' South Central area you have a predominately African American neighborhood which has transitioned into a neighborhood filled with Mexican immigrants, I'm sure some there with papers and some there without.  In cities like Houston you also have black and Latino populations. So it seems to me that the issues that you see playing out in your study are, you know, being also played out in a very micro level in America's cities. Mr. KATZ: Oh yes, they're quite present there and there are, you know, a large number of issues, of employers being in many cases more wiling to hire recent immigrants than African American young workers, given some of the problems with undocumented immigration, which creates a workforce that in some sense has less ability to stand up their rights because their status in the U. S. is, which is a worrisome aspect of some policy questions like guest worker programs and stuff, which create potentially something that looks more like indentured servants, where your status in the U. S. depends on a particular employer. That's something employers might be very happy to have, but not something that's very beneficial to other workers who have to compete with people.  But, you know, in some sense we all may be able to benefit if we could do more with things like the earned income tax credit, giving employers greater incentives to hire U. S. workers who are more vulnerable. Attempts to stop immigration, given the huge economic incentives, have not been particularly effective in the past. CHIDEYA: Lawrence Katz is a labor economist at Harvard. Thank you so much for talking with us today. Mr. KATZ: Thank you. GORDON: That was NPR's Farai Chideya.

I'm John Ydstie.  (Soundbite of chanting demonstrators) YDSTIE: Thousands of immigrants marched across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan today. It was the latest in a series of nationwide rallies in support of legalizing undocumented workers. While the congressional debate has brought hundreds of thousands of immigrants into the streets, it's also got many employers around the nation on edge.  NPR's Kathleen Schalch has our report.  KATHLEEN SCHALCH reporting:  It's a common sight in the Washington, D. C. suburbs these days, compact men with brown skin and sweatshirts tied around their waists hammer plywood onto the skeleton of a huge new house. Fredrico Rivera says he and all the other workers on this job site are from El Salvador. Rivera says there's a good reason for this.  Mr. FREDERICO RIVERA: (Spanish speaking) SCHALCH: Much more money, he says. In El Salvador you make six dollars a day, whereas here you earn 12 or $13 and hour. Rivera's got a short-term visa, but he'd like to stay as long as he can. Under current law that wouldn't pose much of a problem for him or his employer, according to Jeff Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. He says right now, one in every seven workers in the construction industry is an undocumented immigrant. Mr. JEFFREY PASSEL (Demographer, Pew Hispanic Center): There are some construction jobs, drywall installers, masons, insulation installers, where they represent 25 to 30 percent, or even a little more, of all the workers in the country. SCHALCH: Employers do check documents, he says, but that's no deterrent because fake documents are so easy to come by.  Mr. PASSEL: And the employer has no real incentive not to hire people who are willing to work and who have what appear to be valid documents. SCHALCH: The immigration bill passed by the House of Representatives would change that, making undocumented workers felons and punishing anyone who knowingly employs them. Employers would have to screen all workers against government databases, and could face civil and criminal penalties, even prison time, if they don't. Mr. JERRY HOWARD (Chief Executive Officer, National Association of Homebuilders): It puts a great burden on small business people to become an untrained, uncertified police force. And that's absolutely untenable to small business people. SCHALCH: Jerry Howard, chief executive officer of the National Association of Homebuilders, has another worry, as well. Mr. HOWARD: If you go on any construction site right now, and look around, the bulk of the laborers are foreign born immigrants. And believe me, some of these jobs in some areas of the country are pretty well paying jobs. We still are getting the people we get. It's not an issue of paying more. It's an issue of the supply of people.  SCHALCH: Howard says lawmakers should tread carefully and avoid doing anything that could cripple the homebuilding industry.  Mr. HOWARD: And remember, the housing construction industry is, depending on whose numbers you believe, between 15 and 18 percent of the GDP. So, I think, you're playing with a real, real dangerous game here.  SCHALCH: Proponents of tighter immigration controls contend that this really is about employers trying to save money.  Mr. JACK MARTIN (Federation for Immigration Reforms): The idea that there are jobs that Americans won't do is simply false. SCHALCH: Jack Martin, of the Federation for Immigration Reforms, says in parts of the country where low paid, undocumented immigrants aren't available, construction and other jobs are filled by Americans. Mr. MARTIN: But what has happened over time is wages in areas with large numbers of illegal aliens have fallen. SCHALCH: Martin and others point to data indicating that the number of undocumented workers in the U. S. has doubled in the last seven years to more than 11 million. Mr. MARTIN: And the only way that we really can disrupt that flow is to remove the job attraction that, in effect, advertises to people that if they can past our Border Patrol, that they will, in effect, be home free.  SCHALCH: Business groups insists that the economy now depends on these people. They're lobbying for a bill that would give undocumented workers a chance to come forward, apply for temporary work visas, and eventually become citizens. They say any program to screen out undocumented jobs applicants should be phased in very slowly. And they're hopeful that the Senate, now debating its own bill, will side with them.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: And I'm Alex Chadwick. Coming up, first there was Senior, then Junior, now another son following his father's way. No, not another George Bush, but another Hank Williams. BRAND: But first, here's a common refrain you've probably heard in the ongoing immigration debate. Americans simply will not do the jobs that illegal immigrants do--jobs such as picking strawberries or lettuce. But maybe that's not such a bad thing. UC Davis agricultural economics professor Phillip Martin says the economy would likely adapt. Davis says the U. S. crackdown on migrant farm workers before, in the 1960s, when Congress ended the U. S. -Mexico temporary labor agreement known as the Bracero Program, and then Phillip Martin says farmers and consumers adapted, and will probably do so again. Professor PHILLIP MARTIN (Agricultural Economics Professor, UC Davis): The average consumer doesn't spend very much on fresh fruits and vegetables, an average of about $6 a week. And of that $6, only about $1 goes to farmers. And, of course, the farmers don't give all the money to farm workers. And secondly, farmers don't get very much of the retail dollar. The second question is how do farmers adjust over time? We've had experience. In 1964, the United States government stopped the Bracero program over the very strong objections of especially California farmers, many of whom predicted that without the Braceros, they would have to follow their workers to Mexico in order to harvest tomatoes and other crops. And even the University of California predicted that prices for tomato products and other commodities that were picked by Braceros would increase in price. That didn't happen. The University of California developed tomatoes that ripened uniformly, a machine to harvest them, and we now produce five times more tomatoes at roughly half the cost that we did back in the 1960s. BRAND: You're saying that farmers would then adapt technologically, that new technologies would be invented and dispatched to make up for the fewer workers. Prof. MARTIN: There's a whole range of options, but I think it's important for everyone to remember that 200 years ago, 95 percent of Americans lived on farms producing food. Today, it's less than 2 percent. If you look around the world, one sign of economic development is fewer people in the fields producing food, more people off the farm in non-farm jobs. It's the way in which we get economic development. Let me caution and say that it's not an easy process. Many farmers would not survive the transition, whether that transition is to mechanization--it wouldn't have to necessarily be mechanization. There could also be mechanical aides that make the work easier and therefore allow for more women and older workers to stay employed longer. Right now, those harvest jobs are young men's jobs. They're back-using jobs. The average career, climbing a ladder, putting 60 or 80 pounds of oranges or apples in a bag is only about 10 years. There's frequent falls, back problems. So, there could be hydraulic lifts out there that still mean the apples are picked by hand, but there would a be a different mix of workers than are out there right now. BRAND: What if we just said, you know, we are going to outsource all our fruits and vegetables? What would that do to the economy? Prof. MARTIN: We know that you can live well and comfortably without producing food. That's why we tell the Japanese that they should open up to our rice imports, even though the Japanese say rice is a staple of our diet, and we have to subsidize out farmers and keep rice production, because we can't rely just on imports. I think, in the end, we would still wind up having a very significant fruit and vegetable sector, because we have good soils. We have good climates. We have good infrastructure. If wages were to rise significantly, and I mean the example at the end of the Bracero Program is farm wages rose about 40 percent in the mid-1960s, and the industry continued to grow. BRAND: You know, a lot of people say even if you raised wages to $20 an hour and provided health insurance, you're still not going to get Americans out there picking strawberries, that it's just too hard. Prof. MARTIN: It is true that workers, logically looking for upward mobility, tend to move out of seasonal agricultural jobs as soon as they can find better jobs in the U. S. labor market. Once they and their children found job options, there needed to be a new source or workers found, and they were. BRAND: UC Davis economics professor Phillip Martin, thank you for joining us.

MELISSA BLOCK, Host: I'm Melissa Block. And this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, from NPR News. NORRIS: The world's biggest retailer is offering some advice to its small-time competitors. Literally. T: how to survive when Wal-Mart comes to town. On top of that, the giant company will be offering tens of thousands of dollars in neighborhood development grants to local chambers of commerce. So what's in it for Wal-Mart? We decided to put that question to Charles Fishman. He's author of a book titled THE WAL-MART EFFECT and he joins us now from Philadelphia. Charles, good to talk to you. CHARLES FISHMAN: Thanks for having me. NORRIS: So why is Wal-Mart so eager now to show itself a good corporate citizen? What's this all about? FISHMAN: This particular announcement was part of a larger announcement that it's going to open 50 or more stores in the next two years in what it calls blighted urban areas. And as part of that, it's going to offer advice to the neighborhood businesses in those urban areas that it goes into. What's in it for Wal-Mart is a couple of things. Wal-Mart desperately needs to move into urban markets successfully. 90 percent of Americans live within 15 miles of a Wal-Mart. So, if you're going to keep growing, you have to go into the big cities, which are the places where there are still few Wal-Marts. Wal-Mart has historically, in the last three or four years, encountered a lot of resistance in big cities. And it's trying to use this announcement of a package of incentives and development grants and ways of going to cities to kind of inoculate itself against that opposition in advance, I think. NORRIS: So go in wearing a white hat? FISHMAN: Try and go in wearing a white hat. And I think it's okay to say, what does Wal-Mart look like when it's behaving well? And maybe this is part of what Wal-Mart looks like when it's behaving well. If the criticism is ever going to have an impact and Wal-Mart is going to change its behavior, what does that actually look like? Maybe this is what it looks like. How many companies have announced recently that they're going to open 50 businesses, especially in economically needy parts of the country? I don't think that's bad news. I think it's okay to be skeptical of Wal-Mart. The cynicism is now so deep it's hard to know when to take their good news initiatives seriously. And so I think this is one where we ought to sort of say, well, if you actually do it and you're true to your word, maybe that will really be a good thing. NORRIS: Has Wal-Mart talked specifically about what they want to do to help these small businesses? FISHMAN: Yes, they have. They've said they're going to conduct seminars with them on how to compete with Wal-Mart. They're going to advertise a select group of businesses every few months on their own in-house radio and TV network in the stores. And they're going to include some of the local merchants in their local newspaper advertising. NORRIS: In the end, though, what can Wal-Mart do to help those mom and pops survive, if they're undercutting the prices on baby formula and diapers and Coca Cola and a gallon of milk? FISHMAN: The weird part of the announcement is not that they're going to build 50 stores in blighted areas. The weird part of the announcement is just what you said, that they're going to try and help the people they will be competing with. I don't know exactly how that's going to work. The idea of Wal-Mart, literally, it's in the official announcement, conducting seminars on how to compete with Wal-Mart, that's a little unusual. There are, of course, ways to effectively compete with Wal-Mart. You change your product offerings. You improve your customer service. I would hope that in a slightly more classic economic development sense, the local communities would be helped because Wal-Mart will be an anchor of good news and good economic energy and that people in the area around who may even do things that Wal-Mart doesn't do, like shoe makers or dry cleaners, will actually benefit from the traffic that Wal-Mart brings. The economics studies show that when a typical Wal-Mart opens anywhere in the country, within five years, four of five businesses have gone out of business. So it is, in fact, quite hard to compete with Wal-Mart, but it is possible. I'm not sure how I'd feel about taking business advice from one of my competitors, but it's worth seeing how it plays out.

The struggling U. S. airline industry is beginning to capitalize on the growing market for air travel to and from China. American Airlines landed its first every flight into China this week, beginning new daily nonstop service from Chicago to Shanghai. Continental and United also fly a limited number of nonstop flights into China. More routes soon may become available, and the competition for those routes is starting to heat up. NPR's David Schaper reports. Mr. DAN ELWELL (American Airlines official): We thought we'd never get it. DAVID SCHAPER reporting: That's how American Airlines official Dan Elwell describes the long wait and struggle to get a direct nonstop route from the U. S. into mainland China. Mr. DAN ELWELL: Something like 14 years we have very much wanted access to the Chinese market. SCHAPER: American's new daily service from Chicago to Shanghai gives the world's largest airline its first foray into what many industry analysts say is a vitally important marketplace. Mr. MO GARFINKLE (aviation consultant, GCW Consulting): Entering into the China market is like entering into paradise for airlines at this point. SCHAPER: Mo Garfinkle is an aviation consultant with the firm GCW Consulting. Mr. GARFINKLE:  The market is the fastest growing in the world. SCHAPER: Garfinkle says to call growth in the market for flights to and from China an explosion might be an understatement. He says it's been decades since the US airlines have seen any kind of market growth like what is taking place in China right now, especially with the demand from higher paying, and thus more profitable, business travelers going in both directions. The U. S. Department of Transportation does not yet have passenger data from the last year, but preliminary figures show that the number of people flying between China and the U. S. has increased close to 20 percent from 2004. And Adam Pilarski of the Washington, DC-based aviation consulting firm AVITAS says there are now an estimated 150 million Chinese who travel by air within their country and abroad. Mr. ADAM PILARSKI (Consultant for AVITAS): China is the second largest generator of passengers after the U. S. in the world. SCHAPER: Yet, Pilarski points out there's still a huge population base in China of more than a billion people who have never flown. Meaning there are tremendous opportunities for that double-digit growth of the market to continue. But the ability of US carriers to capitalize on those markets has been hamstrung by the limited number of direct, nonstop routes allowed by the Chinese government. Right now, U. S. carriers have just five direct flights a day from the U. S. into China. Polarski says the Chinese government is, in part, protecting its own airlines, which he says are not yet ready to compete head-to-head with the U. S. carriers. Mr. PILARSKI: China does not have the sufficient number of aircraft, sufficient number of pilots, and a sufficiently high level of service to attract customers. SCHAPER: But Polarski and others say that just as the rest of the Chinese economy is making rapid advancements, so too are Chinese airlines. And therefore the Chinese government may be ready to open up new routes to U. S. carriers soon. The topic will be discussed in bilateral talks between the U. S. and China slated to begin in Beijing April 18th. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  The struggling U.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: NPR's Chris Arnold reports from Boston. CHRIS ARNOLD: To try to get more people to this open house in Dorchester, the realtor, Hal Allen, has brought in live cabaret singers, hung artwork by local artists on walls, and he sent out invites to 100 other brokers, neighbors and friends. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC AT OPEN HOUSE)HAL ALLEN: We've had a fairly good turnout, probably between 40 and 50 people so far, and we're about halfway through the event. ARNOLD: Allen says the condo is a renovated Victorian and has an allnew kitchen, hardwood floors and vaulted ceilings. It's listed at $449,000, but Allen says with so many condos on the market, he is pricing the more runofthemill ones at least 5 percent below last year's prices or he's asking sellers to include extra features, like a wine fridge or a big, luxurious bathtub. That's because he says buyers are now taking the time to find something they really like for the best price. ALLEN: I've reduced, this week, four of my properties at least $10,000 each. ARNOLD: And brokers and sellers are trying all kinds of other things to attract buyers. Some are paying condo fees for the buyer's first year or offering cash back for the buyer to spend on closing costs or new furniture. Broker Carrie Dowland says throwing in a flat-screen TV is enough to tip the balance for more buyers than you might think. CARRIE DOWLAND: It's a couple thousand dollars, and the perceived value of it, I think, is greater than that, you know. A lot of condo buyers are first-time homebuyers. They don't have a lot of expendable cash, so they know that they can get some bells and whistles that they can't afford on their own and just roll it right into the price. You know? ARNOLD: But a lot of buyers don't go for the bells and whistles. DARLENE VITORI: The house has been on the market since August. ARNOLD: Darlene Vitori-Marcelle is trying to sell her five-bedroom house in Holliston, Massachusetts, a suburb about 45 minutes outside of Boston. MARCELLE: It's a fantastic neighborhood. It's full of children, full of families, it's a young-family neighborhood. ARNOLD: But Marcelle says there are just a lot of other homes on the market, and hers hasn't sold for months. She's just now started offering $5,000 cash back at closing for a buyer. She's tried having a neighborhood party in the house, and she's dropped her price from $439,000 to $379,000. A lot of brokers say that's the best way to sell your house. DAVID KNOX: There's only one thing you can do. Price it right. ARNOLD: David Knox is a motivational speaker for real estate brokers, and he has come to the Holiday Inn in Marlboro, Mass. , to talk to ERA realtors from across the region and to sell them his instructional videos. He says the extras and open-house parties are nice and all, but --KNOX: You can have a party all day long with free liquor. If it's not priced right, it doesn't matter, no parties, no creativity, no nothing. Read the market, price it right. Read the market, price it right. That's it. Once you've done that, then the party works. If you have a party in an over-priced home, you'll just have more people knowing it's overpriced. ARNOLD: Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

Some are paying condo fees for the buyer's first year or offering cash back for the buyer to spend on closing costs or new furniture. Broker Carrie Dowland says throwing in a flat-screen TV is enough to tip the balance for more buyers than you might think. CARRIE DOWLAND: It's a couple thousand dollars, and the perceived value of it, I think, is greater than that, you know. A lot of condo buyers are first-time homebuyers. They don't have a lot of expendable cash, so they know that they can get some bells and whistles that they can't afford on their own and just roll it right into the price. You know? ARNOLD: But a lot of buyers don't go for the bells and whistles. DARLENE VITORI: The house has been on the market since August. ARNOLD: Darlene Vitori-Marcelle is trying to sell her five-bedroom house in Holliston, Massachusetts, a suburb about 45 minutes outside of Boston. MARCELLE: It's a fantastic neighborhood. It's full of children, full of families, it's a young-family neighborhood. ARNOLD: But Marcelle says there are just a lot of other homes on the market, and hers hasn't sold for months. She's just now started offering $5,000 cash back at closing for a buyer. She's tried having a neighborhood party in the house, and she's dropped her price from $439,000 to $379,000. A lot of brokers say that's the best way to sell your house. DAVID KNOX: There's only one thing you can do. Price it right. ARNOLD: David Knox is a motivational speaker for real estate brokers, and he has come to the Holiday Inn in Marlboro, Mass. , to talk to ERA realtors from across the region and to sell them his instructional videos. He says the extras and open-house parties are nice and all, but -- KNOX: You can have a party all day long with free liquor. If it's not priced right, it doesn't matter, no parties, no creativity, no nothing. Read the market, price it right. Read the market, price it right. That's it. Once you've done that, then the party works. If you have a party in an over-priced home, you'll just have more people knowing it's overpriced.

The London Stock Exchange's history goes back to the late 17th century. It's still the center of Britain's financial industry, so it's come as a shock to some that New York's youngest stock exchange, NASDAQ, is courting its venerable British rival. Yesterday NASDAQ bought a 15 percent stake in the London Exchange, and many expect NASDAQ to make a play for a majority stake soon. NPR's Adam Davidson reports that all this is evidence of big changes sweeping global stock exchanges. ADAM DAVIDSON reporting: When you hear the words stock exchange you probably immediately picture some big, busy room where dealers trade with each other. But that doesn't happen at NASDAQ or at the company it's trying to buy, the London Stock Exchange. They're both electronic exchanges and they sound very different. Mr. FORREST BOWMAN (Stock Trader): And just a few seconds, and yes, I'm there now. So I'm in front of my iDealing. com order entry and trading screen. DAVIDSON: Forrest Bowman trades on the London Stock Exchange. His company, iDealing. com, created software that helps investors trade stocks from anywhere in the world. They just need a computer and an Internet connection. Electronic trading has been around a while, but the technology is advancing so quickly that's it is changing the way the exchange business works. Mr. BEN STEIL (Council on Foreign Relations): In the exchange business the bigger the better. DAVIDSON: Ben Steil with the Council on Foreign Relations says that's exactly why NASDAQ is hoping to buy the London Stock Exchange. They're hoping to profit from the high volume that electronic trading allows. The business logic is solid, Ben Steil says, except for one problem. The U. S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, might decide that it has jurisdiction over the London Stock Exchange as soon as an American Company buys it. Ms. ANGELA KNIGHT (British Stockholder's Trade Association): I suppose that's where my concern starts. Because the U. K. has its own rules and requirements, and they're different to the U. S. They're not wrong, but they're just different to the U. S. DAVIDSON: Angela Knight runs APCIMS, a British stockbrokers trade association. She says America's SEC regulations are seen as particularly costly and intrusive, and she says many British traders are desperate to keep NASDAQ away from the London Stock Exchange. They're afraid NASDAQ might have to use U. S. rules even in London, and that could kill London's exchange business. Ms. KNIGHT: That business will walk away. It's ever so easy to start to lose business. It's very hard to get it. DAVIDSON: It might surprise some people that the U. S. has more stock trading regulation than most European countries. Knight is afraid costly U. S. regulation will send companies to Germany or France to sell their stock. That would hurt the U. S. and Great Britain, she says. NASDAQ officials declined to comment, but some experts have said the company could structure a deal that would not force U. S. regulations on the London Exchange. No matter what happens with this particular deal, most industry watchers say that deals like this are inevitable. Soon there will likely be a handful of large global exchanges handling most stocks.

I'm Alex Chadwick. China's President Hu Jintao arrives in the United States tomorrow. He'll be here for a week. He's going to meet with President Bush on Thursday, and here's an item the two could discuss. China says its economic growth in the first quarter of this year exceeded 10 percent. Joining us is John Dimsdale. He's in Marketplace's Washington Bureau.  John, welcome back. And what, are there going to be congratulations, do you think, when U. S. officials sit down with their Chinese counterparts? Mr. JOHN DIMSDALE (Marketplace): Well, not really, because this gives some ammunition to the U. S. , which is long argued that China must allow its currency to float more freely against the dollar. You know, in the American view the Chinese currency is pegged by the government two low against the dollar, and that makes Chinese products very cheap hear, but potential American exports are too expensive in China, which is why there's this huge trade imbalance between the two countries. And this trade and currency and inequality is also generating a lot of China's growth, which even China concedes is too fast to control, so the U. S. can say now, let your currency become a little stronger, lower your protectionist trade barriers, and then let U. S. products compete in the Chinese marketplace. CHADWICK: And then there are complaints that China's growth is actually adding to the high price of oil. Mr. DIMSDALE: That's right, and you notice, oil is once again at $70. 00 a barrel, the first time it's been that high since Hurricane Katrina, and there are several reasons for that, but one is that oil is so scarce. It's fueling strong growth in China, India, the U. S. , which is also growing at a pretty quick clip. Huge demand is one reason you're seeing gas prices here hitting $3. 00 a gallon in a lot of places, and it's not just oil that's in short supply. Other commodities like gold, silver, copper, nickel, all are in high demand, and therefore really expensive. CHADWICK: What is President Hu's itinerary? He's stopping in Seattle on the way into the country, and then Washington? Mr. DIMSDALE: That's right. He's going to tour a Boeing Aircraft factory, give a speech there. You know, China's a big customer of Boeing's, and President Hu's time there is designed to show that the U. S. , you know, China doesn't only mean outsourcing jobs for cheap labor. China recently placed a $4. 5 billion order for 80 Boeing planes, planes that are made in America, which means new high-wage jobs will be created here. To make things a little more hospitable on this trip, a group of Chinese businesses have spent the last couple weeks touring the U. S.  They've announced $16 billion in purchases of American-made products. President Hu will have dinner with Microsoft's Bill Gates tomorrow. They're going to talk about technology investments in China, and he'll no doubt complain about cheap Chinese knockoffs of software that cuts into his business and makes the trade deficit worse.  Speaking of that: piracy. On Marketplace today we're going to kick off a week-long look at the issue with a report today on counterfeit auto parts. CHADWICK: Thank you, John.

Welcome to the show. Mr. MICKEY KANTOR (Former U. S. Trade Representative) Thank you very much, Madeleine. BRAND: Well, what is the most pressing trade issue Hu will discuss with President Bush? Mr. KANTOR: Well, there are three or four areas. Currency issues, which we've all read and talked about; whether China's manipulating its currency to take advantage of its trade relationship with the United States. Protection of intellectual property rates, where there's been great frustration over great number of years by the U. S. of over China's failure to, in many ways, protect intellectual property rights. But let me add they're doing much better now. Market access for U. S. goods, services, and agricultural goods and financial services; and last they'll be, as usual, continuing discussion over textiles with the caveat that we reached a--an arrangement or a combination with the Chinese just a few months ago on that issue, so it will not take a front seat. BRAND: And what's the nature of the intellectual property dispute? Mr. KANTOR: Well, it--it takes on a couple of aspects. Number one is the rate of piracy in China is still high. Although not the way it was fifteen years ago. We have two intellectual property rights protection agreements with China, we also have agreements under their accession to the World Trade Organization; given those areas, they have passed laws and regulations, Madeleine, which, in effect, are pretty good. It's the enforcement across the country, and a country as big as China with no real history of, of, of protecting intellectual property rights that is difficult. It may be one thing to talk about it in Beijing, it's another to enforce it outside of Beijing. BRAND: Mm-hmm, in a huge country like China. What's--what's an example of, of a good, of an idea of something that, that is a problem, that China has violated in. . . Mr. KANTOR: Well, in pharmaceuticals, in music, in movies, in other areas--computer software, Windows and other products. Windows being a Microsoft product since you mentioned Bill Gates. BRAND: Well, what happens then, someone like Microsoft, for example, develops something like Windows, for example, and all of a sudden someone in China is knocking it off? Mr. KANTOR: It's not just someone; it's the Chinese government itself. Many of the ministries use what you might call knock-off Windows and other Microsoft products which is--not only costs a lot of money, but of course it is embarrassing not only for Microsoft, it's embarrassing for the Chinese government. Madame Wu Yi who's a Vice Premier, the highest ranking woman in the Chinese government and someone with--who I negotiated with for four years, has done a good job in heading an internal committee in an attempt to enforce, not only in government, out of government, the rights of software users, as well as movies and music and pharmaceuticals and other areas. And they're starting to make progress, but there is still a long way to go. BRAND: What is it like negotiating with the Chinese?  What kinds of negotiators are they? Mr. KANTOR: Good; strong; knowledgeable; direct. Well, when we, we negotiated both IPR agreements in '95 and '96, I guess is when we signed them. BRAND: Intellectual Property Rights? Mr. KANTOR: Intellectual Property Rights Agreements. The Chinese were quite clear about not only their unwillingness to enforce certain rights but also their inability to do it outside of Beijing given the usual strength or the historic strength of their provinces. And as a result, we made progress, but we made progress because we were very clear about what they could do and what they couldn't do and where they thought their situation stood.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Business and trade are the topics of the day, as China's President Hu Jintao continues his visit to the U. S. He's in Washington State and today, Hu got a look at some of Boeing's latest offerings and then addressed a group of business leaders in Everett, Washington. NPR's Wendy Kaufman was there and she joins us now. Wendy, what did President Hu have to say? WENDY KAUFMAN: Well, the focus of his speech this afternoon was really about friendship and business development and cooperation between the two countries. But he also painted a very broad picture of the Chinese economy and its relationship to other economies. It was as though he was saying economic development and trade are complex issues, that any problems we may have have to be resolved within a context and that we cannot take a piecemeal approach. He emphasized the problems between the U. S. and China should not be politicized, but should be addressed through what he called consultation and dialogue on a \"equal footing as we work to expand our trade ties. \"So it was a pretty upbeat speech, but noting that there were, you know, some problems and that they had to be addressed. SIEGEL: Well, let's start with a pretty big problem as it's perceived from this side of the relationship, a 200 billion dollar trade deficit with China. Did President Hu address that? KAUFMAN: He did. And he acknowledged it's a big problem. He said \"China takes this issue seriously. \" He also said that China does not see the big trade surplus with the United States. But he turned around and stressed the growth in U. S. exports to China, a 118% increase between 2001 and 2005. So he tried to put a positive Chinese spin on it. At the same time, he said that much of the deficit could be explained by structural changes stemming from globalization. And he said that the U. S. imports many products that the U. S. simply doesn't make anymore, saying that if the U. S. didn't buy the goods from China, they'd buy them from someone else. So, you know, don't blame us for that structural kind of issue. SIEGEL: And of course there was the obvious symbolism of his being in Everett, Washington and at Boeing, where China's just bought, is it, 80 737s from Boeing. KAUFMAN: Yeah, that was their most recent order, but in the past year or so, they've ordered, you know, hundreds, and they've said they're gonna by 2000 within the next fifteen years. That's a lot of airplanes. SIEGEL: Now, another big issue is currency. The U. S. claims that the Chinese government keeps its currency artificially low to keep its good artificially cheap. Did he address that issue? KAUFMAN: He took that one on as well, but here again, he said China has taken a responsible attitude that is suitable to its own national interest. But he did note that last July, the Chinese government allowed the currency to float somewhat relative to a basket of currencies. And since then, the Chinese currency has moved upward about three percent relative to the dollar. Now, I should add that is not enough to satisfy many in Washington, D. C. who think that if it were really freely floating, it would rise somewhere between ten and as much as, you know, 40%. So, a lot more than it's gone up so far. SIEGEL: Another big contentious subject is intellectual property. And having visited Microsoft yesterday, it would be quite important to them. Issues of software piracy for example. KAUFMAN: And here, he said that China will be firm in fighting piracy. He said China will step up enforcement and crack down on copyright enforcement. He said China needs to protect intellectual property to open itself wider, to improve its investment climate and to enhance its internal innovations. In short, Robert, there was a lot of rhetoric here, and a lot of sort of strong good business examples from Washington state that show what a productive relationship in trade can be for both the United States and China. But it's not clear if the overtures which played so well here will go over quite so well when he gets to meet President Bush tomorrow in Washington, D. C. SIEGEL: Okay, thank you, Wendy. KAUFMAN: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Wendy Kaufman reporting on Chinese president Hu's visit to Washington state. MELISSA BLOCK, Host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

But he turned around and stressed the growth in U. S. exports to China, a 118% increase between 2001 and 2005. So he tried to put a positive Chinese spin on it. At the same time, he said that much of the deficit could be explained by structural changes stemming from globalization. And he said that the U. S. imports many products that the U. S. simply doesn't make anymore, saying that if the U. S. didn't buy the goods from China, they'd buy them from someone else. So, you know, don't blame us for that structural kind of issue. SIEGEL: And of course there was the obvious symbolism of his being in Everett, Washington and at Boeing, where China's just bought, is it, 80 737s from Boeing. KAUFMAN: Yeah, that was their most recent order, but in the past year or so, they've ordered, you know, hundreds, and they've said they're gonna by 2000 within the next fifteen years. That's a lot of airplanes. SIEGEL: Now, another big issue is currency. The U. S. claims that the Chinese government keeps its currency artificially low to keep its good artificially cheap. Did he address that issue? KAUFMAN: He took that one on as well, but here again, he said China has taken a responsible attitude that is suitable to its own national interest. But he did note that last July, the Chinese government allowed the currency to float somewhat relative to a basket of currencies. And since then, the Chinese currency has moved upward about three percent relative to the dollar. Now, I should add that is not enough to satisfy many in Washington, D. C. who think that if it were really freely floating, it would rise somewhere between ten and as much as, you know, 40%. So, a lot more than it's gone up so far. SIEGEL: Another big contentious subject is intellectual property. And having visited Microsoft yesterday, it would be quite important to them. Issues of software piracy for example. KAUFMAN: And here, he said that China will be firm in fighting piracy. He said China will step up enforcement and crack down on copyright enforcement. He said China needs to protect intellectual property to open itself wider, to improve its investment climate and to enhance its internal innovations. In short, Robert, there was a lot of rhetoric here, and a lot of sort of strong good business examples from Washington state that show what a productive relationship in trade can be for both the United States and China. But it's not clear if the overtures which played so well here will go over quite so well when he gets to meet President Bush tomorrow in Washington, D. C. SIEGEL: Okay, thank you, Wendy. KAUFMAN: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Wendy Kaufman reporting on Chinese president Hu's visit to Washington state.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.

We called her this morning to find out more about the event. Hello. Governor CHRISTINE GREGOIRE (Washington State): Hi, how are you? MONTAGNE: Fine. Now, in a way, you're just coming from that dinner. Besides the many business executives, who else attended? What did you all talk about? Gov. GREGOIRE: Well, for the most part, our conversation surrounded global healthcare. We also talk about education and the need for greater education exchange. So, he and I talked about a Confucius Institute in Seattle, and a Washington education institute for students and teachers in China. MONTAGNE: Now, I gather that you met separately with the president, but before we get to the sorts of things you would have discussed, let's turn momentarily back to the dinner which we've just heard Martin Kaste say had the air of a chamber of commerce event. But, what, for instance, did you have on the menu? Gov. GREGOIRE: Oh, well, we had beef or halibut by way of choices--fine wines produced here in Washington State. So, it was an opportunity to feature the kind of agricultural products that we have to offer, and they're one of the importers of many of our good agricultural products. MONTAGNE: And the president himself, President Hu Jintao, was he social? Gov. GREGOIRE: Absolutely. When he arrived at the Paine Field in Everett, Washington, everyone expected him to go immediately to his car, but there was about 800 Chinese Americans. He actually went through the crowd and shook hands and greeted all of them, and I think that's kind of an indication he's a very warm individual, very easy to chat with. MONTAGNE: There were protests, though, in Seattle, in connection with President Hu's visit. The issue of human rights came up in those protests. Did it come up in your meetings? Gov. GREGOIRE: There were some protests, but there was also a huge number of Chinese Americans that were present at virtually every stop we went, with Chinese and American flags out. MONTAGNE: And just, finally, back to the broader questions of trade relationships with the United States, as we've heard, Washington State has an actual surplus. Did that question come up? Gov. GREGOIRE: Well, we talked about the trade imbalance, but he also was very clear in my meeting with him--my private meeting--that Washington State is unique and that the trade that has gone on before will not only continue, but increase on many more sectors. One up and coming one is the environmental issues that they are facing there, and we have the technology to help them, particularly as they prepare for the 2008 Olympics. MONTAGNE: What's on the agenda for today? Gov. GREGOIRE: Today, we are going to take a tour of the Boeing company, and then President Hu, at a luncheon, will give a major address. My hopes are that he will address the piracy issue that many of our companies find as an experience in China, and I'm hoping that he will send a message that they're going to step up their protection of intellectual property, which will be an immense benefit to us in terms of our trade and our nation's trade with China. MONTAGNE: Governor, thank you very much for joining us. Gov. GREGOIRE: You bet. Thanks, Renee.

I'm Alex Chadwick. Another new record for oil prices today. It's above $73. 00 a barrel. Nationwide, average gasoline prices are now $2. 85 a gallon. California's average is just above $3. 00, and in the east, there are shortages of gasoline in some areas as refiners and distributors make the switch to summer blends of fuel. Joining us is John Dimsdale in Marketplace's Washington Bureau. John, what about these spot shortages of fuel? Mr. JOHN DIMSDALE (Marketplace): Well, it sounds like it's going to be for several weeks. In part, it's still the hangover from last summer's storms, but it's also caused by the process of changing over to gasoline that is less polluting in the warm weather, and that procedure is more disruptive this year because distributors are switching from the old chemical called NTBE, which has been found to pollute ground water, to ethanol. Geoff Sundstrom, who tracks gas supplies for Triple-A, says the switch is hitting the mid-Atlantic states right now, from Richmond to Philadelphia. Mr. GEOFF SUNDSTROM (Spokesman, Triple-A): What's occurring at the retail level and at the fuel distribution terminal is a complete draining of their gasoline inventory, the cleaning of all the equipment and storage, and then a refilling of that storage with the new Ethanol blend fuel. Mr. DIMSDALE: Now, the good news here is that once this change is done, Ethanol is cheaper than NTBE and could take some of the price pressure off gasoline. The Triple-A expects prices to drop a bit after Memorial Day, but stay at least in the $2. 50 range for the summer. CHADWICK: Gas prices have been a high, John, since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It's going to be hurricane season again pretty soon. What kind of economic impact are these prices having? Do we know? Mr. DIMSDALE: You know, so far, surprisingly little. In the past, these kinds of levels would spark real economic drag, high interest rates, even recession, but adjusted for inflation, gas prices aren't quite at the record highs reached during the oil embargos of the '70s, and, you know, there are signs that Americans are driving less and buying fewer gas-guzzlers. CHADWICK: You know, there's also a political fallout from this, though, isn't there? This is an election year, and people worry about these prices. Mr. DIMSDALE: Yeah, exactly. The polls show it's becoming an issue of concern for a lot of voters, and Democrats see an opening, and the gas bills are taking the edge off of Republican hopes that they could benefit from this strong economy. Coming up later on Marketplace, our series, Conversations From the Corner Office, continues with an interview with the CEO of Xerox, Ann Mulcahy. CHADWICK: Thank you.

S. Commerce Department, helped facilitate the Census Report. Mr. Langston said the growth of black businesses is good news and reaffirms the president's goal of keeping America competitive. Mr. RONALD LANGSTON (National Director, Minority Business Development Agency): I think there is a renewed since of entrepreneurial energy in the African-American community that we have not seen, I guess, since the Harlem Renaissance and shortly after World War II. More and more individuals are seeing themselves as business owners and not just as going to school, graduating and getting a job. GORDON: This has been something that we have seen with the hip-hop generation. Is this also reflective of older blacks as well? Mr. LANGSTON: Absolutely. As we see more who are leaving the workforce after 25 and 30 years in business, they're leaving with gold and sometimes platinum parachutes and they want to go into business. And it's certainly not unique to the hip-hop generation. As matter of fact, we have seen a consistent flow of more minorities because of technology, because of new focused energy in being an owner, really responding to this need to be in business. GORDON: Now, let's define what these businesses are in terms of just size and how we define, quote, \u201cblack business,\u201d if you will. Mr. LANGSTON: There are about 1. 2 million minorities businesses, of which about 1. 1 million are what we call micro or sole proprietor businesses. And though that might seem a little disconcerting, it really is a good base by which we can to start to grow businesses. Almost 40 percent of minority businesses are in the services arena, and another 33 to 34 percent are in retail. So there's a disproportionate number of minority businesses in those two sectors. My concern, as the national director for minority business, is to see a greater distribution of minority businesses in the high asset businesses, like manufacturing, transportation and utilities. GORDON: While I think most people would applaud all of what we are seeing, we've got to be honest, not just about black business, but about business and the idea of becoming entrepreneur. It is not and easy road to hoe. When you jump in this water you know that more than half will, in fact, drown. Mr. LANGSTON: That is a national statistic, regardless of your race or ethnicity. There's about a 45 to 51 percent failure rate in the first one to three years and that's not uncommon. When we started the Minority Business Development Agency in 1968 as a product of the Nixon administration, we were the only ones on the block pretty much providing a kind of technical and managerial assistance. But, today, there are many NGO's non-profits, trade association chambers who are also providing that kind of entry-level review and technical assistance. We have been focusing on strategic growth companies that one have $1 million or more in gross receipts because we believe that profile of entrepreneur business owner has the greatest capacity to expand, grow, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and to employ more people. GORDON: With these increasing numbers, are we starting to see an increase in mainstream lending institutions looking to African-Americans? Mr. LANGSTON: Yes, we are, but it's somewhat targeted. There are four or five real key states\u2014California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, and then we can get into Ohio and back to Pennsylvania, where we're starting to see a larger number of access to capital routes being taken by entrepreneurs, particularly African-American and other minorities. We're also starting to see, among different ethnic groups, various pockets of venture capitalists, angel funders. For example, the Hispanic business community really has been leading the way recently on angel funders. GORDON: Now, Mr. Langston, I don't have to tell you this. I'm sure that you've had to deal with this for some time. When people are starting to look at a trimming of a budget, oft times what we see is the kinds of flotation devices, if you will allow that, that carry minorities through the hardships. There have been concerns that we're going to see those kind of programs go by the wayside. Mr. LANGSTON: Frankly, the president's budget on research and development, and on tax credits, and also return of taxes to small businesses, has been quite instrumental, I believe--and also the reports you see around the country have been very instrumental in helping businesses to grow and expand. So we need to position African-American businesses to take advantage of the tax opportunities or the research and development as different budget items shift around, but as they shift around to competitive areas that we make sure that they're positioned to take full advantage of them. GORDON: We talk about lower interest rates. Everybody's watching the feds, the tax credits that are given, and those sometimes, particularly when we start moving into midterm elections and then into '08, can sometimes be battleground and tenuous. How confident are you that these kinds of things are going to remain in place? Mr. LANGSTON: Well, no. The president has asked for a permanent tax credit and tax break, so I hope that the business community, particularly the minority and African-American community will support the president's tax program to make tax reduction permanent, particularly as those taxes are reinvested back into businesses. And then, from there, they can take opportunities to grow and expand their businesses and to employ more people. GORDON: All right. Mr. Langston, before we let you go, a lot of numbers in this 468 page report. What number do you want people to really take a look at and say that this is most important? Mr. LANGSTON: There are actually two numbers. The 45 percent increase in African-American firms is very, very strong and a good number, and we're moving in the right direction. Equally important, you see a 25 percent increase in the gross receipts of those African-American firms. So both gross receipts and firm growth are moving in the right upward trajectory. We must sustain that trajectory going forward because we want to see more multi-million dollar businesses grow. And that 1. 1 million of sole proprietorships, I want to see that number reduce and the other side of the table increase, because that's where our strength is going to be going forward in the future. GORDON: Mr. Langston, thank you so much. Appreciate it! Mr. LANGSTON: Thank you. I'm a big fan, and I appreciate this opportunity to visit with you today.

Today, foreclosures. Colorado posted the highest ratio of foreclosures in the country last month. The online provider of such information, RealtyTrac, reports the foreclosure rate in Colorado rose to three times the national average. Of course, Colorado may or may not be a forecaster of the national housing market. Last summer, on this program, mortgage banker Lou Barnes considered this very question. Mr. LOU BARNES (Boulder West Financial Services): I work in Boulder, Colorado, which is a test case for all the bubble theories. We had a huge home price boom in the late 1990s, until the tech boom ended. People borrowed on interest-only and adjustable rate mortgages, and didn't have to prove their incomes. People bought with nothing down. Five years after the boom, anyone waiting for a real estate crash is still waiting. True, we've had some foreclosures, some due to bad lending, more to job losses. Prices have been flat for five years, just as they should be after a boom. But even though Boulder has been on the lists of the overpriced housing markets, there's no blown bubble here. The bubbleologists shout that low interest rates and crazy mortgages have fueled even crazier speculation. That easy money has doubled home prices and over-extended buyers. That's not what I've observed. I've never seen a family buy a home they knew they couldn't afford just because they thought the price would go up. Invest in a home, and even if you're wrong about prices, you get to live in it. MONTAGNE: With these new numbers out we returned to Lou Barnes to find out if he stands by his original analysis. Mr. BARNES: The Colorado foreclosure numbers are misleading in two ways. First, the absolute numbers are small relative to the Colorado market. They stand out only in comparison with the record low foreclosure rates nationwide. Second, our foreclosures are concentrated in the northeast of Denver, where's there's been a new and excessive subdivision of land. That excess of buildable land is suppressing appreciation rates across the Denver area. But the housing market this spring, statewide, is probably the best in five years. Nothing fancy. We've been in the top five states in employment growth for the last two years. We have the benefits of marked-down rents, now that technology bubble's blown, and we're getting a renewed flow of people into the state. We feel the headwind of rising interest rates and after-effects of some foolish lending and borrowing, but there is no housing bubble blowing here. Fannie Mae's regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, says that Colorado homes appreciated six percent in 2005, and the Denver area gained four and a half percent. Not great, but not a foreclosure crash either. MONTAGNE: Commentator Lou Barnes writes a weekly newsletter called Mortgage Credit News.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  On Fridays, the business segment focuses on your money.  Today, foreclosures.  Colorado posted the highest ratio of foreclosures in the country last month. The online provider of such information, RealtyTrac, reports the foreclosure rate in Colorado rose to three times the national average.  Of course, Colorado may or may not be a forecaster of the national housing market. Last summer, on this program, mortgage banker Lou Barnes considered this very question.

Few seek out the poor and attempt to help them pull out of poverty. This week, the University of Southern California assembled hundreds of bankers and bright-eyed MBA students to talk about what's called microfinancing. From member station KPCC, here in Los Angeles, Rachel Myrow reports. RACHEL MYROW reporting: The classic example of a microfinancing project in the developing world is the cell phone lady. Lend her enough money to buy a cell phone and she can sell the minutes to individual callers. Pretty soon, she'll be buying a house and sending her kids to college. Muhammad Yunus knows all about it. He's managing director of the Grameen(ph) Bank in Bangladesh, which lends to about 200,000 cell phone ladies. Recently, Yunus found himself addressing the children of those micro entrepreneurs. Mr. MUHAMMAD YUNUS (Managing Director, Grameen Bank, Bangladesh): Every morning when you get up, you repeat that: I shall never ask for a job from anybody. I will create jobs. So some students asked me, How do we do that, we don't know. I said, If you don't know how to do that, ask your mother. MYROW: These days microfinance has expanded to include everything from insurance to student loans and home loans. Christina Barrineau, of the United Nations Capital Development Fund Savings, asked the well-heeled audience to imagine life without access to financial services. Ms. CHRISTINA BARRINEAU (Chief Technical Advisor, United Nations Capital Development Fund Savings): What would your life be like if you didn't have a credit card, if you didn't have a bank account, if you had to walk for miles and miles to deposit a few dollars into a savings account and never know whether or not those savings were safe at the end of the day or whether they might be taken by the government or taken by somebody else. MYROW: It's not just a problem in developing countries. Hurricane Katrina, to name just one example, exposed a large domestic population without bank accounts, credit cards or insurance.

Mr. JOHN BRYANT (Founder and Chairman, Operation Hope): So we invite you in. We pull your credit report. We all have a nice laugh. And we then back into a loan approval through alternative documentation, copies of your utility bills, copies of rent statements, copies of phone bills. . . MYROW: Bryant says in 14 years of facilitating home mortgages, not one borrower has defaulted. Operation Hope eventually sold the institution to three commercial banks. John Bryant says the next big microfinancing opportunity in the U. S. will likely be remittances from immigrants back to the home country. Mr. BRYANT: The growing Latino market in the U. S. is going to force the banking industry to innovate. And I believe it will look in some ways like microfinances. The model is not completely, as you know, transferable, but I think it'll address their needs. No different than, again, the Democratization of credit. They're in business to make money. It's too big a market to ignore. MYROW: The Democratization of credit, he notes, has a long history in the U. S. Back in 1904, when immigrants and small borrowers weren't considered worth the attention of traditional banks, a small start-up called The Bank of Italy began serving that market. After the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, the market for small business loans took off as merchants struggled to rebuild following the disaster.

They will give more influence to China, South Korea and other rapidly growing economies. NPR's Adam Davidson has been following the meetings this weekend and joins us in the studio now. Hello, Adam. ADAM DAVIDSON reporting: Hey, Deb. ELLIOTT: Tell us what happened. DAVIDSON: Well, basically, these rapidly growing countries, like China and South Korea and others, have said enough is enough. They say that the way that the IMF and therefore much of the world economy is governed is locked into the balance of power that existed in the '70s and they say it does not reflect he fact that so many countries since then have become wealthy.  So they said, look, you need to include us in the decision making process. We need to have a lot more power than we do now, and the rest of the world, where basically the wealthy world agreed and said, okay, we're gonna give you power. ELLIOTT: So how will the power be shared and what will the U. S. lose? Mr. DAVIDSON: That's the big question. They've agreed in principle that power does need to be shared more equitably among the world's economic powers but they haven't agreed exactly how, and what we can be sure of is over the next coming months there will be a lot of very contentious behind the scenes battles where people will be hashing out the voting structure of the IMF.  Basically the U. S. likes its position as dominant player in the global economy and they do not want to give up power. There are strong domestic pressures on this presidential administration but on any presidential administration to have influence over China, to have influence over other countries that affect our economy, and the people in the U. S. government who oversee economic matters, they do not want to give up the power they have.  ELLIOTT: Can you just remind us what it is that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank do? DAVIDSON: Sure. They were founded just after World War II by the big European and American powers to help stabilize the world and bring the world out of poverty. The World Bank specifically gives money, mostly in the form of loans, to poor countries to bring people out of poverty. That's at least in theory. The IMF is more there as sort of an economic policeman. They do loan money but with the purpose of stabilizing the global economy so that there aren't massive discrepancies between countries. ELLIOTT: Now, why would the U. S. or the U. S. representatives in the IMF and other rich countries, why would they agree to give up power? DAVIDSON: Basically they have recognized that the IMF is in a fight for its life. It's not going to go out existence tomorrow or a month from now, but over the coming years if the IMF doesn't respond to these profound concerns of the poor and developing world, there is going to be no reason for the IMF and that means there is not going to be an IMF.  ELLIOTT: Now, even if the U. S. gives up power in the context of this organization, doesn't it remain a dominant force in the world's economy? DAVIDSON:\tOh, there's no question that for most likely the coming decades, the U. S. will be the dominant force. The head of the IMF said that what has changed here is that no longer will seven men be able to sit in the hotel room somewhere and decide how the world economy works. They're going to have to pay attention to lots of other voices, even if the loudest voice will continue to be the U. S. ELLIOTT: NPR's Adam Davidson thank you. DAVIDSON: Thank you.

One proposal from the president: temporarily suspend deposits into the nation's strategic petroleum reserve. MARKETPLACE'S John Dimsdale is in Washington. John, how much oil goes into the strategic petroleum reserve on a daily basis? So, how much is going to be freed by this? JOHN DIMSDALE reporting: Not a whole lot. The Energy Department estimates that between now and this fall, which is when the temporary suspension will end, it'll make available an extra 2. 1 million barrels. Now, to put that in perspective, the U. S. , as a country, burns about 21 million barrels a day. Of that, 12 million are imported. But as the president said, every little bit helps, and oil analyst Mary Novak at Global Insight says the main idea here is to have a psychological effect on oil markets. Ms. MARY NOVAK (Oil Analyst): As part of our fair share of the global burden, one thing we're going to do is put on hold our desire for a larger inventory. But it's such a small amount, that it's principle effect is to try to calm the market, rather than physically being enough to actually make prices move substantially in and of itself. CHADWICK: So John, it sounds as though she's saying, this is a symbolic move. DIMSDALE: It is, especially when you consider that the real bottleneck right now is in the refining level. It's not the crude oil level. There's plenty of crude. It's--refiners have been caught in this shift of additives to make fuel cleaner, and that requires them to shut down their production and clean out the old fuel before they can start producing and distributing the new blend. CHADWICK: Well, what do you think? Are consumers going to see a difference in the price they pay for gasoline as a result of what Mr. Bush said today? DIMSDALE: From this particular change, they're not going to see much. And if they do, it's going to take a while to work through the system from crude oil to refineries, and before it shows up at the pump. And it could easily be hidden in other changes that will happen in the market. CHADWICK: But the president made a point of saying this, I mean, he must've had something in mind. DIMSDALE: Well, from a financial management perspective, suspending the deposits right now isn't such a bad idea, because you're not going to be paying top-dollar for oil that's going to be set aside. Ideally, you want to buy when the price is low. And chances are you're going to be releasing it when it's very expensive. It's like buying a stock. You want to buy low and sell high, especially from a taxpayer perspective. It--the (unintelligible), the strategic petroleum reserve was opened up after Hurricane Katrina with some success.

Today, one state's efforts to boost worker pay. (Soundbite of music) Michigan this fall will become the 17th state to raise its minimum wage to a rate higher than the $5. 15 mandated by the federal government. Low wage earners are not the only ones who stand to benefit. Some highly paid workers could be in for what some say is an unintended boost in their pay, and this development has some businesses in Michigan up in arms. Michigan Public Radio's Rick Pluta reports. Mr. RICK PLUTA (Reporter, Michigan Public Radio): Michigan's new wage law will change how federal rules affect overtime pay. Several categories of workers, who are now exempt from overtime pay, will be eligible for time-and-a-half, after putting in 40 hours in a week. These include people who work odd or fractured shifts, such as truck drivers and live-in nannies. They also include some highly paid professionals who charge by the hour, and salespeople who work on commissions. And that has Leo Jerome hopping mad. Jerome owns three car dealerships in mid-Michigan, and his salespeople work six days a week. Their pay is a combination of salary plus commissions, and Jerome says he can't afford time-and-a-half one day a week for everyone. Mr. LEO JEROME (Chairman and CEO, Jerome Enterprises): I suppose if we have to limit the hours that our people can do it, because if you have to pay time-and-a-half, I can't do it. Mr. PLUTA: Jerome says he'll be less likely to keep marginal performers who would otherwise be given more chances, and less likely to hire new, young salespeople who don't sell as many cars and trucks. Six days a week, Jeff Sears(ph) wanders through rows of shiny new Chryslers and Jeeps, looking to turn browsers into buyers. He spots a young couple eyeing minivans. Mr. JEFF SEARS: Hi folks. How are you today? Unidentified Woman: Okay. How are you? Mr. SEARS: You need some assistance? Unidentified Man: (unintelligible) for a minivan. Mr. SEARS: My name's Jeff Sears. . . Mr. PLUTA: Sears is a top performer at his lot, typically selling three cars a week. But it's been a little slow lately, and Sears says from day to day he never knows when he's going to make a sale. He says reduced hours on the lot would probably cost him money. He says salespeople could learn to be more efficient, finding other ways to cultivate prospects, such as letters and phone calls. But Sears doesn't think he would sell as many cars. Mr. SEARS: It could absolutely result in lost sales. When you're not here, you can't sell. Mr. PLUTA: Some Democratic politicians and labor leaders in the state say there are plenty of people who will benefit from the new time-and-a-half rule. Michigan's Governor, Jennifer Granholm, says she's comfortable with her decision to sign the minimum wage hike. Governor JENNIFER GRANHOLM (Democrat, Michigan): Believe me, this was all considered. If there needs to be any adjustments going forward, we can do that. But the bottom line is Michigan got a raise. Mr. PLUTA: In fact, Democrats say that Republicans in the Michigan legislature never really wanted to pass a higher minimum wage law. Congress has not raised the federal minimum wage since 1997. So labor organizations have been mounting a nationwide campaign to boost the minimum wage, state-by-state. In Michigan, labor unions and Democrats launched a petition drive to get a minimum wage increase on the November ballot. Once it became evident the drive was going to succeed, Republicans decided to get in front of the issue by passing their own minimum wage increase. But Wendy Hofmeyer, of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, says Republicans got too far in front, and created this unintended consequence. Ms. WENDY HOFMEYER (Director of Health Policy and Human Resources, Michigan Chamber of Commerce): There are going to be real-world implications if this actually were to go into effect on October 1, and we want to make sure that we're protecting those jobs. Mr. PLUTA: But Democrats say Republicans should live with the law they passed. And some Republicans are reluctant to reopen the debate over the minimum wage law with elections drawing near. They say businesses may have to just pay those workers overtime, at least until after the November elections. For NPR News, this is Rick Pluta, in Lansing, Michigan.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  On Wednesdays, we look at the workplace. Today, one state's efforts to boost worker pay.  (Soundbite of music)  Michigan this fall will become the 17th state to raise its minimum wage to a rate higher than the $5. 15 mandated by the federal government.  Low wage earners are not the only ones who stand to benefit. Some highly paid workers could be in for what some say is an unintended boost in their pay, and this development has some businesses in Michigan up in arms.  Michigan Public Radio's Rick Pluta reports.  Mr. RICK PLUTA (Reporter, Michigan Public Radio): Michigan's new wage law will change how federal rules affect overtime pay. Several categories of workers, who are now exempt from overtime pay, will be eligible for time-and-a-half, after putting in 40 hours in a week.  These include people who work odd or fractured shifts, such as truck drivers and live-in nannies. They also include some highly paid professionals who charge by the hour, and salespeople who work on commissions. And that has Leo Jerome hopping mad.  Jerome owns three car dealerships in mid-Michigan, and his salespeople work six days a week. Their pay is a combination of salary plus commissions, and Jerome says he can't afford time-and-a-half one day a week for everyone.  Mr. LEO JEROME (Chairman and CEO, Jerome Enterprises): I suppose if we have to limit the hours that our people can do it, because if you have to pay time-and-a-half, I can't do it.  Mr. PLUTA: Jerome says he'll be less likely to keep marginal performers who would otherwise be given more chances, and less likely to hire new, young salespeople who don't sell as many cars and trucks.  Six days a week, Jeff Sears(ph) wanders through rows of shiny new Chryslers and Jeeps, looking to turn browsers into buyers. He spots a young couple eyeing minivans.  Mr. JEFF SEARS: Hi folks. How are you today?  Unidentified Woman: Okay. How are you?  Mr. SEARS: You need some assistance?  Unidentified Man: (unintelligible) for a minivan.  Mr. SEARS: My name's Jeff Sears. . .  Mr. PLUTA: Sears is a top performer at his lot, typically selling three cars a week. But it's been a little slow lately, and Sears says from day to day he never knows when he's going to make a sale. He says reduced hours on the lot would probably cost him money. He says salespeople could learn to be more efficient, finding other ways to cultivate prospects, such as letters and phone calls. But Sears doesn't think he would sell as many cars.  Mr. SEARS: It could absolutely result in lost sales. When you're not here, you can't sell.  Mr. PLUTA: Some Democratic politicians and labor leaders in the state say there are plenty of people who will benefit from the new time-and-a-half rule. Michigan's Governor, Jennifer Granholm, says she's comfortable with her decision to sign the minimum wage hike.  Governor JENNIFER GRANHOLM (Democrat, Michigan): Believe me, this was all considered. If there needs to be any adjustments going forward, we can do that. But the bottom line is Michigan got a raise.  Mr. PLUTA: In fact, Democrats say that Republicans in the Michigan legislature never really wanted to pass a higher minimum wage law. Congress has not raised the federal minimum wage since 1997. So labor organizations have been mounting a nationwide campaign to boost the minimum wage, state-by-state.  In Michigan, labor unions and Democrats launched a petition drive to get a minimum wage increase on the November ballot. Once it became evident the drive was going to succeed, Republicans decided to get in front of the issue by passing their own minimum wage increase.  But Wendy Hofmeyer, of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, says Republicans got too far in front, and created this unintended consequence.  Ms. WENDY HOFMEYER (Director of Health Policy and Human Resources, Michigan Chamber of Commerce): There are going to be real-world implications if this actually were to go into effect on October 1, and we want to make sure that we're protecting those jobs.  Mr. PLUTA: But Democrats say Republicans should live with the law they passed. And some Republicans are reluctant to reopen the debate over the minimum wage law with elections drawing near.

A lot of people are worried about rising oil prices, and that include Federal Reserve Chief Ben Bernanke. In testimony on Capitol Hill today, Bernanke said high oil prices could cause inflation, and that could mean he'd have to take action and raise interest rates. Bob Moon of Marketplace's New York bureau is here now. And, Bob, what exactly is Bernanke worried about? BOB MOON reporting: Well, Madeleine, of course, they've been raising interest rates at the Federal Reserve, but Wall Street has been interested in seeing a pause, at least, in those interest rates hike. The big concern is what these rising oil prices could do to fuel inflation, which is the main reason the fed's been steadily raising those rates for the past several months now--to keep inflation in check. So whether the fed needs to keep raising interest rates could end--end up depending a lot on what happens to these energy prices. And Bernanke was testifying today before Congress' Joint Economic Committee and he was doing a little verbal head scratching about what rising energy prices might mean to inflation, specifically, but also to the economy, in general. Mr. BENJAMIN BERNANKE (Chairman, Federal Reserve): On the one hand, they directly affect the cost of living, inflation. On the other hand, by taking purchasing power away from consumers, they tend to slow economic activity and so it does produce a difficult problem. MOON: Now, that dilemma means that the fed's future course on boosting interest rates is uncertain, at the moment. Bernanke did hint that the fed might be ready to pause, at some point, to figure this all out. But at the same time, he was telling the lawmakers that vigilance, in regard to inflation, is really essential to keep the economy healthy. BRAND: And did he say, specifically, what circumstances would have to arise to cause the central bank to raise interest rates some more? MOON: Well, as I mentioned, he did offer that his strongest hint that the rates might be coming down, or at least they might pause the interest rate hikes for a while, at least long enough to get a better handle on what these rising energy prices mean to the economy. But listen to this, at the same time he's keeping his options open on picking things up again if the money policymakers decide that more action's needed. (Soundbite of Federal Reserve Chairman's testimony) Mr. BERNANKE: Of course, a decision to take no action in a particular meeting does not preclude actions at subsequent meetings. And the committee will not hesitate to act when it determines that doing so is needed to foster the achievement of the Federal Reserve's mandated objectives. MOON: Well, Wall Street reads that to mean that the fed chairman wants to pause the interest rate increases, and that investors will be getting a break from those. Stocks rose today; the dollar fell as Bernanke was testifying before the Joint Economic Committee. BRAND: And tell us a little bit about his style. How does it differ from his predecessor Alan Greenspan? MOON: Well he has indicated that he wants to be a little sharper, a little clearer in tone on the fed's course on this. The problem is, according to one analyst who was quoted this morning, the overall tone is really decided by the fed's crystal ball and that's not very clear right now. We'll be taking a closer look at this today in the Marketplace newsroom. BRAND: Bob Moon, thank you. Bob Moon of public radio's daily business show, Marketplace.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. The U. S. economy staged an impressive comeback during the first three months of the year. The Commerce Department said today the economy grew at an annual rate of 4. 8 percent in the first quarter, more than twice as fast as it grew in the quarter before that. The strong growth occurred despite the rise in energy prices. As NPR's Jim Zarolli reports, some economists caution that the numbers are something of an aberration. JIM ZAROLLI reporting: Almost as soon as the numbers were released, President Bush was trumpeting the good news. At a morning press conference in the Rose Garden, the president noted that it was the steepest one quarter gain in growth since 2003. President GEORGE W. BUSH: This rapid growth is another sign that our economy is on the fast track. ZAROLLI: As he often does, President Bush used the release of the numbers to make the case that Congress should keep in place the tax cuts that it's passed. President BUSH: This good news cannot be taken for granted. With gas prices on the minds of Americans, we need to keep our foot on the pedal of this strong economy. ZAROLLI: Some economists said the numbers were not quite as good as they seemed. They noted that growth slowed sharply during the last three months of 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. John Lonski is senior economist at Moody's Investor Service. Mr. JOHN LONSKI (Senior Economist, Moody's Investor Service): The primary reason why first quarter growth was so steep from the previous quarter was because the final quarter of 2005 was so low. ZAROLLI: And LonSKI says that given higher interest rates and energy prices, it's highly unlikely that growth will be as strong throughout the rest of the year. But he says there's no denying that the economy has held up well. Today's report said consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 5. 5 percent. It was barely one percent the quarter before. Business investment boomed. Lou DiNardo, president of the semiconductor company Intersil, says business surged during the past three months. Mr. LOU DINARDO (President, Intersil): I think overall it's very positive. The customer base feels strong, feels very positive about 2006. ZAROLLI: DiNardo says he hears little about rising energy prices from his customers, and that's something that surprises him. Mr. DINARDO: What it really boils down to is that everyone understands that this will be something that we absorb as an economy. ZAROLLI: But some economists noted that much of the recent increase in the energy prices came in April, too late to be included in the first quarter statistics. So the impact of high gas and oil prices isn't yet reflected in the numbers. The report this morning also indicated that despite strong growth, inflation pressures remain largely benign and the employment cost index, which measures benefits and salaries, also slowed. Economist John Lonski says in one sense that's encouraging. Mr. LONSKI: The latest slowing improves the inflation outlook and makes it all the more likely that the federal reserve will at least temporarily halt its current series of interest rate hikes fairly soon. ZAROLLI: But Lonski says the numbers also suggest that worker pay isn't rising as fast as it did, and with the current high energy prices, people will have less money to spend over the next few months than they had last quarter. Any drop in consumer spending can only hurt growth, and that means it could be some time before the economy grows quite as fast as it did during the first three months of this year.

There are those troubling gas prices but overall the national economy looks very good. For the first quarter of 2006, the country's gross domestic product grew by 4. 8 percent; that's the strongest rate in more than two years. Marketplace's New York Bureau Chief, Bob Moon, joins us. Bob, this economic growth spurt, is it going to be enough to get the country past these energy costs? BOB MOON (Bureau Chief, New York Marketplace): Well Alex, it doesn't hurt to have the economy turning in such a robust performance heading into the latest rise in oil and gasoline prices. In a way, you can liken this to a patient who has a sudden health crisis. The prognosis is going to be a lot better if they were in good shape to begin with. And the economy is much the same in being able to shake off some of the ill effects that these rising energy costs are causing. So let's take a look at the patient's medical chart, if you will.  In the first three months of this year, as you mentioned, the Commerce Department reports a 4. 8 percent increase. That amounts to the country's economic strength. Compare that to the final quarter of last year; this latest reading is more than twice the 1. 7 percent rate at the end of 2005. Even better, this growing strength seems to be spread across the entire economy. These latest figures show consumers, businesses and government all contributing to the robust spending and that is helping to spur this healthy economy. CHADWICK: Well, it's a lot of good news but I wonder about inflation. Mr. MOON: Well, that's always a concern, of course. The Labor Department though is out with a separate report today. It measures what employers pay in wages and benefits. Those payroll costs actually rose at the slowest pace in seven years during the first quarter of this year. So that should ease any concerns about potential wage-induced inflation.  The Economic Policy Institute issued its own report this morning and it suggested this disparity reflects a Jekyll and Hyde economy because while the overall growth rate looks good, wage increases for American workers are still well below the inflation rate. And the group says that the overall economy may be doing fine but somehow that's not helping the workers who are helping to build the economy. CHADWICK: And when you put the workers into the mix here, how are consumers overall feeling about the economy these days? Mr. MOON: Well, this is a day that we get quite a few economic reports so I can point to a new survey on consumer confidence to give you an answer on that. The University of Michigan is out with a wrap-up on consumer sentiment for April. Reuters' reports that prescription-only survey was down from March, apparently reflecting this souring mood about energy costs. On the other hand, consumer sentiment does remain relatively high, so there is some wiggle room if you will.

As though the world's energy markets are not in enough turmoil, Bolivia is nationalizing that country's natural gas resources, and it has a lot of them--second largest in South America. This is a campaign pledge from Bolivian president, Evo Morales. John Dimsdale joins us from MARKETPLACE. John, how many companies own, well, own positions down there in Bolivia natural gas? JOHN DIMSDALE reporting: There are 25 foreign gas companies with about $3. 5 billion in investments. Not many U. S. companies, ExxonMobil has a stake in one field, but the bigger gas companies in Bolivia are from Brazil, Britain, France, and Spain. Now, Bolivian gas is used almost exclusively in the region itself, in the neighboring countries. Natural gas isn't as portable as oil. It's not as easy to transport. So this nationalization shouldn't have too much impact on supplies for global markets, but it's an important energy supply locally, and Bolivia's not kicking the companies out of the country. They're going to have to renegotiate their contracts with these new restrictions that keep them from earning profits, except on about 18 percent of the country's gas resources. CHADWICK: But President Morales has actually ordered the Bolivian army to surround more than 50 of these gas installations so that he can enforce his will there. Maybe these foreign companies are just going to say, to heck with it, and walk away from their investments in Bolivia. DIMSDALE: You know, so far, they're being pretty cautious in their response, but that's kind of unlikely just because the business is so profitable right now: high demand, high prices these days. It means companies will probably want to stay, and Bolivia needs them to stay. The government can't run the gas fields by themselves, so it's a risk for the country to seize these assets. Bolivia probably wouldn't or couldn't make a move like this if global prices were lower, because the companies would say, you know, this just isn't worth our staying in a nationalized market. CHADWICK: And it's a situation that they increasingly face throughout South America, isn't it? This is part of a trend, perhaps--more state control. DIMSDALE: Boy, that's for sure. Venezuela's already moved to take over much of its oil industry. Ecuador's considering a law to limit the profits that foreign oil companies take out of the country. A Peruvian presidential candidate is campaigning for nationalized, that country's oil and mining industries. There are left-leaning governments now in Brazil, Argentina, Chile--all have come to power to some extent because they opposed the industrialized world's exploitation of their resources. Just over the weekend, the presidents of Bolivia, Venezuela, and Cuba were in Havana, putting together a new trade block which they call a counter-weight to U. S. dominance. So none of this is a welcome sign for private, foreign investors in Latin America. Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, we'll find out why a wave of laptop thefts has created an identity theft crisis for corporate America. CHADWICK: Thank you, John.

It means companies will probably want to stay, and Bolivia needs them to stay. The government can't run the gas fields by themselves, so it's a risk for the country to seize these assets. Bolivia probably wouldn't or couldn't make a move like this if global prices were lower, because the companies would say, you know, this just isn't worth our staying in a nationalized market.  CHADWICK: And it's a situation that they increasingly face throughout South America, isn't it? This is part of a trend, perhaps--more state control.  DIMSDALE: Boy, that's for sure. Venezuela's already moved to take over much of its oil industry. Ecuador's considering a law to limit the profits that foreign oil companies take out of the country. A Peruvian presidential candidate is campaigning for nationalized, that country's oil and mining industries. There are left-leaning governments now in Brazil, Argentina, Chile--all have come to power to some extent because they opposed the industrialized world's exploitation of their resources.  Just over the weekend, the presidents of Bolivia, Venezuela, and Cuba were in Havana, putting together a new trade block which they call a counter-weight to U. S. dominance. So none of this is a welcome sign for private, foreign investors in Latin America.  Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, we'll find out why a wave of laptop thefts has created an identity theft crisis for corporate America.  CHADWICK: Thank you, John.

Oil prices dropped below $70 a barrel today; that's down from $75 earlier in the week. The reason--less driving. A federal report says the lower price may be because motorists are not filling up as much. Joining us is John Dimsdale from MARKETPLACE. And John, what is this evidence that we may be actually changing our driving habits? JOHN DIMSDALE reporting: Well, it's not a big change. Gas demand for the month of April, this year, was, essentially, the same as last April. And normally, you'd expect to see a one to one-and-a-half percent increase. So this flat demand is seen as an incremental slowdown in our use of gasoline. BRAND: Well, how does that compare--this demand for gas now, how does it compare with demand during past price--pricings? DIMSDALE: Well, for the last 30 years there's been a constant increase in gasoline use in the country, expect for two years: 1980 and 1981. Now, the drop in demand then was a response to the oil embargos from the Middle East. But it was really more than just the price spikes that were going on then. There were shortages of gas, which lead to long lines at the pumps. Plus, there was a downturn in the economy; recession has a way of lowering demand for gas. Doug McIntyre with the government's Energy Information Administration says in the early 80s, gas demand dropped a full 10 percent. Mr. DOUG McINTYRE (Senior Analyst, Energy Information Administration): To get to the massive declines that we saw in 1980 and 1981, you really need a change in lifestyle. In that case, it was a shift towards driving smaller cars or people moving closer to their jobs. BRAND: So, John, this time around, what kind of prices would there have to be to make people change their habits? DIMSDALE: Well, we still haven't reached the records that were set in 1980, at least on an inflation-adjusted level. Prices then hit a national average of $3. 12 a gallon. Lynn Westfall, who's the chief economist with the refining company Tesoro Petroleum, says it takes awhile before Americans dramatically change their driving habits. Mr. LYNN WESTFALL (Chief Economist, Tesoro Petroleum): It takes a three-year sustained price direction, either up or down, to get a noticeable change in driving patterns. If prices stay where they are this year, this will be the third year that we've higher than historical prices--if that happens, history would show you that you can see demand declines in the, oh, half the 3/4 percent level. BRAND: So, John, with that kind of drop in demand, will we see a drop in prices? DIMSDALE: Not necessarily, according to the experts. You know, this is a global market and demand in this country's only one influence on price. You have to consider demand in India and China. And plus, there's all the disruptions in supply in Nigeria and Iran, which might withhold its oil. So it'll take other international changes to get back to the good old days. We have a related story coming up on MARKETPLACE. We'll find out how much gas prices have to rise before ethanol becomes an economical alternative.

However, the public remains largely pessimistic.  And to explain the gap between public opinion and economic reality, we're joined by Juli Niemann.  She's an analyst with the investment firm Smith, Moore & Company in St. Louis, Missouri, and Juli Niemann, give us evidence of this rosy economy.  What's going on? Ms. JULI NIEMANN (Investment Analyst, Smith, Moore & Company):  Well, the favored expression among economists is the Goldilocks Economy.  We've had good jobs formation.  Unemployment is still at relatively record lows.  Consumer incomes are up.  Everything but confidence happens to be up.  The market is hitting new levels.  Everything really appears to be going very well for the economy at this point. BRAND: So what are consumers basing their lack of confidence on? Ms. NIEMANN:  Well, here's the big problem.  I think it really is a confidence situation going back to 2001 when we had 9/11 and going back to 2003 when we had fraud, greed, corruption, scandals, one after another.  Investors still have this sense of impending pain, so no matter how good the economic news comes along, they still have this sense that something is about to go wrong. BRAND:  And really, for a lot of people, things have gone wrong, at least at the gas pump. Ms. NIEMANN:  They have, but you know, when you look at it very realistically, it still, on an inflation adjusted basis, isn't nearly as high as it was 20 years ago when we had real economic pain from gasoline.  Right now it's a situation of where everybody thinks that they have the right to cheap gasoline, and we don't have that anymore, and we're not going to have that for the foreseeable future because of worldwide global demand.  So right now the hue and the cry is for to get gasoline prices down, but they're not coming down.  Only a recession would do that, and of course that's kind of a Draconian cure to it. BRAND:  But could that explain why people are feeling pessimistic about the economy? Ms. NIEMANN:  I think it's just one of many things, because even before we had the high gasoline prices last year, when they were relatively low, people were still kvetching about everything.  We didn't have a prolonged period of economic pain, really, when you look at it from 2000 to 2003, but the bear market really created that sense.  The economic decline during that time, it was a relatively mild recession, but there were just instances going on within the United States that really gave consumers and voters a sense of pain. BRAND:  When was the last time there was good, high consumer confidence?  What was going on? Ms. NIEMANN:  Oh, that was in the '90s.  The mid-to-late '90s, everything was firing on all cylinders, and optimism was unbelievably high. But even through 1999 it was always very apparent that we had a huge bubble going on within the tech area, but people were borrowing like crazy, buying stocks, and speculation really had hit the silly season.  So again, perception and reality typically don't match, and that's the situation right now. BRAND:  So people were feeling unnaturally confident then. Ms. NIEMANN:  Exactly, and now that we do have a very good economic environment, they're basically ignoring it, looking for the worst side of it.

Whereas chemical engineers have the highest starting salaries, fields like finance and computer science are also paying well.  Overall, hiring of recent graduates is up more than 14% this year.  That's the third consecutive year of double-digit growth, meaning that a recent student has a better chance for a job now than any time since the economic recession of 2001.  Hiring of new graduates fell by almost 25% that year. Katie Kwo(ph) is about to graduate from NYU, depending on she did on her debt financing final yesterday.  But Kwo's pretty confident.

Most economists expect to see continued job growth when April's employment numbers are released today. For the first three months of the year, the economy added jobs at a rate of around 200,000 a month. Still, many workers aren't yet seeing a big rise in their pay, as NPR's Jack Speer reports. JACK SPEER reporting: Talk to economists about why wages haven't gone up faster, and you'll get lots of explanations. Mr. JARED BERNSTEIN (Economic Policy Institute, Washington, D. C. ): There's not one smoking gun. It's more like murder on the Orient Express with a lot of different perpetrators. SPEER: That's Jared Bernstein, with the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based policy research firm. He says, while the economy grew at a strong 4. 8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, employee pay barely budged. Bernstein blames several factors: global competition, soaring energy prices, and rising benefit costs, for keeping the lid on employee wage growth. He says companies also haven't had to worry too much about finding workers. Mr. BERNSTEIN: This labor market has consistently been a buyer's market. Employers have been able to keep and sustain exactly the workforce they need. That's why we see profit rates soaring through the roof and wage rates falling behind inflation. SPEER: Wages did in fact fall behind inflation in the first quarter as soaring energy prices pushed inflation to an annual rate of more than 4 percent. Some economists, though, say that when you look at overall compensation--not just wages but also benefits--workers are doing better. Michael Kovach runs City Machine Technologies, an 80-employee firm that repairs and rebuilds heavy industrial machinery in Youngstown, Ohio. He says he'll probably have to increase wages eventually, but right now, competition is preventing him from raising his prices so he won't be boosting wages anytime soon. Mr. MICHAEL KOVACH (co-owner, City Machine Technologies): There's a lid to what we can afford to pay our people. Now we pay them very well, we're above the state average in all our categories. We're non-union, and our people have got a good benefit package. If you don't do that you won't keep people. SPEER: Kovach currently pays his employees $17 an hour, a figure he says rises to more than $24 an hour when benefits costs are factored in. And while he's held the line on wages, he says his overall compensation costs have risen sharply. Gail Lindley owns Denver Bookbinding Company. She's looking at ways to provide benefits for her 20 employees that don't cost a lot of money but are still meaningful for them. Ms. GAIL LINDLEY (President and CEO, Denver Bookbinding Company): Wages aren't everything. Flexibility for working mothers or single working mothers is really important. They want to be able to take off for their well-baby care, or mothers who breastfeed--that was a huge issue in Colorado to allow them that time to do that. SPEER: With the unemployment rate now under five percent, the labor market is tightening. In the past, that's led to higher wages. Economists will be searching the April jobs numbers out this morning for signs that wage growth is taking hold. Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  On Friday's our business report focuses on your money.  Most economists expect to see continued job growth when April's employment numbers are released today. For the first three months of the year, the economy added jobs at a rate of around 200,000 a month.  Still, many workers aren't yet seeing a big rise in their pay, as NPR's Jack Speer reports.  JACK SPEER reporting:  Talk to economists about why wages haven't gone up faster, and you'll get lots of explanations.  Mr. JARED BERNSTEIN (Economic Policy Institute, Washington, D. C. ): There's not one smoking gun. It's more like murder on the Orient Express with a lot of different perpetrators.  SPEER: That's Jared Bernstein, with the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based policy research firm.  He says, while the economy grew at a strong 4. 8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, employee pay barely budged. Bernstein blames several factors: global competition, soaring energy prices, and rising benefit costs, for keeping the lid on employee wage growth. He says companies also haven't had to worry too much about finding workers.  Mr. BERNSTEIN: This labor market has consistently been a buyer's market. Employers have been able to keep and sustain exactly the workforce they need. That's why we see profit rates soaring through the roof and wage rates falling behind inflation.  SPEER: Wages did in fact fall behind inflation in the first quarter as soaring energy prices pushed inflation to an annual rate of more than 4 percent. Some economists, though, say that when you look at overall compensation--not just wages but also benefits--workers are doing better.  Michael Kovach runs City Machine Technologies, an 80-employee firm that repairs and rebuilds heavy industrial machinery in Youngstown, Ohio. He says he'll probably have to increase wages eventually, but right now, competition is preventing him from raising his prices so he won't be boosting wages anytime soon.  Mr. MICHAEL KOVACH (co-owner, City Machine Technologies): There's a lid to what we can afford to pay our people. Now we pay them very well, we're above the state average in all our categories. We're non-union, and our people have got a good benefit package. If you don't do that you won't keep people.  SPEER: Kovach currently pays his employees $17 an hour, a figure he says rises to more than $24 an hour when benefits costs are factored in. And while he's held the line on wages, he says his overall compensation costs have risen sharply.  Gail Lindley owns Denver Bookbinding Company. She's looking at ways to provide benefits for her 20 employees that don't cost a lot of money but are still meaningful for them.  Ms. GAIL LINDLEY (President and CEO, Denver Bookbinding Company): Wages aren't everything. Flexibility for working mothers or single working mothers is really important. They want to be able to take off for their well-baby care, or mothers who breastfeed--that was a huge issue in Colorado to allow them that time to do that.  SPEER: With the unemployment rate now under five percent, the labor market is tightening. In the past, that's led to higher wages. Economists will be searching the April jobs numbers out this morning for signs that wage growth is taking hold.  Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.

In Alaska, the high cost of fuel can be a matter of life and death. Johanna Eurich of member station KDLG has this story about New Stuyahok, a small remote village in Southwestern Alaska, where the price of fuel has deadly consequences this winter.  JOHANNA EURICH reporting:  The space where the Gus(ph) family home stood is a chard square in the snow. New Stuyahok's Mayor Randy Hastings points out the spot right off the village's main street. Mayor RANDY HASTINGS (New Stuyahok, Alaska): It was kind of kitty-cornered behind the red house and straight behind this yellow and black house.  EURICH: Homes in New Stuyahok are tiny, wooden one-story cabins, clustered close, almost rubbing shoulders with one another. Fish or moose meat dry under some eaves, testament to lives spent hunting and fishing. The Russian Orthodox church sits near the river. It's the only church in this Yupik village. Unidentified Woman: Last (unintelligible) going back to (unintelligible). EURICH: The ubiquitous VHF radio squawks in practically every building, with residents chattering, keeping tabs on each other. That's how many heard a fire had started in the Gus family's cabin just after midnight on March 14th. A neighbor noticed the flames and put out the call. Mayor Randy Hastings, like the rest of the town, came running, grabbing home fire extinguishers and buckets. That's all they had. Mayor RANDY HASTINGS (New Stuyahok): We basically fought it with snow. One of the neighbors here, we started a bucket brigade using their water and were fighting it by hand. EURICH: Two men, longtime residents, died in the fire. New Stuyahok's fire truck stood in a garage within sight of the flames with its tanks drained of water to keep them from cracking in winter's subzero temperatures. The community can't afford to heat the village garage. The price of gasoline here is $4. 63 a gallon, heating fuel, $3. 80. Those high fuel prices also make it tough to get out of town. With no roads to New Stuyahok, residents use air taxis which have raised their fares 50 percent this winter to cover the higher cost of aviation gas. That's meant fewer trips to grocery stores in Dillingham, the hub community on this side of Bristol Bay. (Soundbite of cash register) Ms. BARBARA GUS (Village Store Manager): 11. 69. EURICH: The village store has seen more business, even though the increasing cost of shipping goods in has driven prices up. Store manager Barbara Gus says it's tough to get staples residents rely on to feed their families, but she's not talking about the products on her shelf. Ms. GUS: It's hard for people to go hunting 'cause we have to go so far to get that, the moose or caribou or whatever we eat, 'cause you go so much gallons going out and you'll have to get more to come back, just to return back home to bring that meat. EURICH: Look around these days. Most homes here have smoke coming out of their chimneys. (Soundbite of woodstove) Many people stoke woodstoves, including William Pavel(ph), manager of the village fuel business. Mr. WILLIAM PAVEL (Manager, Village Fuel Business): Couldn't afford to buy heating fuel so I've been burning wood. The guy that sells it couldn't afford to buy it. EURICH: New Stuyahok is not unique. It's story is repeated all over the state where village fuel prices have doubled the last two years. Some villages don't even have enough fuel to run their generators. For example, Venetie in the interior is rationing electricity, cranking up the generator for part of the weekday and going totally dark on weekends. The region around New Stuyahok makes its money fishing for salmon, but fish prices collapsed a few years ago. This economic pressure, combined with climbing fuel prices, is forcing many to move away to look for work. Those remaining behind have dug deep to help their neighbors. Evelyn Yanez(ph) in the Bristol Bay community of Togiak routinely cooks for 20 to help feed those less fortunate, and when her brother couldn't pay to heat his home, she paid. Ms. EVELYN YANEZ (Togiak Resident): He said they haven't had money to buy oil for a month so they didn't have heat in the kitchen, so I ended up giving him money to buy oil. It's hard to watch people suffering. EURICH: Yanez says people are routinely choosing between food and heat. Residents all over rural Alaska worry about the latest wave of price increases in the lower 48. As long as the rivers remain frozen and the fuel purchased back in the fall holds out, they'll continue to pay last fall's fuel prices. But when the ice breaks loose and the spring barge heads upriver, it'll leave behind a wave of even higher fuel prices. Many wonder if they can afford to continue living in these places they call home. For NPR News, I'm Johanna Eurich.  HOWARD BERKES, host:   Energy, of course, is on the minds of many Americans.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to its all-time high. It could set a new record soon. But a lot depends on whether the bankers at the Federal Reserve signal they are ready to take a break from raising interest rates. Marketplace New York Bureau Chief Bob Moon joins us. Bob, if the Dow does set a new record this week, it's possible this week, how significant is that? BOB MOON reporting: Well, Alex, it's just a number, of course; but it's a magic number--11,722 points. The Dow Industrial Average hasn't been that high since January of 2000. This is significant because the Dow is such a key index for Wall Street. It's a collection of the blue chip stocks, of course, IBM, Boeing, McDonald's, Home Depot, to name a few, so it could be an important psychological lift for investors. I saw one market strategist quoted in U. S. A. Today saying, there's a ton of mojo in the market right now. A lot of anticipation that the market is going to be able to shake off the downward pressures of soaring oil prices, geopolitical worries, and, of course, those interest rate increases from the Fed that investors have been so focused on lately. CHADWICK: Well, what are the signs from the Fed? MOON: Well, this could be the deciding factor here of whether the Dow can break this historic high. And it's one of the reasons that the markets have been so volatile lately. Wall Street seems to be confused about the signals coming out of the Fed. The money policymakers at the Federal Reserve meet again this week. The consensus on Wall Street, right now, is that the central bankers are all but certain to notch up interest rates another quarter percentage point on Wednesday. That would be the 16th straight increase in the past couple of years. And it would bring the rates that the Fed charges banks to an even five percent. Now, as I say, that seems to be a foregone conclusion. What Wall Street will be listening very closely to is the statement that comes along with the Fed action. The big question is, will they reiterate what Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested in testimony on Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, that the Fed could be leaning toward at least a pause in the rate tightening while it gets better handle on how the economy is doing, just how serious the threat of inflation might be. That's the whole reason for the steady lifting of the interest rates, to keep those inflationary pressures down. CHADWICK: Okay, so what happens if they do not get that signal? MOON: Well, then you can almost surely kiss goodbye any prospect that the Dow will set this new record that we've been talking about. That would put investors right back where they started, really scratching their heads. And, of course, we all know that Wall Street hates uncertainty, so we'll just have to be watching what the Fed policymakers will be doing later this week. That will really be the key here.

The Fed raised its key short-term interest rate by a quarter point to 5%. That much we can take on face value. After that, it's all about whether the Fed indicated or signaled or perhaps suggested that it might now be ready to take a break and leave rates alone. Many fed watchers say that's exactly what the Fed did. Others read the Fed's statement differently. NPR's Jack Speer is with us to explain all this. Jack, help us sort all this out. More rate hikes or a hiatus. What did the Fed actually say? JACK SPEER: Yeah, right. Take your pick, Michele. I mean, the Fed basically left the door open wide enough to drive a truck through here today. I mean, what Fed policymakers said at the conclusion of this meeting here in Washington today in essence was that, you know, if there's a need for further interest rate hikes in the months ahead, we're ready to do that. If the data tells us otherwise, then we're ready to back off. But you can sort of take your pick here. Wall Street and the financial markets obviously were really, really hoping they would get a much clearer, more definitive statement from the Fed, something along the lines of, you know, we're more likely to pause or a pause is expected. They didn't hear anything like that today and, as you mentioned, Wall Street was basically flat. NORRIS: So they're keeping their options open, and they've raised the rate by a quarter point. Consumers will immediately see some of that, right? SPEER: Oh, absolutely. I mean, the big banks were all raising their prime lending rates immediately after the Fed's announcement. The prime rate, in fact, went up today to 8%. That's its highest level in quite awhile and of course that raises borrowing costs for lots of, millions of consumers. People who have credit cards tied to the prime rate. Home equity lines will start ticking higher. Lots of people with adjustable rate mortgages are going to be seeing the increase of the rate hikes a little further out. And a lot of this is already underway and will continue as a result of today's rate hike. NORRIS: Now this is the 16th straight rate hike, but only the second since the new Fed chairman took over. How do people think he's doing so far and is it hard to read this, because he's so new that they can't quite sort of interpret his move? SPEER: Well I think people are giving Ben Bernanke, and he's the new Fed chairman, as you mentioned, a fair bit of slack at the moment. I mean, this is the second rate hike that's occurred under Ben Bernanke and as you mentioned, it's the 16th straight rate hike we've had from the Federal Reserve. You know, I think people generally give him high marks with a few caveats here. I think there have been a couple of stumbles that have been somewhat publicized, some miscommunications perhaps with the public and the markets. People maybe were looking for slightly clearer signals from Mr. Bernanke. You know, Mr. Greenspan was known for being somewhat obtuse at times and I think people thought maybe Ben Bernanke would be a little clearer, communicate a little bit better. As I mentioned, two weeks ago before the Congress, he had some remarks that indicated the Fed might pause in rate increases even if there were some signs of inflation out there. And he sort of came back and clarified his comments a little bit after that, saying that a pause doesn't necessarily mean a halt. In other words, the Fed could decide to pause and then raise interest rates later on down the road if conditions warranted it. But basically, I think people are giving Mr. Bernanke fairly high marks and kind of taking a wait-and-see approach to his tenure at the Fed. NORRIS: Jack, just quickly before we let you go, I'd like to ask you about gold. It's going for more than $700 an ounce now, the highest level in 25 years. What's going on? SPEER: Yeah, gold closed today in New York at $703 an ounce. Precious metal prices have been rallying and really don't seem to be showing any signs of slowing down here. It's in response to a weaker dollar, global uncertainties and inflation worries. And you know it's a hard thing to figure out with the stock market poised to hit a new high, what's behind this rally in gold, Michele. NORRIS: Thank you, Jack. SPEER: You're welcome.

The Federal Reserve's move to raise short-term interest rates by another quarter point yesterday is already rippling through the economy. Major banks followed the Fed's announcement by boosting their prime lending rates, something that will affect millions of consumers with loans tied to that rate. Jack Speer, NPR's Jack Speer, reports. JACK SPEER reporting: The Federal Reserve Board meeting in Washington didn't necessarily open the door to additional interest rate increases, but neither did it slam it shut. Meaning, in the near term, the cost of money just went up. Robert Perry is the former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He says the economy is feeling the effects of a string of interest rate hikes from the Fed over the past 23 months. Mr. ROBERT PERRY (Former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco): We have seen interest rates move up 16 times. We've seen long-term rates move up as well. And that should take a toll in certain sectors of the economy leading to slower growth. SPEER: It's that slowdown in growth, partly due to an expected falloff in consumer spending and a gradual cooling of the housing market the Fed is counting on to indicate when its time to stop raising rates. Perry says in terms of housing, the slowdown is already underway. Mr. PERRY: I don't think there's any reason to be concerned that there'll be a sharp slowdown in the housing sector, but it's certainly not going to be one of the star performers of the economy over the next year or so. SPEER: Along with a gradual slowdown in housing, the Fed's decision to raise interest rates will immediately mean higher borrowing costs for with those with home equity lines or credit cards tied to the prime rate. Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:   Our business news begins with a hike in interest rates.  The Federal Reserve's move to raise short-term interest rates by another quarter point yesterday is already rippling through the economy. Major banks followed the Fed's announcement by boosting their prime lending rates, something that will affect millions of consumers with loans tied to that rate.  Jack Speer, NPR's Jack Speer, reports.  JACK SPEER reporting:  The Federal Reserve Board meeting in Washington didn't necessarily open the door to additional interest rate increases, but neither did it slam it shut. Meaning, in the near term, the cost of money just went up.  Robert Perry is the former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He says the economy is feeling the effects of a string of interest rate hikes from the Fed over the past 23 months.  Mr. ROBERT PERRY (Former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco): We have seen interest rates move up 16 times. We've seen long-term rates move up as well. And that should take a toll in certain sectors of the economy leading to slower growth.  SPEER: It's that slowdown in growth, partly due to an expected falloff in consumer spending and a gradual cooling of the housing market the Fed is counting on to indicate when its time to stop raising rates. Perry says in terms of housing, the slowdown is already underway.  Mr. PERRY: I don't think there's any reason to be concerned that there'll be a sharp slowdown in the housing sector, but it's certainly not going to be one of the star performers of the economy over the next year or so.

WENDY KAUFMAN reporting: Prodded in part by a Congressional oversight committee and consumer advocates, the IRS began investigating dozens of credit-counseling agencies two years ago. What the agency found was extremely troubling. IRS commissioner Mark Everson. Mr. MARK EVERSON (IRS Commissioner): Some of these organizations, most of these large organizations have not been operating for the public good and they don't deserve tax-exempt status. They have actually poisoned an entire sector of a charitable community. I don't say this lightly, but the organizations have been offering little or no counseling or education to individuals and they appear to be primarily motivated by profit. KAUFMAN: Everson says in many instances, the companies were organized just to funnel business to related for-profit companies. Many of these firms spend millions of dollars on commercials urging anyone with debt to call them to solve their financial woes. What's more, says IRS commissioner Everson, because tax-exempt organizations are not bound by the Do Not Call list, the firms were able to telephone consumers and pitch their services under the guise of a non-profit counseling service. Mr. EVERSON: The insidious thing here was that individuals were sucking people in and then basically channeling them to profit-making businesses to pedal debt management plans. KAUFMAN: Which often came with high fees and costs. Legitimate counseling agencies, which are often funded at least in part by creditors, operate differently. Trained counselors provide education and evaluate a debtors entire financial picture and then work out a total program. They don't nearly push debtors into high fee debt management plans. Ms. SUSAN C. KEATING (National Foundation for Credit Counseling): Consumer debt has become a market in this country. KAUFMAN: Susan C. Keating is president and CEO of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, an industry umbrella group that's been in existence for more than half a century. She says her organization welcomes the scrutiny, noting that none of its members has appeared on the IRS target list. Ms. KEATING: We think it's important that the steps that are being taken differentiate qualified organizations that operate against standards from those that are really geared to making profits and capitalizing on the extreme consumer debt. KAUFMAN: Another group heartened by the IRS action is the National Consumer Law Center. But Center attorney Deanne Loonin says she hopes the IRS moves quickly to complete its investigations so consumers can more easily find legitimate counseling agencies. Loonin also worries that revoking the tax-exempt status of some of these firms won't necessarily put them out of business. Ms. DEANNE LOONIN: (National Consumer Law Center): These companies, the bad ones, are very creative and they already knew this was going to happen. They knew this was coming down the pipelines. So they've been thinking of ways that they can continue to operate, potentially still as non-profits, but perhaps a different category of non-profit. Or potentially just taking their business into the for-profit sector. So it's very encouraging, but we're not out of the woods yet. KAUFMAN: In addition to the actions announced today, the IRS is sending more than 700 compliance letters to the rest of the credit counseling industry. The IRS investigations will affect consumers under the federal bankruptcy law. Consumers considering bankruptcy must now get credit counseling before they're allowed to file.

It is not your imagination - prices are up. The Labor Department reports today that wholesale inflation rose nine-tenths of a percent in April. Also, new home construction began to slow a bit. MARKETPLACE'S Tess Vigeland is here. And Tess, let's start with inflation. Nine-tenths of a percent - is that abnormal? TESS VIGELAND reporting: Well, it is the biggest jump in seven months, Madeleine. And this is wholesale inflation, as you mentioned. That's the cost of things that are bought before they reach store shelves. Now, I know I spoke with University of Maryland economist Peter Morici, and he says it's very easy to see where this spike came from. Prof. PETER MORICI (Economist, University of Maryland): All gasoline prices. Gasoline prices were up a great deal in April, as we all know. However, the price for other goods and services did not rise very much. According to the producer price index, they were up a scant one-tenth of a percent, and over the last year, they've been up only six-tenths of a percent in total. VIGELAND: And he says the reason why other prices aren't higher is worker productivity is so high. Well, we're all doing a lot of work. So businesses can absorb those high energy prices - at least so far - without raising prices to consumers very much. BRAND: But Tess, aren't the high gas prices reflected in other parts of the economy? VIGELAND: Absolutely, and you are starting to see that in retail sales. We're still buying a lot of stuff, but we're not buying as much of it. We'll actually get a better read on how this is affecting our wallets tomorrow when we get the consumer price index, and that measures inflation at the check-out counter. Another big factor here, as you mentioned, housing starts are down. That measures the number of homes where they're breaking ground to build. That figure dropped by 7. 4 percent in April, so the housing boom has really propped up the economy the last several years, is, as everyone was expecting, starting to slow. BRAND: And Tess, what does this all mean for interest rates and whether they'll go up again? VIGELAND: Well, the Fed is meeting again in late June, and there's a lot of disagreement about what it will and what it should do. Of course, just last week it raised rates for the 16th time in two years. Morici says there are two sets of forces pulling on the Fed right now. Prof. MORICI: One are these higher energy prices. That does pull up the overall rate of inflation. On the other hand, the economy is slowing and the Fed doesn't want to step on the brakes too hard by pushing up interest rates too far and throw the economy into a recession. VIGELAND: But, of course, all prognostication aside, we will have to see what they do in June. In the meantime, we'll have some more important figures coming out on both unemployment and GDP to add to the mix of all these economic statistics that we got today.

I'm Madeleine Brand. NOAH ADAMS, host: And I'm Noah Adams. Two hundred billion dollars - that is the trade deficit the U. S. ran up last year buying goods imported from China. BRAND: And in the next few years, that deficit could grow even bigger, because now China has plans to move beyond selling us lots of cheap clothing, toys, and consumer electronics. ADAMS: Several Chinese companies now say they'll begin importing automobiles into the U. S. , perhaps as early as next year. BRAND: To find out more about these Chinese cars, we called Jamie Kitman. He's the New York Bureau Chief for Automobile Magazine. He spoke with our colleague, Alex Chadwick. ALEX CHADWICK reporting: Jamie, welcome to the program. Mr. JAMIE KITMAN (New York Bureau Chief for Automobile Magazine): Hello, Alex. CHADWICK: What are Chinese car makers planning? How are they going to crack the U. S. market? Mr. KITMAN: Well, I think their secret is going to be the ones that the Koreans and the Japanese before them used - and I guess the Europeans before that -which is to sell cars for less money than American makers do. CHADWICK: China is incredibly successful at selling goods here, but for consumers, what's the difference between a pair of socks and a mini van? Mr. KITMAN: To run the risk of stating the obvious, a mini van is more complex than most pairs of socks. There's a lot of, you know, different components that go into making it. CHADWICK: And when consumers get around to buying a car from a manufacturer they're not familiar with, wouldn't they have to get over a hurdle that would be much more difficult with a mini van than it would be with, say, a five dollar pair of socks? If you could still buy socks for five dollars. I don't know. Mr. KITMAN: Right, but I think the ultimate test is the same. Are these fit for the purpose for which I bought them? People will buy a pair of socks, and if they disintegrate, they probably won't buy another pair from that manufacturer. Historically, foreign manufacturers have had good success, initially, selling low-priced automobiles in the United States. The problem comes when they don't hold up, and it's almost a year or two later - or three - that you find out the real truth. CHADWICK: Well, have you driven a Chinese car, and how good are they? Mr. KITMAN: Well, I'm afraid I haven't, but from what I read, they're not really quite up to scratch. They tend to be aimed at a very low price point in an absolute sense - they're small and underpowered, and they tend not to be very safe. When they have been subjected to Western-style crash tests, they generally perform poorly. Obviously, anything they would sell in the United States for use on public roads would have to meet our safety and emissions standards, which is, in fact, perhaps the thing that's slowing their arrival down as much as anything, because they don't. CHADWICK: Do you know about auto parts? How is China doing with selling auto parts over here - maybe engines, that kind of thing? Mr. KITMAN: Huge amounts of auto parts are coming into the United States. The number multiplies exponentially, and it's probably up to around five billion dollars last year. We see Chinese parts largely in places that people don't look, in electrical components, plastic moldings. But also, in more major components, like engines. Some Saturn's have engines that are actually made in China. CHADWICK: Well, so they are succeeding at the parts level, anyway, and we'll have to see how they do with the entire car. There's this note - this might just help us out with the deficit part of this: I've read that the most popular car among the Chinese elites is an American car, and it's a Buick. Mr. KITMAN: I mean, it really is the dark side of the moon. This is a car that, in America, its buyers have a median age of around 67 or something like that, and yet it's hip with Chinese youth. You know, all I can say is go figure. However, General Motors took a big position into China. Some of their critics argue that they would've better spent their money shoring up their position at home. But they do have a seat at the table in China, which is - unfortunately, it's a nasty game there. The pricing wars are cutthroat, competition is insane, and it really looks like the world, only even tighter. CHADWICK: Jamie Kitman, New York Bureau chief for the magazine, Automobile.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. There was some surprising news today about inflation and it was enough to send the financial markets into a tailspin. The government said that the core inflation rate rose three tenths of a percent in April, higher than investors expected. As a result both stock and bond prices fell. NPR's Jim Zarolli reports. JIM ZAROLLI reporting: Investors have been hoping and praying that the Federal Reserve is almost through raising interest rates, but those hopes were dashed this morning. The labor department reported that the consumer price index rose six tenths of a percent in April and about half of the increase was in the so-called core rate, a worrisome sign for the economy. Ian Shepherdson is chief U. S. economist at High Frequency Economics. Dr. IAN SHEPHERDSON (High Frequency Economics): It's not so much that this number is particularly bad. It was a little bit worse than expected. The problem is that there was a little bit worse than expected number last month as well and although two numbers don't make a trend, they do make people nervous. ZAROLLI: The report sent stocks falling in both the United States and Europe. By the middle of the afternoon the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost two percent and the NASDAQ composite index hit a six month low. Bond prices also took a nosedive. Ian Shepherdson says the response may have been an overreaction. Much of the increase was in housing costs, specifically in rents. Nigel Gault, U. S. economist at Global Insight says that as interest rates have risen, people have stopped buying homes as fast as they were and so some people are moving into the rental market, which is already extremely tight. Mr. NIGAL GAULT (Global Insight): It's very strange that one of the things that's happening here in core inflation is actually a reflection of a perspective weakening in housing activity, which you would expect to be disinflationary. ZAROLLI: Gault says the question now is whether inflation has reached a point at which companies will begin passing on price increases to the public, something they've largely refrained from doing so far. Mr. GAULT: Shouldn't panic at this point. I mean, these inflation numbers are still historically relatively low. The unfortunate thing at the moment is things are pointing upwards, so the indication is that maybe things are going to get a bit worse before they get better. ZAROLLI: If inflation is picking up that would force the hand of the Federal Reserve. The Fed has already raised rates by four full percentage points over the past few years and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke warned last week that rates may have to keep rising to control inflation. Investors are worried that today's numbers make that kind of prospect more likely. Jim Zarolli, NPR News, New York.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

ZAROLLI: If inflation is picking up that would force the hand of the Federal Reserve. The Fed has already raised rates by four full percentage points over the past few years and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke warned last week that rates may have to keep rising to control inflation. Investors are worried that today's numbers make that kind of prospect more likely.  Jim Zarolli, NPR News, New York. ", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.

Taylor says asking oil companies to slash their prices just doesn't make sense. Mr. JERRY TAYLOR (Senior fellow, the Cato Institute): Gasoline, like houses, are sold to the highest bidder. They're priced at what the market will bear. In gasoline markets, like in housing markets, they're sold by auction. Gasoline prices were established by spot markets around the country, and the price that your service station pays to get gasoline is tied to that spot market price, plus some business and transportation costs. Yeah, businesses could sell below spot market price, in which case they'd lose money and probably face shareholder lawsuits. CHIDEYA: Jerry, let me ask you - transitioning to international issues - about a certain play by Hugo Chavez, the head of Venezuela's government. He gave some low cost heating oil to northern states this winter. Why haven't US companies -you know, particularly during the winter when this was a matter of life of death - done what some people would consider a public service use of their resources? Mr. TAYLOR: Well, the job of business is to make money. You're not in business for generally any other reason, say, for making a profit. Hugo Chavez, because he has substantial control over the domestic industry there, can reallocate goods and services as he sees fit for political reasons. And so government can, of course, provide below cost commodities if they so desire. And Hugo Chavez saw a political opportunity to embarrass the Bush administration by doing so. But asking businesses to sell products at below market cost is asking businesses, essentially, to self-destruct. And no business is going to want to do that. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist): This is a simplistic sort of supply and demand model that Jerry's putting out here, saying that. I agree with him that a company's job is to profit maximize, but at the same time, companies like ExxonMobil and others live in a society where, essentially, they have some responsibility to the government and the people that have consistently subsidized them, and artificially inflated demand for their products over the years. Again, our highway system, I think, is something we might look at. The paucity of public transportation. What Hugo Chavez did, I think, was a heroic move. And yes, he was attempting - and he did very affectively - embarrass the Bush administration. But it wasn't also about embarrassing the administration, but also about making a point about availability of these supplies. CHIDEYA: Let me just jump in and add that ExxonMobil made the largest profit of any company last year. So they're doing what businesses do well. And I wanted to transition you - and please fill in with whatever else you were going to say, Jerry - to the questions of gas taxes. You hear some pundits like Joe Kline(ph) saying, well, we should drop the payroll tax and increase the gas tax. And then other people laughing to his face, saying that Americans will never increase gas taxes. What about the government's role in depressing consumption by increasing the price of gas through taxes? Mr. TAYLOR: Well, the Cato Institute has long argued that it would be far better to tax consumption rather than taxing income. So as a general matter, we'd be happy with the transition of the tax code, which looked towards taxing gasoline and oil and other commodities as opposed to taxing income and labor. I think that would be a positive step. In the specific issue of heating oil -which is what we were talking about - that's primarily a fuel source in the Northeast, in New England, not throughout most of the country. Most of the country and most households get their heating fuel from natural gas or electricity or something else. I can't tell people what to do with their resources or their time or their money. But the fact is, nobody puts a gun to anyone's head and tells them to rely on heating oil to keep their house warm. If they've decided to do that, that's one thing. And, in fact, for the most part, you will save money more years than not by relying on heating oil as opposed to natural gas or electricity. But some years you won't. So there's nothing government needs to do for you here. If you can't do something for yourself\u2026 Dr. MALVEAUX: It's not about government doing anything for you, Jerry. It's not about government. I think you've attempted to distort my argument. I think that what we're looking at is things like infrastructure. Things like people who don't have the flexibility, again, to convert. Of course Cato would say let's not tax gas. Let's tax consumption. But I don't think we'd want to waive a gas tax until we talked about how we're going to do some things around issues of conversion. Government incents what the want to incent. With a $70 billion tax cut last week, they attempted to incent private investment. Why can't we attempt to incent efficient energy use? CHIDEYA: There's been a lot of debate about the CAFE standards, which are the fuel efficiency standards. What do you think, Jerry, is the federal government's responsibility to raise fuel efficiency standards for cars? Mr. TAYLOR: I don't think the government should even have CAFE standards. For the most part, consumers will respond to high gasoline prices the way we might hope, which is to conserve on gasoline. We've seen that over the past couple of years now that sales of heavy SUVs have dropped like a rock. Not because government forced any regulations on the industry or punished consumers or raised gasoline taxes, but because gasoline prices have gone up, and the big heavy SUVs - which were attractive and we saw record gasoline prices in 1998 -are no longer attractive at all. We've seen an increase of fuel efficiency in the auto fleet, and we've also seen a reduction in gasoline demand compared to 2003 to the present. We're actually consuming less gasoline than we consumed the year before and the year before that, and we'll continue to see improvement. So the idea that the government needs to step in and force people to conserve or to minimize how much gasoline they use, or to reconsider what kinds of cars they're buying -that might be an argument for when prices are very low. When gasoline is selling for $3 a gallon or more, people definitely do take that into consideration. Not only in the kind of cars they buy, but where they live, how often they're interested in taking mass transit, whether they car pool. In other words, high prices is the best friend for people who want conservation, and want to see different sort of commute patterns and that sort of thing. CHIDEYA: Julianne. Dr. MALVEAUX: You know, Farai, everyone does not have the fluidity to decide that they want to move because they want to move closer to their city or closer to the job because gas prices have gone up. It boggles my mind to think that there is no notion of the income skew that comes with the notion of let's just deal with prices. You've got face costs and variable costs, so yes, someone buying a car today probably would look at a hybrid SUV, would look at something other than your traditional SUV. A single mom with four kids is going to go to the used car lot and get what she can. I do think that government can do more. I think that certainly with the CAFE standards, the government has dropped the ball. Private business can be incented both by the market, and that's - Cato always says just let the market work. Well, the market works, but it works imperfectly, and some people end up with a greater burden from the market. So government can help the market work by imposing some of these standards. I think this will be a great time to re-engage Detroit, especially as the auto industry is flagging into talk about some standards, and to talk about alternatives. CHIDEYA: All right.

The government is giving evacuees a chance to buy HUD homes anywhere in the country at a 10 percent discount before others even see that they're on the market. NPR's Kathy Lohr reports from Atlanta. KATHY LOHR reporting: Homes that the government has in stock through foreclosure are now available for victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita to buy at a discount. There are about 20,000 HUD homes in total, some in every state and in every price range. About 2000 homes are available in Louisiana and Mississippi. Mr. JOE McCLUSKEY (Department Housing and Urban Development): We see this as a great opportunity for families. LOHR: That's Joe McCluskey, director at HUD. Mr. McCLUSKEY: Generally we sell our homes at a value that is about 98 percent of the appraised value on average. But a 10 percent reduction on the appraised value, you know, the housing market, which - although it's cooling down some -is still very strong throughout the country, is a pretty strong offer. And I think that most families would see that as a very attractive offer. LOHR: Atlanta Realtor Angie Jackson is so excited about the program, she's taking out a newspaper ad to let evacuees know about it. She sits down with Shawn Williams-Evans, to talk about the possibility, but Williams-Evans has a lot of questions. Ms. ANGIE JACKSON (Realtor): You can take advantage of this program. Ms. SHAWN WILLIAMS-EVANS: It's not credit score driven or is it credit issues, you have to repair your credit and all to get into this program? How does that affect a person who may have a home that is now delinquent or facing foreclosure? How would that affect them? LOHR: In order to buy a home at the reduced price, buyers must have a FEMA registration number and a copy of a letter from the agency stating their eligibility. Williams-Evans drove to Atlanta days after Katrina, when supplies ran out in a New Orleans hotel. She's renting a HUD house now, but is seriously considering buying in this city. One daughter and a son live here in Atlanta, while her husband and her eldest son are back in New Orleans. Williams-Evans says she sees him about once a month and she still doesn't know what to do with her two New Orleans houses in the lower Ninth Ward that were flooded and still need so much work. Ms. WILLIAMS-EVANS: I love where I was. I've been there all my life in the lower Ninth Ward but it has to be rebuilt. I don't think it can take another hit. And Louisiana is just like in a fish bowl. We're surrounded by water, so I have to think about that. LOHR: The program requires only $50 down payment and provides other benefits. HUD pays up to five percent of the closing costs and the realtor's fee. It also gives people who've been renting HUD homes the first crack at buying them and settling in a new place. Williams-Evans says she's not sure, but she wants to talk to her husband about it. Ms. WILLIAMS-EVANS: It's a lot to think about. I mean, so much is going on. I like Atlanta. I always wanted to, you know, purchase a house here because I have a son here. It's possible. LOHR: Would that make you feel like you're out of, sort of harm's way? Ms. WILLIAMS-EVANS: Yes, it would. That way, the house in Louisiana, I can go back and check on my son or whatever and then come here and, you know, live here or whatever. LOHR: Williams-Evans says she doesn't want to live through another hurricane. Her husband's mother died in a shelter and her grandmother recently passed away after living through Katrina.

It goes something like this: immigrants take jobs away from Americans. Plenty of Americans are willing to do those jobs, but the influx of foreign workers depresses wages and distorts the economy. That's what critics say about large-scale illegal immigration. But many make the same argument against legal foreign workers, especially in the fields of computers and engineering. And they complain their views aren't being heard in the debate over immigration reform. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports. JENNIFER LUDDEN: In years past, when Congress has added visas for high-skilled foreign workers, there have been bitter, public debates. But this time, hardly a word, even though the proposal now in the Senate includes substantial increases. It doubles the number of temporary H1B visas for hightech workers. It would make it easier for foreigners studying in the U. S. to stay and look for a job. And it would more than double the number of permanent employment-based visas issued every year. Jeff Landy of the Information Technology Association thinks there's simply wider acceptance now that the hightech industry needs these workers. JEFF LANDY: There is recognition that the majority of students in our graduate level math, science and engineering programs are actually foreign nationals and we have two choices. We can either facilitate their stay in the country so they can work for U. S. companies, innovate and create new jobs, or watch them go back to their home countries and innovate for our competition. LUDDEN: Norm Matloff of the University of California at Davis cites a different reason for the lack of debate. He thinks the hightech industry wanted these increases buried in a bill that's largely about the hot button topic of illegal immigration. Matloff teaches computer science, and says there's deep public anger over foreign hightech workers' impact on Americans. He believes the proposed increases would hurt thousands more. NORM MATLOFF: What we have here is an internal brain drain. We have our best and brightest people, whose talents are being wasted. There are many American engineers and programmers who are not just unemployed, but a better view is underemployed, meaning that they used to be an engineer and now they're selling insurance. LUDDEN: It's not illegal to replace an American with a temporary foreign worker. When it comes to issuing permanent visas, though, a company must first recruit Americans and then prove to the Department of Labor that it can't find any who qualify. Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies alleges the system can be finagled. MARK KRIKORIAN: The attorneys have gotten very good at crafting ads that apply to no one but the person their client wants to hire and then place them in papers that almost no one will ever see anyway. LUDDEN: Companies are also required to pay foreign workers prevailing wages, but software consultant John Miano says when he reviewed Department of Labor paperwork on this from last year, he found more than half the foreign workers assigned to the bottom skill level and lowest wage bracket. JOHN MIANO: So when employers want an H1-B increase, they tell the public that these are highly skilled workers. When employers are calculating the prevailing wage for these workers, they suddenly become low skilled workers. LUDDEN: Jeff Landy of the Information Technology Association denies foreign workers are cheaper once you take into account what it costs to recruit them. Barry Chiswick of the University of Illinois at Chicago says hightech foreign workers can depress wages in some industries. But he also says they raise the nation's productivity, raise the earnings of lower skilled workers and pay more in taxes than they use in services. BARRY CHISWICK: Nobody likes having more competition, but I think we have to take a broader view in terms of what is beneficial for the American economy. LUDDEN: Unlike the Senate bill, legislation in the U. S. House does not include any increases in legal immigration. If the measures make it into an eventual compromise bill software consultant John Miano would be disappointed, but not surprised. He says hightech companies like Microsoft have big time lobbyists and make big campaign contributions. All we have, he says, are people who travel to D. C. on their own time and knock on doors.

Tom Easton, the chief financial writer for The Economist, joins us from New York City. He's written about Goldman Sachs and, Tom Easton, I guess you should begin by defining what this is, it's a Wall Street investment banking firm that went public a few years ago. Mr. TOM EASTON (The Economist): Yes, it went from being a highly successful, highly secretive investment partnership into a highly successful, highly secretive, publicly traded investment firm. And very few people really understand how Goldman does what Goldman does. I mean, it is the mystery on Wall Street. There is no more exciting moment every quarter than when Goldman unveils its earnings. First so that all its competitors can see how much money it makes, and generally it makes more than they can possibly imagine. And secondly if there's any clue to how they made all the money that they did and that always leaves as many questions as answers. SIEGEL: Give us a measure of how successful Goldman Sachs has been in recent years. Mr. EASTON: Goldman Sachs's return on equity is upwards of 40 percent which is just a staggering number and even in the depth of the recent market slide, its return on equity never went below ten percent and these are just terrific numbers. People who go to Goldman and achieve what is known in the firm as a participating and managing directorship become richer than people can possibly imagine every becoming. I mean this is the most successful, to be hired by Goldman, to succeed at Goldman, to rise at Goldman is to be on one of the most extraordinary career tracks in the history of the world. SIEGEL: There's a fact in your piece in The Economist about Goldman Sachs that is stunning. It's about the interviewing process that goes on before people get hired and there's a vice chairwoman of the firm who, you write, was interviewed 150 times before she was hired. Mr. EASTON: You know that is thought to be a record, but no one is quite sure whether it really is a record because there's a possibility that other people have been interviewed even more intensely. I mean this is, you know, Goldman doesn't do everything right. It makes a lot of mistakes. And Goldman doesn't hire everyone who's particularly bright. Lots of other firms do as well. In fact, when you have a firm that does so many interviews to hire someone the possibility is that great people will be knocked off in the process or, in fact, great people won't put up with it and they'll just go to another firm. So there's plenty of talent in other places. That said, Goldman has long been legendary for the intensiveness of their recruiting process, for the thoroughness of their interviews and for the bear hug that you get once they want to hire you. I mean you will be deluged by telephone calls once they decide that you are the person that they want. You will be called by everyone in the division that you are going to. If it looks dicey, Mr. Paulson himself, notwithstanding the 20,000 employees that Goldman Sachs already has, will telephone you and try to get you to come and the result is even if they didn't intend to go there initially when the first offer came, they tend to go there anyway because the seduction process is just so overwhelming. And now as you also saw in my piece, working there is not easy. I mean once you go to Goldman it is an extraordinary commitment of your life. People at Goldman return emails all night long, I mean if you send a, if they get a voicemail or they get an e-mail, they are expected to send a response and the method that they use in Goldman Sachs for emails is you can send an e-mail simultaneously to ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 people and they are all expected to respond and you are expected to respond to them. Mr. Paulson himself, every quarter, goes through a long voicemail to all employees about how the quarter did, and there's a special function I think on the Goldman voicemail things that prohibit you from deleting Mr. Paulson's comments until you have listened to them in their entirety. So this is a firm that requires unbelievable self-engagement. SIEGEL: Given the mystery that is Goldman Sachs, does it ever occur to financial writers in New York that there might conceivably be an Enron problem there? That is, a business so complicated run by such smart people that to our astonishment, maybe it doesn't make any sense if you actually knows what goes on there. Mr. EASTON: I would say that occurs to people on a minute by minute basis and the only thing that would make you feel better about that is, A) it sells at, what, 13 times earnings. Enron sold at 99 times or 100 times earnings. Now if people really thought that Goldman could consistently make the money that it is making today, it wouldn't sell at 13 times earnings, it would sell at 20 times or 25 times or 30. So there is skepticism about Goldman. Now in terms of making it up, the Wall Street firms deal with Goldman every day and they question it and, you know, there is some sort of notion of counter party accountability going to lease with them. They do put out voluminous financial filings, but you know, in other ways, you're right, I mean, there is a concern there. SIEGEL: Mr. Easton, thanks a lot for talking with us. Mr. EASTON: You're welcome. Thank you for having me on. SIEGEL: That's Tom Easton, who is chief financial writer for The Economist, talking with us about Goldman Sachs.

Rising interest rates mean mortgage payments are going up. That is bad for homeowners, and it's also bad for renters. According to the National Association of Realtors, rents will rise more than five percent this year. That's double last year's increase. David Lereah is chief economist with the group, and he joins us now. And Mr. Lereah, what is driving this increase? Mr. DAVID LEREAH (Chief Economist, National Association of Realtors): Basically, when the residential marketplace cools, the mirror image is going to be the apartment marketplace. So that's got to heat up. So as people are saying, you know, I can't buy that house this year, that means they have to go somewhere else. They're going to be renting. So you're increasing the demand for renting, and if you increase the demand for rentals, something has to give in. That's prices, and prices happen to be rent. BRAND: And are there other factors? I've read that there were a lot of condo conversions recently, which have also taken rental apartments off the market. Mr. LEREAH: Oh, most definitely. Condo conversions represented, I think, about 35 percent of all multi-family buildings sold in 2005. So certainly, the less condo conversions we're having, it is taking some of the properties off the market. Supply is down. Demand is up. Again, something has to give or you're going to have higher rents. BRAND: But if the housing market is cooling and prices are dropping, won't that mean that more renters will now be able to buy houses, thereby vacating their apartments and putting more supply on the market? Mr. LEREAH: We're in a transitioning marketplace. So right now, even though the housing markets are cooling, prices are not dropping significantly at all in most of the nation's housing markets. So the renter is getting stuck. The renter now is being faced with greater demand for rentals, because people are postponing purchasing properties to own so the renters are paying higher rents. Eventually, as these markets complete the transition, if in some of these hot markets prices begin to soften, affordability begins to improve and renters hopefully can get back into the buying marketplace and buy. BRAND: But on the other hand, if prices begin to soften, then landlords might have to raise the rents. Mr. LEREAH: Well, when prices soften, landlords have to make up the money somewhere if the demand is there. Right now, the demand is there to rent because people are not buying, and the landlord can raise their rents in order to offset the loss in value of their property. BRAND: Where is it the worst place to be a renter these days? Mr. LEREAH: All the major cities right now are real tough because rents are going up a good deal. So, you know, D. C. , San Francisco, L. A. All the major big cities. You're getting less supply, greater demand - that's exerting upward pressure on rents. BRAND: So where are these people supposed to go? They can't rent. They can't buy. Mr. LEREAH: You know, I think the biggest problem we have - in both the home ownership marketplace and the rental marketplace - is lack of affordable houses and rental units. It's a workforce housing problem. People that work in the city can't find affordable property - whether they're going to buy or rent, it's very difficult. That's, in my opinion, the number one problem in the U. S. housing markets today. BRAND: David Lereah is an economist with the National Association of Realtors. Thanks for joining us.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. The May employment report was released this morning and it was weaker than expected. Employers added 75,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, that was less than half what economist's had forecast. But many stock market watchers immediately assumed that the bad news on jobs would be good news for investors, because it would encourage Fed policy makers to hold off on additional interest rate hikes. Well, that view did not prevail and the Dow and the NASDAQ finished down on the day. Joining me to talk about this, about jobs, interest rates, and the economy is NPR's Jack Speer. Welcome, Jack. JACK SPEER reporting: Good afternoon, Robert. SIEGEL: And before we get to the big picture, I want you to clear up part of the confusing picture; everyone says this was a weak jobs report, not many jobs created. On the other hand, the unemployment rate was down a notch to 4. 6 percent. How does that work? SPEER: Yeah, they call economics the dismal science; maybe they should call it the inexact science, too. The reason that it came out that way is that there really are a couple of different reports here that the government looks at when they determine what's going on with the unemployment rate. One looks at payroll jobs added by companies - those are jobs added by companies - and that number was the one that was much weaker than we expected. As you say, down 75,000 -only 75,000 jobs added by the economy last month. Now, there's a second survey, the household survey, and that survey asks people about whether they're employed or not; and that number was a bit more positive. Actually unemployment - the unemployment rate, which is measured by that survey went down a tenth of a percent to 4. 6 percent. Most of the time, these two surveys move pretty well together, but lately that hasn't been the case. So even though the unemployment rate fell, which is the good news beneath these numbers, there are a lot of cross currents and a lot going on. SIEGEL: Is it people dropping out of the job search that accounts for it or just different methodology? SPEER: Actually those numbers really haven't changed that much. The number of -as you mentioned, so-called discouraged workers and others - that number really hasn't changed a whole lot. As a matter of fact, there are 144 million people in the workforce right now, which is pretty good. You know there was initially some positive reaction to these numbers today; many economists were looking at this weaker jobs number and saying, well, because of this the Fed will probably hold off on raising interest rates when it meets at the end of the month. But that optimism, unfortunately, was pretty quickly replaced by another possibility and that is that maybe these numbers are an indication that things are actually a lot weaker than we think. You know this, we had a far weaker number in May, the government also revised downward the March and April employment numbers. And this is indicative of an economy that appears to be struggling a little bit. And consumers are struggling with higher energy prices, you know, they could reign in their spending. So the fear here is that, you know, whatever optimism there was, I guess, about what the Fed will do with these numbers, the greater fear is what it means for the broader economy and for companies. SIEGEL: Now the monthly report also included news about wages. What's the word there? SPEER: It did, it did and that was actually, if you're a worker it wasn't such good news, wages were only up a small amount, a penny an hour last month; but that's also not necessarily viewed as being overly inflationary, so that's somewhat good news. And for the year, we should mention, worker wages were up about 3. 7 percent. But the problem here is with other prices going up just as quickly, if not faster - energy and consumer good prices - many people are starting to wonder how this is going to play out, in terms of growth for the economy down the road. And many economists have already reduced their forecasts for second quarter GDP growth to about two-and-a-half percent, that's less than half the growth rate that we saw in the first quarter (unintelligible). SIEGEL: Thank you, Jack. SPEER: You're welcome. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Jack Speer.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel.  The May employment report was released this morning and it was weaker than expected. Employers added 75,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, that was less than half what economist's had forecast. But many stock market watchers immediately assumed that the bad news on jobs would be good news for investors, because it would encourage Fed policy makers to hold off on additional interest rate hikes.  Well, that view did not prevail and the Dow and the NASDAQ finished down on the day. Joining me to talk about this, about jobs, interest rates, and the economy is NPR's Jack Speer. Welcome, Jack.  JACK SPEER reporting:  Good afternoon, Robert.  SIEGEL: And before we get to the big picture, I want you to clear up part of the confusing picture; everyone says this was a weak jobs report, not many jobs created. On the other hand, the unemployment rate was down a notch to 4. 6 percent. How does that work?  SPEER: Yeah, they call economics the dismal science; maybe they should call it the inexact science, too. The reason that it came out that way is that there really are a couple of different reports here that the government looks at when they determine what's going on with the unemployment rate. One looks at payroll jobs added by companies - those are jobs added by companies - and that number was the one that was much weaker than we expected. As you say, down 75,000 -only 75,000 jobs added by the economy last month.  Now, there's a second survey, the household survey, and that survey asks people about whether they're employed or not; and that number was a bit more positive. Actually unemployment - the unemployment rate, which is measured by that survey went down a tenth of a percent to 4. 6 percent.  Most of the time, these two surveys move pretty well together, but lately that hasn't been the case. So even though the unemployment rate fell, which is the good news beneath these numbers, there are a lot of cross currents and a lot going on.  SIEGEL: Is it people dropping out of the job search that accounts for it or just different methodology?  SPEER: Actually those numbers really haven't changed that much. The number of -as you mentioned, so-called discouraged workers and others - that number really hasn't changed a whole lot. As a matter of fact, there are 144 million people in the workforce right now, which is pretty good.  You know there was initially some positive reaction to these numbers today; many economists were looking at this weaker jobs number and saying, well, because of this the Fed will probably hold off on raising interest rates when it meets at the end of the month. But that optimism, unfortunately, was pretty quickly replaced by another possibility and that is that maybe these numbers are an indication that things are actually a lot weaker than we think.  You know this, we had a far weaker number in May, the government also revised downward the March and April employment numbers. And this is indicative of an economy that appears to be struggling a little bit. And consumers are struggling with higher energy prices, you know, they could reign in their spending. So the fear here is that, you know, whatever optimism there was, I guess, about what the Fed will do with these numbers, the greater fear is what it means for the broader economy and for companies.  SIEGEL: Now the monthly report also included news about wages. What's the word there?  SPEER: It did, it did and that was actually, if you're a worker it wasn't such good news, wages were only up a small amount, a penny an hour last month; but that's also not necessarily viewed as being overly inflationary, so that's somewhat good news.

It used to be that when you wanted to make a new television show, you would naturally come to Los Angeles. And you still can. But according to a new study out today, the L. A. area is losing more of the TV pilot production business to other cities. MARKETPLACE'S Janet Babin is here. Janet, these pilots, they go on and then people hope a whole series will develop out of them. So where are these pilots being shot now? JANET BABIN reporting: That's right, Alex. The hope is that, you know, they'll stay on and keep creating revenue for these cities, but most of the pilots this year headed to New York and Canada. Canada's provinces picked up 11, as did New York, and Washington, D. C. got three pilots. And even places you wouldn't expect, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, they got two pilots each. But overall, according to this study, Los Angeles is still the place to make television. Film L. A. survey found that this year 81 pilots were shot in Los Angeles. And that sounds like a lot, but when you compare it to last year, the city snagged 105 pilots, it's a 23 percent decline. And even though this is a short season, it's a three to four month pilot season, it is responsible for a lot of jobs and tax revenue. The survey found that Los Angeles lost more than 1,000 jobs and $70 million because of this pilot decline. CHADWICK: Janet, are these other cities cheating or something? I mean, what are they doing? (Soundbite of laughter) BABIN: Well, for several years now, many states and cities have been offering lucrative tax incentives to film and TV crews that California just can't compete with. But even more than that, some cities and states are now, they've made attracting film and TV production a top priority by setting up film commissions or they streamline the permit process for these crews. And they have staff members that are just willing to bend over backwards to get a film or TV crew to a place. And some of these cities and states are places that you don't normally associate with the entertainment industry, places like Louisiana and Ohio.  For example, Cleveland, Austin and Philadelphia offer producers free sound stages, and Louisiana officials like to refer to themselves as Hollywood South. So the thinking is that, you know, in addition to getting additional dollars into the economy, film and TV crews can create a positive vibe around a city, and again, if the pilot turns into a series, well, that's national attention and a lot of long-standing revenue. CHADWICK: Los Angeles isn't going to give this up with nothing, no response? BABIN: No. The mayor, Villaraigosa, he is responding to the report and he's waived the daily fee for filming on city property, and there's also state legislation in the works as well. Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, we'll report on the heated presidential runoff election that's in Peru. CHADWICK: All right.

If you think paying for gas for your car is going to be painful this travel season, just be glad you don't own an airplane. A report out today from the International Air Transport Association says that soaring oil prices are going to mean billions of dollars in losses for the airline industry this year. Tess Vigeland joins us from the MARKETPLACE news room in Los Angeles. Tess, how does it look for the industry? Is this a possibility for more bankruptcies? TESS VIGELAND reporting: Well, Northwest and Delta are already there, of course, so who knows which airline might be next? But yes, it looks pretty bad at this point. That report you mentioned from the International Air Transport Association is predicting $3 billion in losses for airlines around the world this year. And an earlier forecast had pegged that number at around $2 billion. So, it's really these skyrocketing fuel costs that are pushing financial performance down at airlines around the world. This report says fuel is going to make up more than a quarter of overall operating costs. So, what that means is it's just harder and harder for the airlines to recover even as they're taking other cost-cutting measures - they're renegotiating the pay and benefits of union workers, for example. And the industry's got a lot to bounce back from. It collectively lost $35 billion from 2001 through the end of last year. CHADWICK: Well, they can undertake all kinds of cost-cutting measures, I suppose, but what about simply charging passengers more to fly? At some point, don't you have to get to that? VIGELAND: Yes, and in fact, that is happening. And the Wall Street Journal reports today that some of the legacy carriers, the big ones like American, United, and Delta are doing some other things like just getting rid of unprofitable routes. You don't have enough people flying from one city to another, planes are half full? Get rid of that route. And what that means is you don't have as many planes flying, so customers don't have as many choices, and that means that the airlines can start to push up prices. One other tactic that some airlines are using is fuel hedging. They're buying fuel at a lower price and assuming that it's going to go up later, but not enough airlines are doing that really at this point. CHADWICK: Tess, more airline news. Cell phones, what's going on there? VIGELAND: Yeah, it looks like we're one step closer to having to listen to other people's conversations on the plane. The discount carrier JetBlue won a license for wireless onboard communications, and that could mean everything from being able to access the Internet on a plane to, yes, being able to use your cell phone. But the FAA and the FCC still haven't given the okay for that to happen. It's still a topic of debate at both agencies. So, for now, you won't have to listen to that conversation, at least not on the phone.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Stocks were in a slump today, and most analysts are blaming comments that the new Federal Reserve Chief Ben Bernanke made yesterday. The Dow Industrial spent most of the day below the 11,000 mark. But late in the day, stocks managed to recover a bit. The Dow closed at 11,002. That's still down from yesterday. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, Bernanke's comments may have been a bit more direct than what investors are used to. JIM ZARROLI reporting: In his remarks, Fed Chairman Bernanke said there is evidence that the economy is finally beginning to decelerate after a long series of interest rate increases. He said consumer spending is slowing, and so is the housing market. But then Bernanke added this. Chairman BEN BERNANKE (Chairman of Federal Reserve): Core inflation measured over the past three to six months has reached the level that if sustained, would be at or above the upper end of the range that many economists -including myself - would consider consistent with price stability and promotion of maximum long run growth. ZARROLI: In other words, the economy is weakening, but inflation is still running a bit higher than Bernanke's comfortable with. Bernanke even said the Fed would be vigilant about inflation is still running a bit higher than Bernanke is comfortable with. Bernanke even said the Fed would be vigilant about inflation pressures, which a lot of people took to mean Fed officials intend to keep raising interest rates. That's the kind of message the markets hate to hear says Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisors, a consulting firm. Mr. CHRIS VARVARES (President of Macroeconomic advisors): So the Fed is likely to be in a position to have to tighten further into a slowing economy, and that double whammy just never sits well with the equity markets. ZARROLI: In the wake of Bernanke's comments, the Dow has lost almost 250 points, or more than two percent of its value. This isn't the first time that remarks by Bernanke have shaken the markets. On April 27, Bernanke told a Congressional committee that Fed officials might pause before raising interest rates again to assess where the economy is going. Again, Chris Varvares. Mr. VARVARES: I mean, as an economist, that makes perfect sense to me. And I didn't - would not think of it as in any way committing to a pause. He's simply laying out of what all the options are. But the markets picked up on pause, and they ran with it. ZARROLI: The reaction to Bernanke's remarks may reflect certain stylistic and philosophical differences between the Fed Chairman and his predecessor, says David Weiss, chief economist at Standard and Poor's. Weiss says Alan Greenspan was famously opaque when he talked about the economy, and investors had to become attune to the subtlest of comments. But, Weiss says, Bernanke came into office promising to be more transparent about the Fed's inner workings. Mr. DAVID WEISS (Chief Economist, Standard & Poor's): We got so use to trying to read between the lines with Greenspan, I think we have to realize that with Bernanke, there's not really very much between the lines. He's saying what he means. But the problem is we keep trying to over interpret it, because he got use to that with Greenspan. ZARROLI: Weiss says people may simply be reading more into Bernanke's comments yesterday than he intended. Mr. WEISS: I think, actually, he's been fairly clear that he's going to let the data decide what the Fed has to do next. And people don't want to accept that. They want to assume that he knows what he's going to do. He doesn't know what he's going to do. ZARROLI: Not everyone agrees with that, and many economists now say the Fed is almost certain to raise rates again later this month. What is clear is that investors are still figuring out how to read the new Fed chairman, and how to respond to remarks that are a lot more direct than they're use to.

We've heard a lot about the underfunding of corporate pensions. Companies aren't setting aside enough money to cover all their retiring employees. Well, a report out today from Standard and Poor's says the situation is even worse for millions of state and federal government employees. Tess Vigeland joins us from the MARKETPLACE newsroom in Los Angeles. And Tess, first explain what's meant specifically by the term underfunded. TESS VIGELAND reporting: Well, pension systems are basically a promise from an employer whether it's a corporation or a government that you're going to have certain benefits available to you when you retire, a certain income. And there are rules that employers have to follow about how much money they have to set aside to fund those benefits that they've promised. There have been all kinds of debates over how much money should be set aside, how employers should account for that on their books, but overall, the experts say many companies and the state and federal governments aren't putting enough money aside for their future retirees. And that's what we mean when we talk about underfunding a pension system. BRAND: Well, how bad is it for government employees? Ms. VIGELAND: Well, according to this report out from S&P, the federal government's pension system for all federal employees, millions of them, is underfunded by $4. 5 trillion. And Standard and Poor's chief economist, David Wyss says states are underfunded by about around $284 billion. Mr. DAVID WYSS (Chief Economist, Standard and Poor's): State pension plans are a little bit better shape than the government pension plans, but not by much. The underfunding in the state pension plan is about twice as bad as the underfunding in corporate pension plans, both in absolute amount and as a percentage of the assets. Ms. VIGELAND: And in fact, the average state pension plan is about 80 percent funded. On the corporate side, it's more like 90 percent. But of course, with both, you have the worst case scenarios. In corporate America, you've had big companies like United Airlines dumping their pension liabilities onto a federal agency after filing for bankruptcy. In state governments, for example, West Virginia's state employee pension system has half the funding that it should. So it's retirees are in a bit of trouble. BRAND: Hmm. And so what happens in the next several years when all the baby boomers start retiring? Ms. VIGELAND: Well, in corporate America, you have this backstop called the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. They take over company pensions if the company just can't pay, like United Airlines. In that case, the PBGC is essentially a proxy for the taxpayer. It's your tax dollars that are paying those pensions instead of the company. The backstop for federal and state pension systems is, plain and simple, again, the taxpayer, the current workforce. And you're talking about having to prop up the retirement plans of millions and millions of employees if this problem isn't solved. And when you're talking about a federal government shortfall of $4. 5 trillion, it's going to be a little difficult to try and make that up. And we will have much more about all this later today on MARKETPLACE. BRAND: Very good. Thank you, Tess Vigeland of public radio's daily business show, MARKETPLACE. It's produced by American Public Media.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  Back now with DAY TO DAY.  We've heard a lot about the underfunding of corporate pensions. Companies aren't setting aside enough money to cover all their retiring employees.  Well, a report out today from Standard and Poor's says the situation is even worse for millions of state and federal government employees. Tess Vigeland joins us from the MARKETPLACE newsroom in Los Angeles.  And Tess, first explain what's meant specifically by the term underfunded.  TESS VIGELAND reporting:  Well, pension systems are basically a promise from an employer whether it's a corporation or a government that you're going to have certain benefits available to you when you retire, a certain income. And there are rules that employers have to follow about how much money they have to set aside to fund those benefits that they've promised.  There have been all kinds of debates over how much money should be set aside, how employers should account for that on their books, but overall, the experts say many companies and the state and federal governments aren't putting enough money aside for their future retirees. And that's what we mean when we talk about underfunding a pension system.  BRAND: Well, how bad is it for government employees?  Ms. VIGELAND: Well, according to this report out from S&P, the federal government's pension system for all federal employees, millions of them, is underfunded by $4. 5 trillion. And Standard and Poor's chief economist, David Wyss says states are underfunded by about around $284 billion.  Mr. DAVID WYSS (Chief Economist, Standard and Poor's): State pension plans are a little bit better shape than the government pension plans, but not by much. The underfunding in the state pension plan is about twice as bad as the underfunding in corporate pension plans, both in absolute amount and as a percentage of the assets.  Ms. VIGELAND: And in fact, the average state pension plan is about 80 percent funded. On the corporate side, it's more like 90 percent. But of course, with both, you have the worst case scenarios. In corporate America, you've had big companies like United Airlines dumping their pension liabilities onto a federal agency after filing for bankruptcy.  In state governments, for example, West Virginia's state employee pension system has half the funding that it should. So it's retirees are in a bit of trouble.  BRAND: Hmm. And so what happens in the next several years when all the baby boomers start retiring?  Ms. VIGELAND: Well, in corporate America, you have this backstop called the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. They take over company pensions if the company just can't pay, like United Airlines. In that case, the PBGC is essentially a proxy for the taxpayer. It's your tax dollars that are paying those pensions instead of the company.  The backstop for federal and state pension systems is, plain and simple, again, the taxpayer, the current workforce. And you're talking about having to prop up the retirement plans of millions and millions of employees if this problem isn't solved. And when you're talking about a federal government shortfall of $4. 5 trillion, it's going to be a little difficult to try and make that up.  And we will have much more about all this later today on MARKETPLACE.  BRAND: Very good. Thank you, Tess Vigeland of public radio's daily business show, MARKETPLACE.

Tess, I do see oil prices are down today in part, I guess, because of the news about the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. TESS VIGELAND reporting: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And so far that hasn't really affected the markets. Oil prices did dip by about a dollar a barrel, in part because of that news. But the drop in oil is really being outweighed today by the fact that the European Central Bank, which is Europe's Fed, raised interest rates there.

CHADWICK: Well, there were those comments on Monday from Fed Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about interest rates. VIGELAND: Right. Yeah. The Dow has lost about 300 points since a sell-off was sparked after those remarks that he made at an international banking conference. He's essentially expressed continued concern about inflation. He said the rate of so-called core inflation, that's without food and energy costs, was, quote, \"unwelcome. \" And the markets are taking that as cue that the Fed will hike the benchmark interest rate again when it meets on June 29th. Now, just last Friday, fears of a rate increase kind of eased off a bit because of the unemployment report. The economy only created about 75,000 jobs last month. Folks thought, well, that could signal the economy is cooling, so we're not going to see another rate hike. But then Bernanke came out with a speech on Monday and the mood really shifted. And that's what you've been seeing, most of this week, is continued speculation about what the Fed is going to do. CHADWICK: Something else from Washington. The Senate today rejected efforts to repeal the estate tax. VIGELAND: Yeah, it's not going to happen, at least under this bill. GOP leaders were hoping that this would end the tax, and right now it's scheduled to go away in the year 2010, but then come back from the dead in 2011. There's been a lot of negotiating this week, but today they were three votes short of getting the bill to the next step. Opponents have said it's just too expensive to get rid of this tax. But, Alex, it's probably not the last we're going to hear of it. There is some talk of putting the repeal into another bill or simply trying again on this one. But the likelihood of that happening before this fall's elections are pretty slim. And coming up later today on Marketplace, we'll find out how post-nuptial agreements are becoming a popular way for couples to save their marriages.

After all, it's not worth much, which is why one congressman plans to introduce legislation to abolish the coin. NPR's Ted Robbins has the story. TED ROBBINS reporting: What do you do with your pennies? Dump them in a jar at home? Drop them in the little tray by the cash register? You know, take a penny, leave a penny? (Soundbite of coins) ROBBINS: Arizona Republican Congressman Jim Kolbe thinks pennies are a waste of, well, money. Representative JIM KOLBE (Republican, Arizona): We're making four billion of these a year that have absolutely no use any longer, from an economic and a commercial standpoint. ROBBINS: Actually, pennies do have one commercial use: for sales tax. And without them, transactions would be rounded up to the nearest nickel. Mark Weller, of Americans for Common Cents - cents as in pennies - says that would hurt poor Americans. Mr. MARK WELLER (Americans for Common Cents): People know that if you don't have the penny you round transactions, and that's a losing proposition for consumers. ROBBINS: Kolbe says, in practice, even poor Americans already round to the nearest nickel, ignoring the penny. Rep. KOLBE: They're just sitting on sidewalks because nobody wants to stoop over to pick one up. (Soundbite of coins) ROBBINS: Meanwhile, it costs more than a penny to make a penny. How's that? Well, this is going to sound backward, but the copper colored penny's main ingredient is zinc. The copper is just a coating.  The price of zinc has surged in recent years. It now costs about a penny and a half to make a penny. The alternative, the nickel, costs more than a nickel to make too, but at least a nickel buys something. Like six minute in a parking meter. The nickel's main ingredient is copper.  Told you it would sound backward. And copper prices have also surged. Guess which state leads the nation in copper production? Arizona, Kolbe's state. His plan would result in more nickels, and more copper being used. Which is another reason Mark Weller opposes Kolbe's plan. Mr. WELLER: We just believe this is special interest legislation at its worst. ROBBINS: Kolbe says copper producers could care less about the amount used in pennies.  Rep. KOLBE: I don't think they're worrying too much about how much copper is being used by the mint when China will take every pound of copper that can possibly be produced in the United States and every other place at whatever the world market price is. And it's very nice, thank you. ROBBINS: And we should tell you that Mark Weller's group, Americans for Common Cents, gets some of its funding from the folks who provide the penny's main ingredient. Yup. Zinc producers. Mr. WELLER: We have a broad-based coalition that's made up of coin and numismatic organizations, charitable groups, and companies that are involved in the production of the penny. And we've been upfront abut that. ROBBINS: Weller says the charitable organizations would lose if the penny is abolished because they raise money collecting pennies in donation boxes. He also points out that some mint workers could lose their jobs if the penny goes away. The mint spends about two-thirds of its production time making pennies. But the main reason Americans for Common Cents wants to keep the penny? Mark Weller says its own polls show people like it. Mr. WELLER: We have consistently seen two-thirds to three-fourths of the Americans that have indicated they want to continue the penny. ROBBINS: We did our own unscientific poll outside a credit union in Tucson. We got the opposite results. Mr. MARCO IOANE(ph) (Arizona Resident): I could do without pennies.

It's a lot cheaper than playing with dollars or dimes. ROBBINS: Or nickels. Jim Kolbe has been pushing to modernize currency for many years. He wanted the dollar coin to replace the dollar bill. Not a roaring success. Since he's retiring from Congress after this term, he'll have to find someone else to carry on his mission. Rep. KOLBE: I'm not sure we'll have time to get it through this year, but I guarantee this is something whose time has definitely come. ROBBINS: If not, there's another way to bring down the cost of making pennies and nickels. Use cheaper metals.

Fears of inflation have returned to the financial markets and to the Federal Reserve. Right now we're going to get the big picture on inflation and also the small picture, or a smaller picture anyway, what it means to your wallet. We've brought in David Wessell, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSELL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: And when we see fears of inflation, is inflation really going up? Mr. WESSELL: Yes, inflation is definitely going up, largely because energy prices are up. Over the last 12 months, energy prices are up 18 percent, so the overall consumer price index is up 3. 5 percent for the 12 months ending in April, and that's somewhat higher than it's been. The question is, is that spilling over into the prices of non-energy goods and services, and that's the big mystery right now. INSKEEP: Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, made a clearer statement that he used to make, although with lots of qualifiers, saying that he thought it was now beginning to spill over. Mr. WESSELL: Well, Alan Greenspan is history. What really matters now is what Ben Bernanke, the new Fed Chairman believes. And in a speech recently he made clear that he's worried that inflation is at the upper bound of what he and other Fed officials feel is comfortable. INSKEEP: Which is significant because he's the guy who might have the power to do something about that, which I guess would be raise interest rates. Mr. WESSELL: Absolutely. The financial markets interpreted his last statement as a clear signal that he's going to raise interest rates at the end of June, and now there's some speculation that he'll keep raising them after that, which is a change of view. People had been thinking he might take a pause because the economy seems to be slowing down. INSKEEP: Now, tomorrow we'll find out something more about inflation because the government will release its latest consumer price index. But at the same time there are some people who say that consumer price index does not fairly represent what people have to pay for things. Mr. WESSELL: That's right. I mean, every time I write a story in the Wall Street Journal about the consumer price index, someone writes me a letter saying, but that's not my experience. And I think that that reflects, sometimes, a misunderstanding of what the consumer price index actually is. It's an average. It's the price of a basket of goods and services that actually is typical of what no one person actually spends. I mean, for instance, college tuition is 1. 1 percent of the consumer price index basket. I have a daughter in college, and I can assure you that college tuition is far more than 1 percent of what I spend. So when they raise prices 6 or 8 percent, as they do, it's a much bigger increase in my personal inflation rate. But that doesn't mean the CPI is inaccurate. INSKEEP: So what does the Fed use to determine whether inflation is really going up and how much? Mr. WESSELL: What the Fed likes to do is look at both the consumer price index and another measure called the personal consumption expenditures index. It comes from another part of the government bureaucracy. And what they do is something that people always find baffling. They tend to strip out the price of food and the price of energy. Consumers find that nutty. After all, in our spending, what happens to food and energy prices is really important. But what the Fed is trying to do is say, what's the core rate of inflation that we can actually control with interest rates? And they have to accept that oil prices are very volatile and they have a lot more to do with what OPEC does than what Ben Bernanke does. And food prices are also volatile. They have a lot to do with the weather and stuff like that.  So they're trying to focus on that piece of inflation that they can control by raising or lowering interest rates. INSKEEP: What's happening with that piece of inflation? Mr. WESSELL: Well, that piece of inflation is creeping up, but only a little bit. And so that's the big question for the Fed. Can they let the energy price increase go through and not have it spill over? What they're seeing is just a little bit of that creeping into what's called core inflation, and that's what's got them so itchy. INSKEEP: So what are they likely to do? Mr. WESSELL: Well, I think the Fed has made pretty clear that they're likely to raise interest rates at the end of the month, unless there are some new developments that they don't expect. The question is, after that, will they be able to keep the inflation genie in the bottle or will they have to keep raising interest rates to keep the cork in? INSKEEP: David Wessell, the Wall Street Journal, thanks very much. Mr. WESSELL: You're welcome.     STEVE INSKEEP, host:   Today's business news cover the price of everything.  Fears of inflation have returned to the financial markets and to the Federal Reserve. Right now we're going to get the big picture on inflation and also the small picture, or a smaller picture anyway, what it means to your wallet.  We've brought in David Wessell, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal. David, good morning.  Mr. DAVID WESSELL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, Wall Street Journal): Good morning.  INSKEEP: And when we see fears of inflation, is inflation really going up?  Mr. WESSELL: Yes, inflation is definitely going up, largely because energy prices are up. Over the last 12 months, energy prices are up 18 percent, so the overall consumer price index is up 3. 5 percent for the 12 months ending in April, and that's somewhat higher than it's been.  The question is, is that spilling over into the prices of non-energy goods and services, and that's the big mystery right now.  INSKEEP: Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, made a clearer statement that he used to make, although with lots of qualifiers, saying that he thought it was now beginning to spill over.  Mr. WESSELL: Well, Alan Greenspan is history. What really matters now is what Ben Bernanke, the new Fed Chairman believes. And in a speech recently he made clear that he's worried that inflation is at the upper bound of what he and other Fed officials feel is comfortable.  INSKEEP: Which is significant because he's the guy who might have the power to do something about that, which I guess would be raise interest rates.  Mr. WESSELL: Absolutely. The financial markets interpreted his last statement as a clear signal that he's going to raise interest rates at the end of June, and now there's some speculation that he'll keep raising them after that, which is a change of view. People had been thinking he might take a pause because the economy seems to be slowing down.  INSKEEP: Now, tomorrow we'll find out something more about inflation because the government will release its latest consumer price index. But at the same time there are some people who say that consumer price index does not fairly represent what people have to pay for things.  Mr. WESSELL: That's right. I mean, every time I write a story in the Wall Street Journal about the consumer price index, someone writes me a letter saying, but that's not my experience. And I think that that reflects, sometimes, a misunderstanding of what the consumer price index actually is.  It's an average. It's the price of a basket of goods and services that actually is typical of what no one person actually spends. I mean, for instance, college tuition is 1. 1 percent of the consumer price index basket. I have a daughter in college, and I can assure you that college tuition is far more than 1 percent of what I spend. So when they raise prices 6 or 8 percent, as they do, it's a much bigger increase in my personal inflation rate. But that doesn't mean the CPI is inaccurate.  INSKEEP: So what does the Fed use to determine whether inflation is really going up and how much?  Mr. WESSELL: What the Fed likes to do is look at both the consumer price index and another measure called the personal consumption expenditures index.

After falling as recently as 2002, apartment rental rates are rising, especially in already high-cost areas.  More from NPR's Jack Speer. JACK SPEER reporting: Like many cities, Washington, D. C. has seen a construction boom in recent years. Lots of new condos. Lots of luxury apartment buildings. But even with the increase in supply, prices have been going up.  Showing off a one-bedroom apartment with den, marketing manager Alicia Panyard points out some of the apartment's features. Ms. ALICIA PANYARD (Marketing Manager, Meridian at Gallery Place): This is an example of a glass-enclosed balcony. I was saying all of the windows go to the ceilings. SPEER: Apartments in the Meridian at Gallery Place start at $1,600 a month and go to as much as $3,200 a month, and there are plenty of takers. The building is 95 percent occupied.  Property manager Paige Hughes says their rental rates have risen substantially over the past year. Now what would this apartment, roughly, go for? Ms. PAIGE HUGHES (Property Manager at Meridian at Gallery Place): 2450 for this particular unit. That increased, oh, wow, 2225 for the same floor plan.

Mr. MARK ZANDI (Analyst, Moody's Economy. com): With the higher interest rates it no longer is affordable for many people to buy a single family home, so rental demand has increased quite substantively. Vacancies have fallen, landlords now have some power and they're using it. They're raising rents on their units, and quite significantly. We're seeing rent increases of 5 to 10 percent in many key markets across the country. SPEER: But there is tremendous variation from market to market. Cities in Florida and California show the biggest increases, but according to one survey, rents were still flat or falling in Denver, Omaha, and Charlotte. Another survey indicates that when you average what's going on around the country and you examine what people actually pay, rents are going up about 3 percent, about the same as the government's main inflation gauge, the consumer price index. And while some consumer prices, including rents, are rising, there are some economists out there who wonder what all the fuss is about. Jim Glassman is with JP Morgan Chase.

In a dynamic economy, lots of things are up and lots of things are down. And broadly, it's a pretty tame story.

Stock markets around the world rebounded a bit today, a welcome respite after the previous week. That's when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost five percent of its value. It's now at a four month low. Worldwide markets are also down, in some countries, by more than 20 percent. Joining us from MARKETPLACE is John Dimsdale, and John, I thought we were just talking a month ago about markets hitting new highs. What happened? JOHN DIMSDALE reporting: That's right. Back in April and May, the stocks were almost getting back to the record levels they reached before the bubble burst in the late 90s. But there's been a big retreat just in the last few weeks, mostly on fears of inflation. Anybody who's been to the store recently, knows that prices have been going up. This morning, the Labor Department reported that the consumer price index for May jumped more than expected, even when you take out energy prices. So it's more than just gasoline. BRAND:  So the markets don't like that, what about the Fed? Does that mean it might take action and raise interest rates? DIMSDALE:  Probably, they meet at the end of this month and the consensus is now that they're going to raise rates another notch. And that raises another fear for stock traders. They wonder, could the Fed go too far and hurt the economy. You know, the world economy's been benefiting the last three years, or so, from easy money, low interest rates which encouraged borrowing for investments. As a consequence, global growth has been running at a good, strong four and a half percent. This period of easy money is coming to an end. Central bankers are raising interest rates to keep the economy from overheating, and that's especially true here in the U. S. Mark Zandi at Moody's Economy. com notes that the Fed has been gradually but steadily tightening their grip on interest rates and he expects one more notch on June 29th. Mr. MARK ZANDI (Moody's Economy. com):  If they push much beyond that, they run the risk of overdoing it, pushing the economy to an environment of much slower growth or creating some kind of financial event, which is historically, something that has occurred at this point in the business cycle. DIMSDALE:  That financial event that he and others are worried about is a recession. In the traditional business cycle after several years of a good economy, we're due for a slow down. BRAND:  John, President Bush at his news conference today said the economy is strong. There's good productivity, low unemployment, why is his assessment so different from the stock market's? DIMSDALE:  Well, he is right. The American economy has been growing strongly this year. Republicans being the party in power want some credit for that. And they're privately upset with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke for being so vocal about his inflation fears. The GOP is worried that the Fed's going to put the squeeze on the economy just as voters head to the polls in November. So President Bush wants to accentuate the positive.

S. housing market is not likely to crash, but it is entering a long period of stagnation, and the news is not good for buyers or sellers. That's according to a study published this week by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Nicolas Retsinas is the Center's director, and he joins me now. Good morning. Professor NICOLAS RETSINAS (Director, Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies): Good morning. WERTHEIMER: With real estate prices not moving up as fast as they have in the past few years, we're heading into a buyer's market. But still, lots of people feel they can't afford to buy. Now, why is that? Prof. RETSINAS: The market has changed. It was clearly a seller's market, and now buyers have more options. So price appreciation is slowing. At the same time, it's unlikely that prices will fall precipitously. And compounding the problem of potential buyers are rising interest rates. WERTHEIMER: Is this a regional thing? Is there a shortage of affordable housing that's more acute in some places than others? Prof. RETSINAS: Well, you're right. There are some parts of the country, Linda, where prices are still going up. But overall, prices are moderating. WERTHEIMER: So if you've kind of had it in mind that you're going to sell your house and make a windfall, have you missed the boat? Prof. RETSINAS: Depends how long you've had your home. If you've had your home for, say, the last three, four, five years, you've made a lot of money. Well, tomorrow you won't necessarily be much richer than the day before, but that doesn't mean you will have lost money. WERTHEIMER: If prices are going down, though, you're still not predicting a crash. You're talking about a soft landing. Prof. RETSINAS: Right. We did some research, looking at when in our recent history prices have gone down substantially. That is, nominal price declines of at least five percent, and we found that two factors that are most related to that are overbuilding and oversupply of homes, and job losses. Well, there are parts of the United States where there has been some overbuilding, but, overall, it has not been widespread. And secondly, our economy continues to produce jobs, so there haven't been widespread job losses. Absent those two factors working together, we don't think there'd be a precipitous price correction. WERTHEIMER: What do you think the effect of the housing slow-down will be overall on this economy? Prof. RETSINAS: Well, it certainly won't provide the boost to the economy it has. We've had such a run of refinancing and home equity loans and transactions. All of that puts money at the consumers' pockets, and we know consumers spend money when it's in their pocket. So consumer spending is likely to slow. Business spending is up, so that will offset some of that. But clearly housing will not provide that boost to the economy that it's had over the last four or five years. WERTHEIMER: What about the longer term? Are you optimistic or not? Prof. RETSINAS: Well, we are relatively bullish over the long term, because we think a key predictor of the housing market is the rate of household formation. That is, how many households do we form? And according to our projections over the next ten years, we'll form about two million more households than we did over the previous ten years. That suggests strong demand. There continue to be, in many markets, restraints on supply, and as a result we think, over the long term, the housing will rebound and prices again will start to go up. WERTHEIMER: So you're talking about the children of the baby boom get married and move into houses. Prof. RETSINAS: Eventually, they will. And the other thing that's happening, of course, is we still have the residue of an incredible amount of immigration over the last five or six years. And the immigrants who came in yesterday are going to be the homebuyers of tomorrow. WERTHEIMER: Nicolas Retsinas, thanks very much. Prof. RETSINAS: My pleasure.

President Bush hasn't received a lot of credit for the country's economic growth, and here's the reason why: wage increases have not kept up with inflation. That's the conclusion of a report out today. MARKETPLACE New York Bureau chief Bob Moon joins us with more. And Bob, previous numbers showed that incomes did stay just ahead of inflation. This one says the opposite. Tell us more. BOB MOON reporting: Well, you're right, Madeleine. Indeed, there are government numbers that indicate the median income level is staying just ahead of rising prices. But the Bloomberg News Service has been comparing different numbers from various sources, and this report today suggests that it's not just a matter of keeping up with the Jones's for most Americans these days. It's tough just to keep up with the cost of living, period. According to this report, the vast majority of Americans are seeing their wage gains evaporate because of accelerating inflation. In the latest example, Bloomberg points to the new Labor Department figures that were out just last week. They show wages adjusted for inflation actually fell last month by almost three quarters of a percentage point. In fact, Bloomberg says pay has been flat or has declined in more than half of the 65 months since President Bush took office in January of 2001. BRAND: And critics are also complaining that the wealthiest Americans are the ones who are benefiting the most. MOON: Yeah, that's the disparity in these numbers. Just last month, the jobless rate was back down to just 4. 6 percent. That's the lowest level since July of 2001. But for some time, Bush's critics have been complaining about the quality of the new jobs being created. And these numbers that Bloomberg has put together do suggest that the rich are getting richer while most of the rest are falling behind. If you can follow along with a little of the math behind this, figures from the Federal Reserve show that median incomes adjusted for inflation actually fell half a percent over the same period that they were increasing for the richest 10 percent of Americans. Well, that skewed the overall number higher, if you will. It was enough to show that the median income level for quote/unquote \"all families\" stayed ahead of inflation. BRAND: I see. So any indication that - other indications of an improving economy, lower unemployment, things like that - having any affect on the president's approval ratings? MOON: Well, good question. There wasn't much sign of that in an Associated Press IPSO's poll a couple of weeks ago. Seventy percent of those surveyed said the country was on the wrong track, and that included 60 percent who said that they disapproved of the way that President Bush has been handling the economy, that even though the jobless rate is down - and a survey by the business group, The Conference Board, shows that most American consumers don't expect their incomes to be rising before the end of the year. Today in the MARKETPLACE newsroom, we're crunching the financial numbers on soccer's World Cup. BRAND: Thank you, Bob. Bob Moon of public radio's daily business show, MARKETPLACE. It's produced by American Public Media.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  Back now with DAY TO DAY. President Bush hasn't received a lot of credit for the country's economic growth, and here's the reason why: wage increases have not kept up with inflation. That's the conclusion of a report out today. MARKETPLACE New York Bureau chief Bob Moon joins us with more. And Bob, previous numbers showed that incomes did stay just ahead of inflation. This one says the opposite. Tell us more.  BOB MOON reporting:  Well, you're right, Madeleine. Indeed, there are government numbers that indicate the median income level is staying just ahead of rising prices. But the Bloomberg News Service has been comparing different numbers from various sources, and this report today suggests that it's not just a matter of keeping up with the Jones's for most Americans these days. It's tough just to keep up with the cost of living, period. According to this report, the vast majority of Americans are seeing their wage gains evaporate because of accelerating inflation. In the latest example, Bloomberg points to the new Labor Department figures that were out just last week. They show wages adjusted for inflation actually fell last month by almost three quarters of a percentage point. In fact, Bloomberg says pay has been flat or has declined in more than half of the 65 months since President Bush took office in January of 2001.  BRAND: And critics are also complaining that the wealthiest Americans are the ones who are benefiting the most.  MOON: Yeah, that's the disparity in these numbers. Just last month, the jobless rate was back down to just 4. 6 percent. That's the lowest level since July of 2001. But for some time, Bush's critics have been complaining about the quality of the new jobs being created.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. A few weeks ago, we did a program on the job prospects for this year's college graduates. And by most accounts, 2006 is a terrific year for them. Data vary by region and profession, but many companies are hiring more new college grads and paying them higher salaries. Unfortunately, the prospects do not look so good for the high school seniors who plan to enter the workforce as soon as they graduate. About a third of high school grads do not go onto college, and a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies predicts many of them will have trouble finding a job this summer. An expanding teenage population flooded the job market, the report says. There's an influx of immigrant labor and increased competition from college grads and unemployed adults. Today, we'll take a look at this job market for new high school graduates. We'll talk with an economist about who is hiring and what skills are in demand, and with the president of a company who's having a hard time finding skilled employees for his construction company. Later in the program, a community college course that's a boot camp for would-be animal trainers. But first, the job prospects for today's high school grads. If you graduated high school in the past year or so, call and tell us about your experience with the job search. If you're an employer, what jobs are you looking to fill, and what skills do candidates need? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@NPR. org. And we start in Conklin, New York, where high school senior Joe Ostrowsky joins us. Hi, Joe. Welcome to the program. Mr. JOE OSTROWSKY (Senior, Susquehanna Valley High School): Hi, how are you? CONAN: I'm good. You're graduating this Saturday? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yes. CONAN: From Susquehanna Valley High School there in Conklin. Congratulations. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Thank you. CONAN: Now, I understand you're not planning to go to college, at least not right away. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Nope. CONAN: What are you doing? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, right now I've got a job at Vector Marketing. CONAN: Mm hmm. Mr. OSTROWSKY: And I'm a sales rep for a Cutco. CONAN: Cutco makes knives, right? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yep, Cutco Knives. CONAN: And you sell them door-to-door? Mr. OSTROWSKY: No. I go to people's houses that I know first, and they give me references. After that, they come. They set up an appointment with me. CONAN: Mm hmm. Mr. OSTROWSKY: (unintelligible) CONAN: That's kind of door-to-door, but I guess there's a difference between going someplace where you have an appointment and just knocking - a cold knock on the door. But how does that work out in terms of money? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Oh, it works really great. I get paid no matter what. There's a base pay. . . CONAN: Mm hmm. Mr. OSTROWSKY: . . . which is $16. 25. And, of course, if I sell, I get a commission. CONAN: And is this what you want to do for a career? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, I'm looking into it. I just started last week, and I'm loving it so far. CONAN: Aha. I understand, though, you have another aim - a dream, maybe. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yes. I want to be a standup comedian. CONAN: Well, if you're doing salesman work, I think you're collecting material. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Oh, yes, I am. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: You want to be a standup comedian. So do they have an improv club there in - well, you must be around Binghamton, New York, somewhere. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yeah. CONAN: Yeah. Do they - so is that place you could go and tryout? Mr. OSTROWSKY: I think there is. I think there's a Giggles Comedy Club somewhere around here, and I'm just going to, like, travel all over and try to find some places to go because I have an open schedule. CONAN: Aha. Oh, so you can do these appointments whenever the people are home or whenever's convenient. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Exactly. I set my own schedule, so if I don't want to work today, I don't have to. But you get what you put into it, so I work a lot. I work really hard, and it really pays off. CONAN: Yeah, the ideal is you may not have to, but, of course, you do if you want to get paid. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. OSTROWSKY: Exactly. CONAN: What about your friends, the other kids graduating with you on Saturday? Most of them going onto college, or most of them going to be looking for work like you? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Most of them are going to college, actually. There's people going to community colleges. There's people that already have scholarships and. . . CONAN: I'm sure that you know, basically, that if you go on to college and graduate with a degree, a four-year college, I think the figures - you end up with an average salary of $51,000-plus, as opposed to if you don't, when your salary's likely to be something around 28. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, I don't really - I do believe that, because, yes, that is true, but I'm so passionate about my comedy career and I know I can do it if I just go out there and work hard. And I work hard with this job, I think I can make more than what they say I'm going to make. CONAN: And is there a plan B? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, plan B really is this marketing job. I mean, my plan A is to be a comedian. CONAN: Right. Mr. OSTROWSKY: And I also have a - I also took a civil service test for a state job. CONAN: Ah, that's plan C. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yeah, plan C. I have backup plans all over, just in case. CONAN: So have you heard about the results of the civil service exam yet? Mr. OSTROWSKY: Not yet. It should be coming in very shortly, because it's been 90 - it's about 60 days already, and it takes 90 to 60, 60 to 90 days for them to grade the test. So I'm just waiting for my results. CONAN: Sixty to 90 days. You're already learning about the civil service. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yep. CONAN: Yep. Well, good luck to you, and congratulations, again, on graduating on Saturday. Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, thank you. CONAN: Joe Ostrowsky will graduate from Susquehanna Valley High School, and, as you heard, hopes to be a standup comedian one day. Just remember, you heard him here first. He spoke with us from his home in Conklin, New York. Joining us now is Andrew Sum, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. He's with us from the studios of member station WBUR in Boston. Nice to have you on the program today. Excuse me, we're still trying to find Professor Sum. And is he there? Professor ANDREW SUM (Director, Center for Labor Market Studies, North Eastern University): Yes. CONAN: Ah, there you are. Okay. Prof. SUM: Yes. CONAN: Welcome to the program. Nice to talk to you. Prof. SUM: Thank you very much, Neal. CONAN: And I gather - I don't know if you've been listening - but Joe's situation is not that common amongst today's high school graduates. Prof. SUM: I would say his current situation is not that common in several respects - not in terms of his ability to get a job, although it's become, in the last few years, somewhat more difficult. . . CONAN: Mm hmm. Prof. SUM: . . . but in terms of Joe's expected pay. If I understood Joe correctly, he was implying that he had a base pay, I think he said, of $16. 50, while I was listening to him. CONAN: Mm hmm. Prof. SUM: And that rate of pay would be more than double what the average starting wage is for a high school graduate. CONAN: I think that's per home visit. . . Prof. SUM: Ah, okay. CONAN: . . . and, obviously, it may take a while to get to the home and then get to the next one. . . Prof. SUM: Okay. Okay. CONAN: . . . so whether that's per hour or not is debatable. Prof. SUM: Okay, yeah, that's what I wasn't sure of. The other thing is that Joe's job is held - a job like that is held by about one in 10 newly hired high school graduates, based on the last few years' experience of doing sales or customer service rep. But, like I said, I wasn't sure what Joe's hours or rate of pay were. CONAN: Well, it seemed that he was most interested in the flexibility, and, of course, he makes some money selling Costco Knives, but I think that he can go around and perhaps pursue his other interests as well. In terms of the job market, though, for high school graduates, not so good this year? Post-Broadcast Correction: The correct name of the product is Cutco knives, not Costco Knives. Prof. SUM: Well, Neal, I would say that the picture is, in some ways, a little mixed. The labor market for new high school graduates in the last five years has been very difficult relative to where young people were at the end of the boom of the 1999, 2000. Job prospects for teenagers and young adults fell far more precipitously than for any other age group in the economy. In the last year, though, for the first time since 2000, we began to observe an improvement in the ability of teenagers and young high school grads to get jobs, and we expect that this summer will be also a little bit better than what situation - and this fall will be a little bit better than what it was last year. But that'll still put young people at - still fairly far down where they were. Let me just give you two numbers to put that in perspective, Neal. Last summer, high school graduates who were not in college - young high school graduates who were not in college - worked at about a 57 percent rate, 57 out of every 100 were able to obtain some type of job. And by the time you get to the fall in October, the employment rate for the kids who did not - like Joe said, were not going to go on to college - was running about 62. Sixty-two out of every 100 versus 70 percent, oh, just five years ago. So in that sense, the labor market has - we kind of like bottomed out in 2003, 2004. We had not seen much movement in 2005. But in the last six months, young workers have been, for the first time, been able to pick up some of the increased share of jobs that the economy's been generating. So that's why I do not discourage young people. I would say there are more jobs out there today than was true last year. There are more jobs vacant today than was true last year. But you'll also still find that you face a fairly high number of competitors for available work. So it'll still take, you know, a lot of hard work to find the job of your choosing. CONAN: Well, let's get listeners involved in the conversation. Our number, again: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. If you graduated high school in the past year or so, what has your job search been like? If you're an employer, what kind of employees are you looking for? Are you hiring? And let's talk with Bodie(ph), Bodie's calling us from Boise, Idaho. BODIE (Caller): Hi, I'm - my name's Bodie, and I manage a firefighting company out of Boise, Idaho called Patrick Corporation. CONAN: Uh huh. BODIE: And we're hiring right now, and we want anyone who's graduated high school, college, who's interested in a new, exciting career in the wild land firefighting industry. And we travel all over the country, pretty much been to all the states fighting fire, except for maybe like the Northeast. CONAN: So this sounds like one of those companies that fights wildfires. BODIE: Yeah, we do wildfire, and then we help out with the hurricanes and stuff, too. CONAN: And how much does it pay? BODIE: We start out at $7. 39 an hour, plus the first 40 hours every week, we give out health benefit of $2. 83. . . CONAN: And. . . BODIE: . . . and after 40 hours, it goes off, because we usually work an average of 60 to 120 hours a week. CONAN: And if you're off in - not in there at home base in Boise, Idaho - but off in Wyoming or Alaska or wherever, presumably, they get paid room and board as well. BODIE: Yeah, that's correct. CONAN: Yeah, let me just ask Andrew Sum, is Bodie offering competitive rates there? Prof. SUM: The salary for Idaho was probably in the ballpark of what the average grad has been getting there. And Bodie said he was located out in a state that has one of the three highest employment rates for young high school graduates in the country. CONAN: So it might make sense is why he's looking for workers, yeah. Prof. SUM: Absolutely, Idaho stands right near, right near the top - tied actually with number two with North Dakota last year. CONAN: And, Bodie, are you finding it difficult, thereby, to get young people who are qualified? BODIE: Yeah, like I think because of the construction industry, we've been getting less applicants than we normally do. CONAN: Mm hmm. BODIE: And, I mean, like first few years that we're here in Boise, we were getting lots and lots, just like overwhelmed - hundreds and hundreds of applicants, 40 to 50 a day. And right now, it's maybe like five to 10 people are coming in and applying. And out of that, like maybe one or two meet our qualifications. CONAN: So you're thinking about raising your pay, or something else to attract more applicants? BODIE: We've begun to diversify, like our advertisements. We're starting this kind of - we've just been doing newspaper ads, and now we're going to put up flyers, and maybe something on the Internet, and kind of expand in that way. CONAN: Well, thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it. And good luck to you, especially good luck when you're out on the job. That's - it's difficult and dangerous work. BODIE: Thank you very much. CONAN: Bodie calling us from Boise, Idaho. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Andrew Sum, who's a professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. If you'd like to join the conversation about jobs and the job market for new high school graduates, 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is I'm Neal Conan. We'll be back after the break. It's the TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. This is graduation season, and many of this year's high school seniors are, or soon will be, out looking for jobs. So if you graduated this year or last year, maybe the year before, how's the job search going for you? If you're an employer, what's the market like? Who are you hiring? What qualifications do you look like? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. E-mail, talk@npr. org. Our guest is Andrew Sum, professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. Let's get another caller on the line. This is Jason, Jason's with us from Athens, Ohio. JASON (Caller): Hi, Neal, thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. JASON: I guess on this program, I'm going to be like a voice of experience since I graduated in the late '80s from high school, and chose not to go on to college. CONAN: Mm hmm. JASON: At that time, I went in the military, got some good training in the military. It wasn't infantry-type training. It was actual electronics training. CONAN: Mm hmm. JASON: Did that for five years, and then went into the IT computer field, which I did up until 2004. Most of my training at that time was on-the-job training by people who were willing to give me the training. And I actually had some pretty good jobs. In 2004, I quit my job to be an at-home healthcare giver for my parents. Since moving to this area and leaving my job, I've been applying for jobs that I could've written the job application for to describe exactly what I have done for the past 12 to 14 years now. And because I have not had a college degree of any sort, they - I've basically been given the cold shoulder, not even getting responses. The responses I do get say we've found somebody who better fits the position. CONAN: The qualifications, meaning somebody with a sheepskin. I just wonder -we'll go to Andrew Sum to get a bigger picture answer on this - but does anybody count the fact that you're a veteran into the equation? JASON: Are you talking to me, Neal? CONAN: Yeah. JASON: I have not had any feedback at all from the fact that I'm a veteran, or the training that I received in the military - which was a high-level electronics training - for the last 10 years or so has been basically ignored. Now, my experience from the past 14 years has been in the IT field, but these days - it seems like once I got out of the system where. . . CONAN: Mm hmm. JASON: . . . it was accepted that my experience was valuable - when I apply for jobs these days and do not have a college degree, I think that the basic feeling is well, we can get somebody directly out of college who has a four-year degree and pay them a lot less. And we know that, you know, they do have that piece of paper on the wall, which I do not have. CONAN: Yeah, Andrew Sum, Jason's experience - well you'd think IT is a field where experience would matter more than actual - you know, especially after you've been working 10 or 12 years. Prof. SUM: Neal, I would agree. What Jason's predicament is, is partly that he explains that there has been, you know, unfortunately, a relative surplus of IT workers in the last few years after the boom ended. And employers, until recently, you know, have had more choice over whom they would like to hire for existing positions. The only thing that I would say is to Jason, is to continue to go out and push your experience and your track record on that, because, overall, most employers still do place a high priority on that. And what you may have to do is adjust your wage somewhat to make yourself more competitive. But young people who have a lot of experience and a lot of training, on average, do just as well in the labor market as, you know, as young college graduates coming out of school. CONAN: Mm hmm. Prof. SUM: So I would just suggest that on the job search strategy, again, keep pushing the experience record and keep your wage a little flexible to prove what you know on the job. CONAN: Or, Jason, I guess the other alternative might be to go back to school. JASON: Well that's what I'm looking at now. When you're 37, 38 years old and you really need the income, it's a little difficult. But at this point, I'm kind of looking at retraining, getting into something that's more in demand right now, I guess. The demand for IT has went down. It seems like there's been a glut of people coming directly out of college with a computer science degree, and they can get, basically, anybody they want with any degree for a very small salary. CONAN: Okay, well, Jason, good luck to you. JASON: Thank you very much. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. We wanted to hear from an employer on this, so joining us now is Billy Harper. He's the president of Harper Industries, a nationwide commercial and industrial construction company with over 1,000 employees. He's with us today from his office in Paducah, Kentucky. Very good of you to take the time to speak with us. Mr. BILLY HARPER (President, Harper Industries): Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity. CONAN: With a company of your size, you must find yourself with quite a few job openings. Mr. HARPER: We do, and unfortunately, it's hard to fill some of them. And the other side is it's neat that our industry is booming right now, so as we fill them, we have more demand. CONAN: So you have jobs open right now? Mr. HARPER: We do. We probably have somewhere between 25 and 50 jobs at this point that we could fill. CONAN: To do what? Mr. HARPER: Oh, anywhere from ready mix truck drivers, to construction crews that would be willing to travel, to some support personnel in office estimating project management. CONAN: And would a high school graduate qualify for one of these jobs? Mr. HARPER: In some cases, particularly depending on age. If they could get a commercial driver's license that would certainly provide opportunity to start in the - onsite with truck driving and ready mix trucks. Also, there's some openings for construction laborers. And then other positions they could work their way up to. CONAN: Mm hmm. And at this point, what skills are you looking for? I mean, beyond those actual accomplishments like, you know, a commercial driver's license? Mr. HARPER: Well, you're always looking for the soft skills: somebody who knows how to show up and work on time and be there every day, be presentable to the public - those sort of things - as well as being able to communicate, and in many cases, have at least basic operational fundamentals of computers and keyboard. CONAN: So it sounds like the attendance record is something you might look at pretty closely on a transcript. Mr. HARPER: Absolutely. We probably lose more people over attendance, either tardiness or being late, and drug tests, than any other issue. CONAN: Really? Mr. HARPER: Unfortunately, that's true. CONAN: Huh. So if somebody presents themselves well, show - you know, gives some sign that they're willing to show up on time and have a good work ethic, that's usually pretty good enough for you? Mr. HARPER: That gives us a definite starting point. And then, obviously, the stronger their skills and the more development they have, then they can move as far as they're willing to go. CONAN: Mm hmm. And can - is there opportunity to move up the ladder? Mr. HARPER: Absolutely. We have everywhere from CEOs of our companies to operational people - some people still in the ranks, all of them with high school diplomas, and very capable in their areas. CONAN: Let's get a caller in on this conversation. And let me just do that because I hit the wrong key there. And here is Dawn, Dawn calling us from Tulsa, Oklahoma. DAWN (Caller): Hi, Neal. I love your show. Thank you for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. DAWN: As an employer, I own an upscale fitness center, and I have - during the summertime, after graduation - probably a dozen or so students or graduates come to my facility looking for work. And most of these young people come to the door not prepared to visit with me regarding a job. They come dressed -girls in shorts and halter tops, guys in jeans and flip-flops and t-shirts. None of them have resumes, and my question is: what is being done in high school to groom and prepare these young people to go out and properly search for a job? CONAN: Hmm. It's interesting. Billy Harper, it sounds like a variation of the same problem you have with some of your applicants from high school. DAWN: That's correct. CONAN: Yeah. Billy Harper, are you still there? Mr. HARPER: I'm here. CONAN: Yeah. Does that sound - does Dawn's experience sound familiar to you? Mr. HARPER: Unfortunately, it is. And, again, the soft skills and just walking in and knowing how to present themselves with a resume and that sort of thing. So, there's definitely some training needed on that part, and how to interview, how to speak, would certainly help a lot of them. Because many of these students have a lot of capability that we just don't see in an interview. CONAN: Yeah. Andrew Sum, let me ask you Dawn's question, and that is - don't high school's train people to go out and prepare for real world job interviews? Prof. SUM: Well, Neal, I'm glad that topic came up, because I've involved with school-to-work programs for more than 20 years. There are programs around the country, part of Jobs for America's Graduates Network that works with young high school students to help prepare them for jobs. Every aspect, from resume preparation, interviewing, soft skill development, basic skills development. We have programs in Boston that the Private Industry Council runs that does that. And I would suggest to both Dawn and to the gentleman from Harper's Construction that - I know there are similar programs like that in Kentucky -that he contact the school-to-career programs that do this type of training very well, the Jobs for Kentucky Graduates program that does that. And there are a number of vocational technical programs that provide a lot of co-op education experience to their students so they're generally prepared with work experience when they graduate. So there are avenues in which this can be done. But I would agree with both of them in that these programs I'm talking about really need to be expanded to a considerable degree. We only touch a very small subset of all the students that'll be entering the labor market. But there are a number of programs doing this, aiming at exactly those sets of skills and - but there's clearly, as they say, a good deal more work that needs to be done here. CONAN: And Dawn, I assume that every once in a while, some of these kids actually work out and do okay. DAWN: That's true, and what's sad is those are the exception. So, I hope, you know, a lot of these kids probably have a lot of potential, but I just feel like they haven't had the guidance. CONAN: Dawn, thanks very much for the call, and good luck with this year's hiring round. And Billy Harper, as you look ahead, do you see this problem getting better or getting worse? Mr. HARPER: I think it will get better. Kentucky has just passed some legislation recently where this is going to be injected into the high school curriculum. So, we're starting to move to help these students present themselves to the public in the key scholarships and things that we're doing. So, there are steps being made to move forward. It's just we can no longer just turn our hand in the sand. I think businesses have got to continue communicating with the school system to make sure it gets done. CONAN: And to make sure that they know what employers actually want in terms of their hires. Mr. HARPER: Exactly. CONAN: Billy Harper thanks very much, and good luck to you as well. Mr. HARPER: Thank you very much. CONAN: Billy Harper, president of Harper Industries, which is a nationwide commercial and industrial construction company. And he called us today - we called him, actually, at his office in Paducah, Kentucky. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is John. John calling from Phoenix, Arizona. JOHN (Caller): Hi, yes, this is John Mitchell, actually. I just wanted to say that my company offers something that might be useful to employers. I think we're the only company in the country that does this. We actually recruit for -on behalf of companies hourly workers, high school graduates, and we provide an assessment that measures somebody's soft skills that some of your previous callers were asking for. Things like tenure, drug avoidance, supervisory skills. We have a 64 question psychological assessment that once they pass, we forward those applications on to prospective employers. And we do a very good job of connecting some, you know, underprivileged kids, as well as, you know, just normal high school kids who don't know how to go out and find some of these positions. And we help employers, because we can do it for several of them and we can kind of more economically recruit those applicants on their behalf. CONAN: Mm hmm. And there's a commercial character to this or is this a - or do you do this - you know, is this for a profit company? JOHN: Well, some of - it is a for-profit company. We do donate our technology. We have 22 job boards. We donate our technology to several non-profit organizations to help those kids find jobs. And we also charge employers kind of on a per applicant basis, you know, for those applications. CONAN: Andrew Sum, that sounds like a kind of an extension to what you were talking about. Prof. SUM: Yes it is. Some of the work that John was referring to is done by a number of these other programs as well. Although, they don't go into - always into the same degree on the psychological testing, which I know a number of firms themselves are doing. But, Neal, let me just ask John this, as well. While the issue of soft skills clearly is sighted by many employers as an obstacle to hiring young people, one of the problems we have is that the way you acquire soft skills often is by learning how to work. So when you don't work in high school, it's harder for you to have skills to present to employers. And one of the major problems we've had, Neal, is that in the last five years, the employment rate among high school students in the country has fallen to an all-time low, since the end of World War II. So, what we've been failing to do is provide more young people in their sophomore, junior, senior year a chance to acquire the jobs, the soft skills, the hard skills. Make it easier for them to transition that labor market. And it would be easier for John as well and his company to match them to existing jobs. CONAN: Okay. Prof. SUM: So, we need to do a better job on all three of these fronts, but his assistance and the type of work he's doing is clearly a desirable intermediary approach. CONAN: John, thank you very much. Good luck. JOHN: Thank you. CONAN: We're talking about high school graduates and the search for work, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's talk with Maria. Maria's calling us from Portland, Oregon. MARIA (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi. MARIA: Hi. Yes. I was calling because being a mother of three children and having sent two of them to college, I know how expensive it is to go to college. And we usually, through conversations, we tend to discourage -especially I concentrate on Hispanic children - on either not keeping the skills of being bilingual or not dreaming to go to college, because it's too expensive. And actually being bilingual is an additional skill that probably they usually don't tend to give credit themselves for. CONAN: I see. Yeah. They tend to think, of course I can do that. MARIA: Well, they never think of how important it is. And it usually takes five years of college or more to be good at expressing yourself well in Spanish, and you don't have the culture behind it. And these children have both. And nobody reminds them how important it is and how many employers will take them first just because they're bilingual. I was born and raised in Mexico, came here when I was 21. And right now I have three jobs, and mainly because I'm bilingual. And one of them is a lesson instructor teaching Spanish non-credit classes. The other one is as an interpreter at a hospital. And my very first one that I got through a big HMO was because I was bilingual. And I've learned too many skills just by working with this many companies, and after you experience that then you can choose what you want to do. CONAN: Maria, that's a great suggestion. Thanks very much. And I just wonder, Andrew Sum, like her bilingual students and her bilingual children, kids don't all the time give themselves credit for what they actually can do. Prof. SUM: I think this is partly true, Neal. That young people oftentimes do have more skills than they suggest. And by the way, there is research support for Maria's view that bilingualism does have a separate favorable economic payoff for the people that possess it. At the same time - particularly given the fact that a larger share of our high school students are Hispanic - the evidence, though, is overwhelming that being strongly grounded in English speaking skills is one of the most overwhelming determinants of the success of Hispanic and other immigrant students. So, I would say a strong base in English first, combined with a strong base in Spanish, gives you an added advantage in the labor market. CONAN: Maria, thanks very much. Appreciate it. MARIA: Thank you. Bye bye. CONAN: Bye bye. And we'd like to thank Andrew Sum for his time today. Good of you to join us in the studio. Prof. SUM: You're welcome Neal. It's a pleasure to be here. CONAN: Andrew Sum, Professor of Economics and Director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. And he spoke with us today from the studios of our member station in Boston, Massachusetts, WBUR. When we come back from a short break: graduates of a different sort: from a boot camp for want-to-be animal trainers. If you have questions about the ways that animals are trained, give us a call: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Email is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. A few weeks ago, we did a program on the job prospects for this year's college graduates. And by most accounts, 2006 is a terrific year for them. Data vary by region and profession, but many companies are hiring more new college grads and paying them higher salaries.  Unfortunately, the prospects do not look so good for the high school seniors who plan to enter the workforce as soon as they graduate. About a third of high school grads do not go onto college, and a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies predicts many of them will have trouble finding a job this summer. An expanding teenage population flooded the job market, the report says. There's an influx of immigrant labor and increased competition from college grads and unemployed adults.  Today, we'll take a look at this job market for new high school graduates. We'll talk with an economist about who is hiring and what skills are in demand, and with the president of a company who's having a hard time finding skilled employees for his construction company.  Later in the program, a community college course that's a boot camp for would-be animal trainers. But first, the job prospects for today's high school grads. If you graduated high school in the past year or so, call and tell us about your experience with the job search. If you're an employer, what jobs are you looking to fill, and what skills do candidates need?  Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@NPR. org. And we start in Conklin, New York, where high school senior Joe Ostrowsky joins us. Hi, Joe. Welcome to the program.  Mr. JOE OSTROWSKY (Senior, Susquehanna Valley High School): Hi, how are you?  CONAN: I'm good. You're graduating this Saturday?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yes.  CONAN: From Susquehanna Valley High School there in Conklin. Congratulations.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Thank you.  CONAN: Now, I understand you're not planning to go to college, at least not right away.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Nope.  CONAN: What are you doing?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, right now I've got a job at Vector Marketing.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: And I'm a sales rep for a Cutco.  CONAN: Cutco makes knives, right?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yep, Cutco Knives.  CONAN: And you sell them door-to-door?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: No. I go to people's houses that I know first, and they give me references. After that, they come. They set up an appointment with me.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: (unintelligible)  CONAN: That's kind of door-to-door, but I guess there's a difference between going someplace where you have an appointment and just knocking - a cold knock on the door. But how does that work out in terms of money?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Oh, it works really great. I get paid no matter what. There's a base pay. . .  CONAN: Mm hmm.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: . . . which is $16. 25. And, of course, if I sell, I get a commission.  CONAN: And is this what you want to do for a career?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, I'm looking into it. I just started last week, and I'm loving it so far.  CONAN: Aha. I understand, though, you have another aim - a dream, maybe.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yes. I want to be a standup comedian.  CONAN: Well, if you're doing salesman work, I think you're collecting material.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Oh, yes, I am.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: You want to be a standup comedian. So do they have an improv club there in - well, you must be around Binghamton, New York, somewhere.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yeah.  CONAN: Yeah. Do they - so is that place you could go and tryout?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: I think there is. I think there's a Giggles Comedy Club somewhere around here, and I'm just going to, like, travel all over and try to find some places to go because I have an open schedule.  CONAN: Aha. Oh, so you can do these appointments whenever the people are home or whenever's convenient.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Exactly. I set my own schedule, so if I don't want to work today, I don't have to. But you get what you put into it, so I work a lot. I work really hard, and it really pays off.  CONAN: Yeah, the ideal is you may not have to, but, of course, you do if you want to get paid.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Exactly.  CONAN: What about your friends, the other kids graduating with you on Saturday? Most of them going onto college, or most of them going to be looking for work like you?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Most of them are going to college, actually. There's people going to community colleges. There's people that already have scholarships and. . .  CONAN: I'm sure that you know, basically, that if you go on to college and graduate with a degree, a four-year college, I think the figures - you end up with an average salary of $51,000-plus, as opposed to if you don't, when your salary's likely to be something around 28.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, I don't really - I do believe that, because, yes, that is true, but I'm so passionate about my comedy career and I know I can do it if I just go out there and work hard. And I work hard with this job, I think I can make more than what they say I'm going to make.  CONAN: And is there a plan B?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, plan B really is this marketing job. I mean, my plan A is to be a comedian.  CONAN: Right.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: And I also have a - I also took a civil service test for a state job.  CONAN: Ah, that's plan C.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yeah, plan C. I have backup plans all over, just in case.  CONAN: So have you heard about the results of the civil service exam yet?  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Not yet. It should be coming in very shortly, because it's been 90 - it's about 60 days already, and it takes 90 to 60, 60 to 90 days for them to grade the test. So I'm just waiting for my results.  CONAN: Sixty to 90 days. You're already learning about the civil service.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Yep.  CONAN: Yep. Well, good luck to you, and congratulations, again, on graduating on Saturday.  Mr. OSTROWSKY: Well, thank you.  CONAN: Joe Ostrowsky will graduate from Susquehanna Valley High School, and, as you heard, hopes to be a standup comedian one day. Just remember, you heard him here first. He spoke with us from his home in Conklin, New York.  Joining us now is Andrew Sum, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. He's with us from the studios of member station WBUR in Boston. Nice to have you on the program today.  Excuse me, we're still trying to find Professor Sum. And is he there?  Professor ANDREW SUM (Director, Center for Labor Market Studies, North Eastern University): Yes.  CONAN: Ah, there you are. Okay.  Prof. SUM: Yes.  CONAN: Welcome to the program. Nice to talk to you.  Prof. SUM: Thank you very much, Neal.  CONAN: And I gather - I don't know if you've been listening - but Joe's situation is not that common amongst today's high school graduates.  Prof. SUM: I would say his current situation is not that common in several respects - not in terms of his ability to get a job, although it's become, in the last few years, somewhat more difficult. . .  CONAN: Mm hmm.  Prof. SUM: . . . but in terms of Joe's expected pay. If I understood Joe correctly, he was implying that he had a base pay, I think he said, of $16. 50, while I was listening to him.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  Prof. SUM: And that rate of pay would be more than double what the average starting wage is for a high school graduate.  CONAN: I think that's per home visit. . .  Prof. SUM: Ah, okay.  CONAN: . . . and, obviously, it may take a while to get to the home and then get to the next one. . .  Prof. SUM: Okay. Okay.  CONAN: . . . so whether that's per hour or not is debatable.  Prof. SUM: Okay, yeah, that's what I wasn't sure of. The other thing is that Joe's job is held - a job like that is held by about one in 10 newly hired high school graduates, based on the last few years' experience of doing sales or customer service rep. But, like I said, I wasn't sure what Joe's hours or rate of pay were.  CONAN: Well, it seemed that he was most interested in the flexibility, and, of course, he makes some money selling Costco Knives, but I think that he can go around and perhaps pursue his other interests as well. In terms of the job market, though, for high school graduates, not so good this year? Post-Broadcast Correction: The correct name of the product is Cutco knives, not Costco Knives.  Prof. SUM: Well, Neal, I would say that the picture is, in some ways, a little mixed. The labor market for new high school graduates in the last five years has been very difficult relative to where young people were at the end of the boom of the 1999, 2000. Job prospects for teenagers and young adults fell far more precipitously than for any other age group in the economy.  In the last year, though, for the first time since 2000, we began to observe an improvement in the ability of teenagers and young high school grads to get jobs, and we expect that this summer will be also a little bit better than what situation - and this fall will be a little bit better than what it was last year. But that'll still put young people at - still fairly far down where they were.  Let me just give you two numbers to put that in perspective, Neal. Last summer, high school graduates who were not in college - young high school graduates who were not in college - worked at about a 57 percent rate, 57 out of every 100 were able to obtain some type of job. And by the time you get to the fall in October, the employment rate for the kids who did not - like Joe said, were not going to go on to college - was running about 62. Sixty-two out of every 100 versus 70 percent, oh, just five years ago.  So in that sense, the labor market has - we kind of like bottomed out in 2003, 2004. We had not seen much movement in 2005. But in the last six months, young workers have been, for the first time, been able to pick up some of the increased share of jobs that the economy's been generating.  So that's why I do not discourage young people. I would say there are more jobs out there today than was true last year. There are more jobs vacant today than was true last year. But you'll also still find that you face a fairly high number of competitors for available work. So it'll still take, you know, a lot of hard work to find the job of your choosing.  CONAN: Well, let's get listeners involved in the conversation. Our number, again: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. If you graduated high school in the past year or so, what has your job search been like? If you're an employer, what kind of employees are you looking for? Are you hiring?  And let's talk with Bodie(ph), Bodie's calling us from Boise, Idaho.  BODIE (Caller): Hi, I'm - my name's Bodie, and I manage a firefighting company out of Boise, Idaho called Patrick Corporation.  CONAN: Uh huh.  BODIE: And we're hiring right now, and we want anyone who's graduated high school, college, who's interested in a new, exciting career in the wild land firefighting industry. And we travel all over the country, pretty much been to all the states fighting fire, except for maybe like the Northeast.  CONAN: So this sounds like one of those companies that fights wildfires.  BODIE: Yeah, we do wildfire, and then we help out with the hurricanes and stuff, too.  CONAN: And how much does it pay?  BODIE: We start out at $7. 39 an hour, plus the first 40 hours every week, we give out health benefit of $2. 83. . .  CONAN: And. . .  BODIE: . . . and after 40 hours, it goes off, because we usually work an average of 60 to 120 hours a week.  CONAN: And if you're off in - not in there at home base in Boise, Idaho - but off in Wyoming or Alaska or wherever, presumably, they get paid room and board as well.  BODIE: Yeah, that's correct.  CONAN: Yeah, let me just ask Andrew Sum, is Bodie offering competitive rates there?  Prof. SUM: The salary for Idaho was probably in the ballpark of what the average grad has been getting there. And Bodie said he was located out in a state that has one of the three highest employment rates for young high school graduates in the country.  CONAN: So it might make sense is why he's looking for workers, yeah.  Prof. SUM: Absolutely, Idaho stands right near, right near the top - tied actually with number two with North Dakota last year.  CONAN: And, Bodie, are you finding it difficult, thereby, to get young people who are qualified?  BODIE: Yeah, like I think because of the construction industry, we've been getting less applicants than we normally do.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  BODIE: And, I mean, like first few years that we're here in Boise, we were getting lots and lots, just like overwhelmed - hundreds and hundreds of applicants, 40 to 50 a day. And right now, it's maybe like five to 10 people are coming in and applying. And out of that, like maybe one or two meet our qualifications.  CONAN: So you're thinking about raising your pay, or something else to attract more applicants?  BODIE: We've begun to diversify, like our advertisements. We're starting this kind of - we've just been doing newspaper ads, and now we're going to put up flyers, and maybe something on the Internet, and kind of expand in that way.  CONAN: Well, thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it. And good luck to you, especially good luck when you're out on the job. That's - it's difficult and dangerous work.  BODIE: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Bodie calling us from Boise, Idaho. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Andrew Sum, who's a professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. If you'd like to join the conversation about jobs and the job market for new high school graduates, 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is  I'm Neal Conan. We'll be back after the break. It's the TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. This is graduation season, and many of this year's high school seniors are, or soon will be, out looking for jobs. So if you graduated this year or last year, maybe the year before, how's the job search going for you? If you're an employer, what's the market like? Who are you hiring? What qualifications do you look like? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. E-mail, talk@npr. org.  Our guest is Andrew Sum, professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. Let's get another caller on the line. This is Jason, Jason's with us from Athens, Ohio.  JASON (Caller): Hi, Neal, thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  JASON: I guess on this program, I'm going to be like a voice of experience since I graduated in the late '80s from high school, and chose not to go on to college.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  JASON: At that time, I went in the military, got some good training in the military. It wasn't infantry-type training. It was actual electronics training.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  JASON: Did that for five years, and then went into the IT computer field, which I did up until 2004. Most of my training at that time was on-the-job training by people who were willing to give me the training. And I actually had some pretty good jobs. In 2004, I quit my job to be an at-home healthcare giver for my parents.  Since moving to this area and leaving my job, I've been applying for jobs that I could've written the job application for to describe exactly what I have done for the past 12 to 14 years now. And because I have not had a college degree of any sort, they - I've basically been given the cold shoulder, not even getting responses. The responses I do get say we've found somebody who better fits the position.  CONAN: The qualifications, meaning somebody with a sheepskin. I just wonder -we'll go to Andrew Sum to get a bigger picture answer on this - but does anybody count the fact that you're a veteran into the equation?  JASON: Are you talking to me, Neal?  CONAN: Yeah.  JASON: I have not had any feedback at all from the fact that I'm a veteran, or the training that I received in the military - which was a high-level electronics training - for the last 10 years or so has been basically ignored. Now, my experience from the past 14 years has been in the IT field, but these days - it seems like once I got out of the system where. . .  CONAN: Mm hmm.  JASON: . . . it was accepted that my experience was valuable - when I apply for jobs these days and do not have a college degree, I think that the basic feeling is well, we can get somebody directly out of college who has a four-year degree and pay them a lot less. And we know that, you know, they do have that piece of paper on the wall, which I do not have.  CONAN: Yeah, Andrew Sum, Jason's experience - well you'd think IT is a field where experience would matter more than actual - you know, especially after you've been working 10 or 12 years.  Prof. SUM: Neal, I would agree. What Jason's predicament is, is partly that he explains that there has been, you know, unfortunately, a relative surplus of IT workers in the last few years after the boom ended. And employers, until recently, you know, have had more choice over whom they would like to hire for existing positions.  The only thing that I would say is to Jason, is to continue to go out and push your experience and your track record on that, because, overall, most employers still do place a high priority on that. And what you may have to do is adjust your wage somewhat to make yourself more competitive.  But young people who have a lot of experience and a lot of training, on average, do just as well in the labor market as, you know, as young college graduates coming out of school.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  Prof. SUM: So I would just suggest that on the job search strategy, again, keep pushing the experience record and keep your wage a little flexible to prove what you know on the job.  CONAN: Or, Jason, I guess the other alternative might be to go back to school.  JASON: Well that's what I'm looking at now. When you're 37, 38 years old and you really need the income, it's a little difficult. But at this point, I'm kind of looking at retraining, getting into something that's more in demand right now, I guess. The demand for IT has went down. It seems like there's been a glut of people coming directly out of college with a computer science degree, and they can get, basically, anybody they want with any degree for a very small salary.  CONAN: Okay, well, Jason, good luck to you.  JASON: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. We wanted to hear from an employer on this, so joining us now is Billy Harper. He's the president of Harper Industries, a nationwide commercial and industrial construction company with over 1,000 employees. He's with us today from his office in Paducah, Kentucky. Very good of you to take the time to speak with us.  Mr. BILLY HARPER (President, Harper Industries): Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity.  CONAN: With a company of your size, you must find yourself with quite a few job openings.  Mr. HARPER: We do, and unfortunately, it's hard to fill some of them. And the other side is it's neat that our industry is booming right now, so as we fill them, we have more demand.  CONAN: So you have jobs open right now?  Mr. HARPER: We do. We probably have somewhere between 25 and 50 jobs at this point that we could fill.  CONAN: To do what?  Mr. HARPER: Oh, anywhere from ready mix truck drivers, to construction crews that would be willing to travel, to some support personnel in office estimating project management.  CONAN: And would a high school graduate qualify for one of these jobs?  Mr. HARPER: In some cases, particularly depending on age. If they could get a commercial driver's license that would certainly provide opportunity to start in the - onsite with truck driving and ready mix trucks. Also, there's some openings for construction laborers. And then other positions they could work their way up to.  CONAN: Mm hmm. And at this point, what skills are you looking for? I mean, beyond those actual accomplishments like, you know, a commercial driver's license?  Mr. HARPER: Well, you're always looking for the soft skills: somebody who knows how to show up and work on time and be there every day, be presentable to the public - those sort of things - as well as being able to communicate, and in many cases, have at least basic operational fundamentals of computers and keyboard.  CONAN: So it sounds like the attendance record is something you might look at pretty closely on a transcript.  Mr. HARPER: Absolutely. We probably lose more people over attendance, either tardiness or being late, and drug tests, than any other issue.  CONAN: Really?  Mr. HARPER: Unfortunately, that's true.  CONAN: Huh. So if somebody presents themselves well, show - you know, gives some sign that they're willing to show up on time and have a good work ethic, that's usually pretty good enough for you?  Mr. HARPER: That gives us a definite starting point. And then, obviously, the stronger their skills and the more development they have, then they can move as far as they're willing to go.  CONAN: Mm hmm. And can - is there opportunity to move up the ladder?  Mr. HARPER: Absolutely. We have everywhere from CEOs of our companies to operational people - some people still in the ranks, all of them with high school diplomas, and very capable in their areas.  CONAN: Let's get a caller in on this conversation. And let me just do that because I hit the wrong key there. And here is Dawn, Dawn calling us from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  DAWN (Caller): Hi, Neal. I love your show. Thank you for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  DAWN: As an employer, I own an upscale fitness center, and I have - during the summertime, after graduation - probably a dozen or so students or graduates come to my facility looking for work. And most of these young people come to the door not prepared to visit with me regarding a job. They come dressed -girls in shorts and halter tops, guys in jeans and flip-flops and t-shirts. None of them have resumes, and my question is: what is being done in high school to groom and prepare these young people to go out and properly search for a job?  CONAN: Hmm. It's interesting. Billy Harper, it sounds like a variation of the same problem you have with some of your applicants from high school.  DAWN: That's correct.  CONAN: Yeah. Billy Harper, are you still there?  Mr. HARPER: I'm here.  CONAN: Yeah. Does that sound - does Dawn's experience sound familiar to you?  Mr. HARPER: Unfortunately, it is. And, again, the soft skills and just walking in and knowing how to present themselves with a resume and that sort of thing. So, there's definitely some training needed on that part, and how to interview, how to speak, would certainly help a lot of them. Because many of these students have a lot of capability that we just don't see in an interview.  CONAN: Yeah. Andrew Sum, let me ask you Dawn's question, and that is - don't high school's train people to go out and prepare for real world job interviews?  Prof. SUM: Well, Neal, I'm glad that topic came up, because I've involved with school-to-work programs for more than 20 years. There are programs around the country, part of Jobs for America's Graduates Network that works with young high school students to help prepare them for jobs. Every aspect, from resume preparation, interviewing, soft skill development, basic skills development. We have programs in Boston that the Private Industry Council runs that does that.  And I would suggest to both Dawn and to the gentleman from Harper's Construction that - I know there are similar programs like that in Kentucky -that he contact the school-to-career programs that do this type of training very well, the Jobs for Kentucky Graduates program that does that. And there are a number of vocational technical programs that provide a lot of co-op education experience to their students so they're generally prepared with work experience when they graduate.  So there are avenues in which this can be done. But I would agree with both of them in that these programs I'm talking about really need to be expanded to a considerable degree. We only touch a very small subset of all the students that'll be entering the labor market. But there are a number of programs doing this, aiming at exactly those sets of skills and - but there's clearly, as they say, a good deal more work that needs to be done here.  CONAN: And Dawn, I assume that every once in a while, some of these kids actually work out and do okay.  DAWN: That's true, and what's sad is those are the exception. So, I hope, you know, a lot of these kids probably have a lot of potential, but I just feel like they haven't had the guidance.  CONAN: Dawn, thanks very much for the call, and good luck with this year's hiring round. And Billy Harper, as you look ahead, do you see this problem getting better or getting worse?  Mr. HARPER: I think it will get better. Kentucky has just passed some legislation recently where this is going to be injected into the high school curriculum. So, we're starting to move to help these students present themselves to the public in the key scholarships and things that we're doing. So, there are steps being made to move forward. It's just we can no longer just turn our hand in the sand. I think businesses have got to continue communicating with the school system to make sure it gets done.  CONAN: And to make sure that they know what employers actually want in terms of their hires.  Mr. HARPER: Exactly.  CONAN: Billy Harper thanks very much, and good luck to you as well.  Mr. HARPER: Thank you very much.  CONAN: Billy Harper, president of Harper Industries, which is a nationwide commercial and industrial construction company. And he called us today - we called him, actually, at his office in Paducah, Kentucky.  Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is John. John calling from Phoenix, Arizona.  JOHN (Caller): Hi, yes, this is John Mitchell, actually. I just wanted to say that my company offers something that might be useful to employers. I think we're the only company in the country that does this. We actually recruit for -on behalf of companies hourly workers, high school graduates, and we provide an assessment that measures somebody's soft skills that some of your previous callers were asking for. Things like tenure, drug avoidance, supervisory skills.  We have a 64 question psychological assessment that once they pass, we forward those applications on to prospective employers. And we do a very good job of connecting some, you know, underprivileged kids, as well as, you know, just normal high school kids who don't know how to go out and find some of these positions. And we help employers, because we can do it for several of them and we can kind of more economically recruit those applicants on their behalf.  CONAN: Mm hmm. And there's a commercial character to this or is this a - or do you do this - you know, is this for a profit company?  JOHN: Well, some of - it is a for-profit company. We do donate our technology. We have 22 job boards. We donate our technology to several non-profit organizations to help those kids find jobs. And we also charge employers kind of on a per applicant basis, you know, for those applications.  CONAN: Andrew Sum, that sounds like a kind of an extension to what you were talking about.  Prof. SUM: Yes it is. Some of the work that John was referring to is done by a number of these other programs as well. Although, they don't go into - always into the same degree on the psychological testing, which I know a number of firms themselves are doing. But, Neal, let me just ask John this, as well.  While the issue of soft skills clearly is sighted by many employers as an obstacle to hiring young people, one of the problems we have is that the way you acquire soft skills often is by learning how to work. So when you don't work in high school, it's harder for you to have skills to present to employers.  And one of the major problems we've had, Neal, is that in the last five years, the employment rate among high school students in the country has fallen to an all-time low, since the end of World War II. So, what we've been failing to do is provide more young people in their sophomore, junior, senior year a chance to acquire the jobs, the soft skills, the hard skills. Make it easier for them to transition that labor market. And it would be easier for John as well and his company to match them to existing jobs.  CONAN: Okay.  Prof. SUM: So, we need to do a better job on all three of these fronts, but his assistance and the type of work he's doing is clearly a desirable intermediary approach.  CONAN: John, thank you very much. Good luck.  JOHN: Thank you.  CONAN: We're talking about high school graduates and the search for work, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's talk with Maria. Maria's calling us from Portland, Oregon.  MARIA (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi.  MARIA: Hi. Yes. I was calling because being a mother of three children and having sent two of them to college, I know how expensive it is to go to college. And we usually, through conversations, we tend to discourage -especially I concentrate on Hispanic children - on either not keeping the skills of being bilingual or not dreaming to go to college, because it's too expensive. And actually being bilingual is an additional skill that probably they usually don't tend to give credit themselves for.  CONAN: I see. Yeah. They tend to think, of course I can do that.  MARIA: Well, they never think of how important it is. And it usually takes five years of college or more to be good at expressing yourself well in Spanish, and you don't have the culture behind it. And these children have both. And nobody reminds them how important it is and how many employers will take them first just because they're bilingual.  I was born and raised in Mexico, came here when I was 21. And right now I have three jobs, and mainly because I'm bilingual. And one of them is a lesson instructor teaching Spanish non-credit classes. The other one is as an interpreter at a hospital. And my very first one that I got through a big HMO was because I was bilingual. And I've learned too many skills just by working with this many companies, and after you experience that then you can choose what you want to do.  CONAN: Maria, that's a great suggestion. Thanks very much. And I just wonder, Andrew Sum, like her bilingual students and her bilingual children, kids don't all the time give themselves credit for what they actually can do.  Prof. SUM: I think this is partly true, Neal. That young people oftentimes do have more skills than they suggest. And by the way, there is research support for Maria's view that bilingualism does have a separate favorable economic payoff for the people that possess it.  At the same time - particularly given the fact that a larger share of our high school students are Hispanic - the evidence, though, is overwhelming that being strongly grounded in English speaking skills is one of the most overwhelming determinants of the success of Hispanic and other immigrant students. So, I would say a strong base in English first, combined with a strong base in Spanish, gives you an added advantage in the labor market.  CONAN: Maria, thanks very much. Appreciate it.  MARIA: Thank you. Bye bye.  CONAN: Bye bye. And we'd like to thank Andrew Sum for his time today. Good of you to join us in the studio.  Prof. SUM: You're welcome Neal. It's a pleasure to be here.  CONAN: Andrew Sum, Professor of Economics and Director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. And he spoke with us today from the studios of our member station in Boston, Massachusetts, WBUR.

Here are some things the Federal Reserve is pondering as it considers whether to raise interest rates at the end of this month. The U. S. economy is slowing down, and the U. S. inflation rate is creeping up. To find out why and what that means, we turn to David Wessel, Deputy Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, regular guest here. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSELL (Deputy Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: So how is the economy doing? Mr. WESSELL: Well, the economy is, as you said, slowing down. We had a lousy fourth quarter, partly due to Katrina. Then we had this incredible surge of growth in the first quarter, more than 5 percent. And the quarter that ends at the end of June looks like about a 3 percent quarter. But a lot of economists think it might be as little as 2 and a half percent. So the question is, is the economy slowing to some safe speed, or is it slowing so much that we're about to see the unemployment rate start to turn up again? INSKEEP: Well, if people are worried that the economy is slowing down too much, why would the Fed even think about raising interest rates, which is something you do to slow down the economy? Mr. WESSELL: I think their current thinking is this: that their most important job is to prevent inflation from getting out of bed. It hasn't been an issue for the past couple of years. Alan Greenspan is gone, and the new leadership doesn't want inflation to raise out of bed on its watch. INSKEEP: Let's be brutally frank about this. Are you saying that Ben Bernanke, the new Fed Chairman, would have to consider his own credibility more important than the short-term health of the economy? Mr. WESSELL: I think Ben Bernanke would say that the long-term health of the economy depends on him establishing his credibility as an inflation fighter, and if they don't get the inflation fears out of the system right now, the risk is that he'll have to raise rates even higher in the future and risk a recession. But we are paying a price for the fact that there was a transition at the Federal Reserve to a new guy who's stumbled a little bit in some of his rhetoric, and as a result is forced to establish his anti-inflation credibility by raising rates a little higher than perhaps Alan Greenspan would have in the same circumstance. INSKEEP: Just to keep things in perspective here, what's the inflation rate right now? Mr. WESSELL: The inflation rate right now is roughly around 3 percent. If you include food and energy, it's a little bit higher. If you take food and energy out it's a little bit lower. The problem right now is not today's inflation rate. What the Fed is saying is, we don't want to do anything right now that gets people to think that inflation's going to get worse. So they're saying if we're tough now, maybe we can kill it before it infects the system. INSKEEP: Is there a risk of looking in the rearview mirror here and attacking inflation that has already happened in the recent past and isn't happening now? Mr. WESSELL: Absolutely. I mean, I was talking to some Fed officials at a conference last week and they expressed concern just about that fact, that they knew that inflation was going to pick up now. It was inevitable because of what happened to oil prices and the fact that the economy is a little bit stronger and they want to make sure that it doesn't get built into what they call inflation expectations. Recently, since they began talking tough about inflation, these surveys of inflation expectations or the market measures of inflation expectations, have sort of improved a little bit, and the Fed has to decide, well, have we done enough with our rhetoric, or do we have to raise interest rates once or twice more to convince people that we're really not going to let it get out of control? INSKEEP: David Wessell of the Wall Street Journal, thanks very much. Mr. WESSELL: A pleasure.

That's one thing you'll read in the latest Ariel/Schwab Black Investor Survey. Melody Hobson is President of Ariel Capital Management, a Chicago-based investment manager. The firm helped conduct the annual survey of 500 black and 500 white investors. Hobson says, overall, the survey showed blacks are upbeat about their golden years. Ms. MELODY HOBSON (President, Ariel Capital Management): That optimism, I think, is really rooted in something that is going away, and that's traditional pension funds in this nation. We've counted on there being a safety net for us, that our pension from our corporation, as well as our Social Security payments, would take care of us in our retirement years. But, unfortunately, what we're starting to see in this country is that safety net has some major holes in it, and now the individual is the only one who can shore up those holes. GORDON: Here's another number that I found interesting, and I'm wondering how much this is really based in reality from what you know, Melody. And that's the idea that almost 90 percent of both groups surveyed considered themselves very responsible when preparing for their own retirement. Ms. HOBSON: That's correct, and that was something that optimism, that sense of accountability was absolutely there with both groups, but there was a slight difference. African-Americans said, okay, if my pension fails, the government is responsible for stepping in and making sure I have a pension in my retirement years. And white Americans were much less likely to think that the government had that responsibility. GORDON: And we found this to be the case because more blacks than whites work for the government. Correct? Ms. HOBSON: This is true. That is something that dates back to after the civil rights movement and some of the laws that came out. Some of the first places to open up for African-Americans was in government jobs, and certainly, we have been willing, in many ways, to take the lower pay of a government job that can exist at times, in order to get that pension promise. GORDON: Let me ask you this. In terms of what we're finding in this survey -and we should note this is people who make $50,000 or more, so it doesn't speak to people under that threshold. Correct? Ms. HOBSON: It does not. $50,000 in household income, so it could be you and your spouse or just you alone. GORDON: All right. That being said, how prepared are most Americans really for retirement in terms of trying to sustain the lifestyle they now lead? Ms. HOBSON: Well, I would say, in general, most Americans are woefully prepared for retirement, but I would say specifically African-Americans are even further behind the eight ball. GORDON: What would you advise to be the best way to ready yourself for retirement if you find today that you're not ready at all, that you haven't really put aside that nest egg? Ms. HOBSON: Well, the first thing I say, it's never too late to start. Secondly, even small amounts of money make a difference over time. Thirdly, I'd say don't count on Social Security or your pension. If they work out, that's terrific, but plan for the worst. Thirdly, I'd say, make sure you're investing outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan or pension plan through IRAs. GORDON: What about clients that you've talked to or just people on the street who pull your coattail for free financial advice, if you will, Melody, the idea that I'm sure some of them are very nervous when they see all of what has occurred over the last couple of years with pension plans, retirement funds, et cetera? Ms. HOBSON: Well, absolutely, that is true. There's a great deal of nervousness. I actually, however, don't think it's totally sunk in, particularly with those in our community. I think we have still thinking everything will work out, and what's coming out in our survey. It's been very interesting, also, to see in our community we make points like, we don't think about retirement in a very traditional sense. We think that after we retire from our current job, we'll either start a new job or career or start a business. And the idea of starting a business, becoming an entrepreneur, in sort of the twilight of your life is riskier than I could probably think of many other endeavors that you might consider. The entrepreneur's life is one of tremendous struggle, and, you know, as you get older, you may not have the energy or the intestinal fortitude or even the money, at some point, to be able to make those dreams a reality. And that is something that concerns me. So if people still choose to pursue that, which I think is a noble and wonderful goal, I just want to make sure they go into that situation fully prepared financially for the ups and downs that come, given the fact that we know most few businesses fail in the first year. GORDON: Let me ask you this as an exit question, the idea of whether or not this is a pipedream, and that's early retirement. I know many of the people that you talked to in the survey suggested they want and are ready for early retirement, but how many of them are actually going to be able to make that goal? Ms. HOBSON: I always believe in being incredibly honest, and I think that that is not a realistic scenario. Given where we are right now, in terms of that $59,000 saved for retirement, that is not enough money to retire comfortably, and I don't think it's realistic that we will retire as early as many in our community had hoped for. GORDON: And is there a ratio to the salary you make in terms of what you should be putting away or what you should expect to be able to sustain yourself on when you try to project down the road what the cost of living will be? Ms. HOBSON: Yes. You know, the rule of thumb that I've said, whatever you're living on and spending right now, you should basically just assume you will need that in your retirement years, which takes some people by surprise, because they think, oh, by then my home will be paid for and, you know, I will have less expenses. But what has changed that math is healthcare costs in this country, as well as the fact that at 65 years old, people are very vibrant and vital in this country, and they want to travel, they want to do things, and so just to maintain a sort of reasonable lifestyle, it takes money. Every little bit helps. GORDON: Every little bit counts indeed. Melody Hobson, with the ninth annual Ariel/Schwab Black Investor Survey, we greatly appreciate your time. Ms. HOBSON: Thank you.

Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman tells the Washington Times today that, compared to last year, tax revenues are up more than 10 percent. And the deficit for the first three quarters of this fiscal year was about $208 billion, that's down from almost $250 billion during the first three quarters of last year. OMB Director Portman gives the administration's policies a pat on the back for that. We're going to check in now with a former Bush White House economist, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Welcome to the program. Mr. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN (Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations): My pleasure. SIEGEL: According to the New York Times over the weekend, it's corporate taxes, individual taxes on stock market profits and taxes on big executive bonuses that are all going up. What does that say to you? Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think this is good news. It's hard to be disappointed that, for a tax system that we expected to result in a deficit that was something like $360 billion, we're quite likely to have a deficit that's below $300 billion. The obvious question is, can it last? And what should we think about this from the point of view of the budget policy going forward. SIEGEL: And the obvious answer is? Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, to the extent that for every dollar of income we get more in taxes, we'll get higher tax revenues going forward. And that would be very good news over the long term.  However, it's important to take this with a grain of salt. We've seen this kind of behavior before, notably in the late 1990s. Because the U. S. income tax system centers heavily on high-income people and corporations, it comes with the volatility of their operations. If bonuses go away, so do the revenues; if profits go down, so do the revenues.  And so you've got to take it with a grain of salt and be cautious and remember that, over the real long term, it's the retirement of the Baby Boom and the programs that they participate in, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that will determine the budget outlook. SIEGEL: Well, does a budget deficit over the course of a fiscal year of $300 billion as opposed to $400 billion, does it make a difference in the American economy? Does anybody feel that difference?  Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: It makes a little bit of a difference. It will lower the demands of the Treasury on private financial markets, free up $100 billion to either not borrow it from abroad or to provide more capital investment in the United States. A little less pressure on interest rates so that everyone else is buying a house, buying a car, doing some remodeling, they face a little less in the way of pressure. The real good news is if you could say, well, instead of $300 billion this year and maybe more in the future, we're going to have $300 billion this year and a lot less of a deficit in the future, that would make a big difference. SIEGEL: And is there anything in the numbers that suggest that one could say that right now? Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: No. Unfortunately, the big problems are on the other side of the ledger. They're on the spending side, and this doesn't change the basic profile for the big programs that we spend a lot of money on. Defense, in the near term, and then past that, the entitlement programs that everyone's heard so much about.  SIEGEL: I want you to go back to something you said a moment ago, that the income tax relies very, very heavily on the wealthy; that is, as opposed to the FICA tax that hits everybody and is not a very progressive tax. The income tax really does; it's paid mostly by the rich. Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Half of Americans don't pay any income tax, or in fact get money back. And the top 5 percent are paying half of it. So it's centered very much on the fortunes of a few Americans and if they have any kind of financial volatility, we get volatility in the revenue system.  And we've seen that in the late 1990s. A lot of options, a lot of bonuses, a lot of money for the government. Then it all went away. So one thing to be careful about is not to bank on this kind of revenue increase for every year in the foreseeable future.  One of the things that's interesting about this year and is cause for optimism is that it's across-the-board strength. We're seeing plain vanilla FICA taxes, plain vanilla income taxes being withheld by corporations, also showing considerable strength. What that may mean is that there's a little more income out there in the economy than our other measures are suggesting, like the Payroll Employment Board thinks it looks weak. Well, maybe it's stronger than we think. SIEGEL: Douglas Holtz-Eakin, thank you very much for talking with us. Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: My pleasure. SIEGEL: That's Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and before that, chief economist at the Council of Economic Advisors at the Bush White House.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  The White House says that, thanks to its policies, tax revenues are rising fast and as a result the deficit is coming down, in the short run, at least. Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman tells the Washington Times today that, compared to last year, tax revenues are up more than 10 percent. And the deficit for the first three quarters of this fiscal year was about $208 billion, that's down from almost $250 billion during the first three quarters of last year. OMB Director Portman gives the administration's policies a pat on the back for that.  We're going to check in now with a former Bush White House economist, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Welcome to the program.  Mr. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN (Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations): My pleasure.  SIEGEL: According to the New York Times over the weekend, it's corporate taxes, individual taxes on stock market profits and taxes on big executive bonuses that are all going up. What does that say to you?  Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think this is good news. It's hard to be disappointed that, for a tax system that we expected to result in a deficit that was something like $360 billion, we're quite likely to have a deficit that's below $300 billion. The obvious question is, can it last? And what should we think about this from the point of view of the budget policy going forward.  SIEGEL: And the obvious answer is?  Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, to the extent that for every dollar of income we get more in taxes, we'll get higher tax revenues going forward. And that would be very good news over the long term.   However, it's important to take this with a grain of salt. We've seen this kind of behavior before, notably in the late 1990s. Because the U.

I'm Madeleine Brand. It's Henry Paulson's first day as U. S. Treasury Secretary. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs was sworn in this morning. He has lots of financial experience, but some people question whether Paulson will have enough clout to influence U. S. economic policy. MARKETPLACE's Janet Babin is here now, and Janet, the treasury secretary is supposed to be in charge of the country's fiscal policy, but that role has diminished since President Bush took office. Why? JANET BABIN reporting: Well, some say that it might have started about six years ago, when the president tapped Paul O'Neill as his treasury secretary. He was an accomplished public servant, but he wasn't a Bush administration loyalist, and he ended up being a vocal, and outspoken critic of the Bush administration's economic plans. NYU Professor Paul Light, says that eroded the department's role in general, and Light says it's difficult to tell exactly who has the president's ear, when it comes to his economic decisions these days. And, he's not sure if Henry Paulson's going to be able to trump the president's inside advisors. Dr. PAUL LIGHT (Professor of Public Service, New York University): Treasury has not been a destination of choice for economic policy advice. George W. Bush relies on loyalists for advice, and that would be people like Karl Rove, Vice President Cheney. You know, Donald Rumsfeld may have more to do with the economic advice going to the president, than Hank Paulson. BABIN: And Professor Light doesn't expect that to change. He says the president chose Paulson, because of his 30 years international experience, and his stellar reputation in the business community. BRAND: Well, if he is not a Bush loyalist, how will he get the president's ear? BABIN: Well, Professor Light says that, you know, this could be Paulson's greatest challenge. The secretary's office is practically within shouting distance of the West Wing, but you still have to get them to open up that door and give you access. Dr. LIGHT: What Paulson needs most, is a regular meeting with the president, hopefully one on one, to convince the president to listen. And that is going to take time, and what Paulson does not have, is time. BRAND: And Janet, what are some of the economic challenges, Paulson needs to tackle? BABIN: Well, there's the record-high deficit, rising energy prices, and a declining dollar, to start. And today, at the ceremony, he said that his first priority is going to be forging a close working relationship with the department's career professionals. And he also said, that the strength of the U. S. economy is linked to the strength of the global economy, so he'll probably focus on that, as well. Coming up later today, on MARKETPLACE, we're looking at why Southwest Airlines is testing assigned seats on its flights, when it's the cattle call that made it so successful. BRAND: Thank you, Janet.

I'm Madeleine Brand. In a few minutes, a look at Nevada's Senator Maggie. She's a woman who leads a double life. But first, Russia will host this year's G-8 Summit later this week, in St. Petersburg. The country's feeling a new financial self-confidence, due largely to huge oil profits. As NPR's Gregory Feifer reports, those oil profits have made Moscow one of the most expensive places on the planet. GREGORY FEIFER reporting: Gone are the days when Americans in Russia could live like royalty. The once disdained ruble, has firmed up against the sinking dollar, and Moscow has become shockingly expensive. A new survey by New York's Mercer Human Resource Consulting Group, has named it the world's costliest city for foreigners. American John Mann(ph), works for a major Russian investment company. He says prices have skyrocketed since his arrival five years ago, because of the many opportunities to make money. Mr. JOHN MANN (American Businessman): I think a lot of it has to do with the price of oil because - oil and other commodities - because what you have in Moscow are what, more billionaires than any other city besides New York. And then, on the next level down, there are just hundreds of millionaires in town. There's a lot of money floating around Moscow. FEIFER: But, while Mann says Moscow is among the priciest cities in the world, he agrees with many Muscovites, that it's not the most expensive. He says cost of living surveys, don't take local bargains into account. The Mercer survey didn't measure the cost of metro rides: 50 cents. Or the price of the city's ubiquitous gypsy cabs: $3. 00 to $6. 00. Still, groceries, house wares, even a cup of coffee, can see steep. The Mercer survey put a cup bought at a coffee shop, at over $5. 00. The average wage in Russia is around $300 a month. But the manager of a central Moscow coffeehouse, says its exorbitant-seeming prices haven't scared off customers. (Soundbite of foreign language spoken) Coffeehouse Manager: (Through Translator) They're willing to pay a lot for coffee, because they like to drink from expensive coffee cups, eat cake with natural ingredients, and enjoy good service. FEIFER: Economist Mikhail Dilyagen(ph), says Moscow's high prices are the result of a serious failure on the government's part, to address the issue. Mr. MIKHAIL DILYAGEN (Economist, Moscow): (Through Translator) By far, the largest amount of the country's income is concentrated in the hands of a tiny part of the population, three to five percent. That vastly inequitable distribution of wealth, doesn't have any sound economic justification. FEIFER: Dilyagen says the government is doing nothing to regulate prices as they gravitate toward the highest levels. (Soundbite of car horn) FEIFER: Still, money is changing the face of Moscow. In just a few years, the streets have become crowded with countless late-model luxury cars: Audis, Mercedes, Bentleys. (Soundbite of construction crane) FEIFER: The city is also spouting construction cranes, as office buildings and apartment houses transform the skyline. Real estate is leading Moscow's boom. Prices have more than doubled in the past year. Ilya Mezulskaya(ph) is head of the sales department at Moscow's Delta Realty. She says her company often rents out two bedroom apartments for $10,000 to $25,000 a month. (Soundbite of foreign language spoken) Ms. ILYA MEZULSKAYA (Realty Sales): (Through Translator) The market is very hot. Prices are rising, but people are buying. When properties first come on the market, sometimes the prices seem inflated. But the market keeps rising and quickly catches up. FEIFER: As the city expands, it's pushing up against its Soviet past, in the form of suddenly valuable dachas(ph), whose residents don't want to sell. (Soundbite of foreign language spoken) FEIFER: In a suburb of Budva(ph), 40 families are making national news by refusing to leave their wooden cabins to make way for new high-rise apartment buildings, prompting the city to send in riot police to disperse their protests. Residents complain of beatings and threats their houses will be burnt down. Yuri Dubvijian(ph) says his family is being offered a small, one-bedroom apartment, for five people. (Soundbite of foreign language spoken) Mr. YURI DUBVIGIAN (Budva Resident): (Through Translator) The authorities want to buy our land for $9000 for 100 square yards, but they want to sell it at auction for a starting price of $100,000. That's what they're fighting for, here. FEIFER: Dubvigian, a construction worker, says he can barely afford to live in Moscow, let alone visit a restaurant.

S. government today on the fiscal front. The federal budget deficit is now expected to run slightly less than $300 billion for the current fiscal year. That number is lower than projected, due largely to tax revenues that came in higher than anticipated. Republicans credit their tax cuts, which they say stimulated the economy. Democrats counter by saying the long-term outlook remains gloomy. NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR reporting: The Bush administration and Congressional Republicans have felt they weren't getting credit for an economy that's registered steady, if modest, growth and monthly job gains. So today they pounced on the word that the deficit for this fiscal year is now projected at $296 billion, well below the $423 billion projected just last February. The president himself made the announcement to a White House audience packed with GOP members of Congress. President GEORGE W. BUSH: This economy's growing, federal taxes are rising, and we're cutting the federal deficit faster than we expected. This good news is no accident. It's the result of the hard work of the American people and sound policies in Washington, D. C. NAYLOR: Those policies, say Republican officials, include the tax cuts the President and GOP lawmakers pushed through Congress in 2001 and 2003, along with regulatory reform and opening new markets. Republican Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina said they should be continued. Senator JIM DEMINT (Republican, South Carolina): This mid-season review offers yet more proof that the Republican agenda to secure American jobs and balance the budget is working. We're making progress. It's third down and time for us to run the ball for a touchdown, not punt it away. NAYLOR: Analysts say the lower-than-anticipated deficit is due largely to stronger collections from the wealthy and increased corporate profits. According to the White House, taxes paid by individuals are expected to grow by 15 percent - corporate taxes by 19 percent. That's offsetting some of the increases in government spending brought on by the war in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina. But Democrats say this is hardly cause for celebration. They say the administration overstated early deficit projections just five months ago to make this summer's numbers look good by comparison. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid says this year's deficit - the fourth largest on record - is hardly good news. Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada; Senate Minority Leader): Please, let's not boast about a $300 billion deficit. Any statistic you look at recognizes the rich in America are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed. NAYLOR: President Bush says with the new figures, the deficit is now on track to be cut in half by fiscal 2008, a year ahead of his schedule. But that's only if spending on the war is dramatically reduced, and soon - which looks unlikely. In any event, the deficit is expected to spike upward in the years after Mr. Bush leaves office, as the baby boomers begin retiring in larger numbers and collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits. North Dakota Democrat Kent Conrad, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, says this is not the time to be rejoicing. Senator KENT CONRAD (Democrat, North Dakota; Senior Democrat, Senate Budget Committee): All of this happy talk coming out of the administration about the fiscal circumstance, it reminds me a little of somebody holding a press conference to talk about the new lifeboats on board the Titanic. NAYLOR: Democrats also note that the Bush administration inherited a budget surplus from the Clinton White House, only to see that reversed as the stock market declined, the economy went into recession, and the country shifted to war footing after the 9-11 attacks. Both sides agree that reforming entitlements like Social Security and Medicare is essential to keeping future deficits from exploding. But for now, they're nowhere near consensus about how to do that. Brian Naylor, NPR News, the Capitol.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  There was good some news from the U.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid says this year's deficit - the fourth largest on record - is hardly good news.  Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada; Senate Minority Leader): Please, let's not boast about a $300 billion deficit. Any statistic you look at recognizes the rich in America are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed.  NAYLOR: President Bush says with the new figures, the deficit is now on track to be cut in half by fiscal 2008, a year ahead of his schedule. But that's only if spending on the war is dramatically reduced, and soon - which looks unlikely. In any event, the deficit is expected to spike upward in the years after Mr. Bush leaves office, as the baby boomers begin retiring in larger numbers and collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits. North Dakota Democrat Kent Conrad, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, says this is not the time to be rejoicing.  Senator KENT CONRAD (Democrat, North Dakota; Senior Democrat, Senate Budget Committee): All of this happy talk coming out of the administration about the fiscal circumstance, it reminds me a little of somebody holding a press conference to talk about the new lifeboats on board the Titanic.  NAYLOR: Democrats also note that the Bush administration inherited a budget surplus from the Clinton White House, only to see that reversed as the stock market declined, the economy went into recession, and the country shifted to war footing after the 9-11 attacks.  Both sides agree that reforming entitlements like Social Security and Medicare is essential to keeping future deficits from exploding. But for now, they're nowhere near consensus about how to do that. Brian Naylor, NPR News, the Capitol. ", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Online gamblers crapped out today as the U. S. House of Representatives voted to block credit card companies from sending funds to off-shore gambling houses. The bill that passed would allow Internet service providers to block certain gambling Web sites here in the U. S. From the Capitol, NPR's Luke Burbank reports. LUKE BURBANK reporting: For people with a lot of gamble in them, as it's called, online casinos have made something they already love - betting - all the easier. Want to put $200 on the Seahawks to cover the spread, or play blackjack or poker? No problem. Just head over to your computer. No need to even change out of your pajamas. But for those with less gamble in them, people like Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte, these Web sites are a menace. Representative BOB GOODLATTE (Republican, Virginia): This is about America's families, like the one in my district whose son committed suicide - the young student in Congressman Dent's district who, when he ran up thousands of dollars in Internet gambling debts, robbed a bank. Support this legislation and send a great measure across the capitol for the other body to consider. BURBANK: Goodlatte was one of the sponsors of the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act, which passed the House today by a wide margin. The bill bars credit card companies from transacting with online casinos, pretty much all of which are located outside of U. S. jurisdiction. Of course, any online gambler would tell you that the credit card companies were already complying with this idea long ago. All people have to do is use a third-party service to get access to their money, a fact not lost on Democrat Robert Scott of Virginia. Representative ROBERT SCOTT (Democrat, Virginia): If we wanted to get serious about Internet gambling, you should've put in there it's illegal to gamble. That's not in the bill. This bill is a message bill. It is unenforceable. You can't regulate it. It'd be - make more sense, since the cat is out of the bag. Many countries are running Internet gambling operations already. We ought - if we're going to do anything, we ought to regulate the operations, supervise it, and tax it. BURBANK: The bill also allows Internet service providers to block some of the gambling Web sites. What it doesn't do is regulate online betting on horses or certain lotteries. Critics say that was a bow to the apparently powerful horseracing lobby. And then there was the ghost of Jack Abramoff. At multiple points in the debate, people on both sides of the issue tried to paint their opponents as unwittingly doing the bidding of the now-disgraced lobbyist. Back when he was working for a group called eLottery, Abramoff used his influence to help kill a similar online gambling ban. This time, though, the bill sailed through - 317 votes to 93. Mr. DAVID WOLKOVE (TV Writer, Los Angeles): Yeah, you forget to eat, you forget to drink, you have to go to the bathroom. BURBANK: David Wolkove is a TV writer in Los Angeles who, between writing gigs, supplements his income by playing a lot of online poker. He keeps a record online of every poker hand he's ever played, which totals. . . Mr. WOLKOVE: At least half a million hands. BURBANK: 500,000 hands. Mr. WOLKOVE: Yeah, I'd say at least that much. BURBANK: Aside from your heart beating, do you think you've done anything else 500,000 times in your life? Mr. WOLKOVE: Definitely not. BURBANK: Wolkove doesn't consider himself a problem gambler. He has a real job and a real life, which he says he doesn't ignore in the pursuit of poker. He does say the Internet makes it easier for casual gamblers to get in over their hands. And it's easy, he says, for kids to set up accounts with their parents' credit card. But even then, he says. . . Mr. WOLKOVE: You know, a real problem gambler will get in his car, drive to an Indian reservation, pawn his car, play all day, and he'll just keep playing until they're broke. So I understand the need to legislate it, but at the same time, if you have it in you, if you have the desire to go and gamble, you're going to gamble anyway. BURBANK: The bill now moves to the Senate, where it likely won't be a high priority. Experts say as far as it actually getting to a vote? Don't bet on it. Luke Burbank, NPR News, The Capitol.

Today, The White House releases its mid-year budget update, today, and it is likely to project a deficit much lower than expected, which sounds like good news. And now we're going to find out if it really is. We turn to David Wessel, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief of The Wall Street Journal - regular guest here. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: So, okay, the deficit is lower than expected. That sounds good. Mr. WESSEL: It is good. The analysts are expecting the Bush administration will project a deficit for this fiscal year, which only has about three months left to run, of about $300 billion. That's a little less than last year, and much less than they had predicted when they put out their budget in February. INSKEEP: Now, as many people have pointed out, when you're talking about budget deficit projections - and saying that you've met expectations or didn't meet expectations or beat expectations - you can move a few relatively minor numbers around in the federal budget, and utterly change your deficit projection. Did that happen here? Mr. WESSEL: Well, I think the $300 billion number is pretty hard. After all, we have about nine months of the fiscal year gone, so there's not much maneuvering room for them. Where I think the White House set themselves up with a favorable comparison, was by inflating a little bit the number that they gave in February, what they expected the deficit to be. Their estimate was about $50 billion more than that of the Congressional budget office. They set it up so they could show progress. There is progress. They're making the progress look a little better than you might have otherwise. INSKEEP: Am I being too cynical, to say that they then said, several months ago - oh, the deficit is terrible, terrible, terrible - and now that an election is approaching they can say - it's getting better, better, better. Mr. WESSEL: Well, you can never be too cynical in Washington, and I think that what you said is true. But it is also true that independent, non-partisan analysts are surprised by how much tax revenue is coming in, and so therefore, surprised that the deficit is not bigger. INSKEEP: Why are tax revenues unexpectedly high? Mr. WESSEL: Well, that's interesting actually. Tax revenues are unexpectedly high because A) corporate profits have been so strong that companies are paying a lot more in taxes. And because the people at the top of the income ladder are doing so much better than the people in the middle class, and they pay higher tax rates. INSKEEP: Okay, does this mean that the deficit is no longer such a big problem? Mr. WESSEL: The deficit isn't a problem today. The economy is doing reasonably well, despite a $300 billion deficit. The problem is in the future. Outside of the president's term, spending on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, is growing so fast and so substantially that the deficit will get much, much bigger unless some major sea change hits. INSKEEP: How are Congress and the president doing right now, on containing spending? Mr. WESSEL: Well, not very well. Spending so far this year, is up about nine percent. Medicare is up 15 percent over last year, because of the prescription drug bill, and spending on interest is up 22 percent, because the debt is so much bigger and interest rates have gone up. INSKEEP: Spending on money we already borrowed in past years? Mr. WESSEL: Absolutely. INSKEEP: Is that going to be a bigger and bigger slice of the budget as the years go on? Mr. WESSEL: It will, unless something changes. INSKEEP: David Wessel of the Wall Street Journal. Thanks very much. Mr. WESSEL: You're welcome.

Israel's escalading incursion into Lebanon has triggered a run-up in world oil prices. Today, prices are close to $80 a barrel.  MARKETPLACE'S Janet Babin is here. And Janet, tell us more about what's behind this rise in oil prices. JANET BABIN reporting: Well, Madeleine, analysts say that in addition to the tensions in the Middle East, it's really a tight market right now. With global economic growth just ballooning over the past few years, the world has seen places like China and India using a lot more oil, feeding demand. So there's been a sort of demand shock to the market that's upped prices.  And now we're dealing with a supply shock. There have been supply interruptions in Nigeria, Venezuela and Iraq, and now possibly more interruptions because of the fighting between Israel and militants in Lebanon. Adding to that, there's only limited spare capacity in the global oil supply system, so any time there's instability in the world, especially near oil supplies, the market reacts and prices go up. And analysts say it's ironic because global crude oil supplies right now are actually in better shape than they've been in for quite a while. But you still have to consider that there's this very little spare capacity of crude oil to go around and what crude is available is really of a lower quality. BRAND: So is this a matter of market psychology then? BABIN: Yeah, it's kind of a mix of both, of this supply and demand issue and of fear.  Oil has really become synonymous with geopolitics, so world politics is part of the cost of that barrel of oil. That's why even though Israel and Lebanon don't produce oil, what happens there can push prices. Tom Weiland(ph) gave me his perspective on this. He's with the Energy Intelligence Group Newsletters. Mr. TOM WEILAND (Energy Intelligence Group Newsletters): There's no direct impact on any oil producer with what's going on between Israel and Lebanon, but it raised this whole concern about the stability of governments and political stability in the Middle East as a whole. This confrontation adds to the extremism, adds to the power of radical groups, and could destabilize some government in the Middle East and that's sort of underlying what the anxiety is that's feeding into oil. BRAND: And Janet, does he and other analysts, do they expect oil prices to keep rising? BABIN: You know, they do. Analysts continue to increase their forecasts for '06 prices and for '07. In a Reuter's poll, analysts predicted global demand will keep the average price about $62 a barrel this year, and so far - next year, rather - and so far for this year, U. S. crude has averaged $67. 67 a barrel. That's pretty high by today's standards, anyway. Coming up later today on Marketplace, we're going to check out the G8 summit and how the Middle East violence might shift the discussion there. BRAND: Thank you, Janet.

YDSTIE: How is the violence in the Middle East likely to affect the U. S. economy and the world economy? WESSEL: Well, the major effect is on oil prices, oil prices have gone up. That's bad for the world economy. If this is a temporary phenomenon, if prices come back down, I think we can shake it off as we have before. But if oil prices are going to stick, it cost $80 a barrel for a couple of weeks or months or even quarters, that's bound to slow an already slowing U. S. economy. YDSTIE: When oil prices first spiked a couple of years ago, interest rates in the U. S. were very low. Now, the Fed has raised rates to head off inflation. Doesn't that put a squeeze on the economy? WESSEL: Right. I mean, the economy's really getting squeezed in all directions now. Some of it by design, as you said. The Federal Reserve has taken interest rates from a very low one percent to five and a quarter percent. Oil prices have gone up quite a bit, financial markets have been gyrating, and that's shaking up people a bit. And then consumers who have been spending very, very readily in the past couple of years are beginning to pinch their wallets a little bit. And so that also was slowing the economy. YDSTIE: As you said, the U. S. economy is slowing as a result of Fed interest rate hikes. Most analysts aren't predicting a recession. Are those optimistic predictions, given what's happening in the Middle East? WESSEL: Well, the economy's very hard to forecast. As you say, most of the forecasters expect slower growth, not a recession. But in the past week, a number of them have begun to say that the risks of recession are rising - some put it at 30 percent, some at 40 percent, some at 50 percent. And the problem is as the economy slows, a little bit more downward pressure can push us just a little bit too slow. And that's not very far from recession. YDSTIE: Stock markets around the world have fallen sharply in the past week. What exactly are they telling us? WESSEL: Well, I think the stock markets are telling us that they're worried about oil, they're worried about central banks like the Federal Reserve overdoing it. And the thing that's interesting is that what the stock markets do is not only reflect what's going on, but they tend to create it. People feel a little poorer because their stock market portfolios are worth a little less. It comes at the same time that housing is a little soft. And suddenly, if a lot of people feel just a little bit poorer, they spend just a little bit less money, and voila, we have a very slow economy. YDSTIE: So, where does this leave the Federal Reserve? Have we seen the last of interest rate hikes? WESSEL: Well, the Federal Reserve is in a really tough position now. We have a new Fed chairman, and he has to make a very difficult call. Which is the bigger worry for the U. S. economy right now? Is it that growth is going to slow too much, or is it that there's going to be a little unwelcome inflation? On one, he cuts interest rates or holds them where they are, on the other, he raises them. We may get some more clues this week, but it's a very, very delicate moment for the Fed. YDSTIE: David Wessel of the Wall Street Journal. Thank you very much. WESSEL: A pleasure. JOHN YDSTIE, Host:  Over the past couple of years, the U.

Typically, by 8:40, economists all across the country have rummaged through the Labor Department's market basket. Economists like Mark Zandi of Moodyseconomy. com. Mr. MARK ZANDI (Moodyseconomy. com): It's a basket of a whole range of various goods, you know, everything from a car to an iPod to various services, medical care, educational services, everything that we plunk money down for. SIEGEL: Selected items are weighted in terms of the average American household budget and month after month, huge consequences flow from small changes in their prices. Mr. ZANDI: It's used by policy makers for setting interest rates. It's used by Social Security Administration to set increases in payments and it's used in various contracts and labor negotiations. It's a very important, perhaps arguably the most important economic statistic that we have. SIEGEL: Michael Bryan, an economist and vice president at the Cleveland Federal Reserve, makes this distinction. He says the Consumer Price Index, the CPI, doesn't really measure the long-run trend of inflation that a central bank worries about. It measures changes in the cost of living, and it does that by actually sending hundreds of people out to check firsthand on tens of thousands of prices every single month. Mr. MICHAEL BRYAN (Cleveland Federal Reserve): Yeah, I've heard an economist describe that as the hand-to-hand combat of price measurement. SIEGEL: Yes. Mr. BRYAN: Yeah, my hat's off to the people who go out there and can do that sort of work. Ms. CAREN GAFFNEY: Hi there. I'm with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We come in here every month, and. . . SIEGEL: Meet Caren Gaffney, who does precisely that sort of work. Ms. GAFFNEY: Certainly let Mike know I'm in the store. SIEGEL: She's a retired telecommunications executive who is now an economics assistant, a price checker for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ms. GAFFNEY: If I could just get you to validate the information here. SIEGEL: We accompanied Caren Gaffney on just two stops that she made on just one day of checking retail prices in June. Ms. GAFFNEY: Sunday six to ten? Great. SIEGEL: We visited two supermarkets near Washington, D. C. , and we can tell you nothing else about them. We are in the super discreet world of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where retailers of all shapes and sizes, from bodegas to big boxes, and providers of all kinds of services participate voluntarily. No business gets identified. Caren Gaffney carries a tablet, one of those portable PCs, which tells her what her assigned products are for each stop of the day and which lets her enter the prices. Ms. \ufffdGAFFNEY: So what Im going to do here is I usually, when I go to a store, I usually have a specific path, sometimes it changes, but I usually start with produce and work right to left. Its efficient. It works for me, its logical. It's my style. SIEGEL: You've got apples on your list. Ms. GAFFNEY: I've got apples. So we're going to look for apples today. SIEGEL: Her computerized checklist of items was generated by consumer surveys of what Americans buy and where they buy it. Ms. GAFFNEY: Okay, I've got Granny Smith here, 4017, if you look on there. And the next item I have here is Gala apples. SIEGEL: And it's $1. 79 a pound now. Ms. GAFFNEY: Okay, and it was $1. 59 in May. And we're going to be looking for Florida oranges, also known as Valencia oranges. SIEGEL: Three for $1. 98. Ms. \ufffdGAFFNEY: $1. 98 so theres. . . now if you look at the scale here, its not quite on zero, so Im going to take one ounce off of the weight. SIEGEL: Two of the oranges weigh 12 ounces, an average orange weighs 6. . . Ms. GAFFNEY: So, I got cantaloupe melons, they're not organic. Now here it talks about a quart of strawberries are $6. 99 each. Now, I went on, I've got limes again. Explain the 75 percent change in effective. . . Hi there, I'm with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I have a couple of questions on produce. I was looking for Macintosh apples. Do you have any of those? Unidentified Man: Not available. Ms. GAFFNEY: All right, have you had them in or are they out of season? Unidentified Man: No, yeah, they're out of season. Ms. GAFFNEY: On the limes -Unidentified Man: Yup. Ms. GAFFNEY: They were five for a dollar and they were on sale. Unidentified Man: For competition purposes, we went down on price. Ms. GAFFNEY: Okay, great. I'm going to go to aisle two, which is canned fruit, so we're going to go down here, and I'm looking for a 48-ounce jar of homestyle chunky. SIEGEL: Homestyle chunky, down on the bottom. Ms. GAFFNEY: There you go. SIEGEL: There we are. Ms. GAFFNEY: That's our jar. I'm looking at Campbell's Pork and Beans with an easy-open pop top, 19. 75 ounces. SIEGEL: I think I've got it. Ms. GAFFNEY: We're looking for farm-raised top skinless, bottom-skin-on fresh Atlantic boneless filets, color added. SIEGEL: Well, we've been to two stores with you. How many stores all told will you visit today? Ms. GAFFNEY: Well, today's going to be a short day. It's, I don't necessarily work eight hours a day. I've got a phone call that I need to make to get pricing from a local college on tuition and fees and I'll also be pricing some tires. SIEGEL: Tires. Ms. GAFFNEY: Tires, yup. SIEGEL: And there are people checking prices in supermarkets for the Bureau of Labor Statistics all over the country right now? Ms. GAFFNEY: Yup. SIEGEL: And in good times, when inflation is relatively low, you can be charting changes that are almost glacial in pace. I mean you'll be coming back month after month to confirm that an apple costs what an apple costs. Ms. GAFFNEY: Absolutely, yup. SIEGEL: But we've got to check that every month. Ms. GAFFNEY: We got to do it. It's my job. SIEGEL: Caren Gaffney's data will go into the national mix at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Maureen Green is the assistant regional commissioner for price programs and she says that the prices we have seen checked have been selected by the BLS. So why select non-organic Granny Smith apples instead of stuffed olives or fresh organic chives? Well, Green says the selection is based on random surveys of consumers. Ms. MAUREEN GREEN (Bureau of Labor Statistics): We will decide what we're going to price using these random statistical techniques, and then we follow that. So it wasn't so much that somebody told us to come to this store for chives, but you're right, I mean most of the things that are in the stores that we just left were not things we priced, and they could have been very expensive, very inexpensive. The prices could have changed. Caren was sent here to look at some very, very specific items and those items are now part of the market basket for the entire Consumer Price Index. SIEGEL: So why do so many people hear the news at 9:00 a. m. one morning in the middle of the month and say, that doesn't sound like what's happened to the prices I've seen? Well, Mark Zandi of Moodyseconomy. com reminds us that, say, today's two-tenths of 1 percent increase in the CPI is an average. Mr. ZANDI: It's not the same, meaning the same thing for all of us. It's somewhat plutocratic in the sense that it represents the spending patterns of all Americans and since wealthy, high-income Americans spend more, it more closely represents their spending patterns. But it's not meant to mimic the prices for the things that you buy or I buy; it's the average American in what he or she buys. SIEGEL: So how accurate is it? Well, the BLS has spent a decade adjusting the CPI in response to the criticism that it used to overstate inflation. A study commission found that it was too slow to pick up on new products that Americans buy. Economist Mark Bils, of the University of Rochester, says it still overstates inflation a little when it compares prices for the latest models of durable goods - say automobiles or microwave ovens or DVD players. He says that the new model is often such an improvement on the old one that to a great extent we're not buying the same product, we're buying a better one. Mr. MARK BILS (University of Rochester): You have the opportunity to buy the goods you had before. It's just the fact is that people choose not to do it because they have better alternatives. SIEGEL: Mark Bils's favorite example is a car that he used to own - a 1983 Honda Accord. Mr. BILS: Which was a great car. It had no air conditioning. It had no power windows or power locks. It didn't have any, you know, air bags, etcetera, but it was, you know, I was very happy with it. It cost $10,000 in 1983. I firmly believe that if that car as it was, brand new, were to go on the market today, you couldn't get anything close to $10,000 for it because there's just so much better alternatives. SIEGEL: Professor Bils says that we can mistake what is really deflation -that is the 1983 Honda would cost much less today - for an increase in price if we don't pay enough attention to those power windows, power locks, air conditioning and other improvements that we find in newer models. Mark Bryan of the Cleveland Federal Reserve says come the end of the year when it's time to ask the boss for a cost of living raise, the CPI, with all of the work that Caren Gaffney and the hundreds of others like her have put into it, is a great index. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Michael Bryan, not Mark Bryan] But, he says, for central bankers who make interest rates rise and fall, an odd spike in one category one month or a sudden drop in another, those fluctuations, which may figure heavily in the CPI, don't say much about the underlying rate of inflation. And that is why economists will sometimes exclude food or energy prices and speak of what's left as the core rate of inflation. Mark(ph) Bryan says he and a colleague have taken that process to its logical conclusion. They've developed what they call the median consumer price index. Throw out what's rising fastest in price and what's rising slowest and just look at the item at the median, whatever that item might be. Mr. BRYAN: So last month, for example, car and truck rentals, down 27 percent on an annual rate. I dont know why. But on the other side, jewelry and watches, up 25 percent. So you can think about subtracting out both of those measures and you continue to do that from the tails of the distribution until you get to the median good. And it was food away from home, restaurant charges. That was the median good. And the median good changes from month to month. But whatever's sitting in the center of the consumer market basket as far as price change, we find that to have a pretty good inflation signal. SIEGEL: Has this professional interest of yours translated at all into an obsession in the grocery store? That is, do you find yourself wondering whether that pound of coffee cost the same thing last month that it costs this month? Mr. BRYAN: Yes it does. And, you know, Robert, I think it's going to do the same for you now that you've been out there and measured prices. You're going to say, well, is this the exact right number of ounces? Have they changed the formula at all? Yeah, it does. SIEGEL: That's Michael Bryan of the Cleveland Federal Reserve talking with us about the Consumer Price Index, which was up 2/10ths of one percent today. You can calculate the purchasing power of a dollar in different years with an inflation calculator. The link is at our website, NPR. org.

Celebrating with Mom, Gina, are her husband for the day, Ian, and their kids, 14-year-old daughter Dani, and 12-year-old son, Colin. Singing along are a few strangers who've just come to see their house.

Another tip-off that they're actors: mom and dad are betting looking than anyone you personally know. The no last name family occupies a model of Resident Style Number 2 in the westerly neighborhood of River Park, a huge master-planned community going up in the city of Oxnard, north of Los Angeles. The Centex company has already done two performances of Home Life at another development, and that one is now sold out, according to regional marketing director Amanda Larson(ph).

Home Life, the kids say, doesn't have any singing or dancing, but it has other things to recommend it. Ms. ZICKAFOOSE: I think it's a great experience.

I'm Ed Gordon. Middle class America is quickly vanishing, and it's happening most notably in major cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington, D. C. A recent report from the Brookings Institution says one potential reason for the shrinking middle class in major urban areas is that cities and suburbs are becoming increasingly segregated by income. And reports suggest that black families are having an even tougher time maintaining a foothold than the middle class because of barriers to home ownership such as gentrification. We're joined now via phone by one of the leading authors of the Brookings Report, George Galster, professor of urban affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit. Also on the line, Mary Pattillo, professor of sociology and African-American studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She also has a upcoming book title, Blacks on the Block: The Politics of Race and Class in the City. I thank you both for joining us. I appreciate it. Professor GEORGE GALSTER (Professor of Urban Affairs, Wayne State University): Hello, Ed. Hello, Mary. Professor MARY PATTILLO (Professor of Sociology and African-American studies, Northwestern University): Hello, George. GORDON: George, let me start with you, if I may. What we're finding - and if we can bottom line it, and we've been hearing this for a long time - America is quickly becoming a society of haves and have nots. Prof. GALSTER: Yes. Our study, Ed - that was done at Wayne State University with my co-authors Jason Booza and Jackie Cutsinger - found very clearly that the middle income parts of our major metropolitan income distributions are rapidly diminishing. We found that since 1970, the middle class in American cities and suburbs have been declining by roughly one quarter. But even more dramatically, we found that the middle class neighborhoods - where there is a large variety of incomes represented, typically - have been declining even faster. They've been declining by almost 30 percent since 1970. And I think this disappearance of not only the middle class, but these highly diverse, middle class neighborhoods are very, very sobering for the American political and social future. GORDON: We should note that when we talk about middle class neighborhoods, we're talking about families that earn between 80 and 120 percent of the local median income. Prof. GALSTER: That's exactly right. GORDON: Talk to me if you will how you see and what you see to be the biggest concerns and problems when you talk about the social and political - and obviously - economic ramifications of all of this. Prof. GALSTER: Ed, I think that politically, when we have different income groups living in different neighborhoods and increasingly in different political jurisdictions throughout the metro area, that we're going to see the politics of selfishness become more and more dominant. By that I mean that different income groups are going to see their own class interests as the primary reason for enacting certain kinds of public policies. And because they have less diversity of classes within their political jurisdiction, those policies more and more are going to be self-serving. As far as social, I think that we found that people tend to reduce their stereotypes of other groups when they are able to live together as neighbors. And if more and more we're seeing neighborhoods which are representing only one income group, we're going to increasingly see polarization of attitudes and stereotypes among the different groups. And of course, economically, we've traditionally seen that the way that people in lower and middle income groups make it into higher income groups is by accessing the public services and jobs and social networks that the higher income groups can offer. And so with this increasing segregation of income groups, the geography of opportunity is becoming increasingly unequal for Americans. GORDON: Mary, here's an interesting dynamic in all of this. We know that the black middle class is disproportionately being hurt by all of this. But what we are seeing is a dynamic - even within the African-American community - of haves and have nots, and that is growing tremendously. Prof. PATTILLO: Definitely. Interestingly, the African-American population is always on the leading edge of a number of trends. And so class segregation within the black community actually is higher than it is within the white community in terms of residential class segregation. That's a little misleading, because while the classes in the African-American communities live separately, when you look at some of the measures we look at, they live more proximately. So the middle class black neighborhoods are proximate, are next door to, are adjacent to poor African-American neighborhoods. So you kind of have a mixed income situation in the black community for many years, even though within the larger segregated black community, you have this kind of segregation within the black community. And I think what this report shows, though, I think it reflects some of the suburbanization of the African-American community, the way in which more highly educated African-Americans are able now - more able to move out of traditional African-American communities. And I think this report is capturing some of that. GORDON: And Mary, what we also find when we talk about, quote, rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods is that many of the African-Americans that make it into what has been categorized as the rich neighborhood really are holding on often by fingernails. Prof. PATTILLO: Well, definitely. The black middle class is particularly fragile, especially, for example, when you look at wealth. We often think of class and we think of income. And so, for every dollar that whites make, African-Americans make about $. 68. And so there's a gap there, but the gap is really huge when you think about wealth. So if for every dollar that whites have in net worth, African-Americans have about $. 10. So that shows you the kind of fragile hold that African-Americans have on middle class status, because to be able to maintain middle class status you have to be able to weather certain kinds of economic storms - for example, loss of a job, or a family member who needs particular help, or the ability to pay for college. And with such meager wealth holdings in the African-American community, you see particular kinds of fragility among African-Americans. GORDON: George, it's interesting because Los Angeles really - if you look at the numbers - illustrates what we are talking about here. We've seen the share of a poor neighborhood go up 10 percent in Los Angeles, a rich neighborhood up by 14 percent. But the middle income neighborhood is down by 24 percent. Prof. GALSTER: Right. It's really quite dramatic how in some of our major metropolitan areas, the middle class neighborhoods are an endangered species, and quickly becoming extinct. And right now, it not only is Los Angeles - the circumstance where less than a third of their neighborhoods are qualifying as middle class neighborhoods - but other major metropolitan areas are not far behind. New York, Houston, Newark, Dallas, Bakersfield, El Paso - they're all in this situation of having a very, very polarized set of neighborhoods where the middle class neighborhood - which not only traditionally had middle class people living in it, but higher and lower income people living in it - those are indeed disappearing rapidly. GORDON: Mary, as you put your book together - The Politics of Race and Class in the City - I'm curious how you found the juxtaposition of what we're hearing from the White House, and that is that the economy is booming, that it's moving along - save gas prices and a couple of other things - and the idea that we are seeing what we're calling today the incredible shrinking middle class. Prof. PATTILLO: Right. Well, most of that is that the booming economy has pretty much benefited only a few. I mean, the wages in the middle sector and definitely at the bottom have definitely been stagnating, and we're talking about a - really, a 30-year, almost 40-year period now. So most of the growth -with the exception of the period in the late 1990s when you had that kind of dot-com boom when really incomes were growing across the income spectrum - as of late most of that growth, most of that whatever good economy that we have had has gone into corporate profits and, you know, there are a lot of stories about corporate pay and so on. And much of that wealth and income has been concentrated at the upper end. So the middle class - the income picture for the middle class has very much been stagnating and that's what this report shows in fact. GORDON: George Galster, what does this mean for - and pick up on your point -but what does this mean for what was a burgeoning black middle class in this country that was trying attain wealth, to build wealth and solidify it for future generations? Prof. GALSTER: Well, I think that the opportunities for any group to move up the economic ladder, and especially African-Americans, are very, very importantly structured by their residential location. And we're talking about access to things that we know are crucial aspects of social mobility, such as a healthy environment with low levels of environmental dangers for children such as lead poisoning. We're talking about an environment where children can have recreational opportunities free from the tremendous psychological and physical dangers associated with the violence in a potential neighborhood. We're talking about a place where, as they grow older, they can go to high quality schools. We're talking about places that increasingly are differentiated depending on where one lives and where one's parents' incomes are. And my fear is that this growing wealth of the upper part of the American income distribution is going to become perpetuated because of the fact that this upper tail of our income distribution is rapidly segregating themselves in exclusive communities. And they're holding within their own communities all of these geographic advantages which they're providing to their children. And they're not as widely available to children in other economic groups. And by default, children of lower economic status parents are not being able to afford the kinds of neighborhood environments and political jurisdictions where their chances for economic opportunity are going to be great. Prof. PATTILLO: And can I just add something about the situation for African-Americans there. GORDON: Very quickly for me, Mary. Prof. PATTILLO: Yes. When you compare middle class black and middle class white neighborhoods on every measure, middle class black neighborhoods have higher poverty rates, higher unemployment rates. One particular statistic in Houston, 12. 8 percent of the units were boarded up in middle class black neighborhoods, compared to the 2 percent of the units were boarded up in middle class white neighborhoods. And this gets to the kind of opportunities that George was just mentioning. GORDON: All right. George Galster is professor of urban affairs at Wayne State University and part of those that wrote the report for the Brookings Institution. And Mary Pattillo is professor of sociology and African-American studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Her new book soon to be released is, Black on the Block: The Politics of Race and Class in the City. I thank you both. Prof. GALSTER: Thank you. Prof. PATTILLO: Thank you. GORDON: Coming up, recognizing religious holidays in schools. Where should schools draw the line? And there goes the neighborhood. Some Harlem residents are complaining about their high-profile neighbor. We'll discuss these and other topics on our Roundtable, up next.  ED GORDON, host:  From NPR News, this is NEWS AND NOTES.

And so, for every dollar that whites make, African-Americans make about $. 68. And so there's a gap there, but the gap is really huge when you think about wealth. So if for every dollar that whites have in net worth, African-Americans have about $. 10. So that shows you the kind of fragile hold that African-Americans have on middle class status, because to be able to maintain middle class status you have to be able to weather certain kinds of economic storms - for example, loss of a job, or a family member who needs particular help, or the ability to pay for college. And with such meager wealth holdings in the African-American community, you see particular kinds of fragility among African-Americans.  GORDON: George, it's interesting because Los Angeles really - if you look at the numbers - illustrates what we are talking about here. We've seen the share of a poor neighborhood go up 10 percent in Los Angeles, a rich neighborhood up by 14 percent. But the middle income neighborhood is down by 24 percent.  Prof. GALSTER: Right. It's really quite dramatic how in some of our major metropolitan areas, the middle class neighborhoods are an endangered species, and quickly becoming extinct. And right now, it not only is Los Angeles - the circumstance where less than a third of their neighborhoods are qualifying as middle class neighborhoods - but other major metropolitan areas are not far behind.  New York, Houston, Newark, Dallas, Bakersfield, El Paso - they're all in this situation of having a very, very polarized set of neighborhoods where the middle class neighborhood - which not only traditionally had middle class people living in it, but higher and lower income people living in it - those are indeed disappearing rapidly.  GORDON: Mary, as you put your book together - The Politics of Race and Class in the City - I'm curious how you found the juxtaposition of what we're hearing from the White House, and that is that the economy is booming, that it's moving along - save gas prices and a couple of other things - and the idea that we are seeing what we're calling today the incredible shrinking middle class.  Prof. PATTILLO: Right. Well, most of that is that the booming economy has pretty much benefited only a few. I mean, the wages in the middle sector and definitely at the bottom have definitely been stagnating, and we're talking about a - really, a 30-year, almost 40-year period now. So most of the growth -with the exception of the period in the late 1990s when you had that kind of dot-com boom when really incomes were growing across the income spectrum - as of late most of that growth, most of that whatever good economy that we have had has gone into corporate profits and, you know, there are a lot of stories about corporate pay and so on. And much of that wealth and income has been concentrated at the upper end. So the middle class - the income picture for the middle class has very much been stagnating and that's what this report shows in fact.  GORDON: George Galster, what does this mean for - and pick up on your point -but what does this mean for what was a burgeoning black middle class in this country that was trying attain wealth, to build wealth and solidify it for future generations?  Prof. GALSTER: Well, I think that the opportunities for any group to move up the economic ladder, and especially African-Americans, are very, very importantly structured by their residential location.  And we're talking about access to things that we know are crucial aspects of social mobility, such as a healthy environment with low levels of environmental dangers for children such as lead poisoning. We're talking about an environment where children can have recreational opportunities free from the tremendous psychological and physical dangers associated with the violence in a potential neighborhood.  We're talking about a place where, as they grow older, they can go to high quality schools. We're talking about places that increasingly are differentiated depending on where one lives and where one's parents' incomes are.  And my fear is that this growing wealth of the upper part of the American income distribution is going to become perpetuated because of the fact that this upper tail of our income distribution is rapidly segregating themselves in exclusive communities. And they're holding within their own communities all of these geographic advantages which they're providing to their children. And they're not as widely available to children in other economic groups.  And by default, children of lower economic status parents are not being able to afford the kinds of neighborhood environments and political jurisdictions where their chances for economic opportunity are going to be great.  Prof. PATTILLO: And can I just add something about the situation for African-Americans there.  GORDON: Very quickly for me, Mary.  Prof. PATTILLO: Yes. When you compare middle class black and middle class white neighborhoods on every measure, middle class black neighborhoods have higher poverty rates, higher unemployment rates. One particular statistic in Houston, 12. 8 percent of the units were boarded up in middle class black neighborhoods, compared to the 2 percent of the units were boarded up in middle class white neighborhoods.  And this gets to the kind of opportunities that George was just mentioning.  GORDON: All right. George Galster is professor of urban affairs at Wayne State University and part of those that wrote the report for the Brookings Institution. And Mary Pattillo is professor of sociology and African-American studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Her new book soon to be released is, Black on the Block: The Politics of Race and Class in the City. I thank you both.  Prof. GALSTER: Thank you.  Prof. PATTILLO: Thank you.  GORDON: Coming up, recognizing religious holidays in schools. Where should schools draw the line? And there goes the neighborhood. Some Harlem residents are complaining about their high-profile neighbor. We'll discuss these and other topics on our Roundtable, up next.

Here's a term we haven't heard much when it comes to housing for some time: buyer's market. Home sales are down. The supply of housing for sale is up, prices are moderating. MARKETPLACE's Steve Tripoli is here to tell us more. Steve, what's going on in the market? STEVE TRIPOLI reporting: Noah, what's going on is that home sales were down for the third straight month in June. The June sales figures were 9 percent below June of last year, and the sales slowdown was sharpest in the northeast and the south. But sales are down north, south, east, and west. And prices are nearly flat nationwide. Now that's a change from the last few years. ADAMS: Now can it last, or is it a summertime thing? What do you think? TRIPOLI: Well, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors thinks it can last. David Lereah says things will get even better for buyers. Mr. DAVID LEREAH (Chief Economist, National Association of Realtors): Most definitely. We're going to see further price softening going forward because inventories are rising. And as they rise, sellers will start to bring their prices down, and that will bring buyers back into the market. So the scenario is we'll have more price softening before sales come back. ADAMS: So he's saying that prices are going to go down even further. TRIPOLI: That's right. And, you know, it depends - the size of the drops depends on location. You know, location, location, location. If you're in a recently hot market that's risen a lot lately - and that's mostly along the coast but also in the Midwest and some southern markets - in those places, the experts are saying prices can drop from 5 to 15 percent off their highs of last year. And don't forget some of those areas are not only seeing slackening demand, but this often happens when housing gets really hot - a lot of builders rushed in to take advantage, so now there's an oversupply depressing prices even further. So there are almost four million homes for sale nationwide now, so take your pick. And that's a seven-month supply of homes in the market. Last year at this time, that was less than four-and-a-half-month supply. ADAMS: Goodness. So kind of a bet here, buyers could wait even a bit longer? TRIPOLI: Well, that wouldn't be the worst idea. Those rising inventories are going to start forcing sellers to drop their prices, especially in those formerly hot markets. And it's starting to look like some folks who were thinking of buying are already holding back. That's one explanation for why the rental-housing market is very strong right now. Potential buyers seem to be sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what happens next. ADAMS: We're using the word hot. Does the weather have anything to do with what's going on? TRIPOLI: It isn't really a weather-driven phenomenon. I mean, usually summer is the buying season. But, you know, you're in a situation now where, you know, you see a buying slowdown, which has already happened. The inventories rise as they already have, and now we're in a stage where psychology kind of takes over. This is where the sellers can't quite believe they're not going to get the price their neighbors got for their houses last year, so they can't bring themselves to drop their price just yet. But again, in some places where there's a lot of housing on the market, that's already happening, like Washington, D. C. or Boston. Once prices do drop a little more, the demand for housing will start to catch up with supply, and maybe that will bring a more normal housing market next year. ADAMS: Yes but still, housing - very expensive for people who are just working for a living in many parts of the country. TRIPOLI: That's true. You know, many people have wondered if prices can hold up in those markets for some time, and somehow they have. There are demographic forces like jobs and immigration and quality of life that just keep drawing people. By the way, Noah, later today on MARKETPLACE, we'll be looking at how Lebanese refugees in Syria have put a big strain on that country's public services.

Car companies and oil companies need each other. But the profits of the two companies are not necessarily anything alike. That's all too clear in new reports of second-quarter profits from big oil and big car companies. Steve Tripoli from MARKETPLACE is with us. Steve, let's start with the oil companies reporting their profits today. ExxonMobil's profits are gigantic, and Royal Dutch/Shell also doing well. STEVE TRIPOLI reporting: Yeah. They didn't do too badly at all, Alex. ExxonMobil pulled in more than $10 billion in profits during the second quarter. That's the second-highest quarterly profit ever for a publicly traded U. S. company. Royal Dutch/Shell's profits were up 40 percent over last year's second quarter. They earned $6. 5 billion. And we learned yesterday that another giant, BP, earned over six billion, and that Conoco-Phillips was at five billion. So these are pretty good times for oil-company shareholders. CHADWICK: Not so good for gasoline buyers, though. A lot of them are complaining that the companies are just cashing in on high oil prices at their expense. TRIPOLI: Well, you know, Shell's CEO says his company's high profits are more a matter of Shell's learning to function efficiently. ExxonMobil says it made a lot off of refining. But I asked an analyst this morning whether the high profits had a lot to do with high prices at the pump, and she just burst out laughing and said, well, it's hard to ignore. So let's say the profits and gas prices are more than casual acquaintances. Whether the oil companies should be charging so much in this environment is an argument for others to have. CHADWICK: Okay. Automakers now. General Motors lost big in the second quarter, $3. 2 billion - lost that much. Hard not to notice that a big rival, Honda, made more than $1 billion. Are their fortunes - well, it sounds like they're heading in opposite directions. TRIPOLI: Well, in some senses they are, but not so much as you'd think. There was actually some good news hidden in GM's numbers. The company made money, over $1 billion in the quarter, on its everyday business operations. So the losses were these one-time pains tied to job-cutting incentives and straightening out some of their obligations. So don't count GM out yet. CHADWICK: But aren't Honda and, say, the Toyotas of the world doing well because they have fuel-efficient cars at the moment? TRIPOLI: Well, things aren't quite what they might seem there, either, although those two companies are renowned for fuel-efficiency. The auto-industry analyst Rebecca Lindland of Global Insight says car companies' fortunes aren't just tied to fuel efficiency or the lack of it, by a long shot. Ms. REBECCA LINDLAND (Auto-Industry Analyst, Global Insight): Fuel pricing has actually really played a very minimal role, especially in the U. S. market. When we look at, you know, what motivates a consumer to buy a vehicle, fuel prices are playing more into it, but at the end of the day, it also is a combination of lifestyle and utility. TRIPOLI: So she's saying people buy those Hondas and Toyotas because they're good cars, not just because they're fuel-sippers. By the way, since we're talking about big industries, later today on MARKETPLACE our series called Conversations from the Corner Office continues with a visit to one of the biggest homebuilders in America.

If you think it's harder to stretch your paycheck over all your bills these days, you may be on to something. Pay raises have been anemic lately. This year's looking no different, and get this. Even our past raises are turning out to be worse than we once thought. Steve Tripoli from MARKETPLACE joins us now. Steve, most people who get their incomes from salaries - most people get their income from salaries, rather, not investments. That's probably not the best way to go through life, right? STEVE TRIPOLI: It's not a very bright prospect right now in the present in the future, or as you said, even in the past. The latest projection for this year is for salaries to increase by 3. 7 percent, but that's lower than the projected inflation rate, so the average worker loses buying power. Next year's pay raises are expected to be about the same. ADAMS: And now we learn from the Commerce Department today that wage growth over the past three years, that time, wasn't quite what it seemed. TRIPOLI: Right. They took new facts and found out that total compensation for the past three years, that's wages and benefits, grew just three point - 2. 3 percent annually. They used to say it was 2. 9 percent a year, and that's not an insignificant difference. ADAMS: Now what's going on? Why aren't wages keeping up? TRIPOLI: Well the changing global economy certainly plays a role. I spoke with Steve Gross. He's a compensation expert at Mercer Consulting. He says employers are really struggling with how much to raise salaries. They're worried that they can't recover that cost as competition intensifies around the world. So we're seeing a lot of what he calls variable compensation these days, things like one-time bonuses and incentives that don't get locked into your salary base. Steve Gross says the changing economy's going to keep affecting different workers' salaries differently. Mr. STEVE GROSS (Mercer Compensation): I think it's going to be an hourglass. The higher-level work, the real, say, thinking activities, those are the things that Americans do best. The worker in the middle is where I see the biggest struggles. So without the continued thrust of education, I see that working-middle class, lower-middle class, middle-middle class having to either reinvent themselves or be left behind in the new economy. ADAMS: Well, Steve, what's the middle to do here? TRIPOLI: Well, you know, the economy has slowed down and the middle is cutting back. The Commerce Department says consumers have turned cautious.

This week, United became the fifth major airline to report a profit for the second quarter. Earnings are up more than 150 percent for the industry as a whole this time over last year. MARKETPLACE's Tess Vigeland is here. And Tess, first let's talk about United. Profitable? TESS VIGELAND reporting: Yes. It's been a long haul for this airline. This is the first quarterly profit since the year 2000. United reported a second-quarter net income of $119 million, that's about 93 cents a share. Now compare that with where it was just a year ago - for the second quarter of last year, it reported a loss of $1. 4 billion, $12. 33 a share. That time, it was still bankrupt. United exited Chapter 11 this past February, and it's been able to engineer this recover despite record high prices for jet fuel. BRAND: And other airlines are also profitable. Why the turnaround? VIGELAND: Yes, part of it is because as anyone knows who has booked a flight lately, all the airlines have been hiking their fares. In fact, Delta just announced yet another $5 price hike last week. That's $5 each way on domestic flights. Fares across the board are up about 10 percent just this year, but that's not stopping people from flying. So that demand is helping fuel these better earnings results despite those high oil prices. Southwest posted a $330-million profit. American, $291 million. Continental, $198 million. For American Airlines, by the way, that was only its second profit in the last five years. Now Northwest and Delta, of course, are still in Chapter 11, undergoing very painful cost-cutting measures. The other airlines already went through that, so they're starting to see the results, though that's small comfort to all the employees who had to take pay and benefit cuts, and in some cases, actually lost their jobs. BRAND: Well, tell us more about Northwest Airlines, because flight attendants there are fighting those cost-cutting measures. VIGELAND: Yes. This battle has been going on for quite a while now. Northwest has been able to get concessions from most of its unions, but the flight attendants don't want to accept the deal that the airline is offering to them. The union several times has threatened random walk-outs. And then you have kind of a last-minute deal, and then the union doesn't ratify it. That happened again this week. Northwest has been trying to get $1. 4 billion in wage and benefit cuts, trying to get out of bankruptcy. It has these agreements with pilots and ground operators, but those contracts don't take effect until something happens with the flight attendants. Northwest has now imposed a new contract on them, including an average pay cut of 21 percent. The flight attendants say that they have started a 15-day countdown toward a strike, which the airline claims would be illegal. So we'll see what happens there. And Madeleine, coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, we'll take a look at a company that says it's got a major update to the internal combustion engine. BRAND: Thank you, Tess. Tess Vigeland of Public Radio's daily business show MARKETPLACE. It's produced by American Public Media.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  Back now with DAY TO DAY. This week, United became the fifth major airline to report a profit for the second quarter. Earnings are up more than 150 percent for the industry as a whole this time over last year. MARKETPLACE's Tess Vigeland is here. And Tess, first let's talk about United. Profitable?  TESS VIGELAND reporting:  Yes. It's been a long haul for this airline. This is the first quarterly profit since the year 2000. United reported a second-quarter net income of $119 million, that's about 93 cents a share. Now compare that with where it was just a year ago - for the second quarter of last year, it reported a loss of $1. 4 billion, $12. 33 a share. That time, it was still bankrupt.  United exited Chapter 11 this past February, and it's been able to engineer this recover despite record high prices for jet fuel.  BRAND: And other airlines are also profitable. Why the turnaround?  VIGELAND: Yes, part of it is because as anyone knows who has booked a flight lately, all the airlines have been hiking their fares. In fact, Delta just announced yet another $5 price hike last week. That's $5 each way on domestic flights. Fares across the board are up about 10 percent just this year, but that's not stopping people from flying. So that demand is helping fuel these better earnings results despite those high oil prices.  Southwest posted a $330-million profit. American, $291 million. Continental, $198 million. For American Airlines, by the way, that was only its second profit in the last five years. Now Northwest and Delta, of course, are still in Chapter 11, undergoing very painful cost-cutting measures. The other airlines already went through that, so they're starting to see the results, though that's small comfort to all the employees who had to take pay and benefit cuts, and in some cases, actually lost their jobs.  BRAND: Well, tell us more about Northwest Airlines, because flight attendants there are fighting those cost-cutting measures.  VIGELAND: Yes. This battle has been going on for quite a while now. Northwest has been able to get concessions from most of its unions, but the flight attendants don't want to accept the deal that the airline is offering to them. The union several times has threatened random walk-outs. And then you have kind of a last-minute deal, and then the union doesn't ratify it. That happened again this week.  Northwest has been trying to get $1. 4 billion in wage and benefit cuts, trying to get out of bankruptcy.

Things started cooling off here in California and on the coast a few days ago. The heat wave moved on to the Midwest and the East. They may start to get some relief over the next couple of days. But the heat has already done damage to many businesses. Tess Vigeland is here from MARKETPLACE in Los Angeles. Tess, we talked on this program recently about how the heat was affecting farmers in California. Of course there are farmers in the rest of the country, too, indeed the nation's farm belt. TESS VIGELAND reporting: Yeah, exactly, and there have been lots of stories about cows dying in the heat. Those that survive are generating a lot less milk. That's going to be a hit on the dairy industry and could eventually affect milk prices at the grocery store. The heat wave is also apparently affecting demand for beef. On Wednesday, the USDA reported a 20 percent drop, just over the last week, in cattle slaughter, and attributable apparently in part to the heat wave. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it's too hot to barbecue. Cornfields across the U. S. drying up, just drying inside the husk, and of course it's not just the heat wave, but there's been a sustained drought that's being exacerbated by the heat wave. And the Agriculture Department declared natural disasters in several Midwest states, and that's been allowing some farmers to take cattle on to federal land for grazing when their farmland is just too dried up. CHADWICK: How about non-farm businesses? VIGELAND: Well, of course we all know that demand jumps for things like air conditioners and ice, but actually Starbucks put some of the blame on the heat yesterday when it reported earnings. Now the coffee chain did well in Q2, but it's growth was the slowest in five years, and the company says part of that is because in July, the breakfast crowd showed up looking for icy frappuccinos instead of hot espressos. The cold beverages take a little longer to make, so the lines were longer and apparently, that hurt business a bit. And the company says it's going to try to figure out how to make those blended drinks faster. And word from overseas that the heat wave there has caused backlog in orders for Beck's beer. They actually ran out of Beck's brew last month, also in part because of demand during the World Cup. According to Deutsche Welle, the company said this week that it's going to clear the backlog until the end of this month. CHADWICK: The nation's major retailers - major retail sales figures out today, and maybe you're seeing indications there of heat as well? VIGELAND: Yeah, both on the positive and negative side. Several stores, including Wal-Mart, Nordstrom, and JC Penney reported better-than-expected sales. Reportedly, some of that is because people went rushing back to the stores last month to pick up some more warm-weather clothing. But then you also had retailers like Target and the Gap reporting that the high temperatures were keeping folks from buying back-to-school clothes. You don't want all those browns and fall colors, and not to mention wool. So something of a split there among retailers, but certainly the weather playing a bit of a role on both sides of that equation. And later today on MARKETPLACE a look at Apple's deal with three automakers to put iPods in their cars. CHADWICK: Thank you, Tess.

The unemployment rate jumped to 4. 8 percent in July. That's the highest since February. The Labor Department also reported today that employers added fewer jobs last month than economists were expecting. Joining us to talk about this job news is MARKETPLACE's Amy Scott, and Amy, why the hiring slowdown? AMY SCOTT reporting:  Well, it seems employers are feeling a bit more cautious these days. It's partly due to energy prices. Their shipping and production costs are going up. But interest rates have also been rising, and the economy appears to be slowing down, and all that's creating a pretty uncertain climate. What's interesting, though, is that wages actually increased. It seems a bit counter-intuitive, but what typically happens during times like this is that instead of hiring new workers that they'll just have to lay off later, bosses are actually asking existing workers to work longer hours. The overtime adds up, and that's what's pushing up overall wages. BRAND: And the report, I understand, shows that the construction industry is creating fewer new jobs, so does that mean the housing boom is slowing down? SCOTT: It certainly looks that way. The economy added just 6,000 construction jobs last month, which is a significant slowdown, and we've had some other data out recently. Last week the California Association of Realtors warned that home sales would fall by nearly 17 percent this year. Mortgage defaults are up about 67 percent in the state. Some are worrying that doesn't bode well for the rest of the country. BRAND: And what does this all mean for interest rates? I understand the Federal Reserve Board meets next week. SCOTT: Well, analysts are mixed on this. The employment data, along with recent GDP figures, show that the economy is definitely slowing down. That would suggest that the Fed's 17 rate hikes in a row are doing their job. But inflation has continued to rise, so the Fed's in a bit of a quandary. Do you keep raising interest rates to fight inflation, or do you ease off the breaks a bit to let job growth recover? Economist Brian Bethune with research firm Global Insight expects the Fed to take a break. Mr. BRIAN BETHUNE (Economist, Global Insight): The Fed is probably saying there's a slowdown underway, and right now we probably want to stand pat and just see how this plays out, because the risk of another rate increase is that, you know, employment growth goes to zero or negative, and we don't want that to happen. BRAND: If the Fed does pause, and this has been long-awaited on Wall Street, Bethune expects investors to be uncorking the champagne today.

I'm Madeleine Brand. Oil prices are up by more than a dollar a barrel today on news of big pipeline trouble in Alaska. British Petroleum shut down an oil field indefinitely because of rusting and leaking pipes. That's about eight percent of U. S. oil production. MARKETPLACE senior business correspondent Bob Moon joins us now with more on this. And Bob, if this pipeline shutdown is already driving oil prices up, are people expecting the prices to go even higher? BOB MOON reporting: Well, let me be careful to draw a distinction here, Madeleine, between the impact on oil supplies and something that can, at times at least, seem totally unrelated, and that's the impact that this could have on oil prices. This news caught traders by surprise, and there may be nothing more prone to outright speculation right now than world oil petroleum supplies. The market's already in what one analyst calls a very high anxiety mode, and he says that any real disruption can affect prices, even if there's no threat of a supply shortage. At one point today, oil prices had spiked almost two percent. That's the bad news. Here's the good news. The Energy Department quickly tried to calm the markets today with a promise to provide oil from the country's emergency stockpile. That's the strategic petroleum reserve. If refineries ask for it, the Energy Department says they'll be in contact with these West Coast refiners to assess their needs and see if they should release some of this oil. We're talking about the loss here, by the way, of 400,000 barrels of oil every day while the flow is shut down in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil field. BRAND: Well, is there any concern at this stage that this could have a more widespread economic impact? MOON: Wall Street seems to think so. It's already showing a big case of the jitters over this. The stock market is selling off today on inflation fears and worries that any higher oil prices could also cause slower economic growth, and that could get us into this stagflation cycle that you may have heard about. There's also worry that this could renew the threat of inflation and cause the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, and monetary policy-makers are set to meet tomorrow on that question. BRAND: And how long are the repairs expected to take? MOON: Well, British Petroleum, BP, has said that it's unable to provide a timetable for repairs. This corrosion has apparently been found along several miles of pipeline. I spoke today to one oil analyst in Alaska who told me that it's well-documented that regular maintenance has been put off by at least a couple of years up there, so they might have some work to do. One analyst said today that he assumes that Prudhoe Bay could be out of action for some months now.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: And I'm Madeleine Brand. Maybe you've seen them behind your favorite restaurant the biodiesel fanatics. Alex, was that you I saw behind\u2026 CHADWICK: Not yet, not yet. BRAND: Oh okay good.  They collect used frying oil take it home and convert it into automobile fuel.  But those barrels of used cooking oil in the back alley have ignited a grease war in Salt Lake County, Utah. From member station KUER in Salt Lake City, Jennifer Brundin reports. JENNIFER BRUNDIN reporting: Kevin Newman lowers a barrel down from his Chevy Duramax Diesel Truck outside a shopping mall in Salt Lake City.  He pushes the empty barrel past clothing boutiques, candy stores and shoe shops into the kitchen of a high end Brazilian restaurant.  The line chefs chopping up eggplant, give him a nod as he walks over to another blue barrel, only this one is half full with used cooking oil. Mr. KEVIN NEWMAN (Biodiesel Home Brewer):  Pure vegetable oil.  That's it, there's nothing else in it, that's the good stuff. BRUNDIN: Newman switches the barrels, and takes the good stuff back to his garage, where he uses a machine, and cheap pantyhose to filter out the bits of steak, tortilla shells and chicken bones.  Then he adds methanol and lye to convert the kitchen waste into biodiesel. In a week Newman will have a finished product to fill up the six trucks he uses in his contracting business - all for about a buck a gallon. Mr. NEWMAN: I got a $35,000 truck here, and I'm putting used garbage from the back of restaurant in it.  I'm out of my mind. But you know what? (Soundbite of Truck Starting) Mr. NEWMAN: It works. BRAND: His openness about his passion is unusual in Salt Lake County.  That's because he's the only home brewer - that's what they call themselves - in the county with a legal permit to collect the grease. Mr. NEWMAN: Most people in Utah that are making biodiesel are very secretive, they won't talk to you about it. BRUNDIN: Home brewer Graden Blair(ph) estimates about 40 people in Salt Lake county were making biodiesel at home before a professional grease collecting company, Renegade Oil, began alerting the authorities.  The oil that many home brewers were collecting from restaurants contractually belonged to Renegade. Mr. GRADEN BLAIR :  We didn't know that, and we had - technically were stealing oil. Well as soon as we learned that, we very quickly said, hey, don't do this anymore, we didn't know.  It was kind of like dumpster diving.  So, what a lot of these people did is they began to put their own barrels behind restaurants, and that also where it became an issue. BRUNDIN: Renegade company president Jerry Peasley(ph) complains that home brewers aren't following proper regulations.  And says, that's not fair. Mr. JERRY PEASLEY (President of Rengade Company): If we didn't have to pay taxes and all the other things that we pay, we could really do well.  Compete, but compete with us on a level playing ground. BRUNDIN: Many home brewers never appreciated the high stakes nature of collecting used grease, it's a valuable commodity, bought and sold on international markets. Renegades Peasley insists that his company isn't afraid of competition from home brewers.  It's a matter of public safety. Mr. PEASLEY:  50 guys do it, then a 100 guys do it, then 300 guys do it.  And if it's not regulated, do you want to be next door to somebody using lye and stuff? BRUNDIN:  The county health department is enforcing a law requiring anyone who transports vegetable oil, to get a $125 permit and a $1 million insurance policy.  But home brewers say insurance brokers won't sell to them, unless they already have insurance for a business.  So, most have good underground. Blair is one of the lucky ones, he lives just North of Salt Lake, county. He Just bought a fancy new processor for his home brewing operation. Mr. BLAIR: I'm going to start collecting my oil again, which I can legally do in Davis County - thank you very much. And make my biodiesel, I'm thrilled to death. BRUNDIN: Elsewhere in the country backyard biodieselers appear to be operating fairly freely, although there are exceptions. In 2005, California lawmakers passed legislation that requires everyone transporting vegetable oil to have a license and insurance. Competition there between home brewers and waste collectors for grease is fierce, and some fear as gas prices continue to rise, the scramble for the nation's kitchen waste will only intensify. (Soundbite of machinery) Salt Laker Kevin Newman(ph) says he'll be right there in the fray, collecting his 500-pound barrels of vegetable oil. He's come to like that faint smell of French fries as he drives from restaurant to restaurant. Mr. KEVIN NEWMAN (Vegetable Oil Collector): On to the next one. (Soundbite of truck starting) BRUNDIN: For NPR News, I'm Jenny Brundin in Salt Lake City, Utah.  ALEX CHADWICK, host:  This is DAY TO DAY.  I'm Alex Chadwick.

In a week Newman will have a finished product to fill up the six trucks he uses in his contracting business - all for about a buck a gallon.  Mr. NEWMAN: I got a $35,000 truck here, and I'm putting used garbage from the back of restaurant in it.  I'm out of my mind. But you know what?  (Soundbite of Truck Starting)  Mr. NEWMAN: It works.  BRAND: His openness about his passion is unusual in Salt Lake County.  That's because he's the only home brewer - that's what they call themselves - in the county with a legal permit to collect the grease.  Mr. NEWMAN: Most people in Utah that are making biodiesel are very secretive, they won't talk to you about it.  BRUNDIN: Home brewer Graden Blair(ph) estimates about 40 people in Salt Lake county were making biodiesel at home before a professional grease collecting company, Renegade Oil, began alerting the authorities.  The oil that many home brewers were collecting from restaurants contractually belonged to Renegade.  Mr. GRADEN BLAIR :  We didn't know that, and we had - technically were stealing oil. Well as soon as we learned that, we very quickly said, hey, don't do this anymore, we didn't know.  It was kind of like dumpster diving.  So, what a lot of these people did is they began to put their own barrels behind restaurants, and that also where it became an issue.  BRUNDIN: Renegade company president Jerry Peasley(ph) complains that home brewers aren't following proper regulations.  And says, that's not fair.  Mr. JERRY PEASLEY (President of Rengade Company): If we didn't have to pay taxes and all the other things that we pay, we could really do well.  Compete, but compete with us on a level playing ground.  BRUNDIN: Many home brewers never appreciated the high stakes nature of collecting used grease, it's a valuable commodity, bought and sold on international markets.  Renegades Peasley insists that his company isn't afraid of competition from home brewers.  It's a matter of public safety.  Mr. PEASLEY:  50 guys do it, then a 100 guys do it, then 300 guys do it.  And if it's not regulated, do you want to be next door to somebody using lye and stuff?  BRUNDIN:  The county health department is enforcing a law requiring anyone who transports vegetable oil, to get a $125 permit and a $1 million insurance policy.  But home brewers say insurance brokers won't sell to them, unless they already have insurance for a business.  So, most have good underground. Blair is one of the lucky ones, he lives just North of Salt Lake, county.  He Just bought a fancy new processor for his home brewing operation.  Mr. BLAIR: I'm going to start collecting my oil again, which I can legally do in Davis County - thank you very much. And make my biodiesel, I'm thrilled to death.  BRUNDIN: Elsewhere in the country backyard biodieselers appear to be operating fairly freely, although there are exceptions. In 2005, California lawmakers passed legislation that requires everyone transporting vegetable oil to have a license and insurance. Competition there between home brewers and waste collectors for grease is fierce, and some fear as gas prices continue to rise, the scramble for the nation's kitchen waste will only intensify.  (Soundbite of machinery)  Salt Laker Kevin Newman(ph) says he'll be right there in the fray, collecting his 500-pound barrels of vegetable oil. He's come to like that faint smell of French fries as he drives from restaurant to restaurant.  Mr. KEVIN NEWMAN (Vegetable Oil Collector): On to the next one.

How much progress has there been now? BOB MOON reporting: Yeah, this is a question that seem to grow in urgency, Madeleine, every time the turmoil ratchets up in the Middle East or there's some other threat to global oil production - the shutdown of the country's biggest oil field up in Alaska, for example, this week. But the Wall Street Journal has taken a fresh look into what's been happening on the ethanol front, and it does find some progress, albeit limited progress. There are some very dramatic predictions about how popular ethanol might soon be, but so far this year, the big three automakers in Detroit have all said they plan to double their output of what they call flex-fuel cars. Those are vehicle specifically made to run on either gasoline or ethanol. There's also something of a boom in the construction of what the ethanol industry calls bio-refineries. That's actually a fancy name for what amounts to a multi-million-dollar still to brew up ethanol. If you pardon the pun, that boom has been fueled not so much by President Bush's focus on ethanol, though, as it has been by record energy prices. That's the catch-22 in all this, Madeleine: ethanol might help us cut back on gasoline use, but the higher energy prices have actually caused the prices for ethanol to appreciate by 50 percent in the past year. In some cases, it actually costs close to what gasoline costs. BRAND: Well let's say everyone decides to try out ethanol, thinking it might be a good idea to get of the oil dependence. How much is available out there? MOON: Good question. The Kroger Company has started selling ethanol-blend fuels at some of the gas stations it operates. Wal-Mart stores is among the retailers that are looking into ethanol blends. But a lot of the major oil companies have said they're skeptical about the viability of ethanol. It does, after all, cause people to buy less of their primary product, gasoline, and the reality is that out of the country's roughly 170,000 gas stations, it's still just a tiny fraction - it's around 800 stations - that sell ethanol. BRAND: Okay, so all this talk in Washington about alternative fuels, about ethanol. Is it real, or is it just political rhetoric.

JIM ZARROLI: Since June, 2004, the Fed's Open Markets Committee has raised the federal funds rate at 17 consecutive meetings in an effort to keep the economy from overheating. Yesterday, committee members decided to take a pause. The decision comes at a time when the nation's annual growth rate - which was so strong earlier this year - has fallen.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. Wall Street is proving to be resilient to news of the latest terrorist plot. The same cannot be said for shares of airlines and travel companies. CHADWICK: Bob Moon joins us from Public Radio's MARKETPLACE program. Bob, you've got the latest on financial effects of the reported terrorist plot? The stock market, how's it doing? BOB MOON reporting: It's really remarkable, but in fact this has tended to be the case whenever we've had one of these heightened terror alerts in the past few years. The stock market is actually doing okay. It does cause some uncertainty in the markets, which is something that always unsettles traders. They really don't like that. But it's something that the markets seem to have gotten used to, and more importantly, perhaps, seems - it's something that they've priced into stock prices now from an overall standpoint. European shares did close lower today. Britain's Footsie Index dropped about a half a percent. Germany's DAX was down more than 1 percent. But those markets had been even lower during the European trading day, so you really have to account for the fact that they did start to rebound. Wall Street has actually been holding its own today, prices actually a bit higher in early trading. The sell-off overseas seems to have given way now to traders taking a wait-and-see approach on the long-term effects of all this, and there have been some good profit reports out today. That seems to be offsetting any worries over this bombing plot. BRAND: Bob, what about oil prices? How is this affecting the oil markets? MOON: Yeah, if there's any good news in all this, that's it. Oil prices are down as much as 2 percent on some markets. Oil traders seem to be speculating that there could be less demand for fuel if this causes people to travel less. That's good news, though, because after a few days of record prices caused by the pipeline shutdown in Alaska, we're actually seeing some relief now. BRAND: And I understand airline stocks are taking a hit. Is that likely to be long-lasting, or is this just a short-term problem? MOON: Well, some analysts are saying this will only have a temporary effect. We've seen that a bit today in the price of airline shares. They did take a big hit on the European markets, but they've actually rebounded some on Wall Street today. CHADWICK: Bob, this I think is going to lead to a lot of people wanting to change their travel plans. Is this going to cost travelers with ticket-change penalties? MOON: Well, it varies by airline, Alex. American Airlines is going to issue travel vouchers or non-refundable tickets to those traveling to, from, or through the U. K. American says travelers can change their date of travel as late as September 1. Continental says customers due to depart from or travel to U. K. airports who don't want to travel today or tomorrow can change up until August 24th. United says it'll waive rules and restrictions for those already in the midst of their travels to allow a single change to their itinerary, as long as the origin or the destination cities stay the same. Those who haven't begun their travels to or from the U. K. on United can make one change without a fee. Today in the MARKETPLACE newsroom, we'll be following more of the fallout from all this.

I'm Madeleine Brand.  ALEX CHADWICK, host:  I'm Alex Chadwick. Alaskans pride themselves on their independence, but their economy is very dependent on oil. Petroleum company BP announced cutbacks in production there in this week after it found corroded pipes. It will try to keep some oil coming, the company says, but Alaska's worried because less oil means smaller state revenues. Libby Casey of member station KUAC reports from Fairbanks.  LIBBY CASEY reporting:  If you can handle Alaska's cold, dark winters and isolation, living here can seem like a good deal. It's the only state with no income or sales tax, and every October Alaskans get a check in the mail called the Permanent Fund Dividend, about $1000 per person. It's all thanks to oil. In addition, nearly 90 percent of the state's unrestricted budget comes from the industry. Former Deputy Revenue Commissioner Larry Persily.  Mr. LARRY PERSILY (Former Deputy Revenue Commissioner, Alaska): Alaskans feel dependent on the industry, no question. Do they realize how addicted they are to it? Probably don't want to admit it - most addicts don't. But we know that this is fragile in terms of cash flow to the state. If there's a long term significant production cutback, we're in trouble.  CASEY: The BP slow down could cost Alaska nearly six and a half million dollars a day in the form of lost taxes and lost royalty payments.  Mr. MICHAEL WILLIAMS (State Chief Economist, Alaska): I'd call that a big deal. CASEY: State Chief Economist Michael Williams. Mr. WILLIAMS: If you think in terms of your household, what would happen to you if your income fell by 40 percent for your household? It would get your attention.  CASEY: It's got the attention of the governor. To try and save money, Governor Frank Murkowski announced this week a state hiring freeze and said the shutdown hasn't helped government/industry relations. Governor FRANK MURKOWSKI (Alaska): What I see developing here, it's unfortunate, but there's been deterioration and a lack of trust between the industry and the producers and the administration and the legislature. And we've got to get back on track. CASEY: But Juno based economist Greg Erickson says the threat is overblown. He believes the governor's hiring freeze is really just political posturing. Mr. GREG ERICKSON (Economist): I don't think there'll be hardly any economic repercussions. There may be political and attitudinal repercussions, but I don't think it's going to have much impact on the economy. Not directly in any sense. CASEY: That's because, Erickson says, the state has a built-in financial buffer. The last few years of high oil prices have meant a windfall in royalties and taxes, creating a budget surplus. The state could also tap the millions of dollars set aside to forward fund education. And as a last resort, Alaska has a budget reserve account. In fact, many people here think the greater impact could be to the consumer, just like in the rest of America.  At a Fairbanks gas station, Diana Cylus(ph) fuels up her minivan. She fears the pipeline shutdown will mean higher heating bills, especially in a few months, when temperatures of 20 below will be the norm. And Cylus says the price of goods could go up, hitting rural areas hardest. Ms. DIANA CYLUS (Resident, Fairbanks): Well, I have noticed in the stores a lot of things rising, the produce and stuff like that. We import a lot of stuff, so it will affect it when they have to pay more to get things over here, you know, whether it's on a boat or a plane or a truck. So it's going to affect us all the way around. CASEY: There could be another ripple affect. The prized Permanent Fund, which pays out the yearly dividend checks, was started with oil money. Some still goes in, but most of the fund's billions now come from investments. Executive director Michael Burns says its fate really rides on the stock market. Mr. MICHAEL BURNS (The Permanent Fund): The challenge to the fund, rather than the lack of royalty money coming in, is what this might to do the national stock markets. The markets have not reacted very favorably to the shutting down of this and what it might do to oil prices and the affect on the economy. CHADWICK: Economist Greg Erickson says even if Alaskans don't immediately feel the affects of the BP shutdown, they are thinking about it. He says that may ultimately have unpredictable consequences.  Mr. ERICKSON: Might change their attitude towards development, might change their attitude towards the oil companies. All those things could have significant impacts on the state. CASEY: In the end, the impact may be political. The governor faces a serious challenge in the Republican primary later this month. Murkowski's opponents say he's too cozy with the oil industry. Alaskans will soon decide if he is or not, even if they can't shake their own oil addiction.

So it's going to affect us all the way around.  CASEY: There could be another ripple affect. The prized Permanent Fund, which pays out the yearly dividend checks, was started with oil money. Some still goes in, but most of the fund's billions now come from investments. Executive director Michael Burns says its fate really rides on the stock market.  Mr. MICHAEL BURNS (The Permanent Fund): The challenge to the fund, rather than the lack of royalty money coming in, is what this might to do the national stock markets. The markets have not reacted very favorably to the shutting down of this and what it might do to oil prices and the affect on the economy.  CHADWICK: Economist Greg Erickson says even if Alaskans don't immediately feel the affects of the BP shutdown, they are thinking about it. He says that may ultimately have unpredictable consequences.   Mr. ERICKSON: Might change their attitude towards development, might change their attitude towards the oil companies. All those things could have significant impacts on the state.  CASEY: In the end, the impact may be political. The governor faces a serious challenge in the Republican primary later this month. Murkowski's opponents say he's too cozy with the oil industry. Alaskans will soon decide if he is or not, even if they can't shake their own oil addiction. For NPR News, I'm Libby Casey in Fairbanks.

For many years one of the hottest housing markets was in Las Vegas. Your chances of finding a house were about as good as beating the house. But now interest rates are up, sales of existing homes are down, and real estate experts are predicting that Vegas will soon be a dead zone.  NPR's Alex Cohen has the story.  ALEX COHEN reporting:  People in the Las Vegas real estate business love to tell stories about 2004. Interest rats were low then and the appeal of Nevada's warm climate and lack of state income tax drew investors and home buyers in droves. Those days it wasn't unheard of for buyers to pay in cash, for a property to attract up to 30 bids on its first day listed. Bob Hamrick is president of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty.  Mr. BOB HAMRICK (President, Coldwell Banker Premier Realty): Two years ago, when we would go to a seller's property and say Mr. and Mr. Seller, your property is worth $400,000, they would say list it for 450. And a week later it would sell for 465.  COHEN: Homes are staying on the market a while longer now, but Hamrick still radiates confidence. At the mere mention of the word bubble, he brandishes a recent magazine article charting job growth in the U. S. over the past five years. Nevada leads the country with 19. 3 percent.  Mr. HAMRICK: One of the keys that Las Vegas brings to the table is job growth. It's much more difficult for property values to decrease when you've got new people coming to our marketplace who have to own real estate, who have to buy, who have to live somewhere.  COHEN: But others are much less sanguine. At the office of Realty ONE Group, salesman Kurt Lehman mulls over another set of charts and graphs, ones that show Las Vegas home sales down nearly 40 percent compared to a year ago.  And there are nearly eight times as many available properties here now as there were in the heyday of 2004. Many of those, Lehman adds, are foreclosures, a result of people who took out adjustable rate or exotic mortgages and can no longer afford them.  Mr. KURT LEHMAN (Agent, Realty ONE Group): The number of available listings is up considerably, probably 40 percent, of a year ago. Interest rates are floating up, which is having an impact. But we have too much inventory and not enough buyers. And there's a buyer mentality that says hold off, maybe prices will come down. COHEN: Most sellers, he says, are reluctant to drop their prices, especially knowing what sort of offers they might have gotten on their homes not too long ago. Instead, Lehman adds, many sellers are desperately trying to cling to their original list prices by throwing in added incentives.  Mr. LEHMAN: Like, you know, new carpet. We'll make an allowance for new carpet or all new appliances or put a pool in at this price.  COHEN: Lehman says realtors with an upbeat outlook are just trying to put a positive spin on a market that looks increasingly grim.  Mr. LEHMAN: My prediction? I don't see it crashing. No, I don't see one huge bubble that's going to pop. I see a lot of air pockets. So a lot of adjustment has to happen.  COHEN: Lehman estimates that home prices will drop at least another 10 percent before the market normalizes. In the meantime, the one thing he and most other realtors do seem to agree on is that right now Las Vegas is a buyer's market.  But not for every buyer. The median price for a home in Sin City now stands at $310,000. And that's way more than Perry Sunberg(ph) can afford. Sunberg teaches second grade in downtown Las Vegas. His wife works at a domestic violence shelter. Sunberg says they've been house hunting for over a year. Mr. PERRY SUNBERG (Resident, Las Vegas): It's kind of like looking at a menu and then not ordering anything. It's getting very frustrating.  COHEN: Sunberg's frustrations are echoed by fellow teachers, nurses, police and firefighters, who say they can't compete with those working in the gaming industry.  Mr. SUNBERG: I've had friends ask me, you know, should I move there. And I say only if you want to be a valet at a casino. Only if you want to be a dealer. If you want to be a teacher, no. Go to Tennessee, go to Kentucky, go to somewhere where you can actually get a job and a house. COHEN: Of course, if the city can't retain employees, that could make Las Vegas an even less attractive option to potential buyers. But there's no need to panic just yet, says Devon Reese(ph), president-elect of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors.  Reese points out that earlier this month, state legislators drafted a bill to build affordable housing on federal land. As for the slowdown in home sales, Reese says it's all about perspective. Compared with the past two years, the market may look dismal, but compared with the past 20 it looks quite normal. Mr. DEVON REESE (Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors): I've been here all my life, and I've seen it go through its peaks and valleys. And right now we may be down a little bit, but I can't imagine it being this way for very long. It never has in the past, and I really don't anticipate it to be that way in the future.

I'm Michele Norris. You don't have to search too hard to find examples of how high oil and gas prices are working their way through the economy. Today, Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, reported its first decline in net income in 10 years. The company says that's due in part to high gas prices in the U. S. Well, Wal-Mart, meet Sandy Neff. She's dealing with the same thing. Sandy Neff coordinates the food service program for Virginia's Augusta County School District. It had to raise the price of lunch for the first time in four years. It's going up 25 cents. Ms. SANDY NEFF (Food coordinator, Augusta County School District, Virginia): We try not to raise prices, obviously. But I think the straw that broke the camel's back was the increase in fuel cost and diesel fuel and all of that was passed on to us. NORRIS: Now when you walk around the kitchens and the cafeterias, can you sort of give us a description of all the goods you see and how those good have gone up in price and how that's been tied to the rise in oil prices? Ms. NEFF: Well, any type of paper, plastic products, you know, all of those increased. Produce, fruits, vegetables, because of some of the different hurricanes. But overriding factor was all the fuel surcharges that were tacked onto prices. NORRIS: You received some letters from some of the food suppliers explaining why they had to raise prices. What did those letters say? Ms. NEFF: Yes. Well, actually those letters went directly to the food distributorship that we work with. And big companies like Kellogg's, Reynold's, all of them were pointing out - aluminum products went up 6 percent, 8 percent. Translucent cups, 8 percent. Trashcan liners, 13 percent increase. Foam hinge lids, tableware, paper products, again, up 10 percent. NORRIS: So even the packaging is more expensive now. Ms. NEFF: Yes, exactly. Sugar prices went up dramatically. I was looking here - of course, this letter's dated November 20, 2005, and hurricanes reduced the crop of oranges by over 38 percent. And our students they love oranges, especially if we cut them up. And at the bottom of this letter, again, increased energy costs to run plants and increases in health insurance. NORRIS: Is that unusual that the food suppliers send these letters of explanation? Ms. NEFF: I don't know. I don't know if that's unusual. I'm sure they felt they needed to justify the costs going up. But I did talk to our food distributor and they said it was extremely high, it was significant and one of the highest increases they had seen. NORRIS: It almost seems like they're apologizing for having to hit you in the wallet. Ms. NEFF: Well, I mean, you know, I filled up my Toyota Corolla this morning and, you know, it was $31. I mean, I remember when it was $15 to fill it up. So all of that is impacting on the meals that we give our students. NORRIS: At this point you're still - even with the price increase - you're still able to limit the overall price of a student meal to $2. Ms. NEFF: Yes. NORRIS: That's an important threshold for you? Ms. NEFF: Absolutely. And, you know, one of the reasons we can do it, you know, the government does provide commodities such as chicken and canned pineapple tidbits and peaches, and so that helps to supplement our food program. NORRIS: Are you concerned that if you have to keep raising prices that some students might not be able to afford breakfast or lunch? Ms. NEFF: Well, I really don't know the impact? I've had cafeteria managers say that they anticipate a decrease in participation in school meals, that more people may start packing. So, you know, I don't know. I do know we're going to take it as a challenge and I want to increase participation. And we are trying to do all kinds of, you know, neat and healthy stuff for the students. NORRIS: Sandy Neff, it's been wonderful to talk to you. Ms. NEFF: Thanks. NORRIS: Sandy Neff coordinates the food service program for 21 schools in Augusta County. That's in north central Virginia.

A bomb scare caused a plan en route from England to Egypt to land in southern Italy today. It turned out to be a false alarm. There were two similar incidents earlier this week here in the U. S. On Wednesday, a plane from London to Washington was diverted to Boston after a passenger caused a disturbance. Yesterday, an airport in West Virginia was closed after someone found a suspicious liquid in a terminal. All this extra security is costing money, of course.  And joining me now to talk about that is Scott McCartney. He writes about air travel for the Wall Street Journal. And Scott, can you put a dollar figure on the cost of diverting a plane? Let's use Wednesday's flight diverted to Boston as an example. Mr. SCOTT MCCARTNEY (Wall Street Journal): It generally runs in the tens of thousands of dollars. And it really depends on the type of plane that's diverted, how long it's on the ground and things like that. But for airlines the cost - there's an added fuel cost, there's time for the crew, and lost time for the airplane, that they may have to put a different airplane into service. BRAND: And who bears that cost?  Mr. MCCARTNEY: Well, the airline does. I mean, we all end up paying for it in ticket prices, but diversions are something that airlines deal with on a fairly routine basis for all kinds of reasons: mechanical reasons or health reasons of a passenger, things like that. And so they kind of know who to deal with it. BRAND: But when you have a case of an unruly passenger who causes the diversion, shouldn't that passenger bear some sort of the responsibility, financially?  Mr. MCCARTNEY: Well, I think it's pretty rare that an airline has ever gone after that. It really becomes a criminal matter and the airline will press charges against the passenger. But I think it's very rare that the airline would actually go after the passenger for $40,000 of fuel costs. BRAND: But yet they could face criminal sanctions such as a fine, and then would that fine then go to the airline or not? Mr. MCCARTNEY: No, I think that's a - it's a federal matter and a fairly serious federal offense to impede the work of a flight crew. And I think passengers in the past have ended up with jail time who have caused major disturbances. BRAND: Well, I imagine these incidents are going to increase, what with tight security these days. So are we already seeing the increases in ticket prices as a result? Mr. MCCARTNEY: Well, ticket prices are so much driven by supply and demand. Ticket prices have been going up, but the pressure that airlines face from fuel costs are far greater than the pressure that they're facing from security costs. I think there will be higher security costs, but it's unclear yet if airlines will bear that or if Congress will pony up more money for the TSA or if passengers will bear the burden with an increase in the security fee that we pay on all tickets.

I'm Madeleine Brand. More trouble for the nation's number two automaker, Ford. The company announced another round of production cuts this morning. It will temporarily shut down a handful of North American plants as part of a long-term restructuring plan. MARKETPLACE'S Amy Scott is here. And Amy, more cuts? What's going on there at Ford? AMY SCOTT reporting: Well, Ford had a pretty rough second quarter. It lost more than $250 million and its sales last month weren't so hot. All that's increased the pressure on a turnaround plan that's already underway at the company, and these new cuts are really just an acceleration of that.  All in all, Ford plans to produce about nine percent fewer vehicles this year than it did last year, and mostly that's going to affect jobs at pick-up truck plants in cities like Dearborn, Michigan, Kansas City, Louisville, Kentucky. And Ford's CEO, Bill Ford, sent a note to employees acknowledging, you know, that impact on them, but he said basically these cuts are crucial to the company's long-term future. BRAND: Well, why pick-up trucks in particular? SCOTT: Well, it's partly higher gas prices. You know, as you know, people are definitely are looking for more fuel-efficient cars these days.  But auto analyst Eric Merkle with the research firm IRN has another theory. Apparently there's a strong correlation between pick-up truck sales and home building, which really took a dive last month. Mr. ERIC MERKLE (Auto Analyst): And the reason for that is because you've got a number of independent home builders, contractors, plumbers, electricians, so on and so forth, employed by the housing industry that are big buyers of pick-ups, and as that housing market cools, as it's starting to do, we would expect to see the pick-up truck market soften a bit too. SCOTT: I guess people are making fewer trips to Home Depot these days, or I guess they're taking the old truck. BRAND: Uh-huh. Or the car or the hybrid or whatever.  SCOTT: Right. BRAND: So Ford isn't the automaker in trouble. What's going on with GM?  SCOTT: Well, of course GM is facing a lot of the same pressures as Ford: declining truck and SUV sales, kind of ho-hum response to its newer vehicles, high labor costs. I'm told GM is a bit further along at cutting those costs than Ford is. GM recently signed up more than 30,000 workers to take voluntary retirement packages, and if you exclude the cost of those buyouts, GM would have turned a profit in its most recent quarter. So there is a bit of optimism there. GM is also talking about a possible alliance with Nissan and Renault that some say could save the company money on parts and engineering.  But you know, if there really is an economic downturn, neither company can really afford that. Coming up later on MARKETPLACE, we'll be talking about how private air taxis are flourishing as commercial air travel loses its appeal. BRAND: Thank you, Amy. Amy Scott of Public Radio's daily business show, MARKETPLACE, produced by American Public Media.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:   Back now with DAY TO DAY. I'm Madeleine Brand.  More trouble for the nation's number two automaker, Ford. The company announced another round of production cuts this morning. It will temporarily shut down a handful of North American plants as part of a long-term restructuring plan.  MARKETPLACE'S Amy Scott is here.  And Amy, more cuts? What's going on there at Ford?  AMY SCOTT reporting:  Well, Ford had a pretty rough second quarter. It lost more than $250 million and its sales last month weren't so hot. All that's increased the pressure on a turnaround plan that's already underway at the company, and these new cuts are really just an acceleration of that.   All in all, Ford plans to produce about nine percent fewer vehicles this year than it did last year, and mostly that's going to affect jobs at pick-up truck plants in cities like Dearborn, Michigan, Kansas City, Louisville, Kentucky. And Ford's CEO, Bill Ford, sent a note to employees acknowledging, you know, that impact on them, but he said basically these cuts are crucial to the company's long-term future.  BRAND: Well, why pick-up trucks in particular?  SCOTT: Well, it's partly higher gas prices. You know, as you know, people are definitely are looking for more fuel-efficient cars these days.   But auto analyst Eric Merkle with the research firm IRN has another theory. Apparently there's a strong correlation between pick-up truck sales and home building, which really took a dive last month.  Mr. ERIC MERKLE (Auto Analyst): And the reason for that is because you've got a number of independent home builders, contractors, plumbers, electricians, so on and so forth, employed by the housing industry that are big buyers of pick-ups, and as that housing market cools, as it's starting to do, we would expect to see the pick-up truck market soften a bit too.  SCOTT: I guess people are making fewer trips to Home Depot these days, or I guess they're taking the old truck.  BRAND: Uh-huh. Or the car or the hybrid or whatever.   SCOTT: Right.  BRAND: So Ford isn't the automaker in trouble. What's going on with GM?   SCOTT: Well, of course GM is facing a lot of the same pressures as Ford: declining truck and SUV sales, kind of ho-hum response to its newer vehicles, high labor costs. I'm told GM is a bit further along at cutting those costs than Ford is. GM recently signed up more than 30,000 workers to take voluntary retirement packages, and if you exclude the cost of those buyouts, GM would have turned a profit in its most recent quarter.  So there is a bit of optimism there. GM is also talking about a possible alliance with Nissan and Renault that some say could save the company money on parts and engineering.   But you know, if there really is an economic downturn, neither company can really afford that.  Coming up later on MARKETPLACE, we'll be talking about how private air taxis are flourishing as commercial air travel loses its appeal.  BRAND: Thank you, Amy.

I'm Madeleine Brand. More American consumers are changing their spending habits. They're cutting back on buying luxury items. There's a report out today that says companies that cater to upscale tastes are feeling the pinch. MARKETPLACE's senior business correspondent Bob Moon is here with more on this, and Bob, what kinds of retailers are being hit by this, and why does consumer behavior seem to be changing right now? BOB MOON reporting: Madeleine, the Wall Street Journal is out with a report today that points out that a lot of familiar names - we're talking companies here associated with what the paper calls the broader prosperity of the past decade - well, they're starting to show some strains: Starbucks and its $4 cups of coffee, for example; the upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Markets; the kitchen-store chain Williams-Sonoma, which also operates the Pottery Barn stores. Well, in the latest round of profit reporting for the second quarter of the year, sales for all those companies and, frankly, numerous others that tend to appeal to the upscale consumer have missed Wall Street expectations, and the value of their stock has been taking a beating because of that. The Journal points out that there's growing data that seems to suggest the major cause for this trend - no surprise here - is the soaring coast of gasoline. It seems strange to put it this way, but we were enjoying prices at the pump in the $2. 25 range on average across the country at the beginning of the year, so the rapid run-off that we've seen in the past few months - the rapid run-up, I should say - really started to crimp budgets here. It's gotten to the point that even restaurants that rely on middle-income customers are starting to report sagging sales. BRAND: Well, does this indicate a larger problem for the economy? MOON: Well, you know, the federal reserve has been looking to slow things down for the past couple of years. It's been raising interest rates steadily and just paused recently. The Journal reports that for now the latest budget tightening seems to be falling squarely on the middle-income consumer, that the rich are still buying luxury items. The slowdown took hold a while ago at Wal-Mart stores, for example, for lower-income shoppers and middle-income shoppers there. The Fed policy makers have been trying to watch this real carefully and bring the economy in for what the economists know as a soft landing. There's some concern among some experts about whether the Fed might have gone too far before it paused this rate-tightening cycle earlier this month. BRAND: And Bob, what do experts predict will happen with the companies that cater to luxury tastes? MOON: Well, a lot of these companies have been putting out warnings of slower sales. Wall Street calls that guidance. When companies report their quarterly results, they also report their expectations for the quarter ahead and for the rest of the year. And the guidance has been down pretty much across the board. Just to give you an idea of some of the more upscale restaurant chains that have warned of slowing sales: PF Chang's China Bistro, Cheesecake Factory, and even Applebee's. They all say that they expect customers won't be dining out as much in the months ahead. And today in the MARKETPLACE newsroom we're looking into a new kind of blockbuster bestseller for some publishers: video game guides. BRAND: Thank you, Bob.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. After five years of explosive growth, the housing market is finally cooling off. New national data show that the stock of unsold houses is up, prices are stable or dropping in most places, and sales this quarter are down from a year ago. And gone, at least for now, are the frenzy bidding wars in waived inspections of just a year ago, and the widespread assumption that your house would appreciate by 10 percent or more every year. But it's not the same everywhere. While sales plummeted in formally red hot markets like, Florida, California and Virginia, sales are up in 20 states including, Texas, North Carolina and Vermont. Still, the trend is definitely down, nationwide. We'll talk about the affect on the economy as a whole and what it means for suddenly lonely sellers; for buyers and for renters; for people who took advantage of low interest rates to buy a first home; and for those who bought second or third homes in hope of quick re-sales and good profits. How's the housing market where you live? If you have questions about buying or selling in a buyers market, our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail or send us your most outrageous story from those golden days of the housing boom. How many offers did you get on the first day? The address is talk@npr. org. Later on in the program, graphic non-fiction, the report of the 9/11 Commission comes out as a comic book. But first, the end of the boom. Lawrence Yun is a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors and he joins us here in Studio 3A. Thanks for coming in for the program today. Mr. LAWRENCE YUN (Senior Economist, National Association of Realtors): Good afternoon. CONAN: Besides all of the for sale signs we can all see out there, what indicators tell you that the boom is finally over? Mr. YUN: Well, the home sales activity peaked last August, and since that time sales have steadily trended downwards. But it's not only the sales but things like housing starts, mortgage purchase applications, the days on the market has been lengthening. So there are many indicator, basically saying that the boom is over, and now we are in a cooling trend. CONAN: And, I guess the next question is, a lot of people thought, well this was a big bubble and when it bursts it's going to burst fast. Are we in for what they're calling a hard landing or a softer landing? Mr. YUN: Well, all real estate is local. So some markets are seeing a rather sharp transition. For example, in Florida markets, where again it was very frenzied level of activity just last year, this year the inventory has doubled, tripled the level of last year. Buyers have suddenly disappeared. So there is a price - pressure on the prices to actually come down. But in other parts of the country, for example, say Austin, Texas or in Seattle, Washington, there is actually lack of inventory. Home prices are actually accelerating. So real estate is local, but overall, for the country as a whole, we are seeing maybe 70 percent of the country on a decline\u2026 CONAN: Mm-hmm. Mr. YUN: \u202630 percent on the rise. CONAN: Is it fair assumption to say that the hotter your local market was maybe two, three years - even one year ago - the more likely it is to be plummeting now? Mr. YUN: The overheated markets are the ones that are seeing the sudden transitions. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Now are all kinds of homes affected? Again this is all local, isn't it? Mr. YUN: It's local. One area that is taking a more plunge than other market is in the condo market. The - lot of investor demand of last year, now the investors are suddenly leaving. And typically, investors are more interested in low-maintenance properties. So they typically buy condo properties. Now the investors seeing a less opportunity for price appreciation, are leaving very fast, which I think is very healthy. I mean, we are cleansing out this non, you know, long-term buyers. So I think that's good for the market over the long-term. But over the short-term, there is a little pain as they are suddenly leaving. CONAN: And if people are wanting to actually sell their condominium for a real reason they could have a problem. Mr. YUN: That's right. So people who are not in the need to sell, if they sort of wait it out, I think the market will turn for the better. But in the short-term, at least over the next year, I think the market will be difficult. CONAN: Now, in terms of people who are selling for one reason or another, again, you were talking about there were record heights last year. People who are selling this year, for the most part are they getting less than they'd hoped or are they taking a loss? Mr. YUN: For most people, I mean, they're still gaining gains. I mean, so compared to last year, you know, they are still getting four, five percent higher price now compared to this time last year. But again, locally speaking -for example, in the D. C. market or Florida markets, or the, some of the California markets - now they are actually getting lower price now than what it was last year. CONAN: But that - if you've held on to your house for 10 years or five years, you're still going to have seen a lot of appreciation there? Mr. YUN: A person who bought a home five years ago - a typical U. S. homebuyer who bought a home five years ago - would have accumulated $60,000 in housing equity gain. So over the long-term, there is a gain. Even if there was to be a short-term fall, you know, a person who bought five, six years ago - they would still have very substantial equity gains. CONAN: Now, what does this do to the national economy? Housing has been an enormous part - not only the construction of new houses but also all the financing that goes on and the re-financing - as people saw very attractive interest rates. Mr. YUN: Housing directly contributes about 15 percent of the national economic activity, 15 percent of GDP, directly. Indirectly, basically through the housing equity accumulation taking - people are taking out cash re-fis and go out and buying automobiles, television, and such - that has been a very big boost in holding up consumer spending. I mean, many economists have been puzzled as to why consumer spending has held on so well over the past - the recession cycle, sluggish job growth - and the reason is due to the strong housing market. And now the housing market is cooling. I mean, that is certainly raising concern. And this is something, I think, particularly the Federal Reserve needs to carefully monitor, because if the - should the housing market, home prices suddenly flatten out, or even turn negative - that would imply consumer spending pull-back, and then may actually tip the economy into a recession. CONAN: Mm-hmm. And so at that point, interest rates - well, interest rates are always of enormous, you know, excuse the expression, interest - but interest rates in this particular regard, they've been trending up the last year or so. And now that's going to have to be carefully looked at. Mr. YUN: Certainly. You know, there was a pause in last Federal Reserve meeting. And my guess is that, you know, Federal Reserve need to monitor the housing market very carefully. You know, there are some signs where some markets are very fragile and any repercussion in the consumer spending area could have really a severe, negative economic consequences. CONAN: Well, let's get some listeners questions on the air as well. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us. 800-989-TALK, e-mail us talk@npr. org. Don't forget to sell us, send us your most outrageous story of the sellers' market. Here, joining us now on the line from Jewett City, in Connecticut, is Pricilla. PRICILLA (Caller): Yes. Hello. CONAN: Hi. PRICILLA: My husband is in the building trades, and right now what seems to be happening in Connecticut is they're really focusing on affordable housing, because people tend to be leaving Connecticut because of the lack of affordable housing. I'm wondering if that trend is going to continue, or if they see that as something that is going to be bottoming out also. Because right now, we've got a lot of people coming into Connecticut but there's not a lot of affordable housing. CONAN: Mm hmm. And just looking at the - quickly - at the statistics I have available - sales of homes in Connecticut was down three and one-half percent over the past year. So, Mr. Yun? Mr. YUN: Certainly the affordability issue has become a major problem in the past five years due to the significant (unintelligible) of home prices. So if you are a homeowner you gain the housing equity. But if the person was a renter and trying to enter the market now, you know, it's very difficult with higher home prices and higher mortgage rates. So, many people have been moving into the rental market and the rents have been strengthening. For some\u2026 CONAN: By strengthening, rents are getting higher, is what you're saying. Mr. YUN: Rents are getting higher. And some builders are recognizing that there is a strong housing demand on the lower end side and, you know, expanding into the affordable housing, and I think that's a great trend. Certainly in a high-priced market, you know, we are hearing stories of public-service workers -policeman, fireman - who have to live further out, that cannot afford to live in their locality. So any development in the affordable housing area is the right trend. CONAN: Mm hmm. And is that the kind of housing your husband builds, Priscilla? PRISCILLA: Yes, but I'm wondering what would be considered the median for Connecticut. Is there a median that you can give me an idea about what would be the cost of a median price of a house?  I know, right now, my house was $100,000 ten years ago and it's up to 315. Mr. YUN: You know, each local market, because of the variation in the land prices - I mean, the structure could be the same but due to the variation in the land prices - a different area would consider something affordable while the same home will be considered expensive in other parts. Connecticut is more a pricey market. I think any development of homes under $200,000 will be, I think, very good for many current renters who are looking into entering the homeownership market. PRISCILLA: Okay. CONAN: Good luck, Priscilla. PRISCILLA: Thank you very, very much. CONAN: Sure. PRISCILLA: Yep. Bye-bye. CONAN: Bye-bye. And let's go to Bill. Bill's calling us from Grand Junction, in Colorado. BILL (Caller):  Hi there. I was debating between renting and buying and I live in Colorado. And I was wondering what your thoughts were on the real-estate market, in general, in Colorado. CONAN: I'm just looking at this list and sales were down 2. 3 percent last year. But go ahead, Mr. Yun. Mr. YUN: Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountain region - I'm actually optimistic about that region. What we are seeing is that many people who have lived in California suddenly realize it's very difficult to live there, or people who have been owners in California are saying: hey, why not move to, say, Colorado, cash out, use the equity to buy a much larger house at a smaller price, and use the remaining cash for just enjoyable lifestyle. So, we are seeing a migration trend of people moving from California into Utah, Colorado\u2026 And I am more optimistic in, say, Rocky Mountain state, compared to the more coastal market. BILL: Thank you so very much. CONAN: Good luck, Bill. And very broadly speaking, as an economist like yourself, look at the demographics of the country - the number of immigrants coming in, the number of households that are expected to be created over the next 10 or 20 years - he market for housing looks pretty sunny. Mr. YUN: The immigrant demand has been very strong. You know, typically it takes several years for immigrants to sort of save for down payment. And the fact that we have had such a surge in immigrant population in the 1990s, and in the early part of this decade, they will pay strong dividend for the housing market going forward. And also, you know, U. S. is in the unique position where the population growth is very respectable, unlike European countries where there's population as stagnating or declining. So anytime a population is growing that just means that people need someplace to live, so we need to build more homes. CONAN: Lawrence Yun, thanks very much for your time. We appreciate it. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors. He was with us here in Studio 3A. When we come back, more of your calls. How's the housing market going where you live?  I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The housing boom is over, at least that's what the numbers tell us. Sales are down in more cities than they're up. Prices have leveled off in many other areas. We're talking about what the latest figures mean if you're looking to buy or sell or just testing the market. And in a few minutes, how a housing slowdown might affect the rest of the economy. Joining us now is Elizabeth Razzi. She's the author of The Fearless Home Buyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal, and the author of the forthcoming book, The Fearless Home Seller. She's with us here in Studio 3A. It sounds like you've anticipated this change. Ms. ELIZABETH RAZZI (Author, The Fearless Home Buyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal): Very often we're doing both buying and selling the same transaction so it's the whole deal. CONAN: Mm hmm. Yet, has the market changed in your experience?  Is it now a seller's market? Ms. RAZZI: Oh, absolutely. I mean - and it was changing even as I was writing the books. The markets of the last couple of years - you know, the extreme sellers' markets - were really just incredible, and it's not supposed to work like that. You're really not supposed to be able to sell a house in 24 hours. We kind of got used to it and there's some people who really have known nothing else. But it should take several weeks to several months to sell a home. You should be able to negotiate. You should be able to have a little selection. CONAN: Really?  This is a brand-new world for a lot of people\u2026 Ms. RAZZI: Exactly. It's back to normal. CONAN: Back to normal. Well, it's going to be a little disappointing for people who wonder why they're getting no action on a house that's priced just the same as their neighbor got last year. Ms. RAZZI: I think that's the key - it's priced just the same as their neighbor got last year - because the market has changed and now they have to compete with other sellers. That didn't use to be the case. You didn't really have any competition. CONAN: Is there sort of a point of disbelief, where sellers say, wait a minute, this can't possibly be; I'm just going to hold the price here for a while and see what happens? Ms. RAZZI: Well, yeah, and we have to also realize that we tend to view our own home the way we view our own children, which is a little bit above normal - above average. You know, our house is a place where we've lived and we've invested our own tastes in the place. And so, the idea that people wouldn't just want to go and snap it up immediately at this reasonable price is just a little bit offensive. CONAN: There's also the idea that, frenzy or not, the way most people buy houses is not to see an instant profit in six months or even two years time - but they buy to live in for five to ten years. Ms. RAZZI: Housing is the ultimate long-term investment. Real estate in general is a long-term investment and a lot of people forgot that. The whole idea of flipping real estate is just crazy. And I know a lot of people are being burned because they did invest in options to buy condos and things like that and turn quite nice profits within a year, and that's not typical. You know, typically you should be in a home three years at least - to have enough appreciation to cover the costs of hiring a broker to sell it, for one thing - and then to pocket a little bit of money. CONAN: And don't forget those moving costs. They're going to add up, too. Ms. RAZZI: Absolutely. CONAN: Let's get some listeners in on the conversation. This is Sandy(ph). Sandy is calling us from Saint Louis. SANDY (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi. SANDY: I put my house on craigslist-Saint Louis on August the fifth and I'm signing the contract on it tonight. Ms. RAZZI: Good for you. CONAN: Congratulations, Sandy. SANDY: I am so happy, I'm levitating. CONAN: And did you get the price that you had hoped to get? SANDY: I got about $7,000. 00 more. CONAN: Wow. SANDY: I took bids on the house on Sunday the 20th and there were three valid bids, and this bid was considerably above the next highest bid. CONAN: Hmm. So at least in Saint Louis, Missouri, Elizabeth Razzi, it looks like the old rules are still in effect. SANDY: I can't guarantee that because there's an awful lot of houses for sale. CONAN: Ah-ha. SANDY: And they're sitting there. CONAN: Why did yours move do you think? SANDY: Oh, I think - I wrote about my house and I live in a four-family building that was built by an architect in the 20s, and I guess I romanced it. I put a headline on it that said: Small castle with income. CONAN: (Soundbite of laughter). So\u2026 SANDY: A wonderful young prince has bought it. CONAN: Salesmanship always matters, Elizabeth. SANDY: Well, sell the sizzle, I guess, but it's still a wonderful house. It's well worth it. Ms. RAZZI: Well, it always helps to have a desirable property and to have something that can be set apart from the big flock of homes that are competing with yours on the market. Yours had two things going for it, it had the architectural distinction and the income property. And they're two great things that you were able to promote in your advertising and that's a smart thing to do. SANDY: Thank you. I'm so happy these people are going to have it. CONAN: And have you found a new place to live, Sandy? SANDY: Yes, I have. I'm moving into an area where a lot of people are restoring houses. It's called Benton Park. It's right near the Anheuser-Busch Brewery - not a commercial - and a lot of good people are moving there, and I'm going to, too. CONAN: Sandy, good luck to you. SANDY: Thank you so much. CONAN: Bye-bye. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is Joseph(ph). Joseph calling us from New Orleans. JOSEPH (Caller): Yeah, good afternoon. CONAN: Afternoon. JOSEPH: I'm just calling to try to - maybe you can give me some guidance. I don't know about what's going to happen with the market. We all kind of need to, you know - need to know if we should stay with our houses or sell our houses. My house was about 50 percent destroyed - completely gutted - and it's a shell of a house now, and I'm living in a FEMA trailer in the front yard and I'm trying to decide - should I sell or should I hold onto it until, like, next season. You know, it's a very confusing time for a lot of us down here. CONAN: Elizabeth, any advice? Ms. RAZZI: Well, unfortunately, you're in such an unusual situation. So much of your decision-making depends on what other people are going to do - whether they're going to rebuild the floodwalls and the levees to the levels that will protect your home or not, what's going to happen to the whole area around you. You really need to look at the overall city planning, and what FEMA and the corps. of engineers and everybody's going to do, to decide if that old property of yours is going to be as valuable to you as it was before the storm. JOSEPH: Right. (Unintelligible)\u2026 Ms. RAZZI: Not an easy decision. JOSEPH: Yeah. There's a lot of factors involved. Fortunately, I live in a neighborhood that is pretty much coming back. It wasn't completely destroyed. The first two blocks of our neighborhood were destroyed, and then the other ones - they were fine. So, I think in the future we have a good place to be. CONAN: Well, it sounds as if you have a strong - at least a rationale - for your emotional attachment. JOSEPH: Well yeah, that's true, too. You know, it's like - you have to want to be there, for sure. CONAN: Yeah, absolutely. JOSEPH: Yeah. CONAN: Good luck. JOSEPH: Thank you very much. CONAN: So long. Buying or selling a house can often be an emotional transaction as well as a financial one. Those emotions can wield considerable power. Robert Shiller is an economics professor at Yale University and the author of Irrational Exuberance, second edition. He joins us now from a Yale University studio in New Haven, Connecticut. Nice to have you back on the program. Mr. ROBERT SHILLER (Author, Irrational Exuberance): Hi. CONAN: Do you feel justified in your predictions of some years ago?  The irrational exuberance finally over, do you think? Mr. SHILLER: Well, in the stock market, but we're talking about the housing market. CONAN: Yes, indeed, but you were writing about that as well. Mr. SHILLER: That's what I added in the second edition, because I thought that we were going through a boom in the housing market that looked an awful lot like the boom that we saw in the 90s in the stock market - driven by human psychology. And your two speakers, so far, really haven't mentioned that. I'm concerned about this market because I think it's supported by feelings that the market will continue to go up. And once that stops happening there's going to be people who want to sell. CONAN: Yet, thus far - and a lot of people talked about this - thus far people are predicting, by and large, a soft landing. Yes, prices are stable - or going down in some places - but they're not expecting a real drop in prices. Mr. SHILLER: Well, it's possible they're right. I suppose we can hope that they're right. But we've seen big drops. This is the biggest real estate boom in U. S. history and I don't see how anyone can be confident. The futures market for a single-family homes - which just opened in Chicago - is now predicting declines of between four and five percent, for ten major U. S. cities, by May of this year. Now, I don't know. Maybe not quite so soon, but there's a lot of people worrying about declines and those worries could have the effect of getting people to sell and producing those declines. CONAN: Mm hmm. And the psychological effect - I guess it's the same as the boom except in reverse. Mr. SHILLER: We can go down on a negative path. As prices start falling, more and more people hear about that, and they think - why am I holding two homes, you know?  Or why am I holding a home at all? I could live in an apartment. And it doesn't take a whole lot of those people to throw the market out of bounds and start producing more declines. CONAN: So what statistics - what numbers - do you look at as indicators? Mr. SHILLER: Well first of all, it's the futures market, because that is the market that is a forecasting market. And we've learned that such markets have predicting power. Beyond that, there's a lot of, you know, we've seen a lot of signs that a peak may be at hand. And Lawrence Yun mentioned some of those, without the same interpretation that I would give. I mean, he was generally not painting this as a dramatic scenario. But we've seen a sharp drop in how housing starts and in permits in the last few months. And these are leading indicators. Housing permits is one of the ten leading indicators in the index of leading indicators because it has, in the past, had consequences. When people stop buying or building houses, that's something to start worrying about. But I don't know for sure, I would say. It could just resume going up. But at this point, it looks like this could be a major turning point. CONAN: In the articles that I've read, people say, you know, a precipitous collapse of housing prices is often connected to losses in the job market at the same time housing is going down. That does not seem to be happening. Mr. SHILLER: Well, but I don't think that this drop in home prices is likely right away. I mean, I'm thinking that a plausible scenario would be a recession in 2008 accompanied by serious drops in home prices. It's a plausible - you know, it has maybe a probability of less than a half, but it's the kind of thing that's happened many times in history. And why do we have recessions? Well, these are difficult things to disentangle, but the real estate market is part of the process that brings on a recession. So it's not as if it has to be coming from somewhere else, it comes from the real estate market. CONAN: Elizabeth Razzi, what do you people tell you when you talk to them? Ms. RAZZI: Well, the thing is I think we need to constantly keep in mind that the housing market does operate differently than the stock market, the bond market, and commodities markets; in that people are not going to decide - oh housing prices are about to go down, I better sell my house, my homestead, and go move into an apartment somewhere just because of finances. I don't think that kind of apocalypse is coming. And also people have lifestyle needs and decisions. You know, if two - if a young couple has a baby on the way and plans for a larger family, they're not thinking of a two-bedroom apartment, they're thinking about a home, a house somewhere. And if they're planning to be there five years, ten years, which is not unreasonable, that's a fairly safe decision to make. Even regardless of what's happening with futures, commodities, and interest rates, that's a lifestyle decision and it's usually a pretty sound one. CONAN: And, Robert Shiller, it's a fairly large segment of the housing market. Mr. SHILLER: Well, you know, we've seen drops in prices before. And so something happened in the early 90s that brought - Los Angeles lost 40 percent of its real value between 1990 and 1997. Ms. RAZZI: Right, but then it went on to gain that value back, plus more, for people who held on longer. Mr. SHILLER: It did this time. Yeah, but you know, that doesn't mean it's going to happen next time. We saw some major\u2026 You know, there was a huge real estate boom in California in the 1880s and then it dropped. It didn't come back until the 1970s - there was a huge increase. So\u2026 Ms. RAZZI: Well, there was giant earthquakes that had something to do with that as well. But the thing is\u2026 Mr. SHILLER: No, not for another 20\u2026 Ms. RAZZI: Individuals still had to make a decision on where to buy. CONAN: We're discussing the drop and stabilization of housing prices in many parts of the country. If you'd like to join the conversation, our number is 800-989-8255. Our e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get another caller on the line. And this is Bill. Bill's with us from San Jose. BILL (Caller): Yeah, hi. CONAN: Hi. BILL (Caller): I'd like to hear your guests talk more about the economics that we're underpinning this huge run-up in prices and that I think now we're reversing and could cause the same thing to deflate this bubble. So, what I'm thinking are the main underpinning economic factors here, were the historic change in interest rates that the Federal Reserve made - lowering interest rates to historic lows in a very fast pace - and that created a huge lever on housing prices, allowing people to borrow more money for the salary. And the other thing - and I live in Silicon Valley - what's been driving prices here, are these really exotic loan types - option-ARMS interest-only loans -that, again, have been a huge lever. And I understand - I know that the interest rates have gone up. Maybe they'll go up more, maybe they won't. But they've already gone up a lot vis-\u00e0-vis where they were before. And now I'm hear that the regulating authorities are going to be cramping down on these exotic loans because people are really misusing them. I'd like to hear the guests talk more about this and what that could do. In my mind, it seems like prices could go back to where they were three or four years ago, which wouldn't be a 10 or 20 percent decline, it would be a 70 or 80 percent decline in prices. And that's really amazing. CONAN: Robert Shiller, what do you think? Mr. SHILLER: Well, Bill is absolutely right to bring up this issue, and it's something I've been bringing up. I've been trying to talk to the regulators. They haven't been moving fast on the - there's nothing wrong with ARMS or option ARMS for the right people. But he problem is that some people have been using them in a wishful thinking to buy a house that's bigger than they can afford. It's the short rates that went down to one percent, when the Fed was really cutting rates, that made the ARM seem like such a way to buy a really big house for some people, especially less-educated people who bought them. It's a real problem. CONAN: I should just say an ARM is an adjustable rate mortgage. And, Elizabeth Razzi, that's just one of the exotic financing options that were made available. Ms. RAZZI: Well, an adjustable rate mortgage in itself is not all that exotic. They've been around quite a long time. One-year adjustable or a hybrid loan that's fixed for five, seven, ten years and then switches to a one-year adjustable is a fairly reasonable thing to do. Unfortunately, over the last couple of years, a lot of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers were pushing these payment option mortgages where you could not pay enough to pay off the loan every month, or you could skip payments, or you could make only interest payments. And it was very much like buying your house on a credit card. And you would get into the same kind of debt trouble as buying a house on a credit card. I think they were absolutely irresponsible in making those loans. And I know some very well educated, savvy people, who did not understand the degree to which their payments could go up. CONAN: And, Robert Shiller, do you think that all of this could snowball into the kind of price declines that Bill was talking about? Mr. SHILLER: I think it's an important factor, although the most important factor is just the psychology. We don't, you know, even if there were no option ARMS, we could still have a bust just as we'd have in the past. It just depends on psychology. CONAN: Don't busts, though, looking back at psychological - doesn't something sort of trigger them and they happen very suddenly. Mr. SHILLER: Not in real estate. Well, even in the stock market, nobody really - the triggers are so hard to see. What caused the crash of '29? People still don't know. What happened in October of 1987? It seems to be, I think, psychology is the unseen factor. And unfortunate for economics, it's not easy to describe. But you sense that the psychology is changing now. I'm not sure about it, but I mean it confirms why I see markets predicting price declines coming up. CONAN: And yet prices could be more or less stable, you're suggesting, even if - as the psychology does change for two or three years. Mr. SHILLER: Yeah. I'm not at all sure what prices will do. What\u2026 Interesting case is Australia, cause it seemed to be leading. I thought Australia would be a case study for our own housing bust. But now, according to the latest news from Australia, it looks like their market is firming again. So, you know, you just can't predict. CONAN: Bill, thanks very much for the call. And we'll be back after a short break. If you'd like to join our conversation on the meaning for the economy and for buyers and sellers of the stabilization, or drop in many places, of housing prices, give us a call, 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Plus 9/11 depicting in the pages of a new comic book. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington, and here are the headlines from some of the stories we're following here today at NPR News. Iran's chief nuclear negotiator says Tehran is ready for what he calls serious talks over its nuclear program. It's unclear if the government is willing to suspend uranium enrichment, which is a key demand of Western governments. Iran could face U. N. sanctions if it does not suspend its nuclear program by the end of this month. And in Baghdad, prosecutors heard gruesome witness testimony in the second trial of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Survivors of the chemical weapons attack in 1987 recalled a greenish smoke that sickened them. The testimony caused one of the court recorders to burst into tears. Saddam Hussein says the survivor's testimony was coached. You can hear details one those stories of those stories and, of course, much more later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, it's been more than a week since the cease-fire took hold in Lebanon. We'll talk about the political fallout from the fighting and the peace, both in Lebanon and in Israel. Plus, with midterm elections nearing and plenty to talk about this week, an expanded visit with our political junkie. That's tomorrow TALK OF THE NATION. In a few minutes, why you can now read the 9/11 Report as a graphic, well, non-fiction. Right now we're talking about the end of the housing boom. Our guests are Elizabeth Razzi, the author of The Fearless Homebuyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal, and Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale, and author of the book, Irrational Exuberance. And let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is Sam. Sam's calling us from the Bay Area in California. Sam, are you there? SAM (Caller): Yes I am. CONAN: You're on the air. Go ahead please. SAM: Yes. I'm a real estate broker in the Bay Area, and I want to say to Doctor Shiller, I wish I'd listen to you in 1999. I remember the same conversation vis-\u00e0-vis the stock market. And I was over-involved with three jobs and didn't pull out of the market. You were dead on. I refer to the book, Devil Take the Hindmost, which tracks these kinds of trends. You probably are familiar with it. And there's something to be learned there. I think we are at the peak of the markets here in the Bay Area. We've seen four or five percent drops in prices on very good homes - that are very good homes, are in great shape - can't be anything other than the topping of the bubble. That's all I really have to say on this. And, again, Doctor Shiller, I appreciate your help. CONAN: And, Sam, does Doctor Shiller's description - not his alone, but other people have called it too, a bubble, in other words, something that's unsupportable once the psychology changes it - you would describe the real estate market in San Francisco that way? SAM: I think that's reasonable. But one other thing I want to address also, is the fact that the lending side has really gotten out of control. Same thing happened in the 80s, people were making crazy loans. Lenders will make loans if they can make the points, and that's what they're doing. I would say that the Fed has been irresponsible in keeping interest rates down for way too long, even though that's benefited me personally. I think that's a great reason for the sprint in housing prices. And if you look at the past, that's what happened with the stock markets and other bubbles that have occurred in the last 200 years. It's classic. So, you know, just a simple observation. CONAN: Robert Shiller, nice to hear some kind words. Mr. SHILLER: Yeah. The Bay Area is one of the most glamorous areas in this country, and glamour areas are vulnerable to booms or bubbles. They're close to Silicon Valley, which has achieved huge home prices. Now Lawrence Yun was just saying that a lot of people are moving to the Colorado or neighboring states because it's so expensive out there in California. And so I think that's part of the process. Even though these places are so highly-priced, we shouldn't trust those prices for the long run because people can move away and new construction can come in to find alternative places for people to live, and that will bring prices down. CONAN: Elizabeth Razzi? Ms. RAZZI: Well, that's why you can have a little more comfort in buying a home in a place that hasn't had that kind of huge run-up. I mean, the Bay Area is about the - the poster-child for the real-estate bubble. It just got so expensive that it wasn't worth what it takes to live there - you can get a good job somewhere else in the country - and that's sort of a self-limiting thing. But there are lots of places in the country where you can move and find affordable housing and where you can take the risk and make a bet on investing your money in a home for several years. You know, it's riskier - the metro areas where, you know, people have been speculating on houses, and condos especially, the resort areas, they're the riskier ones - where people were taking out those really risky mortgage loans to stretch beyond their capability to get into homes. That's where the problem is. CONAN: Sam, thanks for the call. Good luck. SAM: Okay, thank you. CONAN: Bye-bye. And let's see if we can get one last call in. Christina(ph). Christina's with us from Sacramento. CHRISTINA (Caller): Yes, hello. CONAN: Hi. CHRISTINA: Thank you so much today. I'd like to say first of all that all the points that have been covered so far are valid from my experiences. I'm a realtor in Sacramento. And I would like to talk about the psychology of fear and what's going on in relation to my unique experiences with the Spanish-speaking immigrant community. First of all, it's really important to remember, when I'm speaking here, that there's a huge percentage of Spanish-speaking immigrants that are a part of the U. S. consumer economy. And previously they were able - because it is not the law, it's a lender preference as what the qualifications are - it was easier for them to qualify for a loan showing their documentation, whatever they had. But in California, what happened was, when the Driver's License Bill was repealed and did not allow the undocumented immigrants to re-apply for their driver's licenses or identification cards - what happens is literally hundreds if not thousands daily in California have their current driver's licenses expired. Okay? So the implications, the economic implications of that, not to mention the personal ones, are huge when it comes to people that have been employed as jobs as drivers, and their employers are also scared because they might have to document them, or they can't get insurance for their drivers because they don't have a driver's license. So what happens is that the instability and the fear of this has stopped, not only the Spanish-speaking community from wanting to apply for a loan because they're afraid of what happens to their job status, but also the lenders have gotten a lot more careful about that. And at the time of closing, when you're signing your escrow documents, you have to have a current, valid form of identification. It doesn't matter what country you're from, it has to be valid. CONAN: And these\u2026 CHRISTINA: A lot of these people have been here for like 10, 15, 20 years. They have their identification. They're not current in their former country because they've been here and been able to use this identification, and now it's not valid. CONAN: Yeah, I think we get the point, Christina, and Robert Schiller, I'd like to ask you to respond to that. Obviously, these kinds of restrictions seem to be on the increase across the country. Mr. SHILLER: Yes, see, the kind of thing - she brings up what lenders might do. If the market starts to turn, lenders might be less willing to even approve a loan with a high loan-to-value ratio. And so they'll expect - you know, lenders have been eroding their standards. It used to be that they wouldn't loan you for more than - a house - more than three years' income. But now typically, you know, they go up for four, five, or even eight years' income. And they're going to - they're not going to want to do this, not even regulators. If they see the market turning, they're going to get worried, too. CONAN: What about those overall, though, sunnier demographic statistics that Lawrence Yun also talked about, the number of household formations and, indeed, the number of immigrants who will be here with documents and able to buy first houses? Mr. SHILLER: In Irrational Exuberance, my book, I looked at demographic factors, at construction-cost factors, interest rates. I don't see that these things are really the dominate movers of the housing market, historically. They sound plausible, and they must play some role. If you look particularly at population growth, it has had none of the magnitude of the swings we've seen in house prices. It's partly because they\u2026 You know, what logically should be pushing home prices is construction costs, because the home industry can build new houses when demand goes up, and construction costs haven't been going up -you know, prices going up, relative to construction costs - which seems unstable right now. CONAN: Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. Christina, thanks very much for the call. Good luck to you in Sacramento. CHRISTINA: Thank you. CONAN: And our thanks to Robert Shiller, who's the author most recently of Irrational Exuberance, Second Edition, and he joined us from Yale University Studio in New Haven. Thanks again. Mr. SHILLER: Okay, my pleasure. CONAN: And our thanks to also Elizabeth Razzi, author of The Fearless Home Buyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal, and the forthcoming book, The Fearless Home Seller. It looks like you're going to have a lot of lack of fear to do that. Ms. RAZZI: Absolutely. CONAN: Elizabeth was here with us in Studio 3A. When we come back, the 9/11 Report, the graphic non-fiction.  NEAL CONAN: host  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  After five years of explosive growth, the housing market is finally cooling off. New national data show that the stock of unsold houses is up, prices are stable or dropping in most places, and sales this quarter are down from a year ago. And gone, at least for now, are the frenzy bidding wars in waived inspections of just a year ago, and the widespread assumption that your house would appreciate by 10 percent or more every year.  But it's not the same everywhere. While sales plummeted in formally red hot markets like, Florida, California and Virginia, sales are up in 20 states including, Texas, North Carolina and Vermont. Still, the trend is definitely down, nationwide. We'll talk about the affect on the economy as a whole and what it means for suddenly lonely sellers; for buyers and for renters; for people who took advantage of low interest rates to buy a first home; and for those who bought second or third homes in hope of quick re-sales and good profits.  How's the housing market where you live? If you have questions about buying or selling in a buyers market, our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail or send us your most outrageous story from those golden days of the housing boom. How many offers did you get on the first day? The address is talk@npr. org.  Later on in the program, graphic non-fiction, the report of the 9/11 Commission comes out as a comic book. But first, the end of the boom.  Lawrence Yun is a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors and he joins us here in Studio 3A.  Thanks for coming in for the program today.  Mr. LAWRENCE YUN (Senior Economist, National Association of Realtors): Good afternoon.  CONAN: Besides all of the for sale signs we can all see out there, what indicators tell you that the boom is finally over?  Mr. YUN: Well, the home sales activity peaked last August, and since that time sales have steadily trended downwards. But it's not only the sales but things like housing starts, mortgage purchase applications, the days on the market has been lengthening. So there are many indicator, basically saying that the boom is over, and now we are in a cooling trend.  CONAN: And, I guess the next question is, a lot of people thought, well this was a big bubble and when it bursts it's going to burst fast. Are we in for what they're calling a hard landing or a softer landing?  Mr. YUN: Well, all real estate is local. So some markets are seeing a rather sharp transition. For example, in Florida markets, where again it was very frenzied level of activity just last year, this year the inventory has doubled, tripled the level of last year. Buyers have suddenly disappeared. So there is a price - pressure on the prices to actually come down. But in other parts of the country, for example, say Austin, Texas or in Seattle, Washington, there is actually lack of inventory. Home prices are actually accelerating. So real estate is local, but overall, for the country as a whole, we are seeing maybe 70 percent of the country on a decline\u2026  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Mr. YUN: \u202630 percent on the rise.  CONAN: Is it fair assumption to say that the hotter your local market was maybe two, three years - even one year ago - the more likely it is to be plummeting now?  Mr. YUN: The overheated markets are the ones that are seeing the sudden transitions.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Now are all kinds of homes affected? Again this is all local, isn't it?  Mr. YUN: It's local. One area that is taking a more plunge than other market is in the condo market. The - lot of investor demand of last year, now the investors are suddenly leaving. And typically, investors are more interested in low-maintenance properties. So they typically buy condo properties. Now the investors seeing a less opportunity for price appreciation, are leaving very fast, which I think is very healthy. I mean, we are cleansing out this non, you know, long-term buyers. So I think that's good for the market over the long-term. But over the short-term, there is a little pain as they are suddenly leaving.  CONAN: And if people are wanting to actually sell their condominium for a real reason they could have a problem.  Mr. YUN: That's right. So people who are not in the need to sell, if they sort of wait it out, I think the market will turn for the better. But in the short-term, at least over the next year, I think the market will be difficult.  CONAN: Now, in terms of people who are selling for one reason or another, again, you were talking about there were record heights last year. People who are selling this year, for the most part are they getting less than they'd hoped or are they taking a loss?  Mr. YUN: For most people, I mean, they're still gaining gains. I mean, so compared to last year, you know, they are still getting four, five percent higher price now compared to this time last year. But again, locally speaking -for example, in the D. C. market or Florida markets, or the, some of the California markets - now they are actually getting lower price now than what it was last year.  CONAN: But that - if you've held on to your house for 10 years or five years, you're still going to have seen a lot of appreciation there?  Mr. YUN: A person who bought a home five years ago - a typical U. S. homebuyer who bought a home five years ago - would have accumulated $60,000 in housing equity gain. So over the long-term, there is a gain. Even if there was to be a short-term fall, you know, a person who bought five, six years ago - they would still have very substantial equity gains.  CONAN: Now, what does this do to the national economy? Housing has been an enormous part - not only the construction of new houses but also all the financing that goes on and the re-financing - as people saw very attractive interest rates.  Mr. YUN: Housing directly contributes about 15 percent of the national economic activity, 15 percent of GDP, directly. Indirectly, basically through the housing equity accumulation taking - people are taking out cash re-fis and go out and buying automobiles, television, and such - that has been a very big boost in holding up consumer spending. I mean, many economists have been puzzled as to why consumer spending has held on so well over the past - the recession cycle, sluggish job growth - and the reason is due to the strong housing market.  And now the housing market is cooling. I mean, that is certainly raising concern. And this is something, I think, particularly the Federal Reserve needs to carefully monitor, because if the - should the housing market, home prices suddenly flatten out, or even turn negative - that would imply consumer spending pull-back, and then may actually tip the economy into a recession.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. And so at that point, interest rates - well, interest rates are always of enormous, you know, excuse the expression, interest - but interest rates in this particular regard, they've been trending up the last year or so. And now that's going to have to be carefully looked at.  Mr. YUN: Certainly. You know, there was a pause in last Federal Reserve meeting. And my guess is that, you know, Federal Reserve need to monitor the housing market very carefully. You know, there are some signs where some markets are very fragile and any repercussion in the consumer spending area could have really a severe, negative economic consequences.  CONAN: Well, let's get some listeners questions on the air as well. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us. 800-989-TALK, e-mail us talk@npr. org. Don't forget to sell us, send us your most outrageous story of the sellers' market.  Here, joining us now on the line from Jewett City, in Connecticut, is Pricilla.  PRICILLA (Caller): Yes. Hello.  CONAN: Hi.  PRICILLA: My husband is in the building trades, and right now what seems to be happening in Connecticut is they're really focusing on affordable housing, because people tend to be leaving Connecticut because of the lack of affordable housing. I'm wondering if that trend is going to continue, or if they see that as something that is going to be bottoming out also. Because right now, we've got a lot of people coming into Connecticut but there's not a lot of affordable housing.  CONAN: Mm hmm. And just looking at the - quickly - at the statistics I have available - sales of homes in Connecticut was down three and one-half percent over the past year. So, Mr. Yun?  Mr. YUN: Certainly the affordability issue has become a major problem in the past five years due to the significant (unintelligible) of home prices. So if you are a homeowner you gain the housing equity. But if the person was a renter and trying to enter the market now, you know, it's very difficult with higher home prices and higher mortgage rates. So, many people have been moving into the rental market and the rents have been strengthening.  For some\u2026  CONAN: By strengthening, rents are getting higher, is what you're saying.  Mr. YUN: Rents are getting higher. And some builders are recognizing that there is a strong housing demand on the lower end side and, you know, expanding into the affordable housing, and I think that's a great trend. Certainly in a high-priced market, you know, we are hearing stories of public-service workers -policeman, fireman - who have to live further out, that cannot afford to live in their locality. So any development in the affordable housing area is the right trend.  CONAN: Mm hmm. And is that the kind of housing your husband builds, Priscilla?  PRISCILLA: Yes, but I'm wondering what would be considered the median for Connecticut. Is there a median that you can give me an idea about what would be the cost of a median price of a house?  I know, right now, my house was $100,000 ten years ago and it's up to 315.  Mr. YUN: You know, each local market, because of the variation in the land prices - I mean, the structure could be the same but due to the variation in the land prices - a different area would consider something affordable while the same home will be considered expensive in other parts. Connecticut is more a pricey market. I think any development of homes under $200,000 will be, I think, very good for many current renters who are looking into entering the homeownership market.  PRISCILLA: Okay.  CONAN: Good luck, Priscilla.  PRISCILLA: Thank you very, very much.  CONAN: Sure.  PRISCILLA: Yep. Bye-bye.  CONAN: Bye-bye. And let's go to Bill. Bill's calling us from Grand Junction, in Colorado.  BILL (Caller):  Hi there. I was debating between renting and buying and I live in Colorado. And I was wondering what your thoughts were on the real-estate market, in general, in Colorado.  CONAN: I'm just looking at this list and sales were down 2. 3 percent last year. But go ahead, Mr. Yun.  Mr. YUN: Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountain region - I'm actually optimistic about that region. What we are seeing is that many people who have lived in California suddenly realize it's very difficult to live there, or people who have been owners in California are saying: hey, why not move to, say, Colorado, cash out, use the equity to buy a much larger house at a smaller price, and use the remaining cash for just enjoyable lifestyle. So, we are seeing a migration trend of people moving from California into Utah, Colorado\u2026 And I am more optimistic in, say, Rocky Mountain state, compared to the more coastal market.  BILL: Thank you so very much.  CONAN: Good luck, Bill. And very broadly speaking, as an economist like yourself, look at the demographics of the country - the number of immigrants coming in, the number of households that are expected to be created over the next 10 or 20 years - he market for housing looks pretty sunny.  Mr. YUN: The immigrant demand has been very strong. You know, typically it takes several years for immigrants to sort of save for down payment. And the fact that we have had such a surge in immigrant population in the 1990s, and in the early part of this decade, they will pay strong dividend for the housing market going forward. And also, you know, U. S. is in the unique position where the population growth is very respectable, unlike European countries where there's population as stagnating or declining. So anytime a population is growing that just means that people need someplace to live, so we need to build more homes.  CONAN: Lawrence Yun, thanks very much for your time. We appreciate it. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors. He was with us here in Studio 3A. When we come back, more of your calls. How's the housing market going where you live?  I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The housing boom is over, at least that's what the numbers tell us. Sales are down in more cities than they're up. Prices have leveled off in many other areas. We're talking about what the latest figures mean if you're looking to buy or sell or just testing the market. And in a few minutes, how a housing slowdown might affect the rest of the economy.  Joining us now is Elizabeth Razzi. She's the author of The Fearless Home Buyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal, and the author of the forthcoming book, The Fearless Home Seller. She's with us here in Studio 3A. It sounds like you've anticipated this change.  Ms. ELIZABETH RAZZI (Author, The Fearless Home Buyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal): Very often we're doing both buying and selling the same transaction so it's the whole deal.  CONAN: Mm hmm. Yet, has the market changed in your experience?  Is it now a seller's market?  Ms. RAZZI: Oh, absolutely. I mean - and it was changing even as I was writing the books. The markets of the last couple of years - you know, the extreme sellers' markets - were really just incredible, and it's not supposed to work like that. You're really not supposed to be able to sell a house in 24 hours. We kind of got used to it and there's some people who really have known nothing else. But it should take several weeks to several months to sell a home. You should be able to negotiate. You should be able to have a little selection.  CONAN: Really?  This is a brand-new world for a lot of people\u2026  Ms. RAZZI: Exactly. It's back to normal.  CONAN: Back to normal. Well, it's going to be a little disappointing for people who wonder why they're getting no action on a house that's priced just the same as their neighbor got last year.  Ms. RAZZI: I think that's the key - it's priced just the same as their neighbor got last year - because the market has changed and now they have to compete with other sellers. That didn't use to be the case. You didn't really have any competition.  CONAN: Is there sort of a point of disbelief, where sellers say, wait a minute, this can't possibly be; I'm just going to hold the price here for a while and see what happens?  Ms. RAZZI: Well, yeah, and we have to also realize that we tend to view our own home the way we view our own children, which is a little bit above normal - above average. You know, our house is a place where we've lived and we've invested our own tastes in the place. And so, the idea that people wouldn't just want to go and snap it up immediately at this reasonable price is just a little bit offensive.  CONAN: There's also the idea that, frenzy or not, the way most people buy houses is not to see an instant profit in six months or even two years time - but they buy to live in for five to ten years.  Ms. RAZZI: Housing is the ultimate long-term investment. Real estate in general is a long-term investment and a lot of people forgot that. The whole idea of flipping real estate is just crazy.  And I know a lot of people are being burned because they did invest in options to buy condos and things like that and turn quite nice profits within a year, and that's not typical. You know, typically you should be in a home three years at least - to have enough appreciation to cover the costs of hiring a broker to sell it, for one thing - and then to pocket a little bit of money.  CONAN: And don't forget those moving costs. They're going to add up, too.  Ms. RAZZI: Absolutely.  CONAN: Let's get some listeners in on the conversation. This is Sandy(ph). Sandy is calling us from Saint Louis.  SANDY (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi.  SANDY: I put my house on craigslist-Saint Louis on August the fifth and I'm signing the contract on it tonight.  Ms. RAZZI: Good for you.  CONAN: Congratulations, Sandy.  SANDY: I am so happy, I'm levitating.  CONAN: And did you get the price that you had hoped to get?  SANDY: I got about $7,000. 00 more.  CONAN: Wow.  SANDY: I took bids on the house on Sunday the 20th and there were three valid bids, and this bid was considerably above the next highest bid.  CONAN: Hmm. So at least in Saint Louis, Missouri, Elizabeth Razzi, it looks like the old rules are still in effect.  SANDY: I can't guarantee that because there's an awful lot of houses for sale.  CONAN: Ah-ha.  SANDY: And they're sitting there.  CONAN: Why did yours move do you think?  SANDY: Oh, I think - I wrote about my house and I live in a four-family building that was built by an architect in the 20s, and I guess I romanced it. I put a headline on it that said: Small castle with income.  CONAN: (Soundbite of laughter). So\u2026  SANDY: A wonderful young prince has bought it.  CONAN: Salesmanship always matters, Elizabeth.  SANDY: Well, sell the sizzle, I guess, but it's still a wonderful house. It's well worth it.  Ms. RAZZI: Well, it always helps to have a desirable property and to have something that can be set apart from the big flock of homes that are competing with yours on the market. Yours had two things going for it, it had the architectural distinction and the income property. And they're two great things that you were able to promote in your advertising and that's a smart thing to do.  SANDY: Thank you. I'm so happy these people are going to have it.  CONAN: And have you found a new place to live, Sandy?  SANDY: Yes, I have. I'm moving into an area where a lot of people are restoring houses. It's called Benton Park. It's right near the Anheuser-Busch Brewery - not a commercial - and a lot of good people are moving there, and I'm going to, too.  CONAN: Sandy, good luck to you.  SANDY: Thank you so much.  CONAN: Bye-bye. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is Joseph(ph). Joseph calling us from New Orleans.  JOSEPH (Caller): Yeah, good afternoon.  CONAN: Afternoon.  JOSEPH: I'm just calling to try to - maybe you can give me some guidance. I don't know about what's going to happen with the market. We all kind of need to, you know - need to know if we should stay with our houses or sell our houses. My house was about 50 percent destroyed - completely gutted - and it's a shell of a house now, and I'm living in a FEMA trailer in the front yard and I'm trying to decide - should I sell or should I hold onto it until, like, next season. You know, it's a very confusing time for a lot of us down here.  CONAN: Elizabeth, any advice?  Ms. RAZZI: Well, unfortunately, you're in such an unusual situation. So much of your decision-making depends on what other people are going to do - whether they're going to rebuild the floodwalls and the levees to the levels that will protect your home or not, what's going to happen to the whole area around you. You really need to look at the overall city planning, and what FEMA and the corps. of engineers and everybody's going to do, to decide if that old property of yours is going to be as valuable to you as it was before the storm.  JOSEPH: Right. (Unintelligible)\u2026  Ms. RAZZI: Not an easy decision.  JOSEPH: Yeah. There's a lot of factors involved. Fortunately, I live in a neighborhood that is pretty much coming back. It wasn't completely destroyed. The first two blocks of our neighborhood were destroyed, and then the other ones - they were fine. So, I think in the future we have a good place to be.  CONAN: Well, it sounds as if you have a strong - at least a rationale - for your emotional attachment.  JOSEPH: Well yeah, that's true, too. You know, it's like - you have to want to be there, for sure.  CONAN: Yeah, absolutely.  JOSEPH: Yeah.  CONAN: Good luck.  JOSEPH: Thank you very much.  CONAN: So long. Buying or selling a house can often be an emotional transaction as well as a financial one. Those emotions can wield considerable power. Robert Shiller is an economics professor at Yale University and the author of Irrational Exuberance, second edition. He joins us now from a Yale University studio in New Haven, Connecticut. Nice to have you back on the program.  Mr. ROBERT SHILLER (Author, Irrational Exuberance): Hi.  CONAN: Do you feel justified in your predictions of some years ago?  The irrational exuberance finally over, do you think?  Mr. SHILLER: Well, in the stock market, but we're talking about the housing market.  CONAN: Yes, indeed, but you were writing about that as well.  Mr. SHILLER: That's what I added in the second edition, because I thought that we were going through a boom in the housing market that looked an awful lot like the boom that we saw in the 90s in the stock market - driven by human psychology. And your two speakers, so far, really haven't mentioned that. I'm concerned about this market because I think it's supported by feelings that the market will continue to go up. And once that stops happening there's going to be people who want to sell.  CONAN: Yet, thus far - and a lot of people talked about this - thus far people are predicting, by and large, a soft landing. Yes, prices are stable - or going down in some places - but they're not expecting a real drop in prices.  Mr. SHILLER: Well, it's possible they're right. I suppose we can hope that they're right. But we've seen big drops. This is the biggest real estate boom in U. S. history and I don't see how anyone can be confident. The futures market for a single-family homes - which just opened in Chicago - is now predicting declines of between four and five percent, for ten major U. S. cities, by May of this year.  Now, I don't know. Maybe not quite so soon, but there's a lot of people worrying about declines and those worries could have the effect of getting people to sell and producing those declines.  CONAN: Mm hmm. And the psychological effect - I guess it's the same as the boom except in reverse.  Mr. SHILLER: We can go down on a negative path. As prices start falling, more and more people hear about that, and they think - why am I holding two homes, you know?  Or why am I holding a home at all? I could live in an apartment. And it doesn't take a whole lot of those people to throw the market out of bounds and start producing more declines.  CONAN: So what statistics - what numbers - do you look at as indicators?  Mr. SHILLER: Well first of all, it's the futures market, because that is the market that is a forecasting market. And we've learned that such markets have predicting power. Beyond that, there's a lot of, you know, we've seen a lot of signs that a peak may be at hand. And Lawrence Yun mentioned some of those, without the same interpretation that I would give. I mean, he was generally not painting this as a dramatic scenario. But we've seen a sharp drop in how housing starts and in permits in the last few months. And these are leading indicators.  Housing permits is one of the ten leading indicators in the index of leading indicators because it has, in the past, had consequences. When people stop buying or building houses, that's something to start worrying about. But I don't know for sure, I would say. It could just resume going up. But at this point, it looks like this could be a major turning point.  CONAN: In the articles that I've read, people say, you know, a precipitous collapse of housing prices is often connected to losses in the job market at the same time housing is going down. That does not seem to be happening.  Mr. SHILLER: Well, but I don't think that this drop in home prices is likely right away. I mean, I'm thinking that a plausible scenario would be a recession in 2008 accompanied by serious drops in home prices. It's a plausible - you know, it has maybe a probability of less than a half, but it's the kind of thing that's happened many times in history.  And why do we have recessions? Well, these are difficult things to disentangle, but the real estate market is part of the process that brings on a recession. So it's not as if it has to be coming from somewhere else, it comes from the real estate market.  CONAN: Elizabeth Razzi, what do you people tell you when you talk to them?  Ms. RAZZI: Well, the thing is I think we need to constantly keep in mind that the housing market does operate differently than the stock market, the bond market, and commodities markets; in that people are not going to decide - oh housing prices are about to go down, I better sell my house, my homestead, and go move into an apartment somewhere just because of finances.  I don't think that kind of apocalypse is coming. And also people have lifestyle needs and decisions. You know, if two - if a young couple has a baby on the way and plans for a larger family, they're not thinking of a two-bedroom apartment, they're thinking about a home, a house somewhere. And if they're planning to be there five years, ten years, which is not unreasonable, that's a fairly safe decision to make.  Even regardless of what's happening with futures, commodities, and interest rates, that's a lifestyle decision and it's usually a pretty sound one.  CONAN: And, Robert Shiller, it's a fairly large segment of the housing market.  Mr. SHILLER: Well, you know, we've seen drops in prices before. And so something happened in the early 90s that brought - Los Angeles lost 40 percent of its real value between 1990 and 1997.  Ms. RAZZI: Right, but then it went on to gain that value back, plus more, for people who held on longer.  Mr. SHILLER: It did this time. Yeah, but you know, that doesn't mean it's going to happen next time. We saw some major\u2026 You know, there was a huge real estate boom in California in the 1880s and then it dropped. It didn't come back until the 1970s - there was a huge increase. So\u2026  Ms. RAZZI: Well, there was giant earthquakes that had something to do with that as well. But the thing is\u2026  Mr. SHILLER: No, not for another 20\u2026  Ms. RAZZI: Individuals still had to make a decision on where to buy.  CONAN: We're discussing the drop and stabilization of housing prices in many parts of the country. If you'd like to join the conversation, our number is 800-989-8255. Our e-mail address is talk@npr. org.  And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's get another caller on the line. And this is Bill. Bill's with us from San Jose.  BILL (Caller): Yeah, hi.  CONAN: Hi.  BILL (Caller): I'd like to hear your guests talk more about the economics that we're underpinning this huge run-up in prices and that I think now we're reversing and could cause the same thing to deflate this bubble. So, what I'm thinking are the main underpinning economic factors here, were the historic change in interest rates that the Federal Reserve made - lowering interest rates to historic lows in a very fast pace - and that created a huge lever on housing prices, allowing people to borrow more money for the salary.  And the other thing - and I live in Silicon Valley - what's been driving prices here, are these really exotic loan types - option-ARMS interest-only loans -that, again, have been a huge lever. And I understand - I know that the interest rates have gone up. Maybe they'll go up more, maybe they won't. But they've already gone up a lot vis-\u00e0-vis where they were before. And now I'm hear that the regulating authorities are going to be cramping down on these exotic loans because people are really misusing them.  I'd like to hear the guests talk more about this and what that could do. In my mind, it seems like prices could go back to where they were three or four years ago, which wouldn't be a 10 or 20 percent decline, it would be a 70 or 80 percent decline in prices. And that's really amazing.  CONAN: Robert Shiller, what do you think?  Mr. SHILLER: Well, Bill is absolutely right to bring up this issue, and it's something I've been bringing up. I've been trying to talk to the regulators. They haven't been moving fast on the - there's nothing wrong with ARMS or option ARMS for the right people. But he problem is that some people have been using them in a wishful thinking to buy a house that's bigger than they can afford.  It's the short rates that went down to one percent, when the Fed was really cutting rates, that made the ARM seem like such a way to buy a really big house for some people, especially less-educated people who bought them. It's a real problem.  CONAN: I should just say an ARM is an adjustable rate mortgage. And, Elizabeth Razzi, that's just one of the exotic financing options that were made available.  Ms. RAZZI: Well, an adjustable rate mortgage in itself is not all that exotic. They've been around quite a long time. One-year adjustable or a hybrid loan that's fixed for five, seven, ten years and then switches to a one-year adjustable is a fairly reasonable thing to do.  Unfortunately, over the last couple of years, a lot of mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers were pushing these payment option mortgages where you could not pay enough to pay off the loan every month, or you could skip payments, or you could make only interest payments.  And it was very much like buying your house on a credit card. And you would get into the same kind of debt trouble as buying a house on a credit card. I think they were absolutely irresponsible in making those loans. And I know some very well educated, savvy people, who did not understand the degree to which their payments could go up.  CONAN: And, Robert Shiller, do you think that all of this could snowball into the kind of price declines that Bill was talking about?  Mr. SHILLER: I think it's an important factor, although the most important factor is just the psychology. We don't, you know, even if there were no option ARMS, we could still have a bust just as we'd have in the past. It just depends on psychology.  CONAN: Don't busts, though, looking back at psychological - doesn't something sort of trigger them and they happen very suddenly.  Mr. SHILLER: Not in real estate. Well, even in the stock market, nobody really - the triggers are so hard to see. What caused the crash of '29? People still don't know. What happened in October of 1987? It seems to be, I think, psychology is the unseen factor. And unfortunate for economics, it's not easy to describe. But you sense that the psychology is changing now. I'm not sure about it, but I mean it confirms why I see markets predicting price declines coming up.  CONAN: And yet prices could be more or less stable, you're suggesting, even if - as the psychology does change for two or three years.  Mr. SHILLER: Yeah. I'm not at all sure what prices will do. What\u2026 Interesting case is Australia, cause it seemed to be leading. I thought Australia would be a case study for our own housing bust. But now, according to the latest news from Australia, it looks like their market is firming again. So, you know, you just can't predict.  CONAN: Bill, thanks very much for the call. And we'll be back after a short break. If you'd like to join our conversation on the meaning for the economy and for buyers and sellers of the stabilization, or drop in many places, of housing prices, give us a call, 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Plus 9/11 depicting in the pages of a new comic book.  It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington, and here are the headlines from some of the stories we're following here today at NPR News.  Iran's chief nuclear negotiator says Tehran is ready for what he calls serious talks over its nuclear program. It's unclear if the government is willing to suspend uranium enrichment, which is a key demand of Western governments. Iran could face U. N. sanctions if it does not suspend its nuclear program by the end of this month.  And in Baghdad, prosecutors heard gruesome witness testimony in the second trial of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Survivors of the chemical weapons attack in 1987 recalled a greenish smoke that sickened them. The testimony caused one of the court recorders to burst into tears. Saddam Hussein says the survivor's testimony was coached.  You can hear details one those stories of those stories and, of course, much more later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, it's been more than a week since the cease-fire took hold in Lebanon. We'll talk about the political fallout from the fighting and the peace, both in Lebanon and in Israel. Plus, with midterm elections nearing and plenty to talk about this week, an expanded visit with our political junkie. That's tomorrow TALK OF THE NATION.  In a few minutes, why you can now read the 9/11 Report as a graphic, well, non-fiction. Right now we're talking about the end of the housing boom. Our guests are Elizabeth Razzi, the author of The Fearless Homebuyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal, and Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale, and author of the book, Irrational Exuberance.  And let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And this is Sam. Sam's calling us from the Bay Area in California. Sam, are you there?  SAM (Caller): Yes I am.  CONAN: You're on the air. Go ahead please.  SAM: Yes. I'm a real estate broker in the Bay Area, and I want to say to Doctor Shiller, I wish I'd listen to you in 1999. I remember the same conversation vis-\u00e0-vis the stock market. And I was over-involved with three jobs and didn't pull out of the market. You were dead on.  I refer to the book, Devil Take the Hindmost, which tracks these kinds of trends. You probably are familiar with it. And there's something to be learned there. I think we are at the peak of the markets here in the Bay Area. We've seen four or five percent drops in prices on very good homes - that are very good homes, are in great shape - can't be anything other than the topping of the bubble. That's all I really have to say on this. And, again, Doctor Shiller, I appreciate your help.  CONAN: And, Sam, does Doctor Shiller's description - not his alone, but other people have called it too, a bubble, in other words, something that's unsupportable once the psychology changes it - you would describe the real estate market in San Francisco that way?  SAM: I think that's reasonable. But one other thing I want to address also, is the fact that the lending side has really gotten out of control. Same thing happened in the 80s, people were making crazy loans. Lenders will make loans if they can make the points, and that's what they're doing. I would say that the Fed has been irresponsible in keeping interest rates down for way too long, even though that's benefited me personally. I think that's a great reason for the sprint in housing prices.  And if you look at the past, that's what happened with the stock markets and other bubbles that have occurred in the last 200 years. It's classic. So, you know, just a simple observation.  CONAN: Robert Shiller, nice to hear some kind words.  Mr. SHILLER: Yeah. The Bay Area is one of the most glamorous areas in this country, and glamour areas are vulnerable to booms or bubbles. They're close to Silicon Valley, which has achieved huge home prices. Now Lawrence Yun was just saying that a lot of people are moving to the Colorado or neighboring states because it's so expensive out there in California.  And so I think that's part of the process. Even though these places are so highly-priced, we shouldn't trust those prices for the long run because people can move away and new construction can come in to find alternative places for people to live, and that will bring prices down.  CONAN: Elizabeth Razzi?  Ms. RAZZI: Well, that's why you can have a little more comfort in buying a home in a place that hasn't had that kind of huge run-up. I mean, the Bay Area is about the - the poster-child for the real-estate bubble. It just got so expensive that it wasn't worth what it takes to live there - you can get a good job somewhere else in the country - and that's sort of a self-limiting thing.  But there are lots of places in the country where you can move and find affordable housing and where you can take the risk and make a bet on investing your money in a home for several years. You know, it's riskier - the metro areas where, you know, people have been speculating on houses, and condos especially, the resort areas, they're the riskier ones - where people were taking out those really risky mortgage loans to stretch beyond their capability to get into homes. That's where the problem is.  CONAN: Sam, thanks for the call. Good luck.  SAM: Okay, thank you.  CONAN: Bye-bye. And let's see if we can get one last call in. Christina(ph). Christina's with us from Sacramento.  CHRISTINA (Caller): Yes, hello.  CONAN: Hi.  CHRISTINA: Thank you so much today. I'd like to say first of all that all the points that have been covered so far are valid from my experiences. I'm a realtor in Sacramento. And I would like to talk about the psychology of fear and what's going on in relation to my unique experiences with the Spanish-speaking immigrant community.  First of all, it's really important to remember, when I'm speaking here, that there's a huge percentage of Spanish-speaking immigrants that are a part of the U. S. consumer economy. And previously they were able - because it is not the law, it's a lender preference as what the qualifications are - it was easier for them to qualify for a loan showing their documentation, whatever they had.  But in California, what happened was, when the Driver's License Bill was repealed and did not allow the undocumented immigrants to re-apply for their driver's licenses or identification cards - what happens is literally hundreds if not thousands daily in California have their current driver's licenses expired. Okay? So the implications, the economic implications of that, not to mention the personal ones, are huge when it comes to people that have been employed as jobs as drivers, and their employers are also scared because they might have to document them, or they can't get insurance for their drivers because they don't have a driver's license.  So what happens is that the instability and the fear of this has stopped, not only the Spanish-speaking community from wanting to apply for a loan because they're afraid of what happens to their job status, but also the lenders have gotten a lot more careful about that. And at the time of closing, when you're signing your escrow documents, you have to have a current, valid form of identification. It doesn't matter what country you're from, it has to be valid.  CONAN: And these\u2026  CHRISTINA: A lot of these people have been here for like 10, 15, 20 years. They have their identification. They're not current in their former country because they've been here and been able to use this identification, and now it's not valid.  CONAN: Yeah, I think we get the point, Christina, and Robert Schiller, I'd like to ask you to respond to that. Obviously, these kinds of restrictions seem to be on the increase across the country.  Mr. SHILLER: Yes, see, the kind of thing - she brings up what lenders might do. If the market starts to turn, lenders might be less willing to even approve a loan with a high loan-to-value ratio. And so they'll expect - you know, lenders have been eroding their standards. It used to be that they wouldn't loan you for more than - a house - more than three years' income. But now typically, you know, they go up for four, five, or even eight years' income. And they're going to - they're not going to want to do this, not even regulators. If they see the market turning, they're going to get worried, too.  CONAN: What about those overall, though, sunnier demographic statistics that Lawrence Yun also talked about, the number of household formations and, indeed, the number of immigrants who will be here with documents and able to buy first houses?  Mr. SHILLER: In Irrational Exuberance, my book, I looked at demographic factors, at construction-cost factors, interest rates. I don't see that these things are really the dominate movers of the housing market, historically. They sound plausible, and they must play some role. If you look particularly at population growth, it has had none of the magnitude of the swings we've seen in house prices. It's partly because they\u2026 You know, what logically should be pushing home prices is construction costs, because the home industry can build new houses when demand goes up, and construction costs haven't been going up -you know, prices going up, relative to construction costs - which seems unstable right now.  CONAN: Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. Christina, thanks very much for the call. Good luck to you in Sacramento.  CHRISTINA: Thank you.  CONAN: And our thanks to Robert Shiller, who's the author most recently of Irrational Exuberance, Second Edition, and he joined us from Yale University Studio in New Haven. Thanks again.  Mr. SHILLER: Okay, my pleasure.  CONAN: And our thanks to also Elizabeth Razzi, author of The Fearless Home Buyer: Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal, and the forthcoming book, The Fearless Home Seller. It looks like you're going to have a lot of lack of fear to do that.  Ms. RAZZI: Absolutely.  CONAN: Elizabeth was here with us in Studio 3A.

I'm Robert Siegel. More evidence today that there are big changes underway in the nation's housing market. Figures released this morning by the National Association of Realtors show that the pace of existing home sales slowed in every part of the country last month. Overall, sales are down 11 percent from a year ago. As NPR's Jack Speer reports, that decline in sales has analysts concluding that some areas are in for major price declines in the months ahead. JACK SPEER: The late economist Herb Stein once said if something can't go on forever, it won't. Good words to remember as the nation's long-running housing boom begins to unwind. As recently as a year ago, sellers in a number of markets were still receiving multiple offers and getting more than their asking price. But based on the numbers out today, those days are over. David Lereah is chief economist with the real estate industry's main trade group. DAVID LEREAH: The drop in sales was rather dramatic. We're at the lowest level since 2004. Sellers are refusing to bring their prices down. Buyers are just not nibbling, so sales are dropping dramatically right now all across the nation. SPEER: That impasse between buyers and sellers is what led to a big increase in the number of homes on the market last month. Inventories of unsold homes climbed to a 7-month supply, meaning that it if homes continue selling at their current pace, it would take that long for demand to catch up. Lereah says as a result, some sellers may have little choice but to bite the bullet and take less for their house. LEREAH: I'm staring you, the seller, in the face right now, looking in the eyeballs. You've got to bring the price down. That's starting to happen. We're seeing it in the Northeast, we're seeing it in the West, and I suspect we'll start to see it all over the country. Once we do, buyers will come back in. SPEER: And the evidence that's beginning to happen is clear when you talk with real-estate agents around the country. Kristen Crabtree is an agent in San Luis Obispo, California. KRISTEN CRABTREE: Prices on upper-end homes are really dropping dramatically. To give you an example, there's a house in my neighborhood that was on the market originally at 1. 2. It went on over-priced, and it sat on the market for eight months. It just sold for 749 because they dropped the price $150,000 in one shot, and that sold the house. SPEER: For months, economists have debated whether the expected slow-down would conclude with a benign soft landing or a much more jarring touch-down, one that might throw the economy into recession. Nicolas Retsinas of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard reminds people there is no one national housing market, and says it was probably time for a slowdown. NICOLAS RETSINAS: The housing market couldn't possibly sustain double-digit appreciation. At some point it had to take a pause, it had to rest to let incomes catch up. And part of it in some markets - not in all markets - you had the entry of investors. And that can artificially stimulate the housing market, but also cause it to fall rather rapidly. SPEER: On Wall Street today, the news of a weaker housing market sent stocks lower. Shares of some big national homebuilders were especially hard hit. Tomorrow, the government releases figures for new-home sales, which most forecasters also expect to show a decline. Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.

New housing numbers are in today, and they are down. These numbers are on existing home sales. They come from the National Association of Realtors. MARKETPLACE'S Janet Babin is here. Janet, give us details. What do things look like? JANET BABIN reporting: Well, Alex, the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales fell in July to their lowest level in two and a half years, down 4. 5 percent. And the big deal here is that sales fell more than analysts expected, and analysts don't like that. Also big here, inventories. That's the number of homes on the market for sale. They increased dramatically, by more than 3 percent, and that's a 13-year high. So what it means is that they're saying it would take 7. 3 months to sell all the homes on the market right (unintelligible). And one more bit of telling news from the NAR: the median price of homes increased, but only slightly - 0. 9 percent, and that is the slowest year-on-year gain in housing prices since May of 1995. CHADWICK: So why this sort of accumulation of events, and why are the analysts off? Why did they get this wrong? BABIN: Well, that is the big question. I mean there is of course the Fed. The Federal Reserve has been steadily increasing rates over the past two and a half years except for the last time it met when it did hold rates steady. And of course the higher the interest rate, the more you're going to have to pay to buy your house, so that discouraged some buyers and prospectors. But I spoke with David Lereah about this, with the National Association of Realtors, and he is blaming another group for this housing slump. Mr. DAVID LEREAH (Senior Vice President, National Association of Realtors): Right now I would put the blame on the seller. The seller, remember, has had five years now of controlling the real estate marketplace in a boom environment. So they are used to calling all the shots, and now all of a sudden their world has been turned upside down. They're having trouble adjusting to that. BABIN: So Lereah is saying sellers aren't facing up to reality, and if they would, if they'd just lower their prices, they'd be able to sell their homes. Now I guess that makes sense, Alex, to some extent, but as someone who just sold their home in the Midwest, I can tell you that it really hurts to reduce the price of your home. I had to drastically cut mine $55,000 over ten months. And when I pressed Lereah on that issue about my experience, he did say that some markets are experiencing job losses and a downturn in the economy, and that is affecting housing. And he's actually more worried about those markets, typically in the Midwest region, than the other markets that he says are just correcting themselves after the boom, places like the West Coast and the Northeast. CHADWICK: How about other sectors of the economy? BABIN: Yeah, it is affecting other sectors. We saw drops today in the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq right after the numbers were announced. Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, we're going to visit a five-star hotel in Afghanistan. Apparently you can get a good deal on housing there. CHADWICK: Well, we'll look for that.

The needs or wants of your kids have gotten a lot more elaborate. They'll no longer be satisfied with some number two pencils and a couple of Trapper Keepers for the new school year. Steve Tripoli from MARKETPLACE joins us now. And Steve, what does it take these days to send a kid off to school? STEVE TRIPOLI reporting: Well Madeleine, I'll tell you this. After looking at school-supply lists from around the country this morning, it isn't just pencils and pens and rulers and glue sticks. In Colorado, some schools want Ziploc bags. In parts of Alabama, kids have to bring copier paper. Outside Baltimore, it's paper plates and a child-sized beach towel. In other places it's floppy disks and rubber boots and change of clothes and Spanish dictionaries. And just about everywhere, they want a box of tissues and the new must-have, which is hand sanitizer. BRAND: Hand sanitizer? TRIPOLI: Yeah. One newspaper story said this might be partly because the federal No Child Left Behind Law measures school attendance, so schools want fewer kids picking up germs and missing school. BRAND: Wow. So what is all this costing? TRIPOLI: A lot more than last year, for starters. The National Retail Federation says the average American family will spend $527. 08 on school supplies this year. That's a big jump from just under $444 a year ago. BRAND: So why the big jump in cost in just a year? TRIPOLI: Well, squeezed school budgets nationwide play a role. More kids are being asked to pay for more of their non-book needs, just like they've been asked to pay more for sports and music classes in recent years. But beyond all the tissues and hand sanitizer, the Retail Federation says there's another new cost driving this, and that's electronics. I felt that sting myself this week. My son's sophomore algebra class requires a specific calculator that costs $100. But Scott Krugman of the Retail Federation says back-to-school electronics spending goes beyond calculators and even computers. Mr. SCOTT KRUGMAN (National Retail Federation): Electronics has become the newest fashion accessory for kids, so they have to have cell phones, iPods, portable video game systems and PDAs - all of which are being bought under the back-to-school banner. They need the cell phones. They need the iPods. And because they need it so much, they're willing to spend their own money. BRAND: Steve, they need it? I mean really. Some of those cell phones, iPods -those aren't exactly back-to-school items, are they? TRIPOLI: Well, they're not. But I asked Scott Krugman that question, and he says they are. He says first of all - as he said in that tape clip - they're in part fashion accessories, and of course kids have always devoted some back-to-spending to fashion. But in part they're really seen as necessities for kids these days. Krugman says kids do use a lot of these items during the school day, whether it's while they're waiting for the bus or in the gym or wherever, so they really see them as part of school. And by the way, the total back-to-school price tag just for K through 12 this year is expected to run over $17 billion. And college students are going to spend twice that amount, but they have really expensive books to buy, and they buy a lot of furniture, too. So that's part of the explanation for that. Speaking of price tags, Madeleine, coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, we're going to visit Biloxi, Mississippi to see how that town is rebuilding a year after Hurricane Katrina.

Summer fading - warm weather, too. One constant through economic seasons the last few years has been strong and steady economic growth. But there's news today that some economists are worried about a financial chill in the air. Steve Tripoli from MARKETPLACE joins us. Steve, what is this latest news? STEVE TRIPOLI reporting: Well, Alex, in a nutshell it seems to be that the downside risks for the economy are increasing from a number of places. Don't take my word for it. Let's turn to the Federal Reserve Board's just-released minutes from their August 8 meeting. Here is the quote: the slowdown in the housing market, the effects of higher energy prices on household purchasing power and the waning impact of household wealth effects on spending are expecting to hold economic growth to below potential over the next six quarters. CHADWICK: Those are the notes from the meeting. How about a little translation? TRIPOLI: Well, these are clearer than they used to be in the Greenspan era, but the translation is we can't use no-longer rising home prices to prop up our spending anymore - we consumers. That's one thing. And along with other factors, the Fed is saying this means the economy is in for at least sub-par growth for the next six quarters, or through the end of next year. CHADWICK: Huh. Other figures out this morning. TRIPOLI: Right. Revised economic figures for the spring show that growth was slowing sharply from the winter quarter's growth. And there's other news, too. The Census Bureau says incomes actually rose slightly, but only because people are working more or making it off their investments. It's not because paychecks are getting bigger. And the newly released consumer confidence numbers for August are the lowest for the year as well, and that's no surprise, given what we're hearing about incomes and housing and energy prices and household debt. CHADWICK: And, you know, we're hearing this word recession these days, too. TRIPOLI: Yeah. You know, it's in the air, just like the autumn chill that's coming. And no one knows for sure, of course. But the risk is clearly seen as higher. And it's a tough one to call, because there are conflicting signs, plus there's one unknowable out there. And the conflicting signs are that corporate balance sheets are healthy, even while household budgets are strained. And also that folks with highly skilled jobs are doing great while workers without college degrees are suffering. CHADWICK: What is the unknowable? TRIPOLI: Well, that unknowable thing is psychology. You know, two of the nation's leading housing experts wrote today that psychology seems to have turned abruptly in that market. They say that means, quote, there's a significant risk of a very bad period. The lesson there is that economic psychology elsewhere can also change suddenly, and only later do we see the accumulation of little things that triggered it. So let's add to the forecast for a chill with a little forecast for wind, Alex. Later on MARKETPLACE, we'll find out why Portland, Oregon plans to start powering its city hall entirely with wind energy.

They show that the unemployment rate for August dropped from 4. 8 to 4. 7 percent, which means absolutely nothing, according to Gene Epstein. He's the economics editor at Barron's and a critic of how we media people report government statistics. Hi, Gene.  Mr. GENE EPSTEIN (Barron's Magazine): Hi. How are you doing? BRAND: Fine, thank you. So on the face of it, a . 1 percentage point decline in joblessness. Looks like good news. So what's wrong with that? Mr. EPSTEIN: Well, you really surprised me when you said that it means absolutely nothing. I thank you for acknowledging my little bit of wisdom in that regard. I should emphasize, though, that since we want to tell people out there that something is going on, indeed something is going on. We have an unemployment rate that's in the high four percent region. That's basically been fluctuating in terms of number but not in terms of reality - between 4. 6 percent and 4. 8 percent, and now 4. 7 percent - and those are basically the same numbers.  Those movements don't have enough statistical significance to have any meaning. The range of error on the unemployment rate is at least 2/10 of a percent. Therefore we don't know whether any change took place, and that's why the Bureau of Labor and Statistics will report - just as it did this morning - the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged. BRAND: I see.  Mr. EPSTEIN: However, essentially unchanged is pretty good. We're talking about an unemployment rate that a year ago was almost a full percentage point higher, and that's what's significant.  BRAND: Okay. So percentage-wise, what does it take to make the statistic significant? Mr. EPSTEIN: Its change on a month-to-month basis has got to be at least 2/10 of a percentage point. But the range of error on any number is much greater than what you would just attribute to pure probability. It's much greater because it's all these - a lot of survey error in this number. When you tell people that this number is based upon a survey of just 60,000 households nationwide, where those 60,000 households are supposedly speaking for a labor force of nearly 150 million people, and when you knock on the door, the person who answers often isn't the individual in that household who either has a job or looking for a job, then you start giving the average person the impression that we must have a clue about what's really going on with the unemployment rate. In fact, of course, these numbers are really just very out of focus, badly out of focus snapshots of what's going on.  BRAND: So Gene, are there statistics that are useful with employment and unemployment news? Mr. EPSTEIN: The last six snapshots shows that it's been averaging about 4. 7 percent. That's almost a percentage point lower than it was about a year ago. BRAND: But you're saying that the very methodology used to take these surveys is flawed, so how can you trust any of the numbers? Mr. EPSTEIN: Well, flawed is the point, but not fatally flawed. In other words, flawed to the point where any single one-month number is a very badly out of focused snapshot. That doesn't mean that with a little adroitness, with a little industry, we can't lay these out of focused snapshots end to end and find that we want to know were the subjects in the snapshot is smiling or frowning, or merely crying. Well, sometimes you can tell from out of focus snapshots.  But if we get carried away and if we start putting sizzle into every one-month figure, then we're going to just confuse people much more than we teach them about what's going on with the labor market.  BRAND: Gene Epstein is the author of the book, Econospinning: How to Read Between the Lines When the Media Manipulate the Numbers. Thank you, Gene Epstein, for joining us. Mr. EPSTEIN: Sure. Thank you. BRAND: Stay with us on DAY TO DAY from NPR News.   MADELEINE BRAND, host:   The government has released its monthly employment statistics. They show that the unemployment rate for August dropped from 4. 8 to 4. 7 percent, which means absolutely nothing, according to Gene Epstein. He's the economics editor at Barron's and a critic of how we media people report government statistics.  Hi, Gene.   Mr. GENE EPSTEIN (Barron's Magazine): Hi. How are you doing?  BRAND: Fine, thank you. So on the face of it, a . 1 percentage point decline in joblessness. Looks like good news. So what's wrong with that?  Mr. EPSTEIN: Well, you really surprised me when you said that it means absolutely nothing. I thank you for acknowledging my little bit of wisdom in that regard. I should emphasize, though, that since we want to tell people out there that something is going on, indeed something is going on. We have an unemployment rate that's in the high four percent region. That's basically been fluctuating in terms of number but not in terms of reality - between 4. 6 percent and 4. 8 percent, and now 4. 7 percent - and those are basically the same numbers.   Those movements don't have enough statistical significance to have any meaning. The range of error on the unemployment rate is at least 2/10 of a percent. Therefore we don't know whether any change took place, and that's why the Bureau of Labor and Statistics will report - just as it did this morning - the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged.  BRAND: I see.   Mr. EPSTEIN: However, essentially unchanged is pretty good.

I'm Scott Simon.  Coming up, a museum of sex in a city known for it, and we don't mean museums. But first, the federal government's most recent economic statistics paint a mixed picture of the U. S. economy. One hundred and twenty-eight thousand new payroll jobs were added last month and the nation's unemployment rate dipped slightly. Wages rose, but not as much as some economists had predicted. Peter Morici is a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Business and former chief economist at the U. S. International Trade Commission. He joins us in the studio. Thanks very much for being with us. Professor PETER MORICI (University of Maryland School of Business): It's a pleasure. SIMON: And what do you make about these latest numbers? Prof. MORICI: Well, this is the latest in a succession of sub-par numbers. The growth in jobs that we have indicates that the economy is slowing and it's going to be difficult to keep unemployment down. The unemployment rate fell because many people left the labor force. They quit. SIMON: And what about wages rising but not as much as some had predicted? Prof. MORICI: Well, wages hardly rose at all - 1/10th of 1 percent - with inflation outside of - at four percent a year. That's a rate of increase of about, you know, one, one and a half percent a year in wages. That's hardly enough to keep up. And that's pretty much been the story for ordinary people, and that's what that wage number measures. The people who do the hard work. Things have not been keeping up. SIMON: What are both the weakest and strongest sectors of the economy? Prof. MORICI: The weakest sector by far is manufacturing. It continues to be clobbered by the trade deficit and imports. Over the last five years they have lost three million jobs. That's an incredible story. Normally at this point in the recovery we would expect to have them get about two million back. Where are Americans going to work? Things that they don't trade abroad. Things like the hospitality industry and landscaping and things of that nature. That's retail sales, that's what's strong. And of course, the hospital sector, our healthcare sector, simply because we spend so much money on it. SIMON: What about he generalization that the wages of skilled workers and that section of the economy is growing and unskilled workers and that section of the economy is not? Prof. MORICI: For the top 25 percent, things have never been better. They're getting wealthier by the day. It's caviar for the best and cake for the rest. For the lower half, things are very tough. Wages don't keep up with inflation. If they lose their job they have trouble replacing it with a job that has comparable wages and benefits. More and more people are going without healthcare. SIMON: Let me ask you about that, 'cause that's an all-time high now, reportedly: 46. 6 million. What impact does having almost 50 million Americans without health insurance have on the economy overall? Prof. MORICI: Well, it has a terrible impact because it creates a lot of inefficiency. People come to emergency rooms when they should be seeing doctors on a regular basis. The high cost of healthcare keeps us from creating jobs. In sectors where benefits are the norm, some businesses simply can't afford them, so they don't create employment. SIMON: Do you see anything in these figures that speak to what we're told is the slowdown in the housing market and, as we all know, I think, the rising price of energy? Prof. MORICI: We haven't really seen the impact of the housing market in the employment numbers yet. We know that fewer homes are being started but still many are being completed. So the construction sector held up pretty well. What we expect to see going forward is a shift in employment from housing to commercial construction, as that sector's picking up a little bit. SIMON: Do you see, what would you venture to see by way of political implications in these numbers? Prof. MORICI: Oh, these numbers bode poorly for the Republicans. A lot of the jobs lost in manufacturing fall in communities along the ridge line between red America and blue America. And a lot of the job losses are in districts that could go one way or the other. These numbers will contribute more to a Democratic victory than anything else out there in the economy, if that does happen.

S. workforce. Steve Tripoli joins us from MARKETPLACE. Steve, what is the state of working America this Labor Day, and let me congratulate you for being in at the office on this day. STEVE TRIPOLI reporting: And you, too, Alex. For openers, lots of people are working, I guess including us today. Sixty-two percent of America's working-age population is employed, which is very high both historically and compared to other wealthy countries. But I really want to go beyond who's doing what today. I called Andy Sum at Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies, and I asked Andy to choose the single most surprising labor statistic he knows. And Andy wonders why American workers have managed very solid productivity gains for five years now, yet they're seeing literally none of their increased output coming back in their paychecks. Mr. ANDY SUM (Center for Labor Market Studies, Northeastern University): And that result is puzzling, because we've always argued that productivity is a key to wage growth. Our productivity performance record was outstanding, and our real wage growth record was extremely poor. Basically we have a labor-market environment in which workers really don't have much bargaining power, and that's true even at the top of the labor market, as well as among, you know, less-skilled workers at the bottom. CHADWICK: Steve, we've heard a lot about stagnating paychecks and wage disparities these days. What's the story there? TRIPOLI: Well, the story is that fully 90 percent of workers have seen their pay trail inflation for the past three years. People are also paying more for benefits or getting fewer of them, especially health insurance and pensions, and one recent survey shows workers are really worried about being able to afford not only health insurance and retirement but other essentials like education and energy. So there are a lot of anxious workers out there, Alex, and that shows up in one other statistic, the very large number of people working long hours, even though most of them claim they don't want to. CHADWICK: Well they say they don't want to, but maybe they really do. Maybe Americans just like to work. TRIPOLI: Well, you know, for some people that's probably true. There are good and bad forces driving how much we work. We're healthier later in life, so we can work more. There are a lot of well-educated folks who have jobs they want to hold onto. But also by historical standards, household debt burdens are very high, so we're working because we can and because we like it, but we're also working to pay off our many creditors, and it has to be said that the least-educated workers in their households are being hammered. They have declining wages and very heavy debts burdens that are often triggered by all their lost buying power. CHADWICK: What do economists see coming? What's the forecast? TRIPOLI: Well, the news there is good. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says America's supply of jobs will keep growing in the coming decades, though slowly, and baby boomers leaving the labor force will free up even more work. And you know, there's one final thing, Alex. Most Americans this Labor Day say they're significantly better off than their parents were. Workers are struggling for things that used to come more easily, and they're facing uncertain times at work, but by any standard this is still a rich country. And later today, Alex, on MARKETPLACE we're going to have a little fun for those firing up the grill for one last summer barbecue. We'll take you behind the wheel of a Weinermobile.

Three oil companies led by Chevron say they have successfully tested a well that is 28,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico. That's about as deep as Mount Everest is tall. Chevron and its partners, including Devon, say the initial test of the oil produced more than 6,000 barrels of oil a day; that is really good. There's hope that this discovery and others in the region and around this field could boost the nation's oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico by 50 percent. Earlier, I spoke with Barbara Shook in Houston. She's an analyst with the Energy Intelligence Group, and she explained the lengths that a company really does have to go to to drill at 28,000 feet. Ms. BARBARA SHOOK (Analyst, Energy Intelligence Group): This is the culmination of probably a decade of work since companies first had access to technology that would allow them to see through these sheets of salt that are thousands of feet thick that lie in various layers and protrusions known as domes. The seismic technology takes readings of underground formations. They send sound waves off and it'll show you structures that could be oil and gas deposits. CHADWICK: And essentially we have better computer models now so we're able to isolate things better. Ms. SHOOK: We have better computer models. We have bigger computers and faster computers. And now it's almost virtual exploration, you hope, but of course it's never approved until you've actually drilled a well. CHADWICK: So you're actually sinking the pipe down there 28,000 feet and actually plugging into the sea floor and getting - this is a very key step in the process. Ms. SHOOK: It is a very key step in the process, yes. A decade ago, the technology did not exist to drill in waters that depth and then that much further below the seabed. CHADWICK: Is this really a pipe, like a metal pipe, that goes down five miles? Ms. SHOOK: It sure is. It's an ultra-high strength, very, very long straw basically made out of steel with special metallurgy to withstand pressures and the corrosive nature of the seawater, that has to withstand currents. This is a high-tech project. This is not just taking some old pipe that they picked up at a used materials lot and putting it together. CHADWICK: Well, I understand this is a long-term project. It'll be years before any of this oil might actually come on line. But still, doesn't this suggest that there must be a heck of a lot of oil in the Gulf of Mexico and there is more oil to be found? Ms. SHOOK: More oil is out there. The question is how long will prices stay at a level that will support drilling these kinds of projects. That's another reason you're seeing them being drilled right now. Prices are high enough to support the initial economics. Once you get the well on production, prices could drop even $25, $30-a-barrel, and projects still would be economic to operate. It just might not be economic to drill another one like it. So companies are taking advantage of high prices. It will help mitigate the decline in U. S. oil production. But until additional areas are opened up, we're not ever going to be able to really turn around production in the U. S. And even if we did turn it around, it still wouldn't offset more than a small percentage of what we import. CHADWICK: Barbara Shook with the Energy Intelligence Group in Houston. Barbara, thank you.

State Senator DEAN MARTIN (Republican, Arizona): It's the largest tax cut in Arizona history. GUTEL: That's State Senator Dean Martin, a Republican from north Phoenix. To him the decision was simple: the extra money didn't belong to the government in the first place. State Sen. MARTIN: The taxpayers overpaid and it's very important that we give them back what they paid. You don't go to a restaurant and not get your change back. GUTEL: Arizona is one of 20 states that use their surpluses this year to reduce income taxes. In Oklahoma, lawmakers voted to increase the state's income tax deductions over the next four years. And many other states, including Kansas, Indiana, and Maryland, took a whack at property taxes. But here in Arizona, some see the tax cuts as a lost opportunity. Democratic Senator Richard Miranda of West Phoenix says the surplus could have helped the Arizona schools or provided better healthcare, plus he doesn't think an income tax cut is fair. State Senator RICHARD MIRANDA (Democrat, Arizona): Someone who earns over $1 million is going to get $12,000 back, whereas, working families who earn between 20 and $50,000 are only going to get anywhere from $25 to $75. GUTEL: Cities didn't like the income tax cut either. Because of a system of revenue sharing, the reductions could eventually cost Phoenix about $10 million. Karen Peters represented the city at the legislature this spring. Ms. KAREN PETERS (City of Phoenix): Well, $10 million represents about 120 police officers.

The state of Georgia used the up tick in the economy to replenish its rainy day fund. Tommy Hills is the governor's chief financial officer. Mr. TOMMY HILLS (Chief Financial Officer, Georgia): I would describe it almost as a savings account, like individual consumers need to put away some money for special expenses that come up, or if they have some financial emergency, like if they lose their job. CAPELOUTO: This year, Georgia added over $400 million to its so-called Revenue Shortfall Reserve Fund. Other states did even better; Connecticut socked away almost $440 million, and Maryland over $590 million. These reserve funds come in handy in times of unexpected economic downturns. In Georgia, that was the case in 2002 and 2003. For the first time, since the Great Depression, the state's income was less than what projected, says Hills. Mr. HILLS: Collectively, in those two years, we spent some $750 million more than what we took in in revenue. And if we had not had the reserve fund, we would have, you know, either not been able to pay our bills or have to lay off staff, in order to have the money to pay bills. CAPELOUTO: Fortunately, the fund at been fattened during the roaring '90s and had almost $800 million available. But these funds don't grow because politicians see a need to save for the future. It only works, because in many states, it's the law. In Georgia, a minimum of four percent of the yearly budget must be put aside, if there is a surplus. University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock says, otherwise there wouldn't be a reserve fund. Professor CHARLES BULLOCK (Political Science, University of Georgia): Our elected officials are profligates - spend today what you have, let tomorrow take care of itself.

I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, host: And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. After years of hard times, state coffers are showing a surplus. The National Council of State Legislatures says states, combined, have 25 percent more money in their coffers than they did a year ago. State lawmakers have been struggling with budgets since the '90s boom busted and the September 11th terrorist attacks created an economic turndown hurting tax revenues. INSKEEP: Many states did not count on projected revenue increases as the economy started improving. Now let's not say they don't know what to do with the money, they'll figure out something. Some states are making up for earlier cuts, others are tucking money away for a rainy day. And we have three reports on how states are responding. First, NPR's Larry Abramson on the fastest-growing area of state spending: education. LARRY ABRAMSON: Taxpayers may oppose increased spending for many state programs, but these days they are eager to spend more on schools. Corrina Eckel(ph) of the National Conference of State Legislatures says spending for a number of K-12 programs will climb by nearly eight percent in fiscal year 2007. Ms. CORRINA ECKEL (National Conference of State Legislatures): Everything from increasing the funding in the school formula to increasing teacher salaries to new schoolbooks and technology in the classroom. ABRAMSON: For years, Medicaid spending was the fastest-growing area of state spending, but now education has taken the lead. And Corrina Eckel says colleges and universities are getting an unusually big boost. Ms. ECKEL: Higher education tends to fare worse when times are bad because lawmakers see that tuition and fees can help make up for budget cuts. And then when times improve, states typically give higher-than-average increases for higher education just to help make up for those prior cuts. ABRAMSON: Alabama's surplus has allowed that state to make up some lost ground. Elementary and secondary students will now attend class five days longer, bringing the state up to the national average. And teachers got their second raise in a row, this time a jump up five percent. Sandra Sims-deGraffenried, Executive Director of the Alabama Association of School Boards, says that's dramatic for a state that ranks near the bottom for per-pupil spending. Ms. SANDRA SIMS-DEGRAFFENRIED: We've come off some really lean years where things have been tough in our state and all of a sudden we now see a budget that has passed that is $6. 02 billion. It's the largest budget for education that this state has ever seen. ABRAMSON: Sims-deGraffenried says recent increases will allow Alabama to chip in $67 per student to pay for textbooks. That's nice, but parents will still have to make up the difference. States that depend on energy revenues are seeing some of the biggest increases for education. Wyoming has no income tax, but revenue from coal and other energy taxes have allowed the state to set aside $400 million for a scholarship fund for the state's community colleges and its university. Jim McBride is Wyoming's Superintendent of Education. Mr. JIM MCBRIDE (Superintendent of Education, Wyoming): And that is enough money to give a large percentage of our students access to those programs at a very, very reasonable rate. ABRAMSON: Revenue increases are not the only factor that will determine whether schools have more to grow on. California has agreed to reduce class sizes in schools where student performance is worst, but that was in response to a lawsuit by state teachers. Some critics of school spending say budget increases often do not lead to better instruction. Tim Mooney is with a group called First Class Education, which is pushing state legislatures to mandate that 65 spending of school spending goes to the classroom, not to the educational bureaucracy. Mr. TIM MOONEY (First Class Education): Nearly every teacher in America in the last two weeks visited a Wal-Mart or an Office Max or Staples and bought basic classroom supplies for their classroom. Why is that, when we're growing at 7. 9 percent increase? ABRAMSON: Still, with teachers getting a sizeable chunk of the increased spending, no one is complaining about extra dollars for schools. But they are wondering, as they always must, whether they will gain or lose ground next year. Larry Abramson, NPR News, Washington.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

S. companies have been shipping software and semiconductor jobs overseas for years. But the total number of jobs in these high skill industries has continued to rise.

I'm Michele Norris. Ford is speeding up dramatic downsizing of its North American operations. The automaker announced big cuts in its blue collar workforce earlier this year. Today it said it would offer buyouts to all of its production workers. It also said it wants to eliminate a third of its white collar workers and cut its annual operating costs by $5 billion. Coming up we'll hear reaction from employees and we'll find out what car buyers are looking for these days. We begin our coverage with Detroit Public Radio's Quinn Klinefelter. QUINN KLINEFELTER: Only a few years ago, Ford was generating big profits off the strength of its popular pickup trucks and SUVs. But times changed. The price of oil soared after Hurricane Katrina and again this summer following renewed conflict in the Middle East. Customers searched for more fuel efficient vehicles while Ford trucks and SUVs gathered dust in dealer's showrooms. Today Ford's president of American operations, Mark Fields, stared into a closed circuit TV camera and admitted what industry analysts have been saying for months. MARK FIELDS: The reality is that our business today is structured around a model that worked well for us a decade ago but is no longer viable today. KLINEFELTER: Ford recognized earlier this year that it was making too many vehicles customers didn't want. The company said it would cut 30,000 hourly jobs and close more than a dozen plants by 2012 under a turnaround plan it dubbed The Way Forward. Over the past decade Ford's share of the U. S. market has declined from 25 percent to just over 17 percent. Ford's Mark Fields says the company eventually expects to control only a modest 14 or 15 percent of the market. FIELDS: We expect these market share declines as well as continued high raw material costs to delay the return of full year profitability for our North American auto operations until 2009. KLINEFELTER: So Ford is suspending stock dividends until it starts making profits again. It is also accelerating its Way Forward turnaround plan. The company offered buyouts to all of its 75,000 hourly workers and says it will eliminate about 14,000 salaried positions. That's about one third of its white collar workers. It also plans to close or sell all of its parts plants. And Ford wants the cuts completed by 2008, four years earlier than originally planned. Automotive analyst Jim Hall says the company has little choice. JIM HALL: The original timing of The Way Forward plan, I believe, was the product of some very optimistic thinking. The bottom line is the spike in fuel prices brought everything to a head way faster than anybody in the industry could have predicted. KLINEFELTER: He address that mounting losses may have forced Ford to take immediate action. Recent published reports cite internal company memos forecasting that Ford will lose as much as $6 billion this year, not including the cost of the employee buyouts. In fact, the company's Mark Fields says Ford has a long list of as yet unspecified plants it might be forced to close over the next few years. FIELDS: We know these decisions bring even more pain to the business in the short term and they will require sacrifice from our employees, labor unions, dealers and suppliers. We also know that our work is far from over. But together we are building a much stronger Ford Motor Company and a more secure future. KLINEFELTER: The grim news out of Ford's headquarters sent the company's stock down sharply today. But if the restructuring plan works, Ford could make its way back. General Motors began similar cuts in its workforce earlier this year and analysts predicted it could take years for the company to again turn a profit. Yet GM did manage to show an operating profit in its most recent quarter once the costs of its restructuring were factored out. For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter in Detroit. MICHELE NORRIS, Host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris. Ford is speeding up dramatic downsizing of its North American operations. The automaker announced big cuts in its blue collar workforce earlier this year. Today it said it would offer buyouts to all of its production workers. It also said it wants to eliminate a third of its white collar workers and cut its annual operating costs by $5 billion. Coming up we'll hear reaction from employees and we'll find out what car buyers are looking for these days. We begin our coverage with Detroit Public Radio's Quinn Klinefelter. QUINN KLINEFELTER: Only a few years ago, Ford was generating big profits off the strength of its popular pickup trucks and SUVs. But times changed. The price of oil soared after Hurricane Katrina and again this summer following renewed conflict in the Middle East. Customers searched for more fuel efficient vehicles while Ford trucks and SUVs gathered dust in dealer's showrooms. Today Ford's president of American operations, Mark Fields, stared into a closed circuit TV camera and admitted what industry analysts have been saying for months. MARK FIELDS: The reality is that our business today is structured around a model that worked well for us a decade ago but is no longer viable today. KLINEFELTER: Ford recognized earlier this year that it was making too many vehicles customers didn't want. The company said it would cut 30,000 hourly jobs and close more than a dozen plants by 2012 under a turnaround plan it dubbed The Way Forward. Over the past decade Ford's share of the U. S. market has declined from 25 percent to just over 17 percent. Ford's Mark Fields says the company eventually expects to control only a modest 14 or 15 percent of the market. FIELDS: We expect these market share declines as well as continued high raw material costs to delay the return of full year profitability for our North American auto operations until 2009. KLINEFELTER: So Ford is suspending stock dividends until it starts making profits again. It is also accelerating its Way Forward turnaround plan.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. LYNN NEARY, host: And I'm Lynn Neary. What goes up must come down, and gasoline prices are coming down fast. The average price of a gallon of gasoline fell by $0. 42 over the last five weeks. In some parts of the country gas is selling for under $2. 00. Experts say the money consumers save at the gas pump should help prop up other parts of the economy. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY: California typically has some of the most expensive gasoline in the country. But even here the average price broke below $3. 00 a gallon this past week. Consumer advocate Michael Shames, who runs a gasoline shopping Web site, says pulling up to the gas pump no longer packs the dread that it did a couple of months ago. Mr. MICHAEL SHAMES (Executive Director, Utility Consumers' Action Network): Filling up used to be painful, like going to a dentist. Now it's like going to a dentist, but at least the dentist is giving you Novocain. HORSLEY: If that's true here on the West coast, drivers must feel like they're on laughing gas in the middle of the country where some stations are now selling gas for as little as $1. 99. Ms. CARLA DICKERSON(ph) (Attendant, Jackson Bait & Tackle): Well, everybody's happy. Five fifty-nine. HORSLEY: Carla Dickerson was working the gas register at Jackson Bait & Tackle in Jackson, Missouri this past week. She says customers are buying plenty of other items with the extra change they get from filling up. Ms. DICKERSON: Beers, soda, candy, chips, snacks and food. HORSLEY: Chief economist Nariman Behravesh of Global Insight says the falling price of gasoline should give a boost to other types of consumer spending. Mr. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH (Chief Economist, Global Insight): I think we'll see people taking some of those savings, if you will, or what they don't need to spend on gasoline, on discretionary items like eating out and, you know, going to a game, going to a concert. That kind of stuff. HORSLEY: The impact is limited. Rising gasoline prices didn't cause wholesale changes in consumer behavior, and falling prices won't either. But JP Morgan economist Robert Mellman says cheaper gas should help to offset some of the drag on the economy from falling home sales. Mr. ROBERT MELLMAN (Economist, JP Morgan): This is an important influence that will help the economy sail through to the end of the year. HORSLEY: Mellman expects gasoline prices to keep falling by another $0. 25 a gallon or so. Some savvy customers are only buying half a tank at a time, knowing gas could be cheaper by this time next week. If the price continues to fall, that could discourage some newfound interest in fuel economy. It could also accelerate our growing demand for gas.

Carey Harver(ph) is here on his lunch hour with some colleagues from a local software company. Harver wears a T-shirt that says: Do Not Taunt the Web master. Mr. CAREY HARVER (San Diego): You get to go fast and there's no consequences. HORSLEY: Well, there are some consequences. As small as these cars are, general manager Jared Booher says they burn through a good bit of gasoline over the course of a day. Mr. JARED BOOHER (General Manager, Miramar Speed Circuit): When the gas prices come down we see it more than even the next guy, because you can imagine how much gas we buy throughout the course of a month. HORSLEY: The go-carts twist and turn, but ultimately wind up back where they started. Consumer advocate Shames is wondering if gasoline prices will do the same. Mr. SHAMES: I think everybody is sort of holding their breath, waiting to see is this a real drop that's going to be sustained, or is this a little blip, and then suddenly prices are going to shoot back up next year? Customers aren't sure where the markets are going, and they shouldn't feel so bad because people who make their living trading the oil markets don't know where the market is going. HORSLEY: Phil Flynn is one of those professional traders. He says the psychology behind oil and gasoline prices can turn just as sharply as go-carts. Mr. PHIL FLYNN (Energy and General Market Analyst, Alaron Trading): If you look to three weeks ago, we were worried about war in the Middle East. You know, we were worried about Iran. We were worried about hurricanes. You know, the market took off. Now a lot of those fears that we've had last week have gone away. HORSLEY: Indeed, the Energy Department said this past week the global situation for oil markets is \"about as rosy has it's been for months. \" Nevertheless, the department expects oil and gasoline prices to level off and possibly increase later in the year.

(Soundbite of music) Federal Reserve officials meet tomorrow and are expected to hold interest rates steady again. It'll be for the second meeting in a row that they'll do that -if they do it. To talk about why, and what the Fed is likely to do later in the year, we turn to David Wessel, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Washington Bureau Chief; Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: Considering that there's going to be no news here, it's pretty closely followed no news. Mr. WESSEL: Absolutely. This time around, the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at 5. 25 percent. But there's a little bit of focus on what they're going to say at the end of the meeting - words that have become very important. With the economy relatively strong, inflation a little higher than the Fed would like, but lots of signs of trouble on the horizon, people are spending a lot of time speculating about what is the Fed going to do later this year, since there's not much suspense about what they're going to do this week. INSKEEP: I assume since interest rates affect the markets, that people are in effect betting money on whether interest rates will go up, stay steady, or do something else. Mr. WESSEL: There's a huge market in betting on the Fed. It's one of the forms of betting that's legal, even over the Internet. At the moment, the market's only a 12 percent chance, if you look at the Fed futures market you can figure that out, a 12 percent chance that the Fed will move at all before year-end. But there's lot of disagreement about where the Fed is going next. There's one camp that says the Fed is bound to cut interest rates next year, because the economy is slowing. Goldman Sachs, for instance, thinks the economy will slow so much because of housing and everything that the Fed will cut rates by 1. 25 percentage points. But another camp of economists think that falling gasoline prices is going to give the economy a little bit of a boost now, and that'll make the Fed worried about inflation and that they're not likely to cut. So there's real disagreement. INSKEEP: You know, I realize that any investment is kind of a bet on interest rates, but can you actually just bet on interest rates? Mr. WESSEL: Oh, yes, you can bet on interest rates. There's two ways to bet on interest rates. One is, there is a futures market where people bet on what the federal funds interest rate, the key interest rate, is going to be three, six, nine months out. That's one way. And secondly, anybody who buys a long-term bond, a ten-year bond, is effectively betting on what the Fed is going to do between now and then. So, much money is spent on Wall Street. Much is made and much is lost by people trying to discern what the Fed is going to do next. Which is why, every time someone from the Fed speaks, there's so much attention in the financial press and in the markets. INSKEEP: Okay, what are some Fed officials saying? Mr. WESSEL: Well, the Fed officials seem to be taking a different emphasis then the people on Wall Street. Wall Street seems very worried about the slowing economy and thinks the Fed is going to have to cut rates or at least sit tight for a while. But Fed officials are, in their speeches, are emphasizing that they're still a little worried about the inflation risk. They're a little more optimistic that the economy is going to do okay. And they're talking about how inflation is a little higher than they're comfort zone. So there's a disconnect between what the markets seem to be thinking about what the Fed should be doing, and what Fed officials are saying about the same subject. INSKEEP: Do you think that Fed officials themselves even know what they're going to do six months from now? Mr. WESSEL: No. And that's one of the interesting points. There are times when the Fed does have a very clear path towards a future. This is not one of them. And what the new Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, is trying to say to the markets is, it depends. And he says if you listen to me carefully, you will know on what it depends, and then you can look at the economy and you can come up with a good sense of what we're going to do. But it's a learning process, and the markets aren't willing to wait for the data to figure out what it depends on. INSKEEP: David Wessel, of the Wall Street Journal, good to talk with you. Mr. WESSEL: Thank you.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  The business news starts with the interest in the Fed's next move.

I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: Cheaper energy is a windfall for most consumers, but not everyone is celebrating. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY: Unidentified Woman (Hostess): Two? Okay. HORSLEY: The nation's biggest casual restaurant chain says it lost five to six percent of its customers in June and July, when gasoline prices were at their peak. Now that pump prices are coming down again, restaurant consultant Malcolm Knapp thinks those middle-income customers will be coming back. MALCOLM KNAPP: It's the median incomes, say $43,000 to $60,000 range, that - a lot of them have SUVs, and that's wroth $80 to $100 a month with the drop that we've just experienced. So you can actually go out and buy something with that. HORSLEY: By contrast, Knapp says customers at high-end restaurants barely blinked when gasoline prices soared. And even though gas prices have moderated, people at the lower end of the income scale are still wary of going out to eat. KNAPP: They're very nervous about is this a short-term phenomenon? Is this a longer-term phenomenon? They're not sure. HORSLEY: Jack Gerard heads the American Chemistry Council, whose members are heavily dependent on oil and natural gas. JACK GERARD: Beyond just using it for heat and power, we use it to make products. So we take natural gas or oil and we turn it into things like plastics that we use everyday, the medicines in the pharmaceutical industry, fabrics in our clothing. So we're very energy sensitive. HORSLEY: Airlines are also flying a little higher now, says aviation economist David Swearinga, thanks to the falling cost of jet fuel. DAVID SWEARINGA: The airlines consume 19 billion gallons of jet fuel every year, and every penny change in the price is a $190 million reduction in their costs. HORSLEY: San Diego County's pension fund lost much of the $175 million it invested in Amaranth. That drew a scolding from taxpayer advocate Lani Lutar when the retirement board met last week. LANI LUTAR: Private investors can play all they want with hedge funds, but public money should not be used for gambling. HORSLEY: Scott Horsley, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, Host:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, Host:  Cheaper energy is a windfall for most consumers, but not everyone is celebrating. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY: Unidentified Woman (Hostess): Two? Okay. HORSLEY: The nation's biggest casual restaurant chain says it lost five to six percent of its customers in June and July, when gasoline prices were at their peak. Now that pump prices are coming down again, restaurant consultant Malcolm Knapp thinks those middle-income customers will be coming back. MALCOLM KNAPP: It's the median incomes, say $43,000 to $60,000 range, that - a lot of them have SUVs, and that's wroth $80 to $100 a month with the drop that we've just experienced. So you can actually go out and buy something with that. HORSLEY: By contrast, Knapp says customers at high-end restaurants barely blinked when gasoline prices soared. And even though gas prices have moderated, people at the lower end of the income scale are still wary of going out to eat. KNAPP: They're very nervous about is this a short-term phenomenon? Is this a longer-term phenomenon? They're not sure. HORSLEY: Jack Gerard heads the American Chemistry Council, whose members are heavily dependent on oil and natural gas. JACK GERARD: Beyond just using it for heat and power, we use it to make products.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. A surprise from the housing market today. The number of new homes sold in the U. S. was up in August over the previous month - that's after three straight months of declines. The median price of a new home also rose, though only slightly, on a monthly basis. But if you think the downturn in the housing market is over, analysts were quick to point out that the up tick may be temporary and that both sales and median prices are down from a year ago. NPR's Jack Speer reports. JACK SPEER: If you're a homebuilder, you've had an extraordinary run over the last five years. The National Association of Realtors says home prices in the U. S. have risen 50 percent since 2000. But times have changed. Listen to this exchange between Jose Weeks, a potential buyer, and Mark Rathbun(ph), a sales associate with K. Hovnanian Homes. Mr. JOSE WEEKS: Well, obviously, all of these have two-car garages, four bedrooms, right? Mr. MARK RATHBUN (K. Hovnanian Homes): Yeah, absolutely. That's where we start. MR. WEEKS: What kind of incentives you have right now? Mr. RATHBUN: Our incentives are basically we'll help you out with closing costs and we'll help you out with the finishing of the largest room in the basement. SPEER: And exchanges like this one are increasingly common. At this upscale development in northern Virginia known as Eagle's Point, single-family homes start at around $600,000. Hovnanian's Emilio Martinez says along with free extras, they're also working with potential buyers to help them sell the house they're in. Something he says they haven't done in years. Mr. EMILIO MARTINEZ (Kay Hovnanian Homes): It's a very nice insurance policy for the buyer. They go into the transaction knowing exactly what the worst-case scenario would be, and I think that offers them some piece of mind of, you know, I know exactly I'm going to get $350,000 at worst case scenario. SPEER: Other big builders like Toll Brothers, Pulte and Lennar are offering similar deals, in some instances offering below market mortgage rates, even providing bridge loans to buyers until they can sell their homes. Homebuilders would like to believe those incentives are what caused the rebound in new home sales last month. But that's far from clear. It may have been a slight decrease in long term mortgage rates. Most analysts agree the housing market hasn't bottomed out yet. There's a glut of both new and old homes on the market right now. Nicholas Retsinas directs the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. Mr. NICHOLAS RETSINAS (Joint Center for Housing Studies, Harvard): Buyers are looking at having many, many more choices. Here a year and a half ago in these hot markets, buyers were getting skittish and nervous. They'd see a house on the market and they'd be afraid if they didn't act quickly the price would increase so that it would be out of reach. SPEER: Now it's exactly the opposite, with many homebuyers expecting prices to fall further in coming months. David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard and Poor's, expects as in past downturns, some builders will be hurt. Mr. DAVID WYSS (Standard and Poor's): These guys always get caught. Housing is a very cyclical market. A lot of the smaller builders particularly, who still dominate the business, are not terribly well financed. They always tend to go out on a limb in these bull markets and then they don't have the resources to withstand the bear market. SPEER: Still most big homebuilders believe they will weather the current downturn, are perhaps more concerned that many economists as what the slowdown will mean for the broader economy.

He's a correspondent for The Economist. Welcome to the program. VIJAY VAITHEESWARAN: Good to be here. INSKEEP: Could the timing of this dramatic drop really be a coincidence? VAITHEESWARAN: The U. S. gasoline market is determined by many factors, most importantly the world oil markets. INSKEEP: Although, wait a minute. We're talking about the price of gasoline, which is a little different than the price of crude oil. Oil companies have assured us over the last couple of years that the price of crude oil doesn't have a lot to do with it. It has to do with their refinery capacity and a lot of other things that are beyond their control which would keep driving prices upward. What's happening that would suddenly drive them down now? VAITHEESWARAN: Well, what happened? We didn't have a crisis. And so market conditions are exerting themselves and that external shock that could always happen in oil, the dog that could bark, it hasn't been barking of late. INSKEEP: Does a major oil company or an oil-producing nation have the power to move the oil price a little bit up or down depending on how they trade, how they sell, how they buy? VAITHEESWARAN: OPEC is very concerned that there might be a price collapse. So I think you might see the Saudis actually cut their own oil production in coming weeks and that would of course help prop up prices. INSKEEP: Weren't there reports that BP was under investigation for manipulating energy prices? VAITHEESWARAN: I mean we think of Exxon, the biggest Fortune 500 company, as a colossus. Exxon is one-twentieth the size of Saudi Aramco, which is a Saudi oil company. Most of the world's oil, almost 90 percent, is in the hands of the government companies, not Exxon, not BP, not Chevron. INSKEEP: So you mentioned one factor behind the change in oil prices, that there was anxiety earlier in the year that drove them up and now that anxiety is abated somewhat so the prices go back down. Has anything fundamental, though, changed about the oil market that has pushed oil prices to such high levels over the last couple of years? VAITHEESWARAN: So it's that mismatch that explains the oil price rises over the last five years and I think the market will remain tight. We're in a much more volatile and dangerous world when it comes to oil and we don't have a safety net. INSKEEP: Vijay Vaitheeswaran of The Economist, author of Power to the People. Thanks very much.

David, good to talk with you again. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: The basics first: what is productivity and why is it so important? WESSEL: And little differences in the numbers make a big difference. At 1 and a half percent annual productivity growth, it takes 50 years to double the standard of living. At just 2 and half percent, it takes only 29 years. INSKEEP: This is like compound interest - if it's going a little faster every year, it just goes like a snowball downhill. WESSEL: Exactly. INSKEEP: So, how's productivity been doing? WESSEL: Now there's a big debate about whether this surge of the '90s is over or whether it's going to continue. INSKEEP: Which is of great interest, I know, to the Fed chairman now, Ben Bernanke. But it raises the question of why, because he's thinking about interest rates and inflation. WESSEL: Right. INSKEEP: What's the connection? WESSEL: Higher productivity, the faster Mr. Bernanke can let the economy grow without raising interest rates. INSKEEP: How does American's productivity growth compare with Europe, say? Or Japan? WESSEL: American workers are among the most productive workers in the world. That's why their wages are higher than other workers. And American productivity growth is the envy of the industrial countries around the world. INSKEEP: Is there a competition between the United States and, say, China as China comes up in the world? WESSEL: If Chinese workers were as productive as American workers, meaning if they - if the stuff they produced per hour of work were as valuable as the stuff that American workers produce, their wages would be much higher. There's lots of competition in the global marketplace, but the winner is almost always the country that has the most productive workers. INSKEEP: Is this our defense, in effect, against cheap imports from abroad and low wage workers abroad? As long as we're more productive, we can deserve and earn more money? WESSEL: That's why there's so much emphasis now on how do we get our schools better, because in today's modern economy, more educated workers tend to be more productive. That is, the value of the stuff they produce is more valuable. We need to figure out how to lift the education of our workers across the economy so that they can be more productive and compete with workers in Mexico, India, and China.

You look bored to death, almost asleep. WESSEL: No, no, no. I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to do everything I have to do today before I leave. INSKEEP: Oh, okay.

So there's your calendar for the week ahead. ", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. The stock market has been on a tear lately, and today the best known measure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, closed at a record high, 11,727. Behind this dramatic run-up is a sharp fall in energy prices. The price of a barrel of oil fell more than $2 today. Oil closed below $59 a barrel for the first time since mid-February. But as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, it's not just cheaper oil. Analysts say there's a widespread perception that interest rates may have peaked. JIM ZARROLI: From his perch on the trading floor at Bear Stearns, senior managing director Michael Driscoll has seen a lot of ups and downs in the stock market. Driscoll says the Dow closing at a record high doesn't generate quite the same excitement here that it might once have. Mr. MICHAEL DRISCOLL (Bear Stearns): It matters. I mean, I think we're all aware of what the numbers are and what it means, and a closing high and so on and so forth. But for the most part, I think people have a little bit less of a euphoric opinion of it than they may have had a couple of years ago. ZARROLI: Stock prices have been in a kind of trough since January 2000. In that time, they have been battered by corporate scandals, terrorist attacks, rising energy prices and war. But Driscoll says in recent months, things have gotten a lot better. Energy prices have fallen from this year's high, and it looks like interest rates have stopped rising. Mr. DRISCOLL: I'd say the biggest catalysts are probably a growing perception that the Federal Reserve has ceased raising interest rates after 17 consecutive hikes. The goal was the soft landing, and it looks like they got that. ZARROLI: Driscoll says that's brought a lot of investors back into the market. Over the next few months, he says, a lot of fund managers and individual investors will try to catch up by buying stock, and that will keep prices rising. For stock investors, it's not exactly irrational exuberance, but it will do. Mike and Ellen Smith have seen their stock portfolios grow nicely. The couple are in town from Seattle and are standing outside the New York Stock Exchange, taking pictures. The Smiths lost some money in the dot-com boom, and to them, the turnaround in the Dow is a welcome development. Ms. ELLEN SMITH: Oh, because we had a lot of dot-com companies, just crazy things. But you know what? It's coming back, and you know, everyone's - it's fine. Mr. MIKE SMITH: Oh yeah. I think it's great news. I love it. Why? Well, that just means I'm getting richer. ZARROLI: Others remain uneasy. Not far away stands Phil Rapozo, who works as a money manager on Cape Cod. Rapozo notes that the other stock indexes aren't doing as well as the Dow. The NASDAQ Index is less than half where it was in 2000. Mr. PHIL RAPOZO (Money Manager): We do not have across the board confirmation of the other indexes doing what the Dow is doing. And historically, any time the Dow has been leading the market, that's not been a good thing. ZARROLI: Rapozo says when investors are nervous, they tend to put money into the kinds of big-cap stocks that make up the Dow. So if the Dow is doing a lot better than other indexes, it may be a sign of weakness in the economy. Why should investors be so nervous? One reason, he says, is the weak housing market. Mr. RAPOZO: This isn't a mild slowdown. There was an indicator that came out not just a week ago that we are at a 13 year high in housing inventory for sale, one year after a peak - unheard of. It takes years to have that happen. ZARROLI: Rapozo says the weak housing market can only make people feel less wealthy, and he says that will lead to a decline in consumer spending and a downturn in the economy. If that proves to be the case, the record high Dow closing may turn out to be a kind of false spring for investors. But for now, at least, consumer spending appears to be holding up, and a lot of investors are seeing reason for optimism. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

Last month, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill increasing the minimum wage from $6. 75 to $8. 00 over the next two years. It could help lift the fortunes of low-wage workers, many of whom are black and Latino. Opponents say the increase will hurt the economy and eliminate jobs. But that hasn't happened in at least one city. From member station KALW in San Francisco, Rose Aguilar reports. Ms. JAMILA BLACKSTON (Resident, Oakland): Sixteen, 15. ROSE AGUILAR: Twenty-eight-year-old Jamila Blackston(ph) works 20 to 30 hours a week at the Goodwill store in downtown Oakland. She also goes to school full time and is studying to become a realtor. Blackston has sole custody of her 8-year-old son, Talin(ph), and he goes to work with her when he's not in school. On a busy Thursday afternoon, he plays with stuffed animals while Jamila checks out customers. She currently makes the state minimum wage, $6. 75 an hour. Ms. BLACKSTON: I try and save like $20 out each on my checks. I can't take my real estate license because I don't have enough money. And every time I get the money to pay for the test, it all - something always comes up. So I've got to spend the little money I am saving. AGUILAR: Blackston says she can't look for a better paying job. She's busy with her son and school. Ms. BLACKSTON: In order to make a minimum wage job work, you have to know how to live on a budget. You have to know how to spend your money wisely. AGUILAR: According to the California Budget Project, a non-partisan group for fiscal reform, almost 60 percent of California's low-wage workers are 25 or older. California ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, has helped a diverse group of minimum wage workers fight for higher wages. Legislative Director Tatiana Siegenthaler. Ms. TATIANA SIEGENTHALER (Legislative Director, ACORN): They're not teenagers; they're families who have three or four kids. People who, because they make such little money, they have to take two or three jobs. AGUILAR: Last year, Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed another proposed wage increase. It could have tied automatic annual raises to the cost of living. The bill just signed does not cover automatic increases. The state's minimum wage was last raised in January 2002. Prices have increased by just over 11 percent since then, according to ACORN. Ms. SIEGENTHALER: The prices of things raise every year -gas, food, things that people low and middle income families consume everyday. Those are the things that go up every year. As they go up, the minimum wage should go up according to inflation. We think that's fair. AGUILAR: Many business groups oppose the wage increase, saying it will hurt the economy and cause businesses to shut down. Just down the street from the Goodwill, Maria Gastelumendi(ph) makes sandwiches for her lunchtime customers at the Rising Loafer Bakery and Caf\u00e9. She already pays her employees just over $8 an hour, but she expects they'll ask for a raise once the new minimum wage law takes effect in January. Gastelumendi's shop has only been open for seven months and she has yet to break even. She says she's going to stick it out until early next year. Ms. MARIA GASTELUMENDI (Cafe owner): Otherwise, I'd have shut down because I cannot - right now payroll is 40 percent of my income and I'm borrowing money to pay to have the doors open, so I'll shut down. I have no other choice. AGUILAR: Gastelumendi is not alone. According to the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California, the state's wage increase will cost employers an additional $2. 6 billion a year. Senior fellow David Neumark, a professor of economics at UC Irvine, has been studying the minimum wage for 20 years. He says it's hard to show that minimum wage increases actually help workers in the long run. Professor DAVID NEUMARK (Senior Fellow, Public Policy Institute of California; Professor of Economics, UC Irvine): Roughly speaking, if you raise the minimum wage 10 percent, unskilled groups will suffer about one to two percent decline in their employment rates. AGUILAR: But according to another recent study at the UC Berkeley's Institute of Industrial Relations, job loss did not happen in San Francisco, where the city raised its minimum wage three years ago. By law, workers in San Francisco now must make at least $8. 82 an hour. Because San Francisco's minimum wage is tied to inflation, workers will make $9. 14 an hour starting January 1st. UC Berkeley economics Professor Michael Reich says wage increases helped to alleviate poverty and ultimately benefit the state's budget. Professor MICHAEL REICH (Professor of Economics, UC Berkeley): And however we slice and dice the data, we could not find any negative employment effects of the minimum wage. And more importantly there was a shift from part-time to full-time employment in the fast food sector of the restaurant industry. AGUILAR: Workers' rights activists applaud the state-wide increase, but they point to research by the California Budget Project that estimates a single adult in California needs to make $13 an hour to get by. An adult with kids needs to make $20 an hour. Jamila Blackston says every dollar helps. Ms. BLACKSTON: That extra dollar, it will help a lot of people who just, you know, can't do nothing else. It would help them, especially if they have more than one kid. AGUILAR: Meanwhile, Jamila will be looking ahead to the day when she earns her realtor's license and doesn't have to accept minimum wage work. In San Francisco, I'm Rose Aguilar.

Still, when the Dow sets records, as it's been doing this week, it's front page news across the country. But to people who follow Wall Street, the Dow is an imperfect gage of market activity. And some say this week's record could be a sign of trouble for the economy. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI: When the Dow broke through the record it set in January 2000 this week, it seemed like good times were back on Wall Street. But the investor optimism is belied by some troubling facts. The economy has slowed and the housing market is hurting. Lakshman Achuthan is managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. NORRIS: In our view - looking at the good leading indicators - it is too soon to call or expect a revival in growth. And that is exactly what the Dow is doing. ZARROLI: Some analysts say this paradox of rising stock prices and uncertain growth prospects may have something to do with the Dow itself. The surge in the Dow has not been matched by the other major stock indexes. The Standard and Poor's 500 index and the NASDAQ composite index are up since the summer, but at a slower pace than the Dow. And the NASDAQ index is still at less than half the level it reached in 2000. Sam Stovall is chief investment strategist at Standard and Poor's. SAM STOVALL: The S&P at a 10 percent rate of growth would probably take about two years to reach a new high, whereas with the NASDAQ it would take more than eight years to go on to set a new high. ZARROLI: The differences among these indexes are due in part to the way they're designed. Each index reflects the value of a particular basket of stocks. The stocks in the NASDAQ and the S&P are weighted by size, which means the price swings of bigger companies affect them much more than smaller ones. In contrast, the Dow counts every stock equally. Many people on Wall Street say this makes the Dow less reliable as a market barometer. Tim Ghriskey is chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. TIM GHRISKEY: The Dow, everybody looks to because it's the oldest index. It's the one everybody remembers from childhood. But it's really not used by institutions at all to measure performance because of how it's constructed. ZARROLI: There's also another big difference among the indexes, the S&P and NASDAQ are based on hundreds of stocks of varying sizes. The Dow consists of just 30 blue chip stocks, like Proctor & Gamble and Microsoft. Tim Ghriskey says these are just the kinds of safe stocks that investors tend to favor when they're worried about the economy. So the fact that the Dow keeps hitting records may not be a sign of strength. Ghriskey says he, himself, doesn't share this concern and he is optimistic about the stock market. GHRISKEY: It does say that we have had quite a recovery in stock prices and the doom and gloom that we saw in 2000, 2001, 2002 is over and that the market is back on solid footing. ZARROLI: As this week's record closings suggest, many investors agree. Still, the Dow has missed the mark before. The Dow rallied 20 percent during the first third of 2001, just as the U.

That's when businesses report their performances, so let's check on his. Henry Hank Paulson took office at the beginning of July. He said he had been assured that he would have more clout than his two predecessors. To talk about whether that's true, here's David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street journal. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: So is Hank Paulson any different from his two predecessors? Mr. WESSEL: He's definitely different. He's almost defined himself as being the opposite of John Snow, his predecessor. He has, for instance, been very quiet, not gone on a lot of TV interviews. He's picked his shots very carefully, made a couple of big speeches, and in a very dramatic departure, has said he will not be campaigning for Republican candidates this fall - exactly the opposite of Mr. Snow. His big move so far has been to take a very high-profile trip to China, a place he's visited 70 times before as an investment banker. INSKEEP: I assume he didn't go along with Bono on that trip. Mr. WESSEL: He did not take Bono. I don't think Bono will be traveling with this Treasury secretary. INSKEEP: As he did with Paul O'Neill, one of the predecessors. Now, you mentioned he's not campaigning for Republican candidates this fall. Why wouldn't a Treasury secretary do that? Mr. WESSEL: I think every Treasury secretary has to decide who his client is. In some cases, they look at their client as being the political wing of the White House. Mr. Paulson seems to think his client is maybe the taxpayers of the United States, and he wants to preserve his stature as sort of a power broker, a dealmaker, so that if Democrats take control of the House or Senate this fall, he hasn't poisoned the atmosphere too much. INSKEEP: Well, what would he want to do after the election then? Mr. WESSEL: Mr. Paulson strikes me as a very ambitious, energetic man, who is to determined to accomplish something in the two years that are left in the Bush presidency. What that something is, is very much unclear. One possibility is to lead the charge for the president in negotiating a deal on the long-term budget problems - spending on healthcare, and Social Security, and tax reform. I think that that's something he would very much like to do if the president will give him the negotiating authority to do so. INSKEEP: Meaning the White House would have to agree to compromise. Mr. WESSEL: I think Mr. Paulson knows that in this respect he is an agent of the president. And unless the president is willing to put, say, tax increases on the table in order to get Democrats to negotiate a compromise, in my judgment, it will be very hard for Mr. Paulson to accomplish anything. INSKEEP: Now, this is a big if, because the election is still weeks away. But if one or both of the Houses of Congress were to change, would that make that kind of deal making more likely? Mr. WESSEL: There are two sets of arguments. One set of arguments is that if Democrats get control of one house or another, they'll have some responsibility to govern. It may force a compromise between Republicans and Democrats. A second argument is that the Democrats will spend most of the next two years investigating the Bush administration and gearing up for the 2008 elections. It's too early to know which scenario will play out. But it is clear that any Democrat who wants to do a deal with the White House -and Mr. Paulson, if he wants to do a deal with Democrats - really only has maybe nine or 10 months in 2007 to get anything done before the presidential campaign overshadows everything. INSKEEP: Now, you mentioned, David Wessel, that Hank Paulson has stayed out of public view for the most part. Has your reporting revealed what he's been like in the private? Mr. WESSEL: Mr. Paulson seems to spend a great deal of time reaching out to Congress, which seems a smart strategy for a newcomer to Washington. A bunch of us from The Wall Street Journal did an interview with him that was scheduled for an hour. He really spoke at us for 20 minutes. I had to interrupt to get our first question in. He has given two big speeches. He cares about them deeply; so deeply that he's already burned out his first speechwriter. INSKEEP: Always interesting with powerful men. How did he take the interruption when you stopped him? Mr. WESSEL: He took it very well. This is a man who knows that reporters will shape his image in Washington. And if he thinks that we're being rude, he doesn't show it. INSKEEP: So low profile but still thinking about what the public thinks. Mr. WESSEL: I don't think it's low profile. I think it's strategically using his profile to achieve his end. He didn't call us in to talk to us until he was about to make a trip to China and he had something to say.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. The government's September jobs report came in weaker than expected today and immediately set off a debate over whether it was really as weak as it looked. Businesses added just over 50,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, but the number for August was revised sharply higher. The unemployment rate dropped a tenth of a percent to 4. 6 percent. To sort all this out, here's NPR's Jack Speer. JACK SPEER: Economists are fond of saying one month's numbers do not a trend make. And while overall jobs growth was weak in September, the upward revisions to July and August put job growth in the third quarter at a respectable 120,000 per month. Standard and Poor's chief economist, David Weiss, says there was also that drop in the unemployment rate. Mr. DAVID WEISS (Standard and Poor's): Well, it's a mixed bag because we're seeing the good numbers on the unemployment rate down at the lowest level we've seen in this expansion, while on the other hand, the number of jobs just is sitting there doing nothing. SPEER: Manufacturing lost another 19,000 jobs and retail shed 8,000. But lest you think the report was mostly doom and gloom, here's PNC financial economist Stuart Hoffman. Mr. STUART HOFFMAN (Financial Economist, PNC): This number to me tells me the economy is continuing to grow and yes, while it is slowing down, it doesn't seem to me as though the wheels are coming off the economy. SPEER: The big surprise, though, was in a little noticed revision to the jobs numbers for the 12 months from March of '05 to March of this year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says it believes it missed as many as 810,000 new jobs in that period. Putting that in perspective, it's more people than live in the city of Jacksonville, Florida, or the entire state of South Dakota. Bernard Bommel is the executive director of the Economic Policy Group. He says it's important for both the Federal Reserve and the financial markets to have accurate and reliable jobs numbers. Mr. BERNARD BOMMEL (Economic Policy Group): They've got to get this right. They've got to reconfigure it, they've got to improve the quality of the way they measure job growth, and I think that's one of the reasons, I think, why we did see the significant big jump. SPEER: The Labor Department acknowledges it's looking at its methodology. If the revised numbers turn out to be right, Bommel says that would indicate an economy that may be on a better footing than most people thought. Mr. BOMMEL: This is a significant announcement. I think a lot of economists are going back to the drawing boards and trying to figure out what's going on, and we may see, you know, some changes in forecasts about what the economy's going to do over the course of the next six to 12 months based on some of these revisions. SPEER: President Bush didn't mention the revisions but said he is pleased with the economy's progress, some of which he credited to the recent decline in energy prices.

Edmund Phelps won the 2006 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Like every other Nobel Prize winner so far this year, he is an American, and he was awarded the prize for working in the '60s, challenging what was then the conventional wisdom.  NPR's Adam Davidson is on the line, and Adam, what was that conventional wisdom? ADAM DAVIDSON: Most people believed that governments had a lot of power to control the unemployment rate. They could lower the unemployment rate, get more people back to work by simply accepting a slightly higher inflation rate. Basically governments thought that they had a lot of power to control how the economy works. It was something known as the Phillips Curve.  Well, Phelps - not Phillips - Phelps showed that that doesn't actually work. It doesn't work in the long run. It completely breaks down. And he forced government economic policy-makers to recognize that they have a lot less power than they thought they did. INSKEEP: This must be huge, because the major thing that governments seem to be able to do to or with the economy is mess with interest rates, affect the deficits, all of which affects inflation.  DAVIDSON: That's right. And they do focus on interest rates and inflation. But governments now, thanks to Phelps, no longer think about the unemployment rate as a number that they can control, much like they can control inflation rates. INSKEEP: I want to ask about another thing. The Nobel committee also cited his work on what's called inter-generational justice. What is that? DAVIDSON: He asked this question, which is a fascinating question: What economic policies that we have today will impact future generations? And he actually wrote in philosophy as well as economics that we have an obligation to future generations as well as to ourselves. And so he came up - they're pretty technical, but with a technical thing - he calls it the Golden Rule of investments, that maximizes well-being not only for current generations but for future generations as well. INSKEEP: What's the Golden Rule? ADAMSON: It's - it looks pretty complicated on paper. INSKEEP: Does it just boil down to invest unto others as you would have them invest - never mind. What is it? ADAMSON: It's basically let's invest an amount today that - that leaves enough money in the future for people to enjoy and consume as much as we do now. INSKEEP: Adam Davidson, one other quick question. They do call it the dismal science for a reason. You never know if these brilliant economists know what they're talking about. How do we know this guy actually deserved a Nobel Prize? ADAMSON: Well, there's an economics joke, that economists are very good at predicting the past and not so good at predicting the future. He's someone whose work really has stood up - at least the 40 years, so far, since he wrote it, and has really transformed in a way that seems sustainable, how economists look at the government. So I think the consensus seems to be he definitely deserved it. INSKEEP: NPR's Adam Davidson, thanks very much.

Ford is recalling more than 145,000 vehicles for various problems, including side door latches and drive trains. This is another hit for a company that's had a lot of problems which are spreading beyond Detroit. Job cuts at General Motors and looming ones at Ford at taking a toll on some of the more exclusive neighborhoods in the area. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports. FRANK LANGFITT: Art Jacobson has a lovely home in a gated community. But he can't sell it. The problem? It's in Dearborn, the Detroit suburb and headquarters of Ford. There's so many houses on the market here, it would take at least a year to sell them all. An when Ford cuts 10,000 white collar jobs in the coming months, more for sale signs are sure to go up. Jacobson left Ford a few years ago in an earlier round of cutbacks. Recently, he gave me a tour of his house. It sits on a golf course, which hosts Ford's Senior Players Championship. Mr. ART JACOBSON: And this opens up onto the seventh fairway. It's a par five. And you can come by here and you can see, like, Jack Nicholas and Arnold Palmer, and - I did follow Lee Trevino around one time. He's a lot of fun to follow around. LANGFITT: The house, which has been on the market for six months, has other selling points. The foyer has marble floors and an 18-foot ceiling. But Jacobson says people are so anxious about the economy, it's hard to get anyone interested in a luxury home. Mr. JACOBSON: We started out at 549. We dropped it down to 524, and we just lowered it about a week and a half ago. Right now we're at 497,500. Hopefully we're going to attract some buyers. LANGFITT: The economic problems of suburban Detroit go well beyond housing. Some country clubs have lost members. Restaurants report fewer customers. Some have even shut down. Last month, Rick Halberg closed Emily's, a French restaurant where a dish of wild Alaskan halibut went for $38. Sitting in the empty dining room, Halberg traces the slide in revenue that began last year. Mr. RICK HALBERG (Owner, Emily's Restaurant): It started dipping and then really, this year was frightening. LANGFITT: Customers from nearby auto parts companies came in less often. So did people who used the restaurant to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries. Mr. HALBERG: Saturday nights weren't as busy. Friday nights weren't as busy. The businessmen on expense accounts, those guys weren't coming in as much, weren't ordering $150 or $200 bottles of wine as frequently -you know, preordering special dinners, things like that. LANGFITT: White tablecloth restaurants aren't the only ones suffering. Pete Buscami(ph) runs a pizza and sub shop across town in Grosse Pointe, a wealthy suburb where lakeside mansions run in the millions. (Soundbite of machinery) LANGFITT: Buscami says some people are cutting out yard work to save money, and that means fewer jobs for the lawn crews who usually buy his subs. Mr. PETE BUSCAMI (Restaurant Owner): You know, the guys who do landscaping and painting and stuff like that, that obviously the job load has become much, much lighter. Their crews are smaller. I'm not getting as many crews. I was averaging probably 12, 15 crews in the middle of the summer of landscapers alone. This year, I was lucky if I got four or five. LANGFITT: Jeff Solinsky(ph) comes in for a sub. He's a self-employed builder. Solinsky says the real estate slump has left him with a lot less work. Mr. JEFF SOLINSKY (Self-Employed Builder): I think what I'm finding is that my phone simply is not ringing at all. LANGFITT: Like the auto companies, Solinsky has handled the drop in his own business by cutting back. Mr. SOLINSKY: I've downsized everything. I went from a five-bedroom house to now a one-bedroom apartment - from a fleet of trucks and ten employees to no employees and an old 1995 Ford pickup truck. LANGFITT: One thing Solinsky can't downsize is college tuition for his daughter, Sara. So he's thinking about moving - maybe someplace in the South or the West where people are building more houses. But even a bad economy creates new business. Unidentified Woman: (Answering telephone) Good afternoon, Bearing Group. LANGFITT: That's a real estate company in Grosse Pointe which focuses exclusively on foreclosures. The firm sells the houses for banks and takes a small commission. Business is booming. Owner Ken Koppite(ph) says that as the economy has declined, his stock of foreclosed properties has quadrupled and he needs more staff. Mr. KEN KOPPITE (Owner, Bearing Group): Well, we've outgrown this office. I'd say we have more people than I have desks. I need to hire a number of new people. I've got more homes than I have people to help me sell them, so I need other assistants to help market the properties for me. And with that, the back office stuff grows, too. Now we have more bookwork, more invoices, more billing going on. LANGFITT: But the hiring at Koppite's business is the exception. Michigan keeps losing jobs, even as most states add them. Researchers at the University of Michigan expect another 23,000 jobs to disappear next year. And they say the problems in the auto industry will keep the economy down until the fall of 2008. Frank Langfitt, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  You may want to avoid driving your vehicle until you know it's safe. Ford is recalling more than 145,000 vehicles for various problems, including side door latches and drive trains.  This is another hit for a company that's had a lot of problems which are spreading beyond Detroit. Job cuts at General Motors and looming ones at Ford at taking a toll on some of the more exclusive neighborhoods in the area.  NPR's Frank Langfitt reports.  FRANK LANGFITT: Art Jacobson has a lovely home in a gated community. But he can't sell it. The problem? It's in Dearborn, the Detroit suburb and headquarters of Ford.

The federal budget deficit for the year ended in September will be substantially below the previous year's amount, $318 billion. That was the amount last year. To tell us why it's going down from that number and whether this good news will last, we turn to David Wessel. He's Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal. David, good to talk with you again. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: How much below $318 billion? Mr. WESSEL: The Congressional Budget Office's guess, and they make pretty educated guesses, is it'll be about $250 billion, or roughly 1. 9 percent of the gross domestic product. This is going to allow President Bush to boast that he met his goal of halving the deficit, and he did it ahead of schedule. INSKEEP: Did the president have anything to do with it? Mr. WESSEL: Oh sure, the president gets credit for everything good that happens in the economy and blame for everything bad that happens. The biggest reason the deficit is smaller than last year and smaller than a lot of the forecasters were expecting at the beginning of the year, is a surge in tax receipts. They're up nearly 12 percent in this fiscal year. That's more than offset the increase in spending, which is about 9 percent. I think the president will say that the increase in tax receipts is his doing. He cut taxes: that stimulated the economy and brought in more money. I suspect he won't be taking credit for the 9 percent increase in spending. INSKEEP: Is the president right, that tax cuts have led to that increase in receipts as the economy is stimulated? Mr. WESSEL: That's a matter of huge theological debate among economists. Seems to me the evidence suggests that the president's tax cuts were fairly well timed and helped stimulate the economy at a time it was weak. But it's also true that a lot of the increase in taxes is coming from tax rates that he didn't cut, and it's hard to see this evidence in my opinion, as supporting the thesis that if you cut taxes you get more revenue, so you should always cut taxes. As you remember, the president mostly cut individual income taxes, but the real surge has been in corporate profits. Measured against the size of the economy, corporate tax receipts in the just-ended fiscal year are bigger than any time since 1978. INSKEEP: So corporations are paying more? Mr. WESSEL: Corporations are paying more because they are making so much money. INSKEEP: The gigantic profits at someplace like Exxon means more tax receipts for the federal government? Mr. WESSEL: Absolutely. INSKEEP: Now, before we get carried away here, David, you said that the expectation is that we'll have a budget deficit somewhere in the neighborhood of $250 billion. That still sounds like a lot of money. Mr. WESSEL: It is a lot of money, but it's not a lot of money in an $11 trillion economy. The deficit today is not a serious economic problem. We have very low interest rates, low unemployment. The problem is that it's probably going to get worse from here. In the near term, interest rates are rising, the economy's slowing, Iraq is costly, and there's all sorts of things on the congressional and presidential wish lists that are going to add to spending. So, in the near term, the deficit is likely to get a little bigger. And then, looking beyond the next year or two, the same large problems loom: spending on benefit programs, particularly retirement benefit programs, and especially healthcare -are going to overwhelm taxes, even with this recent surge in tax receipts, until somebody figures out how to square that circle. INSKEEP: David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal, thanks very much. Mr. WESSEL: A pleasure.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Well, the White House is expected to announce some good news this week.

It's been almost a year since sweeping changes took effect in the nation's bankruptcy laws.  Since then, the number of people filing for bankruptcy has dropped off dramatically. But neither creditors nor bankruptcy attorneys expect the numbers to stay down. NPR's Scott Horsley explains. SCOTT HORSLEY: One of the goals of the year-old bankruptcy law was to weed out abuse and make sure debtors who could afford to pay some of their bills actually did so. Would-be filers who make more than the median income are now supposed to be steered in some cases into payment plans. But Mark Miller, one of San Diego's busiest bankruptcy attorneys, says the new payment plan net actually catches very few fish. Most of his clients still end up having their debts erased altogether. Mr. MARK MILLER (Bankruptcy Attorney, San Diego): What we're finding is that about 90-plus percent of the people who cold qualify under the old law can still qualify under the new law. So there is a perception that bankruptcy is no longer available. That's a false perception. People in fact can still file. HORSLEY: But filing for bankruptcy is not as easy as it used to be. Personal filings in the first six months of this year were down nearly 70 percent from a year ago.  Law Professor David Skeel, who's a scholar in residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute, says extra conditions imposed by the law have discouraged many people from seeking bankruptcy protection. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're paying their bills. Skeel says many are stuck in a kind of financial limbo. Professor DAVID SKEEL (American Bankruptcy Institute): The principle effect of this legislation has not been to induce more people to repay. The principle effect is really just to increase the cost of filing for bankruptcy and the hassle of the bankruptcy process. And that's something I think is unfortunate. HORSLEY: A big reason for the higher cost is that bankruptcy attorneys are now required to verify their clients' financial claims, and that means more work. Supporters say the verification requirement helps prevent fraud, but Skeel says a bankruptcy case that cost $1,000 before the new law took effect might be twice as expensive today. Prof. SKEEL: One of the great ironies is you can be too poor to file for bankruptcy. HORSLEY: Would-be filers also have to go through financial counseling first. Skeel says such counseling probably comes too late to help most people, once they've reached the point of even considering bankruptcy. But Laura Fisher, of the American Bankers Association, says even if it doesn't prevent filings, counseling is still a good idea. Ms. LAURA FISHER (American Bankers Association): Even if people go to counseling and they still declare bankruptcy, it sets them up to be more successful in the future. They're going back to their same expenses, and in some cases the same bad habits, and, you know, the counseling is going to help them avoid some of the missteps they may have taken in the past. HORSLEY: Fisher, who represents banks and credit card companies, expects the number of bankruptcy filings will rebound over time. But ultimately, she says, if filings drop even a little bit from the level they were at before the new law that could be sign that abuse has been wrung out of the system. On the other hand, Miller, the bankruptcy attorney, notes that credit card companies and other lenders are still pushing easy money. He thinks that will lead to even more bankruptcies down the road. Mr. MILLER: I mean I saw an ad in the newspaper where VISA was marketing - they needed salespeople to market credit cards to people who had credit problems. So, as long as interest rates stay low, the credit industry will be aggressive in their marketing of credit. And that means people will be at my door. HORSLEY: Miller expects his caseload will be back to its 2005 level within six months to a year. Scott Horsley, NPR News, San Diego.

He's Deputy Washington Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal and a regular guest here. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: Okay, the housing market is not doing very well. How bad is bad? Mr. WESSEL: Well, in August there were 20 percent fewer new homes started than in August a year ago. The median price of an existing house has, by a measure that the National Association of Realtors keep, says that the typical house is going for 2 percent less than a year ago - which is a whole lot different then a market where prices were going up 10, 12, 15 percent a year. INSKEEP: Why would that scare people about the overall economy? Mr. WESSEL: Well, a couple of reasons. One is, home building is a big industry, and there are fewer people working in it. But the main one is that consumer spending is a major driver of the U. S. , and indeed, the global economy. And the fear has been that when housing prices come down people will stop spending. They'll stop using their house like an ATM. INSKEEP: This is the clich\u00e9, that people have been borrowing against their homes and then spending it on cars, or trips, or any number of other things. Mr. WESSEL: Correct. Correct. INSKEEP: Okay. So now the market is going down. People don't have quite as much money they can borrow. What's happening? Mr. WESSEL: Well, the economy is definitely slowing. Ben Bernanke, the Fed Chairman, said the other day that the weak housing market will shave a full percentage point off the annual growth rate in the second half of the year. But it's interesting that the forecasters - who are sometimes right and sometimes not - are beginning to talk about all the other good things that are going on in the economy that may prevent us from being driven into a housing recession. INSKEEP: Like what? Mr. WESSEL: Well, the biggest one is that energy prices are coming down. Oil is $15 a barrel less than it was at the peak. The sharp drop in the prices of gasoline and natural gas have freed up about $90 billion, at an annual rate of spending that consumers can use on other things. The second thing is that U. S. exports are starting to turn up, because other parts of the world are picking up a little momentum as we lose it. And finally, people are now convinced that the Fed is not going to raise interest rates any further anytime soon. That has kept long-term interest rates - which are really important to the economy - down, and that's also helping to stimulate things to offset the weakness driven by housing. INSKEEP: So have consumers gone right on coming up with money to spend? Mr. WESSEL: Pretty much. One thing that's clear is that every time forecasters say the American consumer is just about spent out, the American consumer proves the forecasters wrong. INSKEEP: You know, it is interesting, though, David, I wonder about the psychological effect, entirely aside from the practical effect of whether you have money to borrow. When my house value goes up, I feel more affluent. When my house value goes down, I feel a little less secure. Mr. WESSEL: There is no doubt that a collapsing housing market is bad for the economy, bad for consumer spending, and bad for public attitudes. The question is, how bad is the housing market going to be? How much will that effect consumer spending, and what other good things will go on in the economy that'll offset that weakness? And it's those other good things that seem to be buoying the forecasters right now. INSKEEP: David, thanks for the explanation. Mr. WESSEL: A pleasure.

In early trading today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 12,000 for the first time in its history. It has since fallen back, though at this hour it remains in positive territory. The early rally on Wall Street may have been spurred by new figures on consumer prices and housing starts. The Consumer Price Index fell in September by half a percentage point, which is the largest amount in 10 months, and construction of new homes showed an unexpected rebound. All these figures come as many high-profile companies are reporting earnings. NPR'S Windy Kaufman reports. WENDY KAUFMAN: IBM's quarterly profit rose 47 percent over the same period last year. The figure was better than analysts had predicted. A lower tax bill and strong gains in both software and hardware sales were largely responsible. But another big name, Intel, reported sharply lower quarterly profits. The 35 percent drop in its third quarter stems in part from a nasty price war with chip rival AMD. Intel, the world's largest maker of PC microprocessors, is hoping its new core chips will restore the firm to glory. Meanwhile, the company is restructuring and reducing its workforce by about 10 percent over the next two years. Motorola, the world's number two cell phone maker, also posted sharply lower profits. The 45 percent drop in earnings came despite the fact that revenue from its cell phone division was up sharply. The company shipped nearly 54 million phones. And finally, we turn to Yahoo. Net income for the online media company fell 37 percent as online advertising has slowed. In a conference call with analysts, the company's chief executive said he wasn't satisfied with the current financial performance and intended to improve it.

JOHN DIMSDALE: Now, some of this new information on delinquencies comes from the Moody's research arm, Economy. com.

MARK ZANDI: Many households, homeowners, got in thinking that the housing market would remain very strong at that these mortgages were temporary, that they'd be able to get into something more traditional and easier to manage. But now with the market turning against them and prices flat to down, it's much harder for them to do that. CHADWICK: John, these rising mortgage delinquencies, what are the numbers historically? Are they are historically high levels here? DIMSDALE: Not yet. The numbers are just getting back to average. They've been low for several years. But banking regulators are beginning to warn lenders to tighten up their standards, to stop making loans to buyers who are taking on more debt that they can handle. The bank examiners worry that the result could be a wave of foreclosures that will create a real drag on the economy.

I'm Liane Hansen. Patriotism and football are probably the two strongest unifying forces in Nebraska. American flags and University of Nebraska Cornhusker banners cover a large percentage of wall space in stores, restaurants and homes throughout the state. The Republican Party ranks close behind. President Bush carried the state with 66% of the vote in 2000. He won reelection in 2004 with 73% of the vote. The governor is a Republican. All three of the state's representatives in the U. S. House are Republicans, as is the state's senior U. S. Senator. The junior Senator, Ben Nelson, is a Democrat, but as one resident of the town of Broken Bow told us on a visit last week, he votes Republican a lot. For a Democrat, a lot of people will say he's one of the best Republicans we've got. Nelson is up for reelection this year and he's expected to win. Unidentified Woman: Good morning, gentleman. Unidentified Man: Good morning. HANSEN: You don't have to be a card carrying Republican to join the retired men who meet for coffee every morning at the Arrow Hotel in Broken Bow. Shared party affiliation is taken for granted, as are other shared life experiences. Mr. NEIL WOOD (Retired Rancher): If you look around the table here, about everybody sitting here has been in the service in World War II. HANSEN: Neil Wood is a retired rancher. Mr. WOOD: We're not too crazy about going to war again. I'm not, and I don't think anybody else in here is. HANSEN: Support for the troops in Iraq among these veterans is absolute. That support tempers all questions about the war. But with the American death toll rising, so is ambivalence. Mr. RAY BROWN (Broken Bow Resident): I'm Ray Brown. I'm never in favor of war, but if somebody hadn't done something about Hitler, why, this whole world would be different than it is right now. There's no question about that. So I think when something crops up like North Korea and Iran and all, I think something should be done about it. And the United Nations, all they're doing is just talking about it. HANSEN: And right now you're in support of what the United States is doing right now? Mr. BROWN: I am 100 percent in support of the president of the United States and what it's doing. Mr. DICK STONE (Broken Bow Resident): I'm Dick Stone. I don't know what they've accomplished. Guard our own home fronts, I mean that's to me - I don't know, I don't know what they've accomplished by going over there. HANSEN: But the reasons for going in, do you think they were justified? Mr. STONE: I have no idea what the reasons were to go over there. To try to stop that dictator, I guess. Now they got rid of him, they got another one now, so it's just a continuation of what's been going on all the time. (Soundbite of train) HANSEN: A few blocks away, coal trains whistle through town day and night carrying their loads south from strip mines in Wyoming and Montana. But the steady flow of coal and commerce does not stop in Broken Bow, where small stores in the center of town may be showing some improved signs of economic life, but making ends meet on the land gets harder every year. Trent Ish welcomed us back to Evans Feed Store and introduced us to his brother-in-law, Mike Evans, the store's co-owner. Trent works at the store and manages his grandmother's ranch. Mr. TRENT ISH (Evans Feed Store): Like right now the price of cattle - cattle are high, a lot higher than what they have been in the past. But if you take the price of cattle with your expenses, the high price of fuel, taxes - if you take your calf check at the end of the year that you sell minus your expenses, that calf price does look high but those expenses are outrageous right now, especially like the price of fuel over the summer. I have a pivot that I water my ground with and I was figuring up my fuel the other day and it was just outrageous on what it costs to water the ground to, you know, for hay and everything for your cattle. It was around 5,000 more than I usually spend more every year. HANSEN: $5,000 more? Mr. ISH: Yep. Just on fuel. HANSEN: Mike, are you hearing a lot of that too? Mr. MIKE EVANS (Co-owner, Evans Feed Store): Oh yeah. The price of steel, lumber, concrete, health insurance, everything - I've been buying and selling in this location since 1989, and I have never seen in a shorter period of time prices on everything across the board go up at the way that they're going up right now. HANSEN: Let me ask you a little bit about, you know, the folks that come in here to buy things from you. And do they come in, they talk about politics, they talk about elections? Mr. EVANS: These people that Trent and I see and all of us everyday are coming in from the country, and a lot of them have just been on the tractor for the last couple of days or doing chores or this or that, and they're ready to talk. And they have opinions on everything - politics, taxes or course, insurance - I mean they bring the whole gamut. HANSEN: They talk about the war? Mr. EVANS: Yeah. HANSEN: What do they say? Mr. EVANS: Most the people around here are Republican, you know. It's a Republican state, it's pretty conservative. But I wouldn't say - I mean they're very patriotic people around here. You don't want to speak anything against the troops at all because they're our heroes, you know. But sometimes it's hard not to question a little bit what are we going to get out of this? That's what I hear. HANSEN: Has the questioning become a little bit more vocal, say, over the last two years? Mr. EVANS: I think when the price of oil went up like it did and they're closing schools in Nebraska and building schools in Iraq, you can't help but wonder a little bit what in the world we're doing sometimes. You know, we have a lot of needs out here that aren't getting met. It seems to me that I'm not sure this country has the money to take care of the whole world. HANSEN: Thank you both. . . Mr. EVANS: Thank you. HANSEN: . . . once again for your time. Mr. ISH: You bet. Thank you. HANSEN: The story of our visit to Broken Bow was written by Stu Sidell(ph) and produced by Ned Wharten(ph).

I have a pivot that I water my ground with and I was figuring up my fuel the other day and it was just outrageous on what it costs to water the ground to, you know, for hay and everything for your cattle. It was around 5,000 more than I usually spend more every year.  HANSEN: $5,000 more?  Mr. ISH: Yep. Just on fuel.  HANSEN: Mike, are you hearing a lot of that too?  Mr. MIKE EVANS (Co-owner, Evans Feed Store): Oh yeah. The price of steel, lumber, concrete, health insurance, everything - I've been buying and selling in this location since 1989, and I have never seen in a shorter period of time prices on everything across the board go up at the way that they're going up right now.  HANSEN: Let me ask you a little bit about, you know, the folks that come in here to buy things from you. And do they come in, they talk about politics, they talk about elections?  Mr. EVANS: These people that Trent and I see and all of us everyday are coming in from the country, and a lot of them have just been on the tractor for the last couple of days or doing chores or this or that, and they're ready to talk. And they have opinions on everything - politics, taxes or course, insurance - I mean they bring the whole gamut.  HANSEN: They talk about the war?  Mr. EVANS: Yeah.  HANSEN: What do they say?  Mr. EVANS: Most the people around here are Republican, you know. It's a Republican state, it's pretty conservative. But I wouldn't say - I mean they're very patriotic people around here. You don't want to speak anything against the troops at all because they're our heroes, you know. But sometimes it's hard not to question a little bit what are we going to get out of this? That's what I hear.  HANSEN: Has the questioning become a little bit more vocal, say, over the last two years?  Mr. EVANS: I think when the price of oil went up like it did and they're closing schools in Nebraska and building schools in Iraq, you can't help but wonder a little bit what in the world we're doing sometimes. You know, we have a lot of needs out here that aren't getting met. It seems to me that I'm not sure this country has the money to take care of the whole world.  HANSEN: Thank you both. . .  Mr. EVANS: Thank you.  HANSEN: . . . once again for your time.  Mr. ISH: You bet. Thank you.

One part of the plan may include the closure of a plant that produces SUV's in Newark, Delaware. That's according to a piece in the Wall Street Journal last week. We're joined by the Mayor of Newark, he is Vance Funk. Mr. Funk welcome to DAY TO DAY. Tell me, how did you find out about the prospect of this plant closing? Mr. VANCE FUNK (Mayor of Newark, Delaware): I'm an attorney in the city and I represent probably 25 percent of the residents. And rumor's been coming by my office for probably the last nine months, that there's trouble at the plant, that they don't have enough orders, and\u2026 So we've been concerned for quite some time. And then the article last Friday in the Wall Street Journal just added fuel to the fire. CHADWICK: So Chrysler has a community liaison officer, you called him up and said what's going on? Mr. FUNK: Oh I did, within probably a half hour of reading the Wall Street Journal. Quite frankly he said that he'd love to comment but he was not permitted to comment on anything. CHADWICK: Tell me how many people work there at that SUV plant in your town? Mr. FUNK: There are approximately 2,200 that are working that plant at the present time. CHADWICK: Now those would be, I guess, from the region, but also from your town. There's 16,000 people in your town, so 2,200 jobs - that's a lot of jobs. Mr. FUNK: That's a lot of jobs and a lot of ripple effect. CHADWICK: And what do you mean by that, ripple effect? Mr. FUNK: Well, in economics they teach us that if a person makes 60,000, the actual impact on the community is more closely to the number $300,000 in lost sales to all our businesses. CHADWICK: Because that person, he'll spend his $60,000 at the cleaners, and the dry cleaner will spend it at the grocery store, and on and on it goes. Mr. FUNK: Yeah, we hope he eats a lot downtown too because we're promoting a restaurant. CHADWICK: But things have not really gone very well at this plant. They produce a vehicle called the Durango - this SUV called the Dodge Durango. Sales are not very good. And over the last six months at this plant, you've seen signs that maybe, well, tell us. Mr. FUNK: First of all, the sales on the vehicle go down. And then recently we've seen a changing of the shifts, where - like the first week of the month, day shift works day work; the second week of the month, night shift works day work; so the employees are only working fifty percent of the time now. CHADWICK: So there's a day shift and a night shift, and in fact, the night shift isn't working nights, they're working days on alternate weeks. Mr. FUNK: That's correct. CHADWICK: So are they taking a fifty percent cut in pay? Mr. FUNK: No, the union benefit plan that they have protects them in that regard. CHADWICK: You wouldn't really think that Chrysler could sustain something like that if the company's losing money anyway, for very long. I mean what kinds of solutions do you think there are? Mr. FUNK: Well I think the saving's grace is this plant and these employees have been extremely productive in the past. There error rate is among the lowest of any auto manufacturer in the United States. It's just not a wise move on their part not to bring another product in here. It just doesn't make any sense. CHADWICK: So there are good workers there, they can build any kind of car you want, and this would be a good place to build it. Mr. FUNK: That is definitely true. CHADWICK: What's your plan now Mayor Funk? Mr. FUNK: Well we have a very active Delaware Development Office, and the State of Delaware - being as small as it is - we tend to team up with the state and the county and our federal officials. The Governor has been very instrumental in bringing new industry to our state and keeping industry here. I mean, we worked as a team, and whatever the team decides to do, I'll be with them. CHADWICK: Vance Funk, Mayor of Newark, Delaware, where a plant that makes Chrysler SUV's may have to close. Mr. Funk, thank you. Mr. FUNK: Thank you. Later in the show a little good economic news for the Motor City. The World Series is bringing baseball fans and their much-needed dollars to downtown Detroit. Unidentified man: Saturday was pretty much wall-to-wall people in here, from about two in the afternoon till about two in the morning. It was honestly like walking through a rock concert for 12 hours in here. It was amazing. CHADWICK: And hey, the St. Louis Cardinals are playing in the Series too and businesses in St. Louis like it.

Two major car makers are out with earnings reports today and both are good and bad. General Motors, the world's largest automaker, reported a loss for the third quarter of about $115 million. Ouch. Though actually, that's a lot better than the $1. 7 billion it lost in the third quarter last year. And DaimlerChrysler reports better than expected overall earnings though it was dragged down by continued losses at Chrysler, it's American Division. NPR's Jack Speer reports. JACK SPEER: At a time the major U. S. car companies have been hemorrhaging cash, even the size of the losses reported today by GM and Chrysler, were something of a relief. Both lost less money in the latest quarter than expected. At Chrysler the problem is much like the problem at GM and Ford and has a lot to do with what happened to consumer choices over the last year, according to DaimlerChrysler's Frederick Lauer, who spoke at a news conference in Stuttgart this morning. Mr. FREDERICK LAUER (Daimler Chrysler): Due to higher fuel prices industry demand is shifting away from pickups, SUV's and mini-vans towards more fuel efficient passenger vehicles. SPEER: That shift, away from large pickups and sport utility vehicles, hammered the U. S. automakers. All had been doing a lot of cost-cutting, but with revenues declining, it's hard to cut costs fast enough. Peter Morici is an Economics Professor at the University of Maryland. He says U. S. carmakers were stung by higher gas prices, but it's not that simple. The U. S. automakers did respond with more fuel-efficient models, he says, it just didn't work. Mr. PETER MORICI (Professor of Economics, University of Maryland): For example, the Chevrolet Malibu is pathetic compared to Toyota's offerings. The Impala is a good vehicle but it's not just as good as the Toyotas, ditto the Ford 500 and the Ford Fusion. SPEER: And Morici says that fall off in sales means another major problem for the automakers as the '07 models begin arriving in dealer showrooms. Mr. MORICI: They normally keep sixty days inventory. Toyota, right now, has less than thirty, and the big three have around ninety days of inventory. What this means is they will be heavily discounting in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2007. What they're doing right now is postponing their big losses by counting those vehicles as sold. SPEER: Leaving many of the automakers likely to be forced to announce further production cuts on top of what's already been announced. DaimlerChrysler says it expects its U. S. division to lose around a billion dollars this year. GM, while showing that some of its cost-cutting efforts are bearing fruit, also can't yet say when it expects to return to profitability.

Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have decided once again to leave well enough alone. The Fed's key short-term interest rate remains at five and a quarter percent. Fed officials said inflation pressures have eased, although they expect growth to continue at a moderate pace. The Fed's decision comes in spite of more signs of a slowdown in the housing market. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI: It was the third straight time that said policy makers made no change in rates. In a statement released after the meeting, they said inflation pressures are still elevated, but are likely to ease. That's because energy prices have fallen so much, and because previous interest rate increases have restrained spending. Richmond Federal Reserve bank President Jeffrey Lacker dissented from the vote for the third straight time. Minutes from the last meeting suggest that Lacker is concerned that core inflation rates are still too high, and that another rate hike is needed. The Fed raised rates 17 times over a two and a half year period ending in June. The rate increases have pushed mortgage rates up, especially on adjustable rate loans, and that's already squeezed the nation's housing market.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. What a difference a housing market makes. Instead of being a booming piece of the U. S. economy, it's now a drag on growth. New figures on the nation's gross domestic product show an annual growth rate of just 1. 6 percent over the summer months. That is the lowest rate of growth in more than three years. And the slowdown was due almost entirely to the weak housing market. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI: As rough patches go, this one has come about with unusual suddenness. Earlier this year, the economy was growing at better than 5. 5 percent and Federal Reserve officials were worried about inflation pressures. Since then, interest rates have gone up, and job creation has been weak. Now, overall growth is what economists call below trend, which means it is weaker than necessary to sustain a healthy economy. Joel Naroff is president of Naroff Economic Advisers. Mr. JOEL NAROFF (Naroff Economic Advisers): Clearly, there's an economic slowdown going on. And 1. 6 is the slowest we've seen since the quarter where we had the Iraq war in 2003. ZARROLI: But Naroff noted something that a lot of economists pointed out today. Almost all of the slowdown in growth was due to the unusually weak housing market. Just yesterday, the Commerce Department said that the median price of a single family home fell in September at its fastest rate since 1970. Again, Joel Naroff. Mr. NAROFF: The simple fact is, housing bubble has burst. We had gained dramatically in 2004 and 2005 and even in early 2006 from housing, and now we're paying the price from that excessive construction that occurred. ZARROLI: Growth was also hurt by a surge in imported goods, which rose faster than exports. Bush administration officials downplayed the significance of today's numbers and predicted they would rebound when the housing market stabilized. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted that if it weren't for the home construction sector, overall growth would have been a more respectable 2. 6 or 2. 78 percent, about where growth was during the second quarter. Mr. HENRY PAULSON (Treasury Secretary, United States): I had much more concern in January when we were growing at 5. 6 percent, than I do now. I feel good about the economy looking forward. ZARROLI: Some economists echoed his view. Nigel Gault, chief U. S. economist at Global Insight, said the slowing housing market was hurting growth, but he said many other indicators looked much better. The Dow is at record highs, consumer confidence has rebounded and gasoline prices are coming down, which will give consumers more money to spend. Gault said all of that will have an impact in the months to come. Mr. NIGEL GAULT (Global Insight): To get a recession, you'd need not just residential construction to be going down, but you'd also need business investment spending to be slowing down very dramatically. That doesn't seem to be happening, and although we think there'll be some fallout from the housing market on consumer spending, we don't think it's going to be so dramatic as to pull us into recession. ZARROLI: Whatever its reasons, the slowdown is one more piece of bad news for the Republicans as they head into the midterm elections. And Democrats rush to highlight the numbers. Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed said the numbers prove that the Bush tax cuts haven't worked. Jim Zarroli, NPR News. New York.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.

Government data on sales in September showed a number of new homes sold is up for a second straight month. However, the median price was down nearly 10 percent. That's the biggest drop in more than 35 years. And there've been lots of stories lately about what will happen to the millions of people who've taken out adjustable rate mortgages or ARM's. The combination of rising interest rates and a cooling market has left many people with higher loan payments, but also unable to sell their properties for what they paid. This has led to a forecast of a collapse in housing that could bring down the entire economy. But many economists say that's unlikely. NPR's Jack Speer reports. JACK SPEER: For months now, there have been dire warnings about what will happen when the bottom falls out of the housing market. Mr. CHRISTOPHER CAGAN (Director Of Research, First American Real Estate Solutions): The rumor is that adjustable resets will overwhelm and break the real estate market. It's the great tidal wave of the century. SPEER: That's Christopher Cagan, director of research at First American Real Estate Solutions, who doesn't expect that will happen. Cagan looked at data from around 26 million home loans. He estimates will be around 750,000 real estate foreclosures over the next five years. That's a big number, but it's a small fraction of all the real estate loans out there. And as the interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages rises, people are doing pretty much what you would expect, looking at their options. Jenny Ferguson is a mortgage broker in Pleasanton, California, an hour outside of San Francisco. Ms. JENNY FERGUSON (Mortgage Broker, Pleasanton, California): We're seeing a lot of people that are coming in with ARMs, that are looking to get out of those ARMs. Or we're seeing a lot of people with home equity lines of credit that are also looking to get out of those and get in to something fixed. SPEER: She acknowledges there are plenty of people who use risky loans to buy way more house than they could afford who will wind up being forced to sell, in some cases at a substantial loss. But she doesn't sense that's what will happen in most instances. Ms. FERGUSON: The people that I have calling me are not in panic mode. A lot of them are saying: I'm going to bite the bullet, and I'm going to pay the prepayment penalty. Just get me out of this, and get me into something more stable. SPEER: There's no doubt adjustable rate mortgages are more common these days, about a third of all of the home loans taken out in the last two years were adjustable, and the percentage is much higher in cities along the East and West coasts. However, people forecasting problems for the economy - including recession because of the increased use of adjustable rate mortgage loans - are probably painting too dire a picture, according to Mike England, chief economist at Action Economics. Mr. MIKE ENGLAND (Chief Economist, Action Economics): The more alarmist descriptions that operate on the basic assumption that households are not smart. When they liberate cash, they spend it immediately. And when they commit to mortgages, they adopt a low-interest payments up front with it, which they can just barely make. And then when interest rates rise they're financially crashed, this is not the way most people behave. SPEER: And it's that rational behavior on the part of consumers, economists are counting on. As interest rates rise on adjustable rate loans, they say some mortgage holders, who opt to pay several hundred dollars more a month for the certainty of a fixed-rate loan, or refinance into another adjustable rate mortgage. But England says the thing that the majority of people won't do is turn their house keys over to the bank. Mr. ENGLAND: Most default rates on mortgages are small, single digit numbers, even throughout the cycle - though obviously it always trends up at the end of a business cycle - and is probably happening in this cycle as well. Those rates are relatively low. And the large majority of people don't find themselves in default situations with their mortgages. SPEER: According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, fewer than one percent of outstanding mortgage loans are now in foreclosure. A number that is well within historical averages, but an increase in the number of defaults is not the only way the economy could be derailed. Many economists worry about the so-called negative wealth effect - what would happen if home values dropped enough to make even wealthy people reduce their spending. Economist Chris Cagan says he sees little evidence of that yet. Overall, home equity hasn't dipped much, even though some markets are showing substantial declines in home prices.

For the last year, real estate analysts warned of the end of the housing boom, and with the bubble beginning to burst, homeowners on the coasts are feeling more-and-more deflated. If you're listening to this broadcast in a small box in an expensive high-rise, cast your eyes toward the middle of the country. In an op-ed in this Sunday's New York Times, author Richard Dooling offered up Omaha, Nebraska and a nice list of pros and cons as an option for any coastal refugees. We have a link to his op-ed at the TALK OF THE NATION page at npr. org, and we want to hear from you. Have you moved to the center of the country to avoid the shards of the housing bubble bursting? Can you get a good bagel in Nebraska? The number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Or you can send us e-mail, talk@npr. org. Richard Dooling is a screenwriter and author most recently of Bet Your Life, and he's with us from the Ware House Productions in Omaha, Nebraska, and it's nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION. Mr. RICHARD DOOLING (Screenwriter and Author, Bet Your Life): Nice to be here, Neal. Thank you. CONAN: And I understand, at least rhetorically in your op-ed, people there in Omaha are preparing for an influx of New Yorkers? Mr. DOOLING: Nothing rhetorical about it, Neal. We're preparing. We're building condominiums, and we have people training to be dog-walkers and poop-scoopers, and we're ready for them. CONAN: And is this something that people are looking forward to? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: Moving to the Midwest? CONAN: Yeah, or are Midwesterners looking forward to an influx of people from the West side? Mr. DOOLING: Well, I think we're ambivalent about it. I mean, one of the best things about living here is being able to drive around without sitting in traffic, so if we make it sound too good, then it might get crowded. CONAN: But if you jaywalk in those situations, you might get run over. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: I always jaywalk, and I've never come close to getting run over. CONAN: I wonder, there are a lot of pros and cons you offered in your op-ed to consider before cashing out and heading to flyover country. Pros, for example, you say a big yard. Mr. DOOLING: Yes. That's one of the first things you can appreciate, and again, you just put your dog outside. One of my earliest memories is seeing this -when I first went to New York City, I was probably 36 years old, and I saw this dignified, well-dressed, elderly woman on the Upper East Side, you know, picking up poop. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: I had never seen that before. I didn't know what she was doing. That doesn't go on here. We just put them outside. And the same is true of the sky. You know, you live - grow up, in a place where the buildings are always above you, and you never get to see the horizon. And out here it's everywhere all the time. CONAN: Of course, on the con side, you have big yards and big sky. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: Yes. That would be yard maintenance, which is incredibly noisy. I mean, people often in urban environments think oh, you know, I could move out to the bucolic Midwest, but one of the primary industries in suburban Omaha is lawn maintenance. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: It's very loud, with leaf-blowers and so on. And then the same thing is true of the big sky. I mean, it does make you feel small, even if you're from New York. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: You did note that there was a comparison done on CNNMoney. com that said if you were earning $229,000 a year in Manhattan, you could maintain your same standard of living at $100,000 a year in Omaha. Mr. DOOLING: Yeah. That kind of surprised me. I mean, generally speaking, things are about one-third less. But that's over half, you know. So that surprised me, too, when I did the research. CONAN: We're talking today with screenwriter and author Richard Dooling, who wrote an op-ed that appeared in this Sunday's New York Times. If you'd like to read it, there's a link to it and to all of our recent Opinion Pages at the TALK OF THE NATION page at npr. org. I'm Neal Conan, you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get some callers on the line. This is Terry. Terry's calling us from Wellesley, Massachusetts. TERRY (Caller): Hi, can you hear me? CONAN: Yes, you're on the air. Go ahead. TERRY: Hi. I just moved from Michigan to Wellesley last month, and I should tell you I sold my dream - my Barbie dream house in Michigan, and I bought less of a house for twice the price in Wellesley. And we have lowered the price to our house to less - much less than we originally purchased it for, and we're just begging for someone to buy it. So it is true that life is a lot cheaper there in many ways, but I still wouldn't trade my life in the Northeast for Michigan. It's just the economy there - I don't know about Nebraska, but much of the Midwest, if you go to the northern part - I mean, I'm sorry, but the education level for our kids, it was just terrible. The economy is terrible. My husband's job was just going down the flue, and there was nothing there for me. CONAN: Well, Richard Dooling, you said one of the attractions of eastern Nebraska is, in fact, both the economy and the schooling. Mr. DOOLING: Yes. This is the fourth in our series of economic articles that I've done about Omaha, and the first one, especially, dealt with the boom here. I mean, we've had $2 billion worth of new building since the year 2000 in Omaha, Nebraska. So there's no problem with the economy here. And then the other feature that you notice, especially if you move away as I did and lived in St. Louis for like 10 years and then moved back - people go to the public schools here. That's where you send your kids, and so you don't mind. I mean, we have - in the article that ran yesterday, we noted that the property taxes here are, you know, very high, right behind New York in fact. But people don't mind. In fact, there's a spending lid on the ballot that's about to be defeated in early November because people know that that money goes to maintain their schools. And even people like me - let's see, three out of four of my kids go to private schools, but I believe in spending that money to educate everybody, so we do have excellent schools here, and that's probably the number two reason. I mean, you ask people why do you stay here even though the taxes are so high, people say one, quality of life, and two, the school system; and then maybe three, the inconvenience of moving. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: And if Terry's right, maybe you should brace for refugees from Michigan. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Terry, thanks very much for the call. TERRY: (Unintelligible) because the state is almost empty. I should add one more thing. The one thing that brought us when we moved - when we thought of moving out of Michigan, seeing how the situation was there was we have a daughter with special needs. And my husband looked for (unintelligible) all over the country and unfortunately, the one thing that kept us from going to places like - my husband's currently working in Arizona, which is also has a big economic boom, but we couldn't (unintelligible) services that the public schools are willing to provide for children with special needs, and many of these areas are still emerging. CONAN: Okay. TERRY: So we found that unfortunately, yeah, it's expensive in Wellesley. But if you go to New York or you come to New England, what you're going to get for a special needs child, it's much more than in other parts of the country. So that's just my last comment. I'll take it off the air. CONAN: Okay, Terry. Thanks very much for the call. Good luck. Let's see if we can go to Derrick(ph), and Derrick's with us from Las Vegas. DERRICK (Caller): Hey there. Listen, I once had - I was a model agent, and I had to go to Omaha, Nebraska to judge a model contest. I'm a gay, liberal, black male from L. A. I did not want to go. When I got there, I was expecting the KKK to meet me at the airport, the whole bit. Those people were so nice. They were the friendliest people on earth. The gay community was amazingly large. They had a whole gay district. The downtown district had been redone, and one of the first times I'd ever seen a good urban-renewal project, for lack of a better term. And I told all my friends when I got back, you know what? I could live there. And it's so cool to have somebody on now, like sort of validating me, because for years, my friends - whenever the subject of Omaha comes up - they go, oh, here goes Derrick about Omaha again. (Soundbite of laughter) DERRICK: And this is just great to hear. It's a great place, and I strongly recommend to people if nothing else, go visit it. It was a really wonderful experience. CONAN: And Richard Dooling, again on your pro-and-con list, on the pro side is friendly people. And on the con side is friendly people. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: Who love to visit for hours. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: But it's interesting, Derrick - taking up Derrick's observation. One of the books I mentioned yesterday was the Quality of Life Report by Meghan Daum. And she - that was a novel, you know, written - she wrote after she moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. And the main character in that novel expected some of the same things that Derrick was expecting and was pleasantly surprised to find the farmer driving by on his tractor waving at her two lesbian friends and saying howdy. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. DOOLING: So the stereotypes don't apply, I don't think. CONAN: Derrick, thanks very much for the call. And Richard Dooling, we appreciate your time today. Thanks for being with us. Mr. DOOLING: Yes, thanks for having me. CONAN: You can read Richard Dooling's op-ed online. We have a link at the TALK OF THE NATION page at npr. org.

S. economy over the past decade. The chief executives of United Health and the New York Stock Exchange, for example, did a lot better than most - and have been in the headlines as a result. To talk about how widely American prosperity has or has not been shared, we turn to David Wessel. He's deputy Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal and regular guest here. David, good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal): Good morning. INSKEEP: So, let's start with William Mcguire of United Health, Dick Grasso of the New York Stock Exchange. The faces of CEO pay today, what do they say about the broader economy? WESSEL: Well, these men are clearly at the extremes. They made so much money. But they're real illustrations of a much broader trend. I mean, last year, the average CEO made about 370 times what the average worker did. INSKEEP: 370 times? Mr. WESSEL: Right. And in 1993, it was only 131 times. INSKEEP: A mere 131. Wasn't it even way lower than that if you went back a few decades? Mr. WESSEL: Yes, it is. INSKEEP: So if you're making 370 times the average worker, how much money is that, in the case of someone like Grasso? Mr. WESSEL: Well, Mr. Grasso is being asked to return perhaps as much as $100 million for his time at the New York Stock Exchange. And Mr. McGuire at United Health has stock options that were worth, at the end of the year, nearly $1. 8 billion. INSKEEP: Wow. So what's happening? Mr. WESSEL: Well, CEOs aren't the only ones winning. There are a group of winners in the labor market who were doing really, really well. The CEOs at one extreme, but not alone, hedge fund managers, baseball players, rock stars, are doing pretty well. And if you look at the typical wage - the median worker -the median worker in the last five or six years has barely kept up with inflation. In fact, if you look just at wages - not at health benefits and other compensation - the average wages of college graduates are actually not keeping up with inflation. Only those with graduate degrees like MBAs or doctorates or law degrees or medical degrees have managed to, on average, do better than inflation. INSKEEP: So you have a few people in the stratosphere. The median worker, the person in the middle, is just treading water, doing okay, not getting any worse. Who's really losing here? Mr. WESSEL: The real loser is somebody who didn't finish high school, can't read and write very well, and is forced to compete with a lot of other workers in that category. Some of them, maybe immigrants - legal or illegal - some of them, maybe factory workers who've fallen out of the middle-class. But there's a big pool, a big supply of workers, who don't have the skills that are now required to get a middle-class wage in our economy. INSKEEP: Are immigrants to blame here at all? Mr. WESSEL: I don't think immigrants are to blame, per se. I think what's - it's hard to say exactly what's causing this. I think both globalization and technology, broadly defined, have something to do with this. If you're a low-skilled worker in America, you may be competing with an immigrant. You may be competing with an import that's made by foreign workers. You may be competing with someone who's employed by an American company in some place like India or China. Or you may, in fact, have a job that's about to be automated out of existence. And all these things have reduced the demand for your labor. And as we know, when demand goes down, so do wages. INSKEEP: Everything you just mentioned is something that has been a political issue or maybe a political issue in this fall's elections, which leads to the question of whether these trends began with the office of President Bush. Mr. WESSEL: The trends did not begin with the arrival of President Bush. A lot of the stuff began in the late \u201870s or early \u201880s. Some of it has intensified recently. The political issue is not about when did this start. The political issue is, what is the appropriate response of government? Should government actively try and resist this trend towards inequality or should it look at it as the price we pay for a prosperous society where we can do better than other countries? INSKEEP: Well? Mr. WESSEL: Well, the voters will decide in November. INSKEEP: Okay. David Wessel, Deputy Washington Bureau Chief of The Wall Street Journal. Thanks very much. Mr. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: And you can read David's Wall Street Journal column on income disparity by going to a link at NPR. org.

Examining some economic figures that are just out and are promising - and are pessimistic. Steve Tripoli from MARKETPLACE joins us now. Steve, you remember the old game show, Who Do You Trust. STEVE TRIPOLI: That's right, Alex, and you know, I think in this case you trust everyone, but you've got to take it all in sort of - as a whole. We learned this morning that American workers' productivity didn't rise at all over the summer quarter. That's one figure. The Labor Department also went back and revised second-quarter productivity figures down. That seems to be at odds with what we discussed right here, yesterday in this spot, that wages and benefits rose in the third quarter. We also learned today that retailers missed their October sales targets, that factory orders were up, but mostly for things like airplanes and not what most people buy. Those two figures seem at odds with this morning's report that layoffs at U. S. companies fell by a lot in October, so the job market is still strong. CHADWICK: Well, that's quite a funny stew. How does it taste to the economists? TRIPOLI: They're saying it's not that uncommon a mix, but what it does mark is a period of economic transition. Take those wage gains, paired with flat productivity, for instance - worker productivity's been booming for years, but wages weren't keeping pace, so there's a little catching-up going on there. But the bigger message is in that mix of messages itself. You usually can't keep having this combination of economic indicators for long. The economy usually breaks one way or the other. CHADWICK: So give us the good news and the bad news in terms of scenarios, OK? TRIPOLI: Well, the best case is the one most economists believe right now is the way things will turn out. We'll get what they call a breather, a slowdown that doesn't lead to a big economic turndown. Don't forget, growth is just slow now, it's not stalled or negative. But if the slowdown deepens - and the worry is that the housing drop-off and other factors might keep consumption down - we could get a recession. And if you really want to get scary, you could get negative growth, even as inflation takes hold. But I think the Federal Reserve will probably be on the lookout for that, even if it means administering a little pain preemptively. CHADWICK: So if you're on your way to work, or maybe you're at work, or you're thinking about how much am I going to budget for Christmas this year, what does all this mean? TRIPOLI: Well, for an economy in transition, Ken Mayland at ClearView Economics in Ohio offers this prescription. Mr. KEN MAYLAND (ClearView Economics): It's time to get a little more cautious. This would be a good time for families to maybe allocate a little more to the investment account as opposed to the Target charge account. TRIPOLI: Now that may not feel right when one of the up indicators is that workers are finally seeing a little more pay. But you know, if we or even the economists knew for sure where the economy's heading, Alex, we wouldn't be having this conversation. So prudence isn't the worst strategy at times like these. Anyway, Alex, an appropriate follow-up to all these up-and-down numbers comes later today on MARKETPLACE. We'll examine the ups and downs of one of America's fastest-growing sports, which is professional bull riding.

And today we'll find out why you won't have to spend quite as much money on a car. This fall should be a very good time to buy a car or truck, because domestic automakers can't get rid of them no matter what they do. Employee pricing, low interest loans, special add-ons for free; dealers are likely to consider these options and more, as they cut deals on Fords, Chryslers and GM vehicles, because they have too much inventory. Monica Langley follows the auto industry as a senior writer for the Wall Street Journal and she's on the line. Welcome to the program once again. Ms. MONICA LANGLEY (Wall Street Journal): Good morning. How are you, Steve? INSKEEP: Doing fine. Thanks so much. Just how big is the inventory problem here? Ms. LANGLEY: It's big. The Detroit automakers made way too many cars for the number of customers wanting to buy them. So they are now having to cut production and expand incentives to clear the dealer lot. The biggest one right now is Chrysler. Chrysler has admitted that earlier this year it overbuilt so much that this summer they had 100,000 unsold vehicles sitting in parking lots. So just this week Chrysler came out and said they are going to broaden their incentives because they have got to move those cars. INSKEEP: Hundred thousand vehicles. So you could give an entire small city, just everybody it's own vehicle, just hand them off, and you'd still have. . . Ms. LANGLEY: And then you could look to sell the 2007 model. This is the problem. Chrysler lots and showrooms now have - 50 percent of their inventory is 2006. And at this time of year you should only have 20 to 30 percent of your inventory 2006 and be ready to start selling the 2007. That brings in the excitement for the consumer. INSKEEP: So how serious a financial problem is this for the automakers? Ms. LANGLEY: I mean it's a problem. GM is saying that it is turning around, but what they're doing is they're really having to cut production; they're negotiating to try to get the unions to give concessions. But you know, where they're looking for the new growth is not in the U. S. ; I mean all three Detroit automakers are still bleeding red in North America. So for example, GM is looking to China as its biggest growth, and it's one of the leading sellers of cars in China. INSKEEP: Now, what about the foreign automakers? Do they also have this inventory problem? Ms. LANGLEY: No, they don't. Toyota and Honda are zipping along. Nissan is too. Nissan is introducing a new Altima, one of its bestselling sedans, and this new Versa, a compact car. And they have a seven day inventory on Versa, as opposed to some of the U. S. automakers having inventory of, you know, 100 days or something. INSKEEP: Now, could this huge inventory problem actually have a drag on the U. S. economy? Ms. LANGLEY: Well, clearly it could. I mean what is affecting the auto industry so much right now is the slowdown in housing. Automakers have found that their inventory moves more slowly when you see the construction and housing industry have a slowdown. So they worry now that consumers will hang on to their old vehicles longer and businesses will defer orders for their new trucks and pickup trucks. So some of the regions in the U. S. will not do well because they're having to cut production. You especially see this in the upper Midwest - Michigan, Ohio, Indiana. They are definitely going to feel the pain from the Detroit cutbacks. INSKEEP: You know, I saw a chart in a newspaper that competes with the Wall Street Journal to some degree, national. . . Ms. LANGLEY: How dare you. . . INSKEEP: USA Today - I was reading. They had this chart in there and it was the average age of the American vehicle fleet and it was going up. It had gone up substantially over the last several years. It's just what you're saying. People are hanging onto their cars longer. Ms. LANGLEY: And you know what another thing is: they are holding onto their cars for maybe economic reasons, but consumers are also holding onto their cars because nothing has really excited them to get into the showroom.

That could mean a much tougher environment for industries such as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, financial services and defense. But for now, both Democrats and business leaders are promising to work together, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI: Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank is expected to chair the House Financial Services Committee, and Frank wants to use the post to highlight issues like wage inequity. Representative BARNEY FRANK (Democrat, Massachusetts) How do you promote economic growth or have policies that are supportive of economic growth but deal with this increasing inequality? Because I think you're going to find, you're already finding, that the average worker's sense of disengagement from the overall economy already has some negative consequences. ZARROLI: But Frank says he thinks Democrats should strike a kind of grand bargain with business groups. If they'll support issues like union rights and affordable housing programs, Democrats will be cooperative. Representative FRANK: I'd like to be for more trade, I'd like to be supportive of the ease of foreign investment, both to and from the U. S. and even outsourcing in appropriate cases. ZARROLI: It's a safe bet that most major business groups prefer a Republican Congress, but they're doing a best to adjust to the new realities. Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers noted hopefully yesterday that the presumed House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is one of the smartest and savviest members of Congress. Mr. JAY TIMMONS (National Association of Manufacturers): As she looks at the new majority, obviously she and the party officials are going to want to be able to govern for more than just two years. So how are they going to accomplish that? I believe they're going to try to reach across and extend an olive branch to non-traditional allies. ZARROLI: In other words, he says, maybe Democrats and business groups will be able to find common ground on some issues. This spirit of conciliation was tested yesterday. Michigan Congressman John Dingell suggested he wants government regulators to scrutinize the merger of AT&T and Bell South more carefully. That sent telecommunications stocks down. But for the most part, Democrats have tried their best to send reassuring signals. While Democrats have proposed some popular ideas like raising the minimum wage, they haven't yet set much of an economic agenda. New York Congressman Charlie Rangel, who's likely to head the Ways and Means Committee, won't even commit to eliminating the Bush tax cuts, which are deeply unpopular with many Democrats. Representative CHARLIE RANGEL (Democrat, New York): I'm 76 years old, and I don't buy green bananas, and I think that what the economy looks like in 2010 will determine what the Ways and Means Committee will be doing in the area of taxes. ZARROLI: Rangel spoke on NPR's NEWS & NOTES yesterday. Former Republican Congressman Steve Bartlett, who heads the Financial Services Roundtable, says he's worked with Democrats such as Barney Frank before and can do so again. Mr. STEVE BARTLETT (Financial Services Roundtable): There's no doubt we'll have our share of both agreements and disagreements, but I think many in the Democratic leadership are people that are focused on some of the same issues that we are. ZARROLI: Issues like predatory lending and the Sarbanes-Oxley Bill, which imposed a lot of new financial reporting regulations that many businesses find onerous.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. A growing number of Americans are getting together to work to end the U. S. embargo against Cuba. It's been in place for almost 45 years. Some farmers, especially those who grow rice and beans, see Cuba as one of the world's most promising new markets. Today in the first part of a series, NPR's Adam Davidson visits a North Dakota bean farmer who believes opening trade with Cuba could change his life. (Soundbite of combine) ADAM DAVIDSON: At the height of the bean harvest, Allen Juliason is driving his massive combine through more than 400 acres of great northern beans. Mr. ALLEN JULIASON (Bean Farmer): This is best time of the year. This is the time that you live for. DAVIDSON: Juliason's farm is in Hope, North Dakota, a town of 300. We're high up in the cab. Below us, the combine picks the beans, shakes them, separates the chaff, and shoots a massive constant waterfall of beans into a large hopper just behind us. Mr. JULIASON: You start it all in April planting the crop and you spend May, June, and July nursing it a long, feeding it fertilizer and taking care of the weeds and cultivating it. Now this is finally the results of your efforts, the best time of the year. DAVIDSON: Juliason says this year's crop is good. And a good harvest, he explains, benefits the whole county. Farmers go out to eat more, they buy pick up trucks and other things. Pintos are going for 17 cents a pound. But if he could easily sell to Cuba, Juliason says, the price would go up more than a few cents. Mr. JULIASON: Without a question, I think you will get to see a nickel, five, six cents, and yeah, that translates back to some money in my pocket. That's important. That market is worth pursuing and we got to knock down these trade barriers to get to that market. DAVIDSON: If a nickel or six cents sounds like nothing, take a look at the economics of beans. Juliason, like most farmers, can tell you how expensive it is to grow them. Mr. JULIASON: Labor per acre, I figure $7 an acre. You've got seed that's around $30, $35 an acre. Fertilizer, around $30, $35 an acre. DAVIDSON: There's the mortgage on the land he owns, rent on the land he doesn't. He spends hundreds of thousands on diesel to power his expensive equipment. It comes out to around $240 per acre. And this year, Juliason will make about $320 an acre. That's just $80 profit on each of 1200 acres. But open up trade with Cuba, get that extra nickel a pound, and suddenly, Juliason says, he'll make $400 an acre. His profits would double. After a couple of years like that, he says, he could retire early. He could take his wife to Mexico during the harsh North Dakota winter. Juliason's son Lucas is in a combine on the other end of the field. He hit a rock and wants advice in fixing the rotor. Both of Juliason's sons work with him. They're young, 22 and 28, and don't know much about the Cuban embargo. They just want to farm. Mr. JULIASON: Oh, it's great having them out in the field. I don't think there is any better feeling than having both of your sons working by your side every day of the week, and I hope they can continue. We get that business in Cuba and then they can continue. DAVIDSON: A lot of people in North Dakota support free trade with Cuba. The governor and agriculture secretary have visited the place. On one trip, Juliason and some state bigwigs had a long late night dinner with Fidel Castro, laughing over cigars and baseball stories until 3:00 in the morning. The U. S. does export some beans to Cuba, but the rules are so strict that so far it's only a small trickle. John Bertolt is a Cuba trade skeptic. He's the marketing director of Walhalla Bean Company in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Walhalla buys beans from farmers like Juliason. During harvest, about 20 semis a day show up carrying 50,000 pounds of beans each. They dump them on a conveyor belt, which carries the beans up a steep hill. Mr. JOHN BERTOLT (Walhalla Bean Company): When we're done with this, it will be approximately 1. 2 million pounds in this stem and we're full. DAVIDSON: Well, it's a hill of beans. Mr. BERTOLT: There's a mountain of beans. DAVIDSON: Bertolt is the guy who actually travels the world selling these beans. And he says it's just not worth his while to think too much about Cuba. He thinks the best way to increase bean sales is to convince more Americans to eat them. U. S. beans, he says, are the best in the world. But they cost more than Chinese beans. So he prefers markets with the money that's spent on a higher quality product. And Cuba, he says, is most definitely not it. Mr. BERTOLT: I guess in Italy, I know from the several times that I've traveled there, they seem to have a little more affluent lifestyle than what I've seen in the video of Cuba, so I think Cuba's the wrong place to go. So -DAVIDSON: Bertolt isn't against trade with Cuba. He just doesn't think it'll have the dramatic impact that Juliason envisions. Agriculture economists who study the issue say they're not sure exactly what would happen. Cubans do import lots of beans now, from Brazil and China mostly. It's not clear how much of that market U. S. growers could take. In fact, one economist says the only way to find out how Cuba trade will help farmers is to see what happens when the trade embargo is lifted. Adam Davidson, NPR News. BLOCK: Tomorrow, our series continues from Miami, where reports that Castro may be on his deathbed have led to lots of speculation about Cuba's future.

They're just too many of those traditional hub and spoke carriers in this country. And airlines that are in bankruptcy protection are popular targets because they have more flexibility to revise things like labor contracts and relationships with vendors. In fact, America West, itself, acquired US Air, after it emerged from bankruptcy last year. And US Airways says by merging with Delta the two airlines could save more than one and a half billion dollars a year. But Richard Aboulafia isn't so sure. He's an airline analyst with the Teal Group and he says these are two airlines with vastly different cultures, different labor structures and different airplanes. Delta flies mostly Boeing aircraft, US Airways prefers Airbus. Mr. RICHARD ABOULAFIA (Airline Analyst, Teal Group): One of the great infractions of a merger is getting as much commonality as possible in terms of maintenance, in terms of buying practices, and in terms of pilot training. When you have a very heterogeneous fleet like the one that would emerge as a result of this merger, it would be very difficult to obtain those cost savings. SCOTT: There are also anti-trust considerations. The combined airline, which by the way would go by the name Delta would be the largest carrier in 155 cities. So, the justice department would definitely be taking a look at potential problems there. CHADWICK: It seems like a lot of obstacles to overcome for this deal to go through. SCOTT: Well as you've said, you know this is a hostile take-over bid. Which means that US Airways has gone straight to Delta's shareholders, which in this case are the airlines creditors. They would get $4 billion in cash and about 78 million shares of US Airways stock, and given the success of that merger with America West last year, analysts say creditors may be seduced. CHADWICK: And what will all this mean for passengers, Amy? SCOTT: Well again that deal I mentioned with America West has been pretty good for customers by most accounts. The airline says it's lowered its leisure airfares by an average 24 percent since then, and if you have frequent flyer miles on either of the airlines, you would get to merge them. The downside, of course, would be that customers would have even fewer choices when they travel. And we'll have more on this story later today on MARKETPLACE. CHADWICK: Thank you, Amy.

ALEX CHADWICK, host: I'm Alex Chadwick. Good news in Puerto Rico where Microsoft is expanding its manufacturing plant. That's where it's going to produce the CDs and DVDs with its new Vista Operating System. And for Office 2000 set for release in January. BRAND: That's 150 new jobs on the island territory. But as NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, Puerto Rico needs a lot more than that. MANDALIT DEL BARCO: The salsa music blaring from a portable stereo onto the factory floor isn't the only thing that distinguishes Microsoft's Puerto Rico plant. The new three story building features state of the art machines that are manufacturing the company's newest CDs and DVDs for sale throughout the Americas. Unidentified Man: Actually, this equipment is the only one in the Caribbean; it's a brand new technology for Microsoft and for Puerto Rico. DEL BARCO: Facilities manager Jose Negrone(ph) tours a high-tech factory in Humacao, an industrial city on the east coast of the island. Mr. JOSE NEGRONE (Microsoft facilities manager): This is the master; this is where it all begins. DEL BARCO: Inside a glass enclosed lab workers wear white coats and goggles to operate machines that laser etch computer codes onto glass discs. Mr. NEGRONE: This is glass, okay? DEL BARCO: Negrone moves to another room where the discs are plated with nickel, then to a third where high speed machines churn out plastic copies. Mr. NEGRONE: It's making DVDs right at the moment. It's going at 2. 4 seconds, so every 2. 4 seconds we are doing one DVD per line. DEL BARCO: General Manager Rodolfo Acevedo says the company is investing $65 million to expand here in Humacao, creating 150 new jobs. Puerto Rico offers the company local tax breaks including some for foreign investors even though the island is a U. S. territory. Mr. RODOLFO ACEVEDO (General Manager, Microsoft Operation Puerto Rico): There is a strong commitment from the company to remain in Puerto Rico for a long time. DEL BARCO: On the outside of the building is a sign that says (Spanish spoken), a new dawn. It's also a new beginning for workers like 35-year-old Delilah Vasquez(ph), a machine operator. Ms. DELILAH VASQUEZ (Machine operator): (Through interpreter) Thank god we found ourselves in a company that's growing with good employee benefits. DEL BARCO: After getting laid off at other U. S. factories that left Humacao, Vasquez now earns twelve dollars an hour with full medical benefits, a rarity in Puerto Rico where the per capita income is about half of what it is in Mississippi, in the mainland's poorest state. Thirty-two year old machine operator Augustino Rodriguez(ph) says he also feels fortunate to be working here. Mr. AUGUSTINO RODRIGUEZ (Machine operator): (Through interpreter) Other companies are leaving Puerto Rico, but Microsoft is one of the most solid companies here on the island. DEL BARCO: As welcome as Microsoft is in Humacao, no one thinks the small expansion will go far in solving the economic problems of Puerto Rico where the unemployment rate is fifteen percent, triple the rate in the rest of the United States. Many other multinational companies have moved their manufacturing plants to places like the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and China where labor is cheaper. The exodus is in sharp contrast to the heady decades right after World War II, when hundreds of U. S. companies took advantage of federal tax breaks to build sprawling factories on the island. Factories producing medical devices, pharmaceuticals, everything from pacemakers to Viagra. Miguel Soto-Class heads the Center for the New Economy, a non-partisan research group in San Juan. Mr. MIGUEL SOTO-CLASS (Center for the New Economy): During the '50s and '60s and part of the '70s we were considered an economic miracle. We had huge growth rates and there was a lot of industrialization in Puerto Rico. DEL BARCO: But, the miracle didn't touch everyone. Soto-Class notes that the big companies moved to Puerto Rico to take advantage of tax incentives but they didn't bring enough of the kinds of jobs needed to put less skilled Puerto Ricans to work. Mr. SOTO-CLASS: They were not creating enough jobs here. I mean we cared too much about the multinational corporations to the detriment of local capital and local entrepreneurs. DEL BARCO: In the mid 1990s U. S. lawmakers from Rust Belt states began questioning all those tax breaks for Puerto Rico and Congress decided to phase them out over 10 years. The island was slow to phase in something new. Mr. SOTO-CLASS: We've lost about 50,000 manufacturing jobs in the last about six years. They would manufacture for example shoes or clothes here and that just is not viable anymore. DEL BARCO: A new book by Soto-Class, an economist at the Brookings Institution, suggests ways the island can restore its economy by encouraging local businesses, deflating the bloated government and moving people from welfare to work. Mr. SOTO-CLASS: The economy is a glass half full. We have all the institutions necessary to restore growth. And certainly we have a lot of challenges. DEL BARCO: Some of those challenges can be seen in the city of Humacao, population sixty thousand. Mayor Marcelo Trujillo Parise(ph) says factory closings in his city have led many to migrate. The latest census shows there are fewer Puerto Ricans living on the island than on the mainland. Mayor MARCELO TRUJILLO (Humacao, Puerto Rico): If they don't have work around, they mostly stay for six months, they came back to take the unemployment. DEL BARCO: They've been going to the United States and coming back to get welfare? Mayor TRUJILLO: Right. DEL BARCO: Trujillo says discouraged workers found they could live reasonably well in Puerto Rico on food stamps, disability payments, and other federal welfare programs. That's why he says he's grateful companies like Microsoft are choosing to provide much needed jobs in his city. Mayor TRUJILLO: I prefer the people work instead of receiving food stamps. DEL BARCO: The unemployment office here in downtown Humacao is filled with people who have been laid off from their factory jobs. Like Erminda Bonija(ph) and her husband Hector Vega(ph). They used to work at General Electric just across the street from Microsoft. Ms. ERMINDA BONIJA: They gave lay off about sixty people. People that have family, that have children, they have their debts and all that stuff. DEL BARCO: Bonija says finding work in Puerto Rico is tough these days for those who are not so highly skilled in science or technology. Ms. BONIJA: Where? Where's the work? Mr. HECTOR VEGA: (Spanish spoken) DEL BARCO: It seems impossible, says Vega. A lot of factories are closing and others are opening but there isn't enough work for all who need it. As they stand in the unemployment line, Bonija and Vega quote the lyrics of a salsa reggaeton song that sums up their hopes of finding new jobs. Mr. VEGA: (Spanish spoken) Ms. BONIJA: (Singing in Spanish) DEL BARCO: If you'll just leave, she sings, I'll take your place. Mandalit del Barco, NPR News. SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC BRAND: Puerto Rico's economy may also benefit from coming changes in U. S. travel policies. These are changes that have many Caribbean nations worried. Beginning in early January U. S. travelers returning from the region will need to show a passport when they come home. CHADWICK: Up till now, coming back from the Caribbean you only had to show an ID, like a driver's license. Countries like Jamaica and Bermuda say these new requirements are going to hurt their tourist industries, maybe devastate them. Mostly, because only about one quarter of Americans actually hold passports now. BRAND: Well, because Puerto Rico is a U. S. territory, travelers don't need to bring their passports and that's become something to market for the Puerto Rican tourist industry.

I'm Michele Norris. Holiday shoppers can be forgiven if they feel like they need a nap about now. Stores across the country opened earlier than ever this morning for the post-Thanksgiving sales. But as NPR's Robert Smith reports, such promotional gimmicks have their limits. ROBERT SMITH: So much for beating the crowds. At 4:30 this morning outside a Best Buy store in Brooklyn, it already looked like a riot had swept through the parking lot. (Soundbite of siren) SMITH: Yellow police tape was strung everywhere. Discarded trash and umbrellas and lawn chairs littered the sidewalk. And hundreds of people, still lined up around the block, looked miserable. Mr. MOE HITTERY(ph): Cold, hungry, waiting to go the bathroom\u2026 Mr. JACK SOPHEY(ph): And frostbite. A little frostbite in the toes. Mr. HITTERY: Yeah on our toes. SMITH: And Moe Hittery and Jack Sophey are the lucky ones. They're 20th in line from the door. Unidentified Man #1: I got here at six. Right after I had Thanksgiving dinner with my family. SMITH: Somebody else took the dishes and you come and wait in line? Unidentified Man #1: Yes. I came to wait for a laptop, a desktop, digital video camera, and a mini-DVD player. SMITH: That is if Best Buy doesn't run out first. For instance, they guarantee only 18 of those laptops at the $250 price. When the store opens at 5, the line surges forward and New York City police officers pull out the bullhorns. Unidentified Man #2: Everybody stay on the crosswalk, move away from the line. Can you speak English? Everybody away from the line. SMITH: Aw, that's the holiday spirit, at least as practiced on Black Friday. The term is supposed to refer to the way the day's sales can move a retailer's books into the black. But black might as well refer to the mood of the shoppers waiting in line or to the color of the early morning sky when the doors open. And this year, some outlet malls experimented with opening at midnight. Others, like Kmart and CompUSA were doing business on Thanksgiving evening. Britt Beemer, who runs the retail consulting firm America's Research Group, says that opening early doesn't necessarily draw more people. Mr. BRITT BEEMER (America's Research Group): I mean I don't think consumers get excited about going to a store unless there's a real reason. Now, if you've got $999 42-inch HDTV - like Wal-Mart does - if you'd opened up at 8:00 on Thursday morning you'd see the crowd then, too. SMITH: Beemer's research team did notice an increased volume of shoppers this morning, but not for the reason you might think. Mr. BEEMER: We had probably three times more men shopping with their wives for early bird specials this year compared to a year ago. And it's being driven much by the fears of all the violence by the PlayStation 3, which caused a lot of husbands to say they would not let their wives shop alone today. SMITH: At the early morning opening of Toys \"R\" Us in Times Square, there were plenty of men as well as women lining up for a shot at the newest Tickle Me Elmo doll. (Soundbite of Tickle Me Elmo) SMITH: The president of Toys \"R\" Us, Ron Boire, watched the scramble from the third-floor balcony of the store. He says that opening at 5:00 a. m. is worth it for a retailer, but not because of sales volume. Mr. RON BOIRE (President of Toys \"R\" Us): There's a financial importance because it's a huge day, but I think more importantly there's an emotional importance to Black Friday where people kind of wake up and go all right, Christmas is coming and it's time to go out and see what's out there. SMITH: We've seen the stores opening earlier and earlier on Black Friday, where does it end? Is there a limit to how early you can open the store and start the shopping season? Mr. BOIRE: I actually think there is. I'm not a fan of midnight openings. I don't think it's good for our employees. I think we want to give our employees time to get home and get some rest from Thanksgiving and start the day at a reasonable hour, if you can call 5 a. m. reasonable. SMITH: Well, that depends on what's for sale. Back in Brooklyn, Mike and his friend Deb emerge from the Best Buy store in a foul mood. MIKE: No laptops. DEB: No laptops. MIKE: None. It isn't worth it. DEB: A waste of time. SMITH: They'd been in line since 11:00 the night before and all they ended up spending was 20 bucks on a stack of blank CDs. DEB: I could have been at home buying stuff on line. MIKE: Sleeping. Having a lot more better things to do then sit in line getting pushed around. SMITH: But even as they warn the rest of the line that the good stuff was gone, nobody seemed willing to give up their spot. As one guy told me he had to come home with something to justify standing out in the cold. Robert Smith, NPR News, New York.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. iPod's, Xbox's, Razr's, BlackBerries - in some respects, today's abundance of gadgets and access to information means that young people are richer than ever before. But that wealth comes at a cost. With wages stagnant and the cost of housing and education way up, many 20- or 30-somethings are piling on the debt. Roughly two-thirds of young people have some form of debt, mostly student loans and credit cards. The extra financial burden makes it harder for young people to pursue additional education, to buy a house, to start a family, or to save for retirement. And boomers beware, this affects you too. Your debt-ridden 25-year-olds might want their old bedrooms back. Later in the program, a Christmas fable from Kinky Friedman, the curly-haired Jewish guy who didn't win the governor's race in Texas. But first, generation IOU. If you fall into the 18 to 34 age bracket, are you taking on more debt? How did it pile on? Does it worry you? If you're a parent with a child in debt, are you baring the brunt of the cost? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. And our e-mail address is talk@npr. org. We begin with Tamara Draut who's the author of book \"Strapped: Why 20- and 30-Something's Can't Get Ahead,\" and she joins us today from Splash Studios in New York City. Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION. Ms. TAMARA DRAUT (Author, \"Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Something's Can't Get Ahead\"): Hi, good to be with you. CONAN: And what makes it - every generation seems to say that, you know, we've never had it so hard as before. What makes this generation different? Ms. DRAUT: Well, I think a couple of things. One is just the amount of debt needed to get a college education today. In the last 10 years, the amount of the average student loan debt has grown from about $12,000 to - today the average being a little over $19,000 is what a college graduate can expect to leave the campus gates with. And just to put that into perspective, that's about a $220 monthly payment over the next 10 years of that person's life. And what we know is that the earnings, the typical earnings for somebody with a college degree, adjusted for inflation, have not grown to meet that payment, nor to meet the rising cost of things like housing and healthcare. CONAN: And a lot of a people say, well, you know, I had to work through school, too. Big deal. Ms. DRAUT: Well, students are working through school and they're still having to take on enormous debt in order to pay for college. In fact, the overwhelming majority of students work, and half of them are now working - half of full-time college students are working more than 25 hours a week, which is one of the reasons why it now takes about six years to get a bachelor's degree. But between working, working during school, working during summers, you know, a generation ago, you could work a full-time job during the summer and be set in terms of being able to pay for a year of college. That's just not the case today. It's a totally different ballgame. CONAN: Now there is a profile of - I call them young people - kids who are in very serious trouble, who've really - would you tell us about some of the worst cases? Ms. DRAUT: Well, you know, I think there's certainly always worst cases. You hear about people who have hundreds and thousands of dollars in student loan debt, mostly for graduate degrees, which, when you get to the graduate level, this generation faces a lot more pressure to sort of keep going up the credential ladder. But the problem is it doesn't always pay off. And let me give you an example. I talked to a social worker, which now it is mandatory to get a master's degree, but that person has taken on an inordinate amount of debt, around $60,000, for a career that is just not going to command a big salary and provide that person with the ability to get ahead and pay off the investment needed to move up in that career. And that's happening across the board, whether it's young people going on to get MBAs, which have become pretty standard for getting ahead in any business-related endeavor. And then we now know that college - or I'm sorry - law school grads are leaving with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. CONAN: Hundreds of thousands of dollars in new debt. That's - you know, obviously that affects you for years if not, as you're suggesting, a decade or more. Ms. DRAUT: Absolutely, and it affects - the effects can be rather immediate. One is that the rise of student loan debt often now begets more debt. Because what happens is, let's say you just leave college, you - either - whether you're living with your mom and dad again, after - with your first job, after you pay the student loan bill of $220 a month, any car payment you have, any utilities you have, there's not going to be a lot left over. And so what find is that there's a lot credit card debt that happens during the 25 to 34-year-old age group as well, because the car breaks down, they need to go to the doctor. Those kinds of things get put on credit cards because they're just no wiggle room, especially now that you have that $220 student loan payment. CONAN: We're talking today about generation IOU. If you'd like to join the conversation, our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And the e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And let's talk with Jennifer, Jennifer on the line with us from Tucson, Arizona. JENNIFER (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. JENNIFER: I was noticing - I'm 27 years old, and my husband and I graduated with bachelor's degrees in May. And I realized just as you were speaking about this that I have $35,000 in student loan debt. And I noticed that, you know, thinking about it, if I had $35,000 in credit card debt, I'd want to crawl under a rock and die. CONAN: Mm-hmm. JENNIFER: But for some reason the student loan debt doesn't seem to affect me that much. And I'm wondering if there's a different mindset as far as student loan debt is. CONAN: Tamara? Ms. DRAUT: Well, that's a really interesting question. Well, one, student loans debt is cheaper debt. A credit card debt is going to, you know, cost you around probably anywhere from 15 percent APR to 29 percent APR, where a student loan debt - at least federal student loans - are going to max out at around eight percent interest rate. But I will tell you that surveys done of people who are in the process of paying back their student loans, after they've been paying back the student loans for about - for several years, three, four years, they actually say that it's more burdensome - more of a burden to them at that point than it was when they first started making those payments. And I think what happens is fatigue sets in, you know, and it's sort of like buying a new car. You know, as soon as the new-car smell wears off, so does the joy of kind of owning and paying for the car, and the same goes with student loans. The further and further you get away from actually having that sort of sheepskin in hand and celebrating that you accomplished getting a college degree, you know, you're on year three of 10 years of student loan payments, and it starts to become less and less apparent and feels more burdensome to still be paying down this debt. CONAN: Nevertheless, Jennifer, congratulations on both you and your husband getting ready to graduate. JENNIFER: Well, thank you. I'm looking forward to it. CONAN: All right. Good luck getting work, too. JENNIFER: Thanks. CONAN: Bye-bye. If you're a recent college grad, still haven't landed that first real job and have thousands of dollars in debt, what do you do? To help answer that question, we turn to Liz Pulliam Weston. She writes a column twice a week for MSN Money, and she joins us today from our studios at NPR West in Culver City, California. Liz, nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION. Ms. LIZ PULLIAM WESTON (Columnist, MSN Money): Great to be here, Neal. CONAN: And I was wondering just the reaction to what you're hearing Tamara Draut talking about, and that last caller, particularly, the distinction between that loan debt and credit card debt. Ms. WESTON: Well, student loan is actually an investment in your future. And as long as you don't overdose and take on too much of it, it's actually a very good move. The other thing, as Tamara pointed out, it's very cheap debt and most people can deduct the interest. So I wouldn't be in any hurry, frankly, to pay off my student loans unless, as I said, you really overdid it and you're looking at six-figure debts and a five-figure income. CONAN: Is there any way out of those debts? Ms. WESTON: Basically, the answer is no. I mean death and total physical disability are two of the ways that you can get out. The student lenders in Congress have made it very, very difficult to wiggle out from your debts. It's very different from the '80s, when I think about 20 percent of people simply walked away from their student loan debts. Now they follow you for life. The Department of Education has enormous powers to collect, to garnish your wages to get their money back, and you can't discharge student loans typically in bankruptcy court. So this is an albatross you could carry for the rest of your life. CONAN: And I want to bring Tamara in on this as well, but aren't you sort of caught if, like a typical person, you have your credit card debt and your student loan debt. I mean that's the Scylla and Charybdis of modern finance for 20-somethings isn't it? Ms. DRAUT: Well it is, and I want to underscore and point that student loan debt is an investment. That being said, we know that we have real affordability issues, and not only is it problematic that we have someone who's 27 taking out $35,000 in student loans to get a bachelor's degree, but behind that person is a lot of really smart kids from low-income backgrounds that can't afford to go to college and are afraid to take on that debt as a first generation college student. And we know that every year we're losing about half million really bright kids who can't get together enough cash/grant aid or even loan aid to complete their education. CONAN: All right. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line, and this is Tim. Tim is with us from Grand Rapids in Michigan. TIM (Caller): Hi. How is it going? CONAN: Good. TIM: I'm a 26-year-old male and I've got a house and it seems like the new American dream is to be debt free, not necessarily to own a home, because getting a home is easy but becoming debt free is hard. I went to - got a job right on the high school and I've got, you know, seven years of experience now. And my job pays for my schooling, so I can actually get my schooling from my job instead of doing it the other way around. It seems as the generation go forward, we tack on another level of learning and expense to get to the top level of jobs, and that limits the people. It keeps the upper class on that level above everybody else. CONAN: But you definitely see this as an investment in your future, Tim, to go to school? TIM: Definitely. CONAN: Yeah. TIM: Definitely. But it gets harder and harder you get to that top echelon of education. CONAN: And was there ever, you know, you're saving to go to school; you're saving for a house. I mean these are difficult decisions. TIM: The house I consider a good debt; and education, that is good debt. But other than that I've kept myself debt free. CONAN: Okay. Liz Pulliam Weston, is he right? Good debt? Ms. WESTON: Yes. There is such a thing as good debt, but again you can overdose on anything. And if you are spending more than, say, 25 percent of your gross on housing expenses, you're spending more than 10 percent of your income on student loan payments, you'll probably overdose. I generally tell people that if they're getting student loans, try to limit the total amount to no more than you expect to make in your first year out of school. So if you expect to earn $40,000, that should be your total borrowing. When people get into trouble is when they take out, you know, two or three times that amount and go to Harvard to get an education, borrow all this money and wind up teaching. You know. That's a disconnect, and that's happening because this money is so readily available and so pushed by lenders to people who aren't even old enough to drink. They're making, you know, decisions that are going to affect the rest of their financial life. CONAN: And they're getting marketed by credit card companies as well. Tim, thanks very much. Good luck in school. TIM: Thank you. CONAN: We're going to take a short break. When we come back, more of your calls about generation IOU, the massive amount of debt weighing on many 20- and 30-somethings. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to join us. 800-989-TALK. E-mail talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. This is the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We're talking about generation IOU, the 20- and 30-somethings, many fresh out of college, hamstrung by debt to the point where they default on student loans and credit card payments or even move back in with mom and dad. For some tips on how to pay for college without going broke, you can check out the TALK OF THE NATION page at npr. org. Our guests are Tamara Draut, the author of \u201cStrapped: Why America's 20 and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead. \u201d Also, Liz Pulliam Weston who writes a twice-weekly column for MSN Money and is the author of the books \u201cYour Credit Score\u201d and \u201cDeal With Your Debt. \u201d And, of course, we invite you to join us. If you fall into the 18 to 34 age bracket, are you taking on more debt? And how did all add up? 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail talk@npr. org. This is an e-mail we got from Jonathan(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri. I'm 24 years old and have approximately $20,000 in debt. I worked two jobs during college and spent five and a half years in school. The incredible thing about this is that I had a substantial college fund before entering school. Now I work in politics, which is not a career that pays well in the early years. I live with my parents, and every month my entire paycheck goes to bills, and some months it does not cover all my expenses. I'm considering graduate school and my question is, should I? Approximately how much more debt might I incurred in getting a doctorate. And what do your guests suggest is the best way to go about applying for loans for graduate school. And, let me begin by asking Tamara Draut. This is one of those questions when you pile on debt, you're intimidated or you have to certainly think twice before pursuing additional education. Ms. DRAUT: Yeah. You definitely have to think twice, but this generation is also under a lot more pressure to do so. It's a difficult decision to make. Depending - you know, my advice to him is that I don't know what field of politics he's thinking about going into, but that should really probably make the decision. I work in sort of a political arena. I work in public policy and I can tell you that I myself face the decision of having to go on to graduate school in order to get into this profession and move up in that profession, and politics is very much the same way. CONAN: And you made the decision. Was it a wise one? Ms. DRAUT: It was a wise one. But I do still have the student loan debts and, as many young people do, I live with it by joking about it that I'll be 65 and heading into retirement when I make that final payment on my student loan debt. CONAN: And as an expert in politics, you of course know that Social Security will be there complete for you. Anyway, let me ask\u2026 Ms. DRAUT: Fingers crossed. CONAN: Yeah. Let me ask Liz Pulliam Weston the financial side of that e-mail question. About how much more, I mean it obviously depends where he's going to school, but it sounds like that he can rack up a lot more in debt getting a doctorate. Ms. WESTON: I'm actually not so worried about that. You now. His student loan debt right now is 20,000, which is fairly manageable. But he says all of his income is going to bills, which tells me there's something else going on -there's a too-big car payment, there's credit card debt, there's other debt he probably should take care of before he even thinks about going back to school again. CONAN: All right. Let's go to Monica. Monica's with us from Kansas City. MONICA (Caller): Hi. I'm calling to comment actually because I've set the exact examples that you were giving earlier. I'm a social worker, have been out of grad school for almost 10 years, and I have about the exact same amount of - I came out with the same amount of student loan debt that you gave the example in for the social work. I have a master's degree. And looking back I feel really disappointed in the lack of guidance in college or anywhere else in making those kinds of decisions. And I kind of regret my decisions, actually, if I'd seen what the career has to offer and just financially making those student loans debts and the income that I\u2018m able to make with that degree. CONAN: And obviously you made those choices with your eyes open, knowing that society, you know, may have made the unfortunate decision not to value social work as much as it does, for example, doctors but\u2026 MONICA: Of course, and that's very disappointing too. And I work in a hospital, so I see that all the time. Yeah. CONAN: And, nevertheless, that's what you wanted to do. MONICA: It's what I wanted to do. I was very young and na\u00efve. I went straight from high school and got my - and then to undergraduate, and then straight on to grad school. And I was na\u00efve and just felt like I would feel very rewarded by doing something that I felt like was helping people and, you know, money wouldn't matter. And I also had a na\u00efve idea that if I went and got a graduate degree that certainly the money would follow. And that has not been the case. CONAN: Tamara, was that you snickering there in the background? Ms. DRAUT: No. That was actually Liz. Ms. WESTON: No. CONAN: Ah, okay. I apologize. But let me ask Tamara, this story must sound familiar to you - Monica's story. Ms. DRAUT: Well, it absolutely does sound familiar. And she should know that she's not alone. One of the things that happens is today's young people after they - if they're lucky enough, you know, we have to remember that only about 30 percent of young people have bachelor's degrees. You know. The majority of young people and the majority of the people in this country do not attain a college degree, and many of them have student loan debt but no diploma. Anyway, there are just so much pressures to keep going on and getting more education, and unfortunately the way to finance your education today is through debts. And I don't think we're sending the right signals to young people when they feel like their choice is to leave with student loan debt right after undergrad and scrape by in a job that's not going to pay very much, or stay in school and take on a lot of debt not knowing exactly what their earnings trajectory is going to be like when they finally get those advanced degrees. CONAN: Monica, obviously one of the ways out of your plight is to go back to school and earn a degree in something else. MONICA: And you know, I've looked into several options with that but, you know, it's really difficult when you have children and family responsibilities at that point. So, yeah, you feel kind of stuck once you get to a certain point. CONAN: Well, good luck. MONICA: Thank you. CONAN: Appreciate the phone call. And, Tamara Draut, we wanted to thank you for your time. Ms. DRAUT: My pleasure. Thank you. CONAN: Tamara Draut is the author of the book \u201cStrapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead. \u201d She's also the director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, a public policy center in New York and joined us today from Splash Studios in New York City. Here's another e-mail. We got this one from Jackie(ph) in Buffalo, New York. It's been my experience that many people my age in college are in enormous amounts of debt - myself included - between tuition, housing, food, car expenses and maybe, gasp, having a life. There's just not enough time to work so that we can afford these things and go to school. In my case, it came down to quitting school to pay my debts or filing for bankruptcy. I chose bankruptcy. So now I'm 22 with two bachelor's degrees and a bankruptcy ruling. If your parents can't support, then you have an amazingly hard time paying for everything without resorting to credit cards, inevitably leading to my situation. So I have no credit, two jobs, no car. When compared to my friends who did not go to college, I often wonder what I was thinking. The degrees seem hardly worth the debt. And, Liz Pulliam Weston, is that cycle of debt that seems to pile on and that crushing mountain that seems there's no escape. Ms. WESTON: Well, we obviously have to take personal responsibility for our choices because debt is not inevitable. We do make choices that lead us there. But we also have to understand that the amount of credit available has exploded in the last generation. So these kids are coming out of school with access to debt that their parents never had. You know, lenders used to be fairly careful about who they extended money to and how much. That is no longer true. So, you know, like Jackie, they can sink themselves very quickly if they're not careful. We do need to be teaching kids about how much debt they should be taking on, how much they should be spending on certain things. Because the, you know, the first impulse when you get out of college is to go for the best department you can, to finally get some wheels that don't, you know, rattle and fall apart, to really make up for the time that you spent being a poor college student, when the best solution really is to continue living like a broke college student for a few years. CONAN: Angela Nissel is a successful author and a producer for the NBC show \u201cScrubs,\u201d but she remembers what it was like to be an impoverished college student. In fact, she wrote a whole book about it called aptly \u201cThe Broke Diaries: The Completely True and Hilarious Misadventures of a Good Girl Gone Broke. \u201d And Angela Nissel joins us now from our studios at NPR West. Nice to have you on the program today. Ms. ANGELA NISSEL (Author, \u201cThe Broke Diaries: The Completely True and Hilarious Misadventures of a Good Girl Gone Broke\u201d): Hi. Thanks. CONAN: So how broke were you? Ms. NISSEL: Oh, I was so broke. I'm listening to Liz, and talk about overdosing. I had a full-time job. I graduated in '98 with about $40,000 in debt. And I was the first in line at 18 to get those credit cards so I could charge some of my tuition also. I didn't have anyone to explain certain things to me, and once you get a certain - once you get to a certain place in college, I mean you're a junior, you're not going to stop signing those student loan documents. So they just keep adding up. And I thought about going back to grad school just to run away from my debt and put it off. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: There's an interesting place to go. But I understand along the way you developed some creative ways to stretch your dollars. Ms. NISSEL: Yes. Once of the things about being 18 to 34 is that a lot of businesses think we have a lot of money for some reason. CONAN: Yeah. Ms. NISSEL: And I would go to places - there's a lot of places that will pay you to give your opinion. I made $300 in one hour sitting there and giving my opinion on what I hated about bra shopping. And they consistently invited me back. That's my student loan payment - one hour. And you can sign up on their Web sites. There's tons of places to sign up for this. Also, I would take\u2026 CONAN: This is the modern equivalent of giving blood or selling your selling your blood, isn't it? Ms. NISSEL: You know. And no pain involved. It was actually quite fun, and you get food too. And I mean I really have to learn how to hustle. I wasn't -didn't come from a family where I could go back there and live, certain day-to-day things. Once you get out of college, you're like, how in the world did my mother figure out how to buy a laundry detergent and toilet paper? And what I did one day is those 1-800 numbers on the back of laundry detergent and everything else, I go like, I don't have any questions about my laundry detergent. Who calls these numbers? I would just calling and chat with the ladies, and I got free detergent for a year, free toilet paper. I think they're bored, you know. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. NISSEL: Just call those 800 numbers and talk. You don't have to complain about the product, talk about how much you like it. I have coupons for diapers now, for free diapers. I don't even have kids. I mean really, I kept myself stocked with the basic needs just by calling those 1-800 numbers. CONAN: Did you try it with how's my driving - 1-800? (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. NISSEL: If they were giving away cars I would have been on that line. CONAN: How did you eat? Ms. NISSEL: Oh, eating. Now this is interesting, because I recently got married and I was looking at my budget for food from before I got married and a lot of it was dating. Thank god a lot of guys insist on paying for meals. And when I was young and single I had a subscription to an online dating service and I didn't want to pay the $15 a month, but I look back and I saved hundreds a month by having someone else pay for the meals. And happy hours - you don't have to go and drink. There's always food out there because they're trying to keep the people there who do want to drink. You can eat for free at a happy hour forever. CONAN: So Vienna sausages, that's what you ate. Ms. NISSEL: Yes. Oh and you can do so many things with hot dogs. CONAN: And now that you're a big successful TV producer, I assume you have a -one of those Lexus's that parks itself. Ms. NISSEL: No, they saw me coming into the\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. NISSEL: I refuse to take on a car payment. The only debt I want - I don't even want it, but I have now is the house and that's only because I finally started paying my student loans on time and checked my credit score and kept at it. But no, I still live very frugally. I'm the last person at the yard sale, so that I assume that they're giving away things for free because they're so tired of them and lots of times they do. CONAN: So hang around for the end of the - I hadn't thought of that. Ms. NISSEL: Oh, I got my kitchen table - I've gotten so many books. The husband and wife will be outside arguing about we can't bring this thing back in the house, they just give it up. It's great. CONAN: So that probably saved you what five bucks on the kitchen table? Ms. NISSEL: It's a really nice hand-carved kitchen table, actually. CONAN: Wow. That's not so bad. Ms. NISSEL: I'm really happy. CONAN: And you had a pickup truck there ready to move it? Ms. NISSEL: The husband for the table wanted it so bad he drove it to my house. It seemed like - it was a gift from one of their relatives that he simply hated. CONAN: Ah-ha. So Aunt Mitsy(ph) came to your rescue? Ms. NISSEL: Yes. CONAN: All right. We're talking with Liz Pulliam Weston and Angela Nissel - who you just heard - she's the author of the book, \u201cThe Broke Diaries: The Completely True and Hilarious Misadventures of a Good Girl Gone Broke. \u201d Liz Pulliam Weston writes a twice-weekly column for MSN Money. If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get another caller on the line. This is Melissa. Melissa calling us from Oakland, California. MELISSA (Caller): Hi. This is Melissa. CONAN: Yes. Go ahead, please. MELISSA: Hi. Yeah. I am somebody with a lot of education that I paid for myself and so I really do believe in the idea of good debt as well. But recently I left a high paying career as biotech to teach college. And I got involved with a for-profit college industry. I actually had never made much of a distinction about this before. And what I found - and actually after choosing to leave it as well and doing some research on it - it's a really rapidly growing industry. It approaches education like a business and the problem is although some students really do get a good education for their top dollar premium that they're paying for it, you know, each student's dollar is just as green as the next. And they'll take that money from anyone that can pay for it whether or not they really belong in the program and whether or not they're really getting the education that they're promised. And it seemed like, you know, there were a lot of incredibly na\u00efve students who had very little educational background and very little financial background who were being horrible exploited through this industry. CONAN: We have nobody on to defend the current for-profit university industry, but Liz Pulliam Weston, again yes there are people who will make a buck but isn't it an individual's responsibility to investigate and find out what's going on? Ms. WESTON: It is, but we're talking about people -MELISSA: Well, this is where I feel like the students were - the na\u00efve students were being exploited because the promises are made. I mean here we're talking about students - and I'm not exaggerating - who can't add and subtract, who can't read, who are being granted admissions to these $100,000 programs. I mean they're really that expensive. CONAN: Yeah. Let's give Liz Pulliam Weston a chance to talk. Ms. WESTON: Yeah, there's an ongoing issue and it has been for a long time with vocational and trade schools and, you know, for-profit schools, either not delivering, not screening the students adequately. Some of these programs are just fine. Others are like Melissa described. They, you know, they're basically diploma mills or debt mills. And it's really scary, because, again, we're talking about kids that are too young to have much financial acumen or experience, parents who often have even less or don't know how to cope with today's realities of what school costs and how to look into an education to see if it's worthwhile. And I don't know what the solution is to it. I do think, again, that we need to take responsibility for our own choices, but we are talking about 18 and 19-year-olds, you know. And I don't know what the last time you talked to one, but, you know, maybe their world experience isn't up to the task. CONAN: Mm-hmm. I wonder - we just have a couple minutes left - but is there reason to think that things are going to improve do you think? Ms. WESTON: I think one thing that's happened with the Democrats in control is there might be some curbs placed on student lenders. Student lenders have basically gotten everything they wanted for the past ten years or so. So there might be - oh, I think, Senator Kennedy mentioned throwing the moneychangers out of the temple, I don't know if we'll go that far, but there may be -CONAN: He also talked about an increase in Pell Grants as well, so. Ms. WESTON: Yeah. Some help so we can change this situation where people have to get loans just to get an education. CONAN: And I wonder, just before we leave, Angela Nissel, after all of this experience and your continued tightwaddedness, when do you think you're going to get rid of all of your student loans? (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. NISSEL: They're actually the last thing that I'm going to pay off. I believe they end in 2013. So I'm paying everything else off first and those are the last to go. CONAN: And there's not many of us who can look forward to that day and have it written down in black and white, is it? Ms. NISSEL: No, not at all. I actually have it in polka dots in a different font on my computer. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: Well, when the party comes, be sure to invite us. Ms. NISSEL: I sure will. CONAN: Angela Nissel is the author most recently of \u201cMixed: Life in Black and White. \u201d She joined us today from the studios of NPR West in Culver City, California. And we thank her for her time. As always Liz Pulliam Weston, appreciate your coming in to speak with us. Ms. WESTON: My pleasure Neal.

When we come back from a short break Kinky Friedman joins us to talk about his unusual campaign for governor of Texas and his new Christmas fable, \u201cThe Christmas Pig. \u201d If you have questions for Kinky Friedman you can call us now, 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Or send us questions by e-mail, talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  iPod's, Xbox's, Razr's, BlackBerries - in some respects, today's abundance of gadgets and access to information means that young people are richer than ever before. But that wealth comes at a cost. With wages stagnant and the cost of housing and education way up, many 20- or 30-somethings are piling on the debt. Roughly two-thirds of young people have some form of debt, mostly student loans and credit cards.  The extra financial burden makes it harder for young people to pursue additional education, to buy a house, to start a family, or to save for retirement. And boomers beware, this affects you too. Your debt-ridden 25-year-olds might want their old bedrooms back.  Later in the program, a Christmas fable from Kinky Friedman, the curly-haired Jewish guy who didn't win the governor's race in Texas.  But first, generation IOU. If you fall into the 18 to 34 age bracket, are you taking on more debt? How did it pile on? Does it worry you? If you're a parent with a child in debt, are you baring the brunt of the cost? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. And our e-mail address is talk@npr. org.  We begin with Tamara Draut who's the author of book \"Strapped: Why 20- and 30-Something's Can't Get Ahead,\" and she joins us today from Splash Studios in New York City. Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION.  Ms. TAMARA DRAUT (Author, \"Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Something's Can't Get Ahead\"): Hi, good to be with you.  CONAN: And what makes it - every generation seems to say that, you know, we've never had it so hard as before. What makes this generation different?  Ms. DRAUT: Well, I think a couple of things. One is just the amount of debt needed to get a college education today. In the last 10 years, the amount of the average student loan debt has grown from about $12,000 to - today the average being a little over $19,000 is what a college graduate can expect to leave the campus gates with.  And just to put that into perspective, that's about a $220 monthly payment over the next 10 years of that person's life. And what we know is that the earnings, the typical earnings for somebody with a college degree, adjusted for inflation, have not grown to meet that payment, nor to meet the rising cost of things like housing and healthcare.  CONAN: And a lot of a people say, well, you know, I had to work through school, too. Big deal.  Ms. DRAUT: Well, students are working through school and they're still having to take on enormous debt in order to pay for college. In fact, the overwhelming majority of students work, and half of them are now working - half of full-time college students are working more than 25 hours a week, which is one of the reasons why it now takes about six years to get a bachelor's degree.  But between working, working during school, working during summers, you know, a generation ago, you could work a full-time job during the summer and be set in terms of being able to pay for a year of college. That's just not the case today. It's a totally different ballgame.  CONAN: Now there is a profile of - I call them young people - kids who are in very serious trouble, who've really - would you tell us about some of the worst cases?  Ms. DRAUT: Well, you know, I think there's certainly always worst cases. You hear about people who have hundreds and thousands of dollars in student loan debt, mostly for graduate degrees, which, when you get to the graduate level, this generation faces a lot more pressure to sort of keep going up the credential ladder. But the problem is it doesn't always pay off. And let me give you an example.  I talked to a social worker, which now it is mandatory to get a master's degree, but that person has taken on an inordinate amount of debt, around $60,000, for a career that is just not going to command a big salary and provide that person with the ability to get ahead and pay off the investment needed to move up in that career.  And that's happening across the board, whether it's young people going on to get MBAs, which have become pretty standard for getting ahead in any business-related endeavor. And then we now know that college - or I'm sorry - law school grads are leaving with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.  CONAN: Hundreds of thousands of dollars in new debt. That's - you know, obviously that affects you for years if not, as you're suggesting, a decade or more.  Ms. DRAUT: Absolutely, and it affects - the effects can be rather immediate. One is that the rise of student loan debt often now begets more debt. Because what happens is, let's say you just leave college, you - either - whether you're living with your mom and dad again, after - with your first job, after you pay the student loan bill of $220 a month, any car payment you have, any utilities you have, there's not going to be a lot left over.  And so what find is that there's a lot credit card debt that happens during the 25 to 34-year-old age group as well, because the car breaks down, they need to go to the doctor. Those kinds of things get put on credit cards because they're just no wiggle room, especially now that you have that $220 student loan payment.  CONAN: We're talking today about generation IOU. If you'd like to join the conversation, our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And the e-mail address is talk@npr. org. And let's talk with Jennifer, Jennifer on the line with us from Tucson, Arizona.  JENNIFER (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call.  CONAN: Sure.  JENNIFER: I was noticing - I'm 27 years old, and my husband and I graduated with bachelor's degrees in May. And I realized just as you were speaking about this that I have $35,000 in student loan debt. And I noticed that, you know, thinking about it, if I had $35,000 in credit card debt, I'd want to crawl under a rock and die.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  JENNIFER: But for some reason the student loan debt doesn't seem to affect me that much. And I'm wondering if there's a different mindset as far as student loan debt is.  CONAN: Tamara?  Ms. DRAUT: Well, that's a really interesting question. Well, one, student loans debt is cheaper debt. A credit card debt is going to, you know, cost you around probably anywhere from 15 percent APR to 29 percent APR, where a student loan debt - at least federal student loans - are going to max out at around eight percent interest rate.  But I will tell you that surveys done of people who are in the process of paying back their student loans, after they've been paying back the student loans for about - for several years, three, four years, they actually say that it's more burdensome - more of a burden to them at that point than it was when they first started making those payments.  And I think what happens is fatigue sets in, you know, and it's sort of like buying a new car. You know, as soon as the new-car smell wears off, so does the joy of kind of owning and paying for the car, and the same goes with student loans. The further and further you get away from actually having that sort of sheepskin in hand and celebrating that you accomplished getting a college degree, you know, you're on year three of 10 years of student loan payments, and it starts to become less and less apparent and feels more burdensome to still be paying down this debt.  CONAN: Nevertheless, Jennifer, congratulations on both you and your husband getting ready to graduate.  JENNIFER: Well, thank you. I'm looking forward to it.  CONAN: All right. Good luck getting work, too.  JENNIFER: Thanks.  CONAN: Bye-bye. If you're a recent college grad, still haven't landed that first real job and have thousands of dollars in debt, what do you do? To help answer that question, we turn to Liz Pulliam Weston. She writes a column twice a week for MSN Money, and she joins us today from our studios at NPR West in Culver City, California.  Liz, nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION.  Ms. LIZ PULLIAM WESTON (Columnist, MSN Money): Great to be here, Neal.  CONAN: And I was wondering just the reaction to what you're hearing Tamara Draut talking about, and that last caller, particularly, the distinction between that loan debt and credit card debt.  Ms. WESTON: Well, student loan is actually an investment in your future. And as long as you don't overdose and take on too much of it, it's actually a very good move. The other thing, as Tamara pointed out, it's very cheap debt and most people can deduct the interest. So I wouldn't be in any hurry, frankly, to pay off my student loans unless, as I said, you really overdid it and you're looking at six-figure debts and a five-figure income.  CONAN: Is there any way out of those debts?  Ms. WESTON: Basically, the answer is no. I mean death and total physical disability are two of the ways that you can get out. The student lenders in Congress have made it very, very difficult to wiggle out from your debts. It's very different from the '80s, when I think about 20 percent of people simply walked away from their student loan debts.  Now they follow you for life. The Department of Education has enormous powers to collect, to garnish your wages to get their money back, and you can't discharge student loans typically in bankruptcy court. So this is an albatross you could carry for the rest of your life.  CONAN: And I want to bring Tamara in on this as well, but aren't you sort of caught if, like a typical person, you have your credit card debt and your student loan debt. I mean that's the Scylla and Charybdis of modern finance for 20-somethings isn't it?  Ms. DRAUT: Well it is, and I want to underscore and point that student loan debt is an investment. That being said, we know that we have real affordability issues, and not only is it problematic that we have someone who's 27 taking out $35,000 in student loans to get a bachelor's degree, but behind that person is a lot of really smart kids from low-income backgrounds that can't afford to go to college and are afraid to take on that debt as a first generation college student. And we know that every year we're losing about half million really bright kids who can't get together enough cash/grant aid or even loan aid to complete their education.  CONAN: All right. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line, and this is Tim. Tim is with us from Grand Rapids in Michigan.  TIM (Caller): Hi. How is it going?  CONAN: Good.  TIM: I'm a 26-year-old male and I've got a house and it seems like the new American dream is to be debt free, not necessarily to own a home, because getting a home is easy but becoming debt free is hard. I went to - got a job right on the high school and I've got, you know, seven years of experience now. And my job pays for my schooling, so I can actually get my schooling from my job instead of doing it the other way around. It seems as the generation go forward, we tack on another level of learning and expense to get to the top level of jobs, and that limits the people. It keeps the upper class on that level above everybody else.  CONAN: But you definitely see this as an investment in your future, Tim, to go to school?  TIM: Definitely.  CONAN: Yeah.  TIM: Definitely. But it gets harder and harder you get to that top echelon of education.  CONAN: And was there ever, you know, you're saving to go to school; you're saving for a house. I mean these are difficult decisions.  TIM: The house I consider a good debt; and education, that is good debt. But other than that I've kept myself debt free.  CONAN: Okay. Liz Pulliam Weston, is he right? Good debt?  Ms. WESTON: Yes. There is such a thing as good debt, but again you can overdose on anything. And if you are spending more than, say, 25 percent of your gross on housing expenses, you're spending more than 10 percent of your income on student loan payments, you'll probably overdose.  I generally tell people that if they're getting student loans, try to limit the total amount to no more than you expect to make in your first year out of school. So if you expect to earn $40,000, that should be your total borrowing.  When people get into trouble is when they take out, you know, two or three times that amount and go to Harvard to get an education, borrow all this money and wind up teaching. You know. That's a disconnect, and that's happening because this money is so readily available and so pushed by lenders to people who aren't even old enough to drink. They're making, you know, decisions that are going to affect the rest of their financial life.  CONAN: And they're getting marketed by credit card companies as well. Tim, thanks very much. Good luck in school.  TIM: Thank you.  CONAN: We're going to take a short break. When we come back, more of your calls about generation IOU, the massive amount of debt weighing on many 20- and 30-somethings. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to join us. 800-989-TALK. E-mail talk@npr. org.  I'm Neal Conan. This is the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  We're talking about generation IOU, the 20- and 30-somethings, many fresh out of college, hamstrung by debt to the point where they default on student loans and credit card payments or even move back in with mom and dad.  For some tips on how to pay for college without going broke, you can check out the TALK OF THE NATION page at npr. org. Our guests are Tamara Draut, the author of \u201cStrapped: Why America's 20 and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead. \u201d Also, Liz Pulliam Weston who writes a twice-weekly column for MSN Money and is the author of the books \u201cYour Credit Score\u201d and \u201cDeal With Your Debt. \u201d  And, of course, we invite you to join us. If you fall into the 18 to 34 age bracket, are you taking on more debt? And how did all add up? 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail talk@npr. org.  This is an e-mail we got from Jonathan(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri. I'm 24 years old and have approximately $20,000 in debt. I worked two jobs during college and spent five and a half years in school. The incredible thing about this is that I had a substantial college fund before entering school. Now I work in politics, which is not a career that pays well in the early years. I live with my parents, and every month my entire paycheck goes to bills, and some months it does not cover all my expenses. I'm considering graduate school and my question is, should I? Approximately how much more debt might I incurred in getting a doctorate. And what do your guests suggest is the best way to go about applying for loans for graduate school.  And, let me begin by asking Tamara Draut. This is one of those questions when you pile on debt, you're intimidated or you have to certainly think twice before pursuing additional education.  Ms. DRAUT: Yeah. You definitely have to think twice, but this generation is also under a lot more pressure to do so. It's a difficult decision to make. Depending - you know, my advice to him is that I don't know what field of politics he's thinking about going into, but that should really probably make the decision. I work in sort of a political arena. I work in public policy and I can tell you that I myself face the decision of having to go on to graduate school in order to get into this profession and move up in that profession, and politics is very much the same way.  CONAN: And you made the decision. Was it a wise one?  Ms. DRAUT: It was a wise one. But I do still have the student loan debts and, as many young people do, I live with it by joking about it that I'll be 65 and heading into retirement when I make that final payment on my student loan debt.  CONAN: And as an expert in politics, you of course know that Social Security will be there complete for you. Anyway, let me ask\u2026  Ms. DRAUT: Fingers crossed.  CONAN: Yeah. Let me ask Liz Pulliam Weston the financial side of that e-mail question. About how much more, I mean it obviously depends where he's going to school, but it sounds like that he can rack up a lot more in debt getting a doctorate.  Ms. WESTON: I'm actually not so worried about that. You now. His student loan debt right now is 20,000, which is fairly manageable. But he says all of his income is going to bills, which tells me there's something else going on -there's a too-big car payment, there's credit card debt, there's other debt he probably should take care of before he even thinks about going back to school again.  CONAN: All right. Let's go to Monica. Monica's with us from Kansas City.  MONICA (Caller): Hi. I'm calling to comment actually because I've set the exact examples that you were giving earlier. I'm a social worker, have been out of grad school for almost 10 years, and I have about the exact same amount of - I came out with the same amount of student loan debt that you gave the example in for the social work. I have a master's degree.  And looking back I feel really disappointed in the lack of guidance in college or anywhere else in making those kinds of decisions. And I kind of regret my decisions, actually, if I'd seen what the career has to offer and just financially making those student loans debts and the income that I\u2018m able to make with that degree.  CONAN: And obviously you made those choices with your eyes open, knowing that society, you know, may have made the unfortunate decision not to value social work as much as it does, for example, doctors but\u2026  MONICA: Of course, and that's very disappointing too. And I work in a hospital, so I see that all the time. Yeah.  CONAN: And, nevertheless, that's what you wanted to do.  MONICA: It's what I wanted to do. I was very young and na\u00efve. I went straight from high school and got my - and then to undergraduate, and then straight on to grad school. And I was na\u00efve and just felt like I would feel very rewarded by doing something that I felt like was helping people and, you know, money wouldn't matter. And I also had a na\u00efve idea that if I went and got a graduate degree that certainly the money would follow. And that has not been the case.  CONAN: Tamara, was that you snickering there in the background?  Ms. DRAUT: No. That was actually Liz.  Ms. WESTON: No.  CONAN: Ah, okay. I apologize. But let me ask Tamara, this story must sound familiar to you - Monica's story.  Ms. DRAUT: Well, it absolutely does sound familiar. And she should know that she's not alone. One of the things that happens is today's young people after they - if they're lucky enough, you know, we have to remember that only about 30 percent of young people have bachelor's degrees. You know. The majority of young people and the majority of the people in this country do not attain a college degree, and many of them have student loan debt but no diploma.  Anyway, there are just so much pressures to keep going on and getting more education, and unfortunately the way to finance your education today is through debts. And I don't think we're sending the right signals to young people when they feel like their choice is to leave with student loan debt right after undergrad and scrape by in a job that's not going to pay very much, or stay in school and take on a lot of debt not knowing exactly what their earnings trajectory is going to be like when they finally get those advanced degrees.  CONAN: Monica, obviously one of the ways out of your plight is to go back to school and earn a degree in something else.  MONICA: And you know, I've looked into several options with that but, you know, it's really difficult when you have children and family responsibilities at that point. So, yeah, you feel kind of stuck once you get to a certain point.  CONAN: Well, good luck.  MONICA: Thank you.  CONAN: Appreciate the phone call. And, Tamara Draut, we wanted to thank you for your time.  Ms. DRAUT: My pleasure. Thank you.  CONAN: Tamara Draut is the author of the book \u201cStrapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead. \u201d She's also the director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, a public policy center in New York and joined us today from Splash Studios in New York City.  Here's another e-mail. We got this one from Jackie(ph) in Buffalo, New York. It's been my experience that many people my age in college are in enormous amounts of debt - myself included - between tuition, housing, food, car expenses and maybe, gasp, having a life. There's just not enough time to work so that we can afford these things and go to school. In my case, it came down to quitting school to pay my debts or filing for bankruptcy. I chose bankruptcy.  So now I'm 22 with two bachelor's degrees and a bankruptcy ruling. If your parents can't support, then you have an amazingly hard time paying for everything without resorting to credit cards, inevitably leading to my situation. So I have no credit, two jobs, no car. When compared to my friends who did not go to college, I often wonder what I was thinking. The degrees seem hardly worth the debt.  And, Liz Pulliam Weston, is that cycle of debt that seems to pile on and that crushing mountain that seems there's no escape.  Ms. WESTON: Well, we obviously have to take personal responsibility for our choices because debt is not inevitable. We do make choices that lead us there. But we also have to understand that the amount of credit available has exploded in the last generation. So these kids are coming out of school with access to debt that their parents never had. You know, lenders used to be fairly careful about who they extended money to and how much. That is no longer true. So, you know, like Jackie, they can sink themselves very quickly if they're not careful.  We do need to be teaching kids about how much debt they should be taking on, how much they should be spending on certain things. Because the, you know, the first impulse when you get out of college is to go for the best department you can, to finally get some wheels that don't, you know, rattle and fall apart, to really make up for the time that you spent being a poor college student, when the best solution really is to continue living like a broke college student for a few years.  CONAN: Angela Nissel is a successful author and a producer for the NBC show \u201cScrubs,\u201d but she remembers what it was like to be an impoverished college student. In fact, she wrote a whole book about it called aptly \u201cThe Broke Diaries: The Completely True and Hilarious Misadventures of a Good Girl Gone Broke. \u201d And Angela Nissel joins us now from our studios at NPR West.  Nice to have you on the program today.  Ms. ANGELA NISSEL (Author, \u201cThe Broke Diaries: The Completely True and Hilarious Misadventures of a Good Girl Gone Broke\u201d): Hi. Thanks.  CONAN: So how broke were you?  Ms. NISSEL: Oh, I was so broke. I'm listening to Liz, and talk about overdosing. I had a full-time job. I graduated in '98 with about $40,000 in debt. And I was the first in line at 18 to get those credit cards so I could charge some of my tuition also. I didn't have anyone to explain certain things to me, and once you get a certain - once you get to a certain place in college, I mean you're a junior, you're not going to stop signing those student loan documents. So they just keep adding up. And I thought about going back to grad school just to run away from my debt and put it off.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: There's an interesting place to go. But I understand along the way you developed some creative ways to stretch your dollars.  Ms. NISSEL: Yes. Once of the things about being 18 to 34 is that a lot of businesses think we have a lot of money for some reason.  CONAN: Yeah.  Ms. NISSEL: And I would go to places - there's a lot of places that will pay you to give your opinion. I made $300 in one hour sitting there and giving my opinion on what I hated about bra shopping. And they consistently invited me back. That's my student loan payment - one hour. And you can sign up on their Web sites. There's tons of places to sign up for this. Also, I would take\u2026  CONAN: This is the modern equivalent of giving blood or selling your selling your blood, isn't it?  Ms. NISSEL: You know. And no pain involved. It was actually quite fun, and you get food too. And I mean I really have to learn how to hustle. I wasn't -didn't come from a family where I could go back there and live, certain day-to-day things.  Once you get out of college, you're like, how in the world did my mother figure out how to buy a laundry detergent and toilet paper? And what I did one day is those 1-800 numbers on the back of laundry detergent and everything else, I go like, I don't have any questions about my laundry detergent. Who calls these numbers? I would just calling and chat with the ladies, and I got free detergent for a year, free toilet paper. I think they're bored, you know.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. NISSEL: Just call those 800 numbers and talk. You don't have to complain about the product, talk about how much you like it. I have coupons for diapers now, for free diapers. I don't even have kids. I mean really, I kept myself stocked with the basic needs just by calling those 1-800 numbers.  CONAN: Did you try it with how's my driving - 1-800?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. NISSEL: If they were giving away cars I would have been on that line.  CONAN: How did you eat?  Ms. NISSEL: Oh, eating. Now this is interesting, because I recently got married and I was looking at my budget for food from before I got married and a lot of it was dating. Thank god a lot of guys insist on paying for meals. And when I was young and single I had a subscription to an online dating service and I didn't want to pay the $15 a month, but I look back and I saved hundreds a month by having someone else pay for the meals.  And happy hours - you don't have to go and drink. There's always food out there because they're trying to keep the people there who do want to drink. You can eat for free at a happy hour forever.  CONAN: So Vienna sausages, that's what you ate.  Ms. NISSEL: Yes. Oh and you can do so many things with hot dogs.  CONAN: And now that you're a big successful TV producer, I assume you have a -one of those Lexus's that parks itself.  Ms. NISSEL: No, they saw me coming into the\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. NISSEL: I refuse to take on a car payment. The only debt I want - I don't even want it, but I have now is the house and that's only because I finally started paying my student loans on time and checked my credit score and kept at it. But no, I still live very frugally. I'm the last person at the yard sale, so that I assume that they're giving away things for free because they're so tired of them and lots of times they do.  CONAN: So hang around for the end of the - I hadn't thought of that.  Ms. NISSEL: Oh, I got my kitchen table - I've gotten so many books. The husband and wife will be outside arguing about we can't bring this thing back in the house, they just give it up. It's great.  CONAN: So that probably saved you what five bucks on the kitchen table?  Ms. NISSEL: It's a really nice hand-carved kitchen table, actually.  CONAN: Wow. That's not so bad.  Ms. NISSEL: I'm really happy.  CONAN: And you had a pickup truck there ready to move it?  Ms. NISSEL: The husband for the table wanted it so bad he drove it to my house. It seemed like - it was a gift from one of their relatives that he simply hated.  CONAN: Ah-ha. So Aunt Mitsy(ph) came to your rescue?  Ms. NISSEL: Yes.  CONAN: All right. We're talking with Liz Pulliam Weston and Angela Nissel - who you just heard - she's the author of the book, \u201cThe Broke Diaries: The Completely True and Hilarious Misadventures of a Good Girl Gone Broke. \u201d Liz Pulliam Weston writes a twice-weekly column for MSN Money.  If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's get another caller on the line. This is Melissa. Melissa calling us from Oakland, California.  MELISSA (Caller): Hi. This is Melissa.  CONAN: Yes. Go ahead, please.  MELISSA: Hi. Yeah. I am somebody with a lot of education that I paid for myself and so I really do believe in the idea of good debt as well. But recently I left a high paying career as biotech to teach college. And I got involved with a for-profit college industry. I actually had never made much of a distinction about this before.  And what I found - and actually after choosing to leave it as well and doing some research on it - it's a really rapidly growing industry. It approaches education like a business and the problem is although some students really do get a good education for their top dollar premium that they're paying for it, you know, each student's dollar is just as green as the next.  And they'll take that money from anyone that can pay for it whether or not they really belong in the program and whether or not they're really getting the education that they're promised. And it seemed like, you know, there were a lot of incredibly na\u00efve students who had very little educational background and very little financial background who were being horrible exploited through this industry.  CONAN: We have nobody on to defend the current for-profit university industry, but Liz Pulliam Weston, again yes there are people who will make a buck but isn't it an individual's responsibility to investigate and find out what's going on?  Ms. WESTON: It is, but we're talking about people - MELISSA: Well, this is where I feel like the students were - the na\u00efve students were being exploited because the promises are made. I mean here we're talking about students - and I'm not exaggerating - who can't add and subtract, who can't read, who are being granted admissions to these $100,000 programs. I mean they're really that expensive.  CONAN: Yeah. Let's give Liz Pulliam Weston a chance to talk.  Ms. WESTON: Yeah, there's an ongoing issue and it has been for a long time with vocational and trade schools and, you know, for-profit schools, either not delivering, not screening the students adequately. Some of these programs are just fine.  Others are like Melissa described. They, you know, they're basically diploma mills or debt mills. And it's really scary, because, again, we're talking about kids that are too young to have much financial acumen or experience, parents who often have even less or don't know how to cope with today's realities of what school costs and how to look into an education to see if it's worthwhile.  And I don't know what the solution is to it. I do think, again, that we need to take responsibility for our own choices, but we are talking about 18 and 19-year-olds, you know. And I don't know what the last time you talked to one, but, you know, maybe their world experience isn't up to the task.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. I wonder - we just have a couple minutes left - but is there reason to think that things are going to improve do you think?  Ms. WESTON: I think one thing that's happened with the Democrats in control is there might be some curbs placed on student lenders. Student lenders have basically gotten everything they wanted for the past ten years or so. So there might be - oh, I think, Senator Kennedy mentioned throwing the moneychangers out of the temple, I don't know if we'll go that far, but there may be - CONAN: He also talked about an increase in Pell Grants as well, so.  Ms. WESTON: Yeah. Some help so we can change this situation where people have to get loans just to get an education.  CONAN: And I wonder, just before we leave, Angela Nissel, after all of this experience and your continued tightwaddedness, when do you think you're going to get rid of all of your student loans?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. NISSEL: They're actually the last thing that I'm going to pay off. I believe they end in 2013. So I'm paying everything else off first and those are the last to go.  CONAN: And there's not many of us who can look forward to that day and have it written down in black and white, is it?  Ms. NISSEL: No, not at all. I actually have it in polka dots in a different font on my computer.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: Well, when the party comes, be sure to invite us.  Ms. NISSEL: I sure will.  CONAN: Angela Nissel is the author most recently of \u201cMixed: Life in Black and White. \u201d She joined us today from the studios of NPR West in Culver City, California.

S. economy continues to grow at a moderate pace and that's making the labor market tighter, according to a survey released yesterday by the Federal Reserve. The report also said the housing market remains weak. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI: The Fed released its Beige Book Reports, a series of surveys of economic activity in different parts of the country. The report said that consumer spending increased in October and early November and the retail sales outlook was cautiously optimistic for the holiday season. The survey said the only part of the country to report slower growth was the Dallas area. Almost every part of the country reported a slowdown in housing. Stuart Hoffman is chief economist at PNC Financial Services. Mr. STUART HOFFMAN (Chief Economist, PNC Financial Services): But there's no sign in here, that even region by region, that other than housing, the economy's moving backward. There's still signs of improvement in the job market, in most areas of manufacturing, and non-residential construction and consumer spending. ZARROLI: The report confirms the generally upbeat assessment of the economy made this week by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. In a speech in New York on Tuesday, Bernanke said growth had slowed, but he said the slowdown was about he would expect in an economy that's been growing for five years. Bernanke also seemed to dampen speculation that Fed officials might be ready to cut interest rates. He said the nation's core inflation rate remains uncomfortably high. He also said the decline in energy prices should help prop up consumer spending and keep the economy growing. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.  JOHN YDSTIE, host:  The U.

Wallets are open. A sure sign the holidays are here again. Wall Street is watching to see which stores are naughty and which toys are especially nice. So far, signs point to a healthy season of holiday shopping with one very big box exception, which may mean a lump of coal if you have invested in the mighty Wal-Mart. As we do each month, we've called on David Gardner for advice, and in December, to tell us how all of this holiday spending is going to play out for your investments. He is co-founder of the Motley Fool and he joins us from Fool headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. David, nice to talk with you again. Mr. DAVID GARDNER (Co-Founder, Motley Fool): Happy Holidays, Neal. CONAN: Thank you. Before we start our usual, a caveat: Neither David nor I will offer advise on whether to buy or sell any particular stock. But if you have questions about the way the markets work, current trends, philosophies of investment, give us a call. 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And, David, signs look good for the initial burst of holiday shopping, anyway. MR. GARDNER: And I think, you know, Neal, just like has been the in case last years, e-commerce is a real savior, I think. You know, some of the - if you actually poll and see how some of the stores are doing, you'll hear a flattish or maybe down 1 percent. That was sort of the story at Wal-Mart, which is of course such a huge story. It does have a good e-commerce operation. Well, that's up 60 percent for Wal-Mart. But still for the most part that's a company focused of course on so-called bricks and mortar. But when you think about eBay, Amazon. com, these are already places I've been loading up on gifts this year. I'm the lazy guy who likes to clip my computer mouse around the Internet and send stuff to friends, but I think that remains a major trend that we have to recognize. CONAN: And what about toy makers, particularly - we just saw two big openings, unveilings of game systems? Mr. GARDNER: Yeah. It's really interesting. I mean I'm a video gamer myself so I think it's pretty much a no-brainer to predict that it's a big time for a company like Gamestop, let's say, which is the number one videogame focused retailer in America today. But of course there's also a lot of benefit stores like Target and Best Buy. But if you actually look at the toy makers themselves, they are sort of interesting. Take Hasbrow today, which, you know, Star Wars Monopoly, G. I. Joe, so many of those brands. In fact, as I think about it, Neal, you know, it seems like there's a monopoly in everything. Isn't there? There's a Star Wars Monopoly, of course. But I think what I want to know, and I think a lot of the American people want to know as well, is could there ever be a Monopoly themed \u201cStar Wars? \u201d CONAN: Really? Mr. GARDNER: And if there were, what would that look like? CONAN: I don't know, I mean you'd have to go around and evaluate all of the properties. And what would be Mediterranean Avenue? I have no idea. Mr. GARDNER: I'm thinking Luke Skywalker banging lightsabers with that guy in the Community Chest cards. But, you know, as I think about, you know, Hasbrow has these brands -CONAN: Tatooine seemed like a pretty lousy world. That could be Mediterranean Avenue. Mr. GARDNER: I knew you could go Star Wars geek-speak with me. But, you know, that's a company that over the last four years saw the stocks up about 80 percent. The stock market is up about 60 percent. When we talk about the Hasbrows and Mattels of this world, that has sort of the stock market returns I think you can expect from them going forward. That is, they will exceed the market because they are relevant companies, well managed for the most part, but they are not going to be spectacular stocks because there are - it's a pretty mature business. CONAN: And how do you gauge how a company like that is doing? Mr. GARDNER: Well, from my standpoint, I just look at the numbers. I mean I look at the top line of sales and then the bottom line. Take out all the costs and what do the profits look like, and then comparing them against the year before or the trends over the last five years. I think a lot of us would be well served as investors to look at two things, really. I know it's not good to look backwards too much, but often with big mature companies look at the last five or 10 years, if you can take a look at the stock graph online, and just see how that company has done versus the market average. A lot of us lack that context, but I've done pretty well as an investor by believing that past performance is actually a pretty good indicator of future results. There is not one-to-one correlation, but for the most part in the world, the winners keep on winning assuming that the same managers, the same brands, and that's very true in the toy industry. CONAN: David Gardner is with us, a co-founder of the Motley Fool. He is with us from Fool headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. You are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And here is an e-mail question we have from Kris(ph) in Cleveland. For Christmas, my sister would like to buy some stocks for my 11-month-old son to go into a college fund for him. She has asked my husband and me to set up an account for him. I'm coming upon terms like custodian, guardian, traditional IRA, educational IRA. Where do I start? What do I need to know? Mr. GARDNER: Well, I'll just talk about what was done for me, because it was wonderful thing in my life. When I was born, I wasn't aware, I was zero, but my parents set up a gift trust account for me. Basically, it was in my name and that it was my ownership, but they decided the age at which I would get it. And it's something that - it doesn't have to end up being a $1 million or it might only end up being $5,000. But anything that you can get saved and add to over the course of a 18 or 21 or 25 years that you want to do for your child is just tremendous. And at least in my parents' case, it wasn't just that they were investing money for me through that account - where, again, they were the trustees but I was the actual owner, which is a very common way to do this -but it was that they were teaching me along the way. So they were interesting me in things like Hasbrow and Mattel, whether there ever will be a Monopoly-themed Star Wars. And so, you know, it makes it real for you as a child and then a teenager. And you start to realize that the stock market isn't really that much different from the farmer's market. It's just that rather than buying fruit and vegetables, you're buying part-ownership in American companies or foreign multinationals, you're looking for great businesses. And so I think half of what you can do for your child is not actually setting up the account, it's actually teaching. CONAN: Well, I would have sunk all my money into Mr. Machine and taken a bath. Anyway, let's get John on the line. John is calling us from Minneapolis. JOHN (Caller): Indeed. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. CONAN: Sure. JOHN: Say, I was doing some Christmas shopping the other day for a friend that lives in the E. U. Zone and suddenly found myself not having quite as much money to spend as I thought because of the recent weakness in the dollar. I'm wondering about your investment philosophy as it comes to hedging against the declining dollar and where you see the market going in that respect. Mr. GARDNER: It's a great question, John. And from my standpoint, I tend to have about maybe 30 percent of my money invested either in foreign companies, just the stocks. For example, BMW is traded in Germany but you can be a part owner of BMW because it's also on the Pink sheets here in the U. S. And that's a stock that I like, for example. But there are many of those great companies outside the U. S. , brands that we know just, you know, the Peter Lynch idea that buy what you know, which is - has been so successful for me as an investor. I think that we can do that with these foreign companies. And it's easier than ever before, and the New York Stock Exchange is getting prepared to merge with Euro next and it's going to be possible with just a single ticker symbol now to be buying some companies over in Europe, just a click of the mouse. So I think it's all coming together, but I would suggest to you that about 30 percent exposure is appropriate. And that can take one of two forms, you can buy foreign stocks outright, or remember that when you buy a company like Coca-Cola, the majority of Coke's business is actually outside the U. S. And so a lot of the large American companies, Dell and others - actually I can't say off the top of my head what the mix is for Dell - but these are companies that operate globally. And so you're actually getting a lot of exposure outside the dollar if you're worried about our currency. JOHN: All right. Well, thanks for the thoughts guys. CONAN: Good luck, John. JOHN: Bye. CONAN: E-mail question from Heather in Anchorage. I'm 63, retired and have an adequate retirement income. Most of my assists are in IRAs. I've heard a rule that it's your age should define your asset allocation; e. g. at 65, I should have 65 percent of my assets in bonds and 35 percent in equities. I defy the rule: 90 percent of my assets are in equities. Am I nuts? She asks. Mr. GARDNER: I don't think you're nuts. I mean I - the old rule of thumb is take your age subtract it from 100, and that's the percentage that you should have in the stocks. So if your 90 years old, you only have 10 percent in stocks; and if you're 10 years old, you should have 90 percent in stocks. And the reason for that rule of thumb, Neal, is that generally the stock market's going to outperform other things but with more risks. If you have time on your side, there's very little risk. The stock market is almost always a great bet over a 20-year period; but if you are 75 years old, that's not as important a bet for you to make. So for the most part, the younger you are, yes, the more stocks you want to have. But you know what? 65 is sounding increasingly young to me these days. And the truth is you're going to live 40 years more. Plan for that. So I think absolutely you should - maybe you should be subtracting your age from a 120 these days. Let's update that rule of thumb for 2006. CONAN: And, David, next time we talk with you next month in the new year, we're going to start with a new portfolio of investment. It's going to be a fantasy portfolio, of course, with imaginary money. I'll be picking the stocks with a little guidance from you and from listeners. Now since I'm a beginner at this, keep in mind this is all just for fun. A chance to track how the markets are doing and to see what it takes to get started with a small portfolio. Not meant to be advice, not a recommendation for or against any investment. We could talk more about those details in January, but until then I need some help. So if you have any advice on what's hot in the market right now and how to kick-start a portfolio, e-mail them now: Talk@npr. org. Talk@npr. org. And then join us again in January when David Gardner and the Motley Fool return. David, thanks very much. Happy Holidays. Mr. GARDNER: Thank you. You too, Neal. CONAN: Happy New Year.

Now since I'm a beginner at this, keep in mind this is all just for fun. A chance to track how the markets are doing and to see what it takes to get started with a small portfolio. Not meant to be advice, not a recommendation for or against any investment. We could talk more about those details in January, but until then I need some help.  So if you have any advice on what's hot in the market right now and how to kick-start a portfolio, e-mail them now: Talk@npr. org. Talk@npr. org. And then join us again in January when David Gardner and the Motley Fool return. David, thanks very much. Happy Holidays.  Mr. GARDNER: Thank you. You too, Neal.  CONAN: Happy New Year.

The bond market is glooming. The Federal Reserve meets today and its decision on what to do about interest rates will reflect one mood or the other. To make sense of the mood swings, we turn to David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal. Good morning. Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal): Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: How do these different indicators see the economy in such different ways? Mr. WESSEL: Well, this is one of those times when there are a lot of cross currents in the economy. The economy has definitely slowed significantly. The auto industry is hurting, housing is hurting even worse. But as we saw in last week's unemployment report, the other parts of the economy are doing okay. The service sector is producing more jobs, enough more jobs so that net employment is up. The Fed is pretty optimistic. It thinks this slow patch is temporary and we're going to come out of it. The bond market is not persuaded. They think the Fed is seeing the economy through rose-colored glasses. And as soon as they figure out that things are really going to be bad, they're going to start cutting interest rates. Not today, but some time next year. MONTAGNE: But you said the Fed is optimistic. Mr. WESSEL: Right. The Fed does see a slowdown of the economy. It actually welcomes a slowdown in the economy. It thought the economy was getting a little ahead of itself and we we're going to get inflation unless things slowed down. It doesn't think this soft patch will last very long. It saw the good news in last week's employment report. And it is a little worried about inflationary pressures. You know, that's the thing that the Fed is charged with avoiding, inflation. They see a little quickening of price pressures and they want to head that off. The bond market thinks the Fed just has it wrong. MONTAGNE: Well, what about that? You said just a little upping of prices. Is that really inflation? Mr. WESSEL: Well, in a historical sense we're in a period of very low inflation. And the new Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, wants to be sure we keep it that way. So he didn't panic when oil prices went up. But there has a been a quickening of the pace of price increases. It's easier for businesses to raise prices. There's a little upward pressure on wages. And what he's trying to do is say we're not going to let that get out of control and so that's why he's seeming sort of tough on inflation. It's actually pretty ironic because when he took the job, the bond market thought this guy was going to be too weak-kneed on inflation, and now they think he may be a little bit too strong armed. MONTAGNE: One thing, David, when Ben Bernanke first took over, we spoke about him being plain spoken. That was sort of a difference between him as a Fed chairman and Greenspan. Why does the bond market apparently not actually believe what he's saying? Mr. WESSEL: Well, that's a great question, Renee. I think that the bond market and investors in general are having a little trouble getting used to the new Fed chairman. It's sort of a learning experience. And when he says something, they interpret it as if Alan Greenspan was saying it. So at the end of 2000, the Fed was talking tough about inflation, but then at the beginning of 2001, they started cutting interest rates and rates came down pretty fast. So the bond market thinks that's what Bernanke is doing now. He's talking tough but he's actually going to act differently. And he actually doesn't believe in that kind of thing. He thinks you should say what you think, and he's having a hard time convincing the bond market that's really what he's doing. MONTAGNE: But he's convinced you? Mr. WESSEL: Well, yes, he has convinced me. I think that whether or not Mr. Bernanke has the right economic forecast is beyond my competence. But I am convinced that he is adopting a kind of call-it-as-you-see-it approach. And if he says that he sees no need to cut interest rates right away because he thinks the economy is going to pick up and he's worried about inflation, I take him at his word.

I'm Michele Norris. Retail sales jumped sharply last month, the increase was bigger than expected. Storeowners obviously hope that trend will continue through the holidays. And as they did last year, they're expecting more of their sales to come from gift cards. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY: At the Fashion Valley Shopping Mall in San Diego, Patti Fogerty(ph) is taking a breather. Big bags from department stores cluster around her feet. Many of the gifts, Fogerty is buying this year don't need a big bag though; they fit easily in a pocket. So far, Fogerty has purchased gift cards for eight of the people on her list. Ms. PATTI FOGERTY: I've got Borders. I've got McDonalds. I've got Jack in the Box. I've got Macy's. So I don't have to guess what they want. HORSLEY: Fogerty says the cards are a cinch to wrap. And they don't require a special trip to the post office to deliver. She's hoping to get a gift card in her own stocking from Bloomingdale's. Another shopper, Jody Swifko(ph) says she loves getting gift cards from her family. Ms. JODY SWIFKO: I'm kind of picky. So no one really knows what really to get me, and I live cross-country from my family. So it's better that they just send me that or cash. But compared - yeah. HORSLEY: Swifko says gift cards are actually better than cash because she won't just use them to pay the bills. But for some traditionalists like Trent Sanderson(ph), the cards are a little bit -Mr. TRENT SANDERSON: Impersonal. You know, especially like if you give that to your mother, and she opens it up, and you know, she wants that - something from you - you know? So I, traditionally, try not to go for the gift card. At the same time, it'd be nice if I got a give card. I guess it - when you're dealing with the younger generation, you know, they want that, the older generation doesn't. HORSLEY: But according to a survey by the National Retail Federation, gift cards are increasingly popular with shoppers of all ages. Spokesman Scott Krugman expects gift card purchases to approach $25 billion this holiday season. That's a whopping 34 percent increase from just a year ago. Mr. SCOTT KRUGMAN (National Retail Federation): I think in the past, gift cards were looked upon with a little bit of disdain that lazy man's gift. Oh, they couldn't think of anything else to get me so they got me a gift card. That's stigma is gone away. And we're seeing gift card products become much more creative. You can personalize them. You can add photos. And I think, people are actually enjoying buying gift cards as well as receiving them. HORSLEY: For retailers, the cards can be big sellers without taking up a lot shelf space or going out of style. And Krugman says at some chains like Starbucks, customers buy cards for themselves. Mr. KRUGMAN: We can certainly see more restaurants and grocery stores getting into the business of reusable gift cards, not to be used as gifts, but to be used for one's own purpose as far as keeping track of their budget. HORSLEY: Buying your own gift card may be the ultimate self-indulgence. But mall shopper Nick Amaro(ph) says even when the card comes from someone else, it does give the recipient a welcome element of control. Mr. NICK AMARO: You know, I know I've gotten shirts before, however, modern day might be from American Eagle or one of these Abercrombie. It just doesn't fit the fat, old dad like me. So, you know, I got to stay within my own lines. HORSLEY: Amaro calls gift cards, the easy way out. And it's a way more and more holiday shoppers are choosing this year.

And this just in from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Bah humbug. The national delinquency rate for mortgage payments is up, and the bankers aren't happy. MARKETPLACE's Amy Scott is with us. Amy, what about this rise in delinquencies? AMY SCOTT: Well, bah humbug indeed. A big part of it is higher interest rates. The largest increase in delinquencies was among sub-prime borrowers with those adjustable-rate mortgages. More than 13 percent of those homeowners missed payments between July and September. That's up from a little over 12 percent in the previous quarter. These are people who maybe otherwise couldn't get a mortgage, so they take out loans with those initially low teaser rates that then go up over time. And now that those rates are rising, people who may have already been stretched thin are finding it harder to make their payments. CHADWICK: And how about the slowdown in the housing market? SCOTT: Well, that definitely plays into it. Even people with fixed interest rates are falling behind more often these days. Mike Fratantoni is a senior economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. He says sluggish sales and falling home prices make it tougher for people to get out of mortgage trouble. Mr. MIKE FRATANTONI (Mortgage Bankers Association): Someone, if they lose their job and they find they're unable to make their mortgage payment, during the boom we've had the past couple of years, it was much easier for them to sell the home, pay off the mortgage, and we never saw that as a delinquency in our statistics. Now that - and particularly in some areas of the country, that's more difficult, given the deceleration in the market we've seen. SCOTT: That scenario is fairly common in an area like the upper Midwest, where the manufacturing sector has been hard hit, and in parts of the South that are still recovering from last year's hurricanes. Mississippi had the highest delinquency rate overall, twice the national average. Louisiana wasn't far behind. So economic conditions are obviously a factor as well. But I should point out that even with delinquencies on the rise, the national rate is still at about the 20-year average. Delinquencies had fallen substantially during the housing boom, so economists don't seem all that concerned. CHADWICK: And what about mortgage applications now? SCOTT: They're on the rise. Last week, apparently, they rose to their highest level in a year, and that's partly because of all those people with adjustable-rate mortgages refinancing to try to lock in lower, long-term rates. And long-term mortgage rates have been falling lately, as have home prices in many areas, and that does seem to be getting some people back into the markets. The Mortgage Bankers Association is predicting now that the housing market will be back on its feet by the middle of next year. And later today on MARKETPLACE, we'll have another conversation from the corner office with Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz. CHADWICK: Well, he's worth listening to. Amy Scott, thank you.

The U. S. trade deficit has hit a record. The Commerce Department says the deficit hit $225 billion from July through September. Joining me now is John Dimsdale of MARKETPLACE, and John, what's causing this record deficit? JOHN DIMSDALE: Well most recently, it's from the higher price of imported oil, which is just adding to the flow of dollars going overseas, and the secondary impact of that oil price is a growing deficit caused by car imports. U. S. carmakers are struggling with their line of gas-guzzlers, so foreign cars are really popular now. And of course, Chinese imports continue to flood into this country, as anybody who shops at Wal-Mart knows. The U. S. deficit with that country alone was $64 billion in the third quarter. BRAND: Well, how much should we worry about this growing trade imbalance? DIMSDALE: Well, it depends on who you ask. Our trade's been running deeply in the red for 10 years now, and it's being sustained by foreign investors willing to put their money in the U. S. economy. But the size of the deficit is making a lot of economists nervous. If foreigners decide to put their money elsewhere, it would create a lot of problems. For one thing, the Fed would have to raise interest rates dramatically to keep attracting that overseas investment. BRAND: And last week, a group of U. S. officials were in Beijing. They were talking economics with Chinese leaders there. Did they bring home any new agreements? DIMSDALE: They did not. China didn't agree to raise the value of its currency or lower tariffs on U. S. exports. But you know, Global Insight economist, Nigel Gault says that the U. S. has to be careful what it wishes for. Mr. NIGEL GAULT (Economist, Global Insight): It's really in nobody's interest to get a very abrupt change in the relationship with China. Because, don't forget, that the relationship, to some extant, benefits both sides because China is getting export demand from the U. S. But at the same token, China is funneling back the funds to the U. S. to finance the huge current account deficit. BRAND: And John, let's look ahead for a bit. How long can this trade imbalance continue? DIMSDALE: Well, that's really the $200-billion question because we're in uncharted territory here. If you had told economists 10 years ago, that our trade deficit would be almost seven percent of the entire economy, most would've said that's impossible without some sort of collapse. Now Gault is one of several economists predicting that the trade deficit will be coming down, especially given the moderation in oil prices. And as the U. S. economy slows, he expects the American appetite for Chinese imports to ease up. So we are hearing people say that, you know, the worst is over. But I bet that they're crossing their fingers, hoping that they're right. Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, half a century ago, Paris got rid of most of its streetcars to make way for automobiles. Now the streetcars are coming back, and we'll find out why.

If you had told economists 10 years ago, that our trade deficit would be almost seven percent of the entire economy, most would've said that's impossible without some sort of collapse.  Now Gault is one of several economists predicting that the trade deficit will be coming down, especially given the moderation in oil prices. And as the U. S. economy slows, he expects the American appetite for Chinese imports to ease up.  So we are hearing people say that, you know, the worst is over. But I bet that they're crossing their fingers, hoping that they're right.  Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, half a century ago, Paris got rid of most of its streetcars to make way for automobiles. Now the streetcars are coming back, and we'll find out why.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. The financial markets hate inflation. They also hate sudden and unexpected changes in economic conditions. So investors were caught off guard this morning by news that a key inflation measure rose at its fastest rate in three decades last month. But as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, economists say, today's report probably overstates the real inflation threat. JIM ZARROLI: The Labor Department said the producer price index rose by 2 percent last month. That was partly because energy prices were higher. But even when food and fuel costs were excluded, the increase was still 1. 3 percent - the biggest jump since the last days of the Carter administration. Those are big increases, but several economists said the numbers were probably somewhat distorted. They noted that the index had fallen or stayed flat throughout much of the fall, so it was probably playing catch-up. What would account for that kind of month-to-month volatility? David Weese, chief economist at Standard & Poor's, says much of it has to do with sales of autos, especially light trucks like SUVs. Mr. DAVID WEESE (Standard & Poor's): The pattern of rebates from month to month is just bouncing so much that it's really swinging the overall index. ZARROLI: Weese says Ford and GM had a lot of unsold vehicles in September and October, so they had to reduce the prices they charge dealers. By November, they had cut production, so they had fewer cars to sell, and they could charge more. It may seem hard to believe that SUV sales could sway the index so much, but Weese says they do. When you account for these distortions, the inflation rate turns out to be a lot lower than today's numbers make it seem, says Wachovia Senior Economist Mark Vitner. Mr. MARK VITNER (Senior Economist, Wachovia): We're still seeing relatively modest inflationary pressures. The overall inflation rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2. 5 percent. ZARROLI: Vitner says that's pretty good for an economy that's been growing as long as this one has. But he also says it's at the upper range of what Federal Reserve officials like to see, which means there's less and less likelihood that Fed policy makers will be willing to cut interest rates anytime soon.

This is one of the busiest travel days of the year, so don't look for a lot of cheer at the nation's airports. Denver is just re-opening after the blizzard. Holiday travelers all over the country are going to be feeling the ripple effects even after Christmas. We're joined by MARKETPLACE's John Dimsdale. How is it out there, John? JOHN DIMSDALE: Well, the airlines are asking people not even to come to the airport unless they've confirmed that their flight will be taking off. Even though your plans might not take you anywhere near Denver, your airplane could still be frozen on the ground there. United Airlines alone has canceled 2,000 flights, so you can imagine the lines at counters and the busy signals when you try calling for information or rebooking. Some passengers can't get new flights to their destinations until next Wednesday, so there's going to be some disappointed families at Christmas dinner. And it's not just here in the U. S. One of the biggest hubs in Europe, London's Heathrow Airport, has been socked in by thick fog for several days now, and it's not expected to lift until the weekend. So it's no better for travelers in Europe. CHADWICK: With so much travel now and with so many airlines in financial trouble, you have to wonder about what this weekend is going to mean for their profits, all these complications. DIMSDALE: Yeah. We've talked before about how the airlines cut back on flights to fill up their planes, but fewer empty seats makes it harder for people to find alternatives. This blizzard happened at the wrong time in the wrong place for United and Frontier, which will be hit with millions in lost revenue and extra expenses to re-route their passengers. Estimates are United will lose about $10 million. Frontier, which recently lowered its earnings forecast from a break-even to a loss, could be hit almost as hard, and the Denver Airport will lose nearly a half a million in landing-fee revenue and have some horrendous extra overtime and plowing bills. CHADWICK: Not good for the airlines or the passengers. DIMSDALE: You know, in the old days, the airlines used to treat their passengers to meals and even hotel rooms when flights were delayed or canceled, but in today's cut-throat, cost-cutting competition, that just doesn't fit in the business model. Passengers have had to fend for themselves. They're turning airport corridors into dorm rooms. It sounds like it's going to be that way for a while. Coming up later today on MARKETPLACE, a subject dear to our hearts: the history of radio. More specifically, the role music played in shaping modern radio and creating an industry.

It's probably the last thing on your mind right now, but retailers are hoping you have a few more trips to the mall in you. A report out today, says sales during the weekend before Christmas were strong, but lower than expected. I'm joined now by MARKETPLACE's Janet Babin. And Janet, so I guess we didn't spend enough for retailers to be happy this Christmas season. JANET BABIN: Yeah, Madeleine. It depends on how you look at it, but according to one benchmark, sales on so-called Super Saturday - that's the Saturday before Christmas - they were strong. Purchases totaled $8. 7 billion, and that's 60 percent higher than the same day last year. And also, combined sales over the weekend passed $16 billion, that's a lot of shopping, and that's 22 percent higher than last year. These numbers come from Shopper Track's national retail sales estimate. BRAND: Well, that sounds pretty good, billions and billions of dollars, but just not good enough? BABIN: Yeah. It turns out that analysts and retailers had forecast that sales would be even higher than that. Consumers, it turns out, spent more the Friday after Thanksgiving than they did on the Saturday before Christmas, and that's not what analysts had hoped or expected. So even though it was a big weekend for retailers, overall, the season seems to be coming up a bit short in terms of traffic and overall sales. And you have consider that a lot of stores end up doing a good portion of their business in the month or so before the winter holidays, so even if sales are off just a little bit, it can have a big effect on the bottom line. BRAND: Okay, so I bet a lot of people got those gift cards for Christmas and Hanukkah, and retailers are hoping that they go out and spend and use those gift cards maybe a bit more, right? BABIN: That's right because, you know, even though gift cards, you know, they're purchased usually before the holiday, they aren't counted on most retailers balance sheets until after they're spent. So a lot of stores just realize now they have they have to start counting January as part of that holiday season. Also, as you mentioned, because who goes and spends the gift card? I mean, I don't think I've ever managed to spend just the amount on that card. BRAND: Right, right. I always spend a little bit more. Any speculation on why consumers held back this year? BABIN: Well, there are a lot of theories, especially in the timing. You know, Hanukkah cam earlier this year than last year, and Christmas fell on a Monday. I also spoke to a few shoppers in the Northeast and Midwest who said they just weren't motivated this year. It's been pretty warm in places like New York and Cleveland, and people were out enjoying the weather instead of shopping, but you guessed it, Madeleine. That might have led to an increase in online shopping. According to Com-store Networks(ph), our online shopping was up 26 percent this year over last.

That's lending money to the poorest to the world's poor. Most of that money comes from philanthropic groups, but that's beginning to change. High tech millionaires are providing venture capital, as NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports. WENDY KAUFMAN: Mike Murray, a former senior executive at Microsoft, remembers the first time he met Muhammad Yunus. Though Murray had never heard of Yunus, he was immediately struck by the intelligence and commitment of the Bangladeshi banker. Mr. MIKE MURRAY (Former Senior Executive, Microsoft): At the time, he was working with two and a half million women in 40,000 villages, providing these tiny little $50 to $100 micro-credit loans, and they would lift themselves out of poverty. KAUFMAN: A woman might use the loan to buy a sewing machine. After a year, she'd own the machine and could expand her business. Yunus explained she'd be able to buy healthier food for her kids, uniforms so they could go to school and so much more. Mr. MURRAY: The whole thing was extraordinarily interesting to me because I'm an inherent champion of free market economics, and here he was using the same principles at the bottom of the economic pyramid and answering a question I'd always had in the back of my mind, which was what about this horrible poverty all around the world? What are we going to do with it? He told me right there. KAUFMAN: Today, Murray is the chairman of Unitas, a non-profit micro-lending accelerator. It provides seed money along with technical and managerial expertise to help micro-lending institutions grow and become self-sustaining. In India, for example, one Unitas partner has seen its portfolio grow from 7,000 loans to more than 300,000. Unitas also sponsor some micro-credit investment fund for high wealth individuals. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, is one investor. Last year, the eBay founder gave Tufts University a $100 million gift to create a microfinance investment fund. But perhaps the most important development came this past September. Pension fund giant TIAA-CREF bought $43 million worth of stock in a global microfinance fund. It was the first investment of its kind, says David Sathertweit(ph), the CEO of a micro-bank lending in central America. Mr. DAVID SATHERWEIT: Pension funds are really the Holy Grail in terms of investment capital because they're so big and they invest over the long term. So to see a top 10 global pension fund make a direct investment in a micro-bank was a very, very big deal, and that's why I call it the watershed moment in terms of microfinance turning the corner towards a more commercial approach. KAUFMAN: Ten years ago, there were perhaps only a dozen microfinance institutions that could provide financial returns that would be attractive to commercial investors. Today, there are many more, says Shari Berenbach, executive director of the non-profit Calvert Foundation, a socially responsible investment organization. Ms. SHARI BERENBACH (Calvert Foundation): People will often say there's anywhere from 100 to 200 of the 10,000 microfinance groups were you can invest and have some level of confidence. KAUFMAN: Individual investors using mainstream brokers can put as little as of thousand dollars into a Calvert Foundation micro-lending fund, earning a guaranteed rate of return of up to three percent. There has been some debate over the wisdom of for-profit investing in microfinance. Some have suggested that while philanthropists are focused on the borrowers and their best interest, for-profit lenders might not be. But Scott Budde of TIAA-CREF says it doesn't have to be an either-or proposition. Mr. SCOTT BUDDE (TIAA-CREF): There are examples of profitable microfinance organizations that have maintained a strong social focus. KAUFMAN: Budde adds there isn't enough philanthropic capital to go around, so it makes sense for micro-lenders to turn to private capital. Mr. BUDDE: That enables microfinance to reach more people, to expand the range of lending services that they offer, to expand in other countries and other regions. So the commercial protest has really significant benefits to it.

I'm Madeleine Brand. NOAH ADAMS, host: And I'm Noah Adams. Housing prices in the U. S. fell this year for the first time in more than three decades. That's one indication of the breadth of the housing slump. And here's another - the number of houses and condos sitting unsold on the market has doubled, and even tripled in many areas. NPR's Chris Arnold has a report. CHRIS ARNOLD: On the sidewalk outside city hall in Boston, Shandra Kassernini(ph) is having a smoke break. And he does contract computer work for the city, and for what they pay him, he says, it's been tough to find a house or condo to buy even with prices coming down some. Mr. SHANDRA KASSERNINI: But I would say like, you know, probably like in 5 to 10 percent a little bit, I think yeah, if they came down. It will still go down a little bit before I think it stabilizes. ARNOLD: A lot of would-be homebuyers are thinking the same thing, that's one reason sales are down. That keeps more houses on the market, the so-called housing inventory, which also makes buyers feel like there are plenty of homes to look at and no rush to buy one. So the question is when does that cycle reverse itself? Mr. ROBERT TOLL (Toll Brothers, Inc. ): How do we get out of this? By working our way through the inventory. ARNOLD: Robert Toll is the chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers, Inc. , one of the nation's biggest homebuilders. The number of new homes being built has fallen more than 30 percent from last year's peak. And Toll says once the supply of homes on the market starts to fall, he thinks the stage is set for a recovery because the underlying economy is still very strong. Mr. TOLL: In my 40 years in business, I have never seen a housing downturn, let alone as sharp as this one has proven to be, at the same time that you have very low unemployment, decent job creation, the stock market reaching new highs and interest rates near the bottom. ARNOLD: Economists agree that there is something different about this latest surge and decline in the housing market. One difference is that more people were buying up houses and condos as speculators trying to make some quick money. Another difference is the flood of first time homebuyers with little or no savings, and even shaky credit, lenders were very eager to offer them so-called subprime loans. Economist William Wheaton is a director of MIT's Center for Real Estate. Mr. WILLIAM WHEATON (MIT's Center for Real Estate): At any time, we have five million renters moving over to owning, and the home ownership, the rate going from 65 to 70 percent. That puts a huge pressure on house prices. ARNOLD: But Wheaton thinks that well is pretty dry. And he takes a more negative view of the underlying fundamentals than Robert Toll does. Wheaton says interest rates, unemployment, and the stock market may all be good, but he says wages have been stagnant, the population isn't growing that fast so he doesn't see a big surge in demand anytime soon. Mr. WHEATON: Most economists think we're in for a fairly significant period of stagnating, gradually falling house prices. We just built a lot of houses in the last five years, more than we need. A lot of them have been second homes. Most economists now are not predicting a quick rebound. ARNOLD: Wheaton says the downturn will be worse in areas in the south and west of the country, where some experts expect prices to keep declining well into 2008. There will be variation from city to city. Many economists say prices in the once-booming markets may fall 15 percent or so peak to trough, but not off a cliff. But any drop is bad news for all those people with bad credit who've taken out subprime mortgages. Twelve percent of those homeowners are now late on their payments. Teaser rates are adjusting upwards by hundreds of dollars a month. Mark Zandi is chief economist with Moody's Economy. com. Mr. MARK ZANDI (Moody's Economy. com): I suspect the turnover of these households will end up turning back the keys to the lender and go back to renting. So we will see a decline in homeownership over the course of the year. ARNOLD: With house prices down, banks are now tightening their credit standards. And so even though interest rates have been falling again lately, Zandi says the people in the most trouble with the worst credit often can't refinance into another loan. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  This is DAY TO DAY. I'm Madeleine Brand.  NOAH ADAMS, host:  And I'm Noah Adams.  Housing prices in the U. S. fell this year for the first time in more than three decades. That's one indication of the breadth of the housing slump. And here's another - the number of houses and condos sitting unsold on the market has doubled, and even tripled in many areas.  NPR's Chris Arnold has a report.  CHRIS ARNOLD: On the sidewalk outside city hall in Boston, Shandra Kassernini(ph) is having a smoke break. And he does contract computer work for the city, and for what they pay him, he says, it's been tough to find a house or condo to buy even with prices coming down some.  Mr. SHANDRA KASSERNINI: But I would say like, you know, probably like in 5 to 10 percent a little bit, I think yeah, if they came down. It will still go down a little bit before I think it stabilizes.  ARNOLD: A lot of would-be homebuyers are thinking the same thing, that's one reason sales are down. That keeps more houses on the market, the so-called housing inventory, which also makes buyers feel like there are plenty of homes to look at and no rush to buy one. So the question is when does that cycle reverse itself?  Mr. ROBERT TOLL (Toll Brothers, Inc. ): How do we get out of this? By working our way through the inventory.  ARNOLD: Robert Toll is the chairman and CEO of Toll Brothers, Inc. , one of the nation's biggest homebuilders. The number of new homes being built has fallen more than 30 percent from last year's peak. And Toll says once the supply of homes on the market starts to fall, he thinks the stage is set for a recovery because the underlying economy is still very strong.  Mr. TOLL: In my 40 years in business, I have never seen a housing downturn, let alone as sharp as this one has proven to be, at the same time that you have very low unemployment, decent job creation, the stock market reaching new highs and interest rates near the bottom.

They have doubled their investments over the last year to as much as $4 billion, according to some experts. Clean energy backers hope all this will be good for the planet and for their wallets. NPR's Laura Sydell reports. LAURA SYDELL: Amyris Biotechnologies develops microbes that have all kinds of possibilities. Among them is their uses in (unintelligible) to turn sugar into biofuel. The company's co-founder Jack Newman says his product works better than corn-based ethanol as a replacement for oil or gasoline. Mr. JACK NEWMAN (Amyris Biotechnologies): Anything that you can make out of a barrel of oil or crack out of a barrel of oil - to use some of the industry's lingo - we can crack out of a bushel of sugar. SYDELL: The only thing that still needs refining, says Newman, is the cost. It's still more expensive to make fuel from sugar than from oil. To work out that problem, Newman says his company needed capital for research. So they went out with open palms to visit a few venture capitalists, and surprise -Mr. NEWMANN: We'll we knocked on doors. The unusual part was that they opened up. SYDELL: This fall, Amyris received $20 million in venture capital funding. The reason that doors opened up so quickly wasn't just that Amyris' technology has potential, the timing was right, says Greg Blonder, a general partner in the venture capital firm, Morganthaler Ventures. Mr. GREG BLONDER (Morganthaler Ventures): With oil peaking and instabilities around the world, there's always a chance that a stable source of energy becomes unstable. And that's an opportunity for a startup to take a technology and insert it. SYDELL: Blonder says his firm has increased investments to clean energy startups and that's true of the entire venture capital world. According to Blonder, last year about 15 percent of all venture capital money in the U. S. went into green technology, up from 7 percent the year before. Stephan Dolezalek, a managing director at VantagePoint Venture Partners, says it isn't just the higher price of oil that venture capitalists are watching. He says consumer awareness of the growing threat of climate change is creating a ripe market. Mr. STEPHAN DOLEZALEK (VantagePoint Venture Partners): We're seeing more people deciding that they're going to live their lives differently, that they going to replace their incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescents, that they're going to look at putting solar on the roof. And so the whole consumer movement part of this is something that we're paying a lot of attention to. SYDELL: Dolezalek says venture capitalists are spreading the money around to startup some solar, biofuel, wind, and cleaner coal energy, but the scattershot investment strategy in green technologies has its skeptics. Like Douglas Lloyd, co-founder of Venture Business Research, a firm that provides data to venture capitalists. Mr. DOUGLAS LLOYD (Venture Business Research): We've seen investors saying well, look we'll just invest in 50 clean tech companies because, at least, 10 will work. That's where, I suppose, we get a little bit concerned. SYDELL: There's also concern among investors about mercurial politicians. Venture capitalist, Dolezalek says the success of many clean tech businesses is predicated on consistent environmental laws and tax credits from state, local and federal governments. Mr. DOLEZALEK: As compared to a situation that says well, it's here now, but it may change dramatically if the next administration moves in. SYDELL: Still, even the Bush administration, which has close ties to the oil industry is responding to the winds of change, with policies such as those that encourage bringing ethanol to gas stations. Dolezalek and other venture capitalists are betting that those winds are only going to pick up in the coming decade. Laura Sydell, NPR News.

To find out what the New Year will bring, NPR's Scott Horsley grilled the experts for some gas price predictions. SCOTT HORSLEY: If you're looking for someone who follows gas prices closely, you don't have to look very far. Almost anyone can tell you what it cost to fill the tank this week, and drivers like Nick Barrard(ph), Matt Derek(ph) and Parker Fino(ph) have a little doubt about what prices will do next year. Mr. NICK FERRARD (Driver): Go up, go up dramatically, and it's going to go a lot higher. Mr. MATT DEREK (Driver): At least a dollar or two higher. Mr. PARKER FINO (Driver): I think that they're going to continue to keep rising, and we're not going to see any relief. HORSLEY: Professional price watchers are a little more cautious. Gasoline prices are so volatile, the Auto Club's Jeff Sundstrom has sworn off guessing at any particular price. Mr. JEFF SUNDSTROM (Auto Club): It's been our experience that those who predict specific prices are invariably proved wrong. And so we generally talk about trends, which we believe are more helpful to the typical consumer in terms of their family budgeting. HORSLEY: And the trend that AAA expects is that gasoline prices will hold fairly steady for the few months of the new year, then begin decline in the spring - first on the West Coast and pretty soon across the country. That's been the pattern in recent years. But Sundstrom hopes the peak price this coming year will not be as high as in 2006. Mr. SUNDSTROM: We're hopeful that if the oil price stays around $62 per barrel and we don't have some cataclysmic event, either manmade or natural, that we will not see return of a $3 average gas price across the U. S. HORSLEY: The price of gasoline briefly topped $3 a gallon in each of the last two years, thanks to both manmade and natural cataclysms. In 2005, it was the Gulf Coast hurricanes. This past year, one could blame a series of problems in oil-producing countries like Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela, as well as refining challenges here at home as the switch was made to ethanol from the gasoline additive known as MTBE. As the year comes to a close, OPEC has tightened the oil test and is threatening to cut more supply in February. Analyst Doug MacIntyre of the Energy Department's Information Arm says that could leave oil producers outside of OPEC hard pressed to meet demand. Mr. DOUG MACINTYRE (Information Arm, Energy Department): It would mean that oil markets would likely remain tight. Our forecast has oil averaging somewhere in the 64, $65 per barrel range. Maybe slightly below where it averaged in 2006, but still above where we are right now. HORSLEY: But MacIntyre admits there a lot of unknowns that could affect the price of oil and gasoline, from how quickly new supplies are developed to how cold it gets this winter. Mr. MCYNTIRE: Probably the largest question mark is the global economy. HORSLEY: A stronger economy means more demand for oil, and therefore higher prices. So far, consumers' demand for oil and gasoline has remained surprisingly strong, even as prices have climbed. MacIntyre notes that while a 25 cent jump in the price of gasoline gets a lot of people angry, it will only cost the average driver about $150 a year. Mr. MACINTYRE: For many people, that is a substantial amount. But for a lot of other people, you know, they spend probably a lot more than that drinking coffee. HORSLEY: Of course, rising energy prices can have ripple effects. Starbucks cited fuel cost as a factor in October when it raised the price of coffee by about a nickel a cup.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average starts the day up more than 1,700 point since the beginning of the year. Major stock indices fell slightly in yesterday's trading despite reports showing the economy is more robust than previously thought. Stock exchanges will close for the New Year holiday. The NASDAQ will remain closed Tuesday in honor of the funeral of former President Gerald Ford. Economists were fretting earlier this year about a drop in housing sales, a surge in energy prices and slowing economic growth. But they're not shedding so many tears now, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI: If nothing else, 2006 will be remembered as the year when the stock market regained its mojo, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally broke out of its post-9/11 stupor and began setting records again. On Wall Street these days, there is optimism to spare. Mr. DONALD MARRON (Lightyear Capital): Basically the economy is in solid shape. ZARROLI: That's Donald Marron, the former chairman and CEO of Payne Webber, who now runs a private equity fund called Lightyear Capital. Marron has some big concerns about certain systemic problems in the U. S. economy. He talks about rising wage inequality, for instance. But Marron says if you go out right now and talk to businesses, you hear a lot of positive news. Profits are strong, business is good. Mr. MARRON: When you look at it from that point of view - and I've talked to a number of CEOs and people doing that - things look okay. ZARROLI: Economist James Glassman of JPMorgan Chase agrees. Glassman says the economy has had some tough breaks this year. Energy prices rose, and though they've since fallen back, they're still high. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, and above all, the housing market is suffering badly, especially in some once overheated markets like southern Florida and Nevada. And yet, Glassman says, most of the cylinders in the United States economy are still firing. Mr. JAMES GLASSMAN (Economist, JPMorgan Chase): Corporate profits are at record levels. I mean if you look away from the building business, there are just a lot of reasons to believe that we're on a good track. ZARROLI: Glassman says one reason for optimism is that the Federal Reserve has apparently achieved what's called a soft landing. In other words, by steadily raising interest rates, it's managed to slow down growth just enough to contain inflation without causing a recession. As a result, the Fed was able to stop raising interest rates over the summer and to leave rates where they are since then. Mr. GLASSMAN: Back in the spring everyone was talking about stagflation - lower growth, more inflation. Now because of what's been happening - lower inflation - people are more optimistic about what could happen next year in growth and so the equity market's responding to that. ZARROLI: And yet not everyone is so positive. Nouriel Rubini is a professor of economics at New York University. He's been decidedly bearish about where the economy is going. Professor NOURIEL RUBINI (New York University): That was one of the earlier suggestions, there is a recession next year. But many more now are worried about it, I would say. ZARROLI: Rubini says the residential housing business is in a deep downturn. Energy prices have come down since the summer. But he says oil is still selling for about $60 a barrel and that makes doing business more expensive. Rubini is especially worried about consumers. He says many consumers are tapped out and heavily in debt. The rise in interest rates make some kinds of credit, like home equity loans, more expensive, which will only worsen consumer's plate. Prof. RUBINI: I see it as a tipping point of consumer burnout that could lead to this hard landing. ZARROLI: Meanwhile, he says, real wages haven't been growing very much in recent years, and the labor market was soft in 2006. Although unemployment was low, the number of jobs created each months was less than spectacular. One other unknown right now is the weaker dollar. It's lost substantial ground this year, especially against European currencies. That makes it more expensive for Americans to buy imported goods, which can add to inflation pressure. But it's also good for exporters because it makes U. S. goods more attractive overseas. Like so much else about the economy this year, the impact of a weaker dollar could go either way.
