NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The housing market recovery kicked into high gear last year. And that's in large part because at the start of the year, back last winter, it was just a great time to buy a house. Interest rates were at record lows. Home prices hadn't risen that much yet in many areas. Lots of respected economists were saying now is the time to buy. And, we saw a strong revival in demand from home-buyers. DAVID BLITZER: The results are housing prices continue to go up 13. 6 percent over the last 12 months. ARNOLD: David Blitzer is an economist with S&P - which publishes the closely watched Case-Shiller Home Price Index. He thinks though such big price gains are not going to be sustainable in the coming year. He points out interest rates rose in the second half of the year, which makes monthly mortgage payments more expensive for homebuyers. That's cooled things of a bit. Home sales have slowed and prices aren't rising less quickly. BLITZER: By this time next year, I think we'll be looking at home prices that are still going up but more likely single digits - six, you know, five, six, seven percent annual increase, not 13 and a half. ARNOLD: Still, if the labor market keeps improving and more Americans get back to work, Blitzer thinks that should help sustain a healthy housing market. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

One of the biggest was that increasing trade with Mexico would increase the incomes of Mexican people. Well, the middle class did grow in Mexico over the past two decades and so did Mexico's ultra rich. In 1992, when NAFTA was negotiated, there were only seven Mexican billionaires. Two years later, when the pact went into effect, there were 24. As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, Mexico now claims the richest man in the world and one of the highest income gaps in the world. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: He's richer than Bill Gates or Warren Buffett and has six times the wealth than Mark Zuckerberg, but nowhere near the fame. He's Carlos Slim Helu, 73 years old, Mexican, and the richest man in the world. Much of his wealth comes from his cellphone company, America Movil, the largest in Latin America. His reach also touches the U. S. , where his investments include a piece of The New York Times. The rest of Mexico's uber-rich are even less-known. They made their riches in mining, TV, Coca-Cola and beer. Dolia Estevez, a contributor to Forbes magazine, says many of Mexico's 15 billionaires are old, in their 70s and 80s, and like to keep a low profile. DOLIA ESTEVEZ: A lot of people avoid publicity, especially in a country like Mexico, where there are so much security problems. KAHN: But Estevez says there are a lot of newcomers to the club, too, five in the last year, most of those attribute their wealth to the company FEMSA, the largest Coca-Cola distributor in the world and Latin America's largest convenience store chain. Economist Luis de la Calle, who helped negotiate NAFTA for Mexico, says these billionaires have gotten wealthier in the past 20 years by what was not in NAFTA. The trade pact specifically excluded opening the telephone, television and transportation sectors. He says in hindsight, that was a mistake; NAFTA should have been more ambitious. LUIS DE LA CALLE: The sectors we did not open benefit the few. KAHN: Many of today's billionaires benefitted from those closed markets and built some of Mexico's most lucrative monopolies. Carlos Slim owns 70 percent of all cell service in Mexico and 80 percent of landlines. In TV, Ricardo Salinas Pliego and his family own TV Azteca, one of Mexico's two television networks; billionaire Emilio Azcarraga owns the other, Televisa. Economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O says it wasn't the intention of NAFTA or the government to create these billionaires. ROGELIO RAMIREZ DE LA O: If it had been planned, it wouldn't have come so perfect. KAHN: But he does say during the NAFTA negotiations, the government focused more on opening up the manufacturing sector, where jobs would be created. And de la O says the legacy of this wealth creation, inadvertent or not, continues to hold Mexico back. O: So at the end of the day, Mexico cannot grow, cannot compete because, among other reasons, it is being strangled by all these monopolies and oligopolies. KAHN: The top 10 percent in Mexico now own 40 percent of the country's wealth. But economist de la Calle counters that NAFTA did help narrow the gap between rich and poor. He says Mexicans are much better off now than they were 20 years ago. CALLE: Mexicans are now taller, they weigh more, they dress better, they're healthier. KAHN: And de la Calle says Mexicans now consume more. With NAFTA, prices went down and quality shot up for most goods, like washing machines, TVs and cars. But clearly not all Mexicans have enjoyed the consumer binge. Nearly half the country lives in poverty, earning less than $4 a day. And when it comes to banking, cellphones and television, Mexicans have limited access to credit at high rates. They pay some of the world's highest cellphone prices and have few broadcast TV choices. But when you ask most Mexicans on the street about billionaire Carlos Slim, many don't deny him his riches. At a downtown sports bar, fans cheer on Slim's soccer team during a recent game. Fan Manuel Jimenez says he's proud of Slim. MANUEL JIMENEZ: (Speaking foreign language)KAHN: He says it gives us a lot of pride that the richest man in the world is Mexican. It's true, says Eduardo Garcia, who runs the financial news website Sentido Comun, or Common Sense; most Mexicans admire Slim, who has given a lot of money to local causes and does not flaunt his wealth like many of Mexico's elite. Garcia says, however, the government has failed to regulate these industries dominated by billionaires. It should have done more to enforce the laws so these titans couldn't run roughshod over their competitors. EDUARDO GARCIA: If you look at the industries in which they have become these very wealthy and powerful people, they are industries controlled by either one or two companies. KAHN: According to Garcia's calculations, which differ from Forbes', there are at least 28 billionaires now in Mexico, and he says that's not counting those in private industry who do not have to publicly account for their wealth. Despite its flaws, Garcia credits NAFTA with putting Mexico on the world stage and opening up its rich and its economy to more scrutiny than ever before. Economist and NAFTA negotiator Luis de la Calle agrees. In fact, he argues that NAFTA and the stability it's given to Mexico will ultimately bring about a more egalitarian economy. CALLE: The NAFTA process is an economic policy that, in the end, has at its heart the interest of Mexicans, not the guys that have access to the government. KAHN: But de La Calle warns that 20 years is a short time to achieve the full benefits of NAFTA. He says it may take another two decades. Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Mexico City.

Regardless of where they stand on a possible extension, conservative and liberal economists both would like to see the government improve the underlying program. They're proposing changes that might help more people find work more quickly. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: At a small manufacturing company south of Boston, Evalise Pachenko(ph) is cleaning out the inside of a component for a heart pump. It's used in surgery and she's using a microscope to inspect the part. EVALISE PACHENKO: You see right there, you have to make sure it's clean and no fuzz around. ARNOLD: Six months ago, Pachenko was collecting unemployment. She got laid off working at a cardboard box manufacturer that went out of business, but a friend of hers told her about a job opening here at this much higher tech factory. It's called Machine, Inc. PACHENKO: My friend Rosemary said to apply and I applied and in a week, they called and I was really, really happy about that, instead of being home and collecting. ARNOLD: Is it more interesting than making cardboard boxes, or. . . PACHENKO: Yes, definitely. Yes, it is. ARNOLD: Economists say this is how unemployment benefits and the job market are supposed to work together. Pachenko has three young kids at home. Her partner's only making about $700 a month, so with the benefits she said a bridge that helped the family survive for nearly a year. Now she's got a better job with the same pay as she had before, but she's learning new skills and there's more room for growth. PACHENKO: You have to pay attention really because it's like, again, medical stuff and airplane stuff so it's interesting. I have training for, like, three months so I think doing good. ARNOLD: That's one way economists say the unemployment insurance program could be improved, helping people to get training while their collecting. DEAN BAKER: Community colleges have been, you know, a good investment that have enable people to get skills to get, you know, somewhat better-paying jobs. ARNOLD: Dean Baker is the co-director of the liberal-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. He says, though, many states don't do enough to support unemployed people getting that sort of training. He'd also like to see more of what's called work sharing. This is something that's reduced unemployment in Germany, actually. Basically, instead of laying people off, a company could just reduce hours for most of its workers. And for the time that they're not working, the government could then use unemployment money to pay them. And some conservatives like this idea, too. MICHAEL STRAIN: I would like for Congress to make it mandatory. ARNOLD: That's Michael Strain, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute. He says in 2012, Congress authorized this German-style work sharing option for employers, but it's only up and running in some states. Strain has other ideas, too. Some involved helping workers to get to areas where there are more jobs. STRAIN: In some of the states, the labor market is booming and healthy and unemployment is really low so I suggested that we offer relocation vouchers to the long term unemployed. You know, only to the people who want them so no one's being forced to move or anything, but, you know, we say, hey, look, you've been looking for a job for seven months and you haven't found one yet. Do you want us to cut you a check and you can move to North Dakota or move somewhere where the labor market is much healthier? ARNOLD: There are lots of other ideas, too. But as far as whether Congress should extend benefits when lawmakers come back next week, Michael Strain says yes. STRAIN: I think it's a mistake that Congress let the benefits expire. ARNOLD: For one, Strain says that long term unemployed workers are more likely to drop out of the work force and give up if they get cut off, but also, he says, there are still three times as many people looking for work as there are job openings so that means that hundreds of thousands of Americans just won't be able to find a job any time soon. STRAIN: Society is failing for them. Really, through no fault of their own. ARNOLD: Still, some other conservatives oppose extending benefits again. They're worried about the cost and also some feel that workers would be looking more aggressively without the extended benefits. Next week, Congress will be debating the issues when lawmakers return.

Democrats like New York's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, have made it a central talking point. President Obama himself delivered a big speech at the end of 2013 on what he called a relentless and damaging trend. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And that is a dangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility that has jeopardized middle class America's basic bargain that if you work hard, you have a chance to get ahead. CORNISH: But what exactly is income inequality? Ask six economists and you're likely to get six different answers. And we're going to ask Drew DeSilver of the Pew Research Center who spent a lot of time lately trying to measure it. Welcome to the program, Drew. DREW DESILVER: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So you've written that economists disagree on how much inequality there is and how to measure it so what are the most popular measurements for understanding inequality? DESILVER: Well, there's all kinds of ways that you can measure income inequality specifically without even getting into whether you should be measuring wealth or consumption inequality or any other kinds of economic inequality. But if you're just looking income, you have to decide whether you want to look at taxable income, total gross income, do you want to include things like Social Security payments or unemployment insurance and depending on which set of numbers you use, you'll come up with different answers, although no matter which income measurement you use, you will see a generally rising trend over time, particularly in recent years. CORNISH: So looking back, say, from the economic crash in 2008 to President Obama's speech last month, what has been the trend? Are we becoming more unequal and in what way? DESILVER: Well, I like to look at the numbers compiled by the University of California researcher named Manuel Saiz and according to his figures, in 2008, the top 1 percent of American families had 20. 9 percent of all income in the U. S. and by 2012, which is the most recent numbers he had, that had risen to 22. 5 percent. Now, when you look at the bottom 90 percent, they had almost 52 percent of the national income in 2008. That had fallen below half to 49. 6 percent as of 2012, which was the lowest in any of the years that Saiz had researched. CORNISH: So you mention measures for understanding inequality so just looking at income inequality specifically, but what about wealth? Talk about the difference there in those numbers. DESILVER: Well, when you look at wealth inequality, it almost always turns out to be a lot more unevenly distributed than income and one of the ways to look at that is by looking at the top 20 percent. The richest 20 percent of the U. S. families own 88. 9 percent of all wealth in country, according to the research that I've seen, whereas the highest earning 20 percent of all U. S. families earned 59. 1 percent of all income. CORNISH: All right. But just to understand, the top 20 percent of U. S. families have 88 percent of all the wealth. DESILVER: 89 percent. CORNISH: Now, sometimes people kind of hear this information in a blizzard of numbers. Is there a statistic for you that feels like really reflects how stark the gap is or how controversial this debate is? DESILVER: I guess one of the other numbers that really strikes me was an analysis that we did based on 2012 dollars about the disparity between household income by race and ethnicity. And if you look at that, the median household income for white Americans was about $57,000 in 2012. For black families, it was $33,300 and for Hispanic families, it was $39,000. And that really is, to me, a very large gap. CORNISH: Why does there appear to be this widening of the gap since the 2007, 2008 financial crisis? I mean, we're in the middle of reporting this week about a surprisingly robust recovery of the stock market. DESILVER: And that's true, but you have to remember that approximately half of Americans don't own stock in any shape or form, which is another way of saying that only about half of Americans are exposed to the stock market either directly or through their retirement accounts. And stock ownership tends to be very heavily concentrated in the upper income brackets. So the people who are most benefiting from the run-up in the stock market are folks who are already at the top of the distribution anyway. CORNISH: That's Drew DeSilver. He's a senior writer for the Pew Research Center's fact tank blog. Drew, thanks for speaking with us. DESILVER: Thank you very much for having me.

S. and by 2012, which is the most recent numbers he had, that had risen to 22. 5 percent. Now, when you look at the bottom 90 percent, they had almost 52 percent of the national income in 2008. That had fallen below half to 49. 6 percent as of 2012, which was the lowest in any of the years that Saiz had researched. CORNISH: So you mention measures for understanding inequality so just looking at income inequality specifically, but what about wealth? Talk about the difference there in those numbers. DESILVER: Well, when you look at wealth inequality, it almost always turns out to be a lot more unevenly distributed than income and one of the ways to look at that is by looking at the top 20 percent. The richest 20 percent of the U. S. families own 88. 9 percent of all wealth in country, according to the research that I've seen, whereas the highest earning 20 percent of all U. S. families earned 59. 1 percent of all income. CORNISH: All right. But just to understand, the top 20 percent of U. S. families have 88 percent of all the wealth. DESILVER: 89 percent. CORNISH: Now, sometimes people kind of hear this information in a blizzard of numbers. Is there a statistic for you that feels like really reflects how stark the gap is or how controversial this debate is? DESILVER: I guess one of the other numbers that really strikes me was an analysis that we did based on 2012 dollars about the disparity between household income by race and ethnicity. And if you look at that, the median household income for white Americans was about $57,000 in 2012. For black families, it was $33,300 and for Hispanic families, it was $39,000. And that really is, to me, a very large gap. CORNISH: Why does there appear to be this widening of the gap since the 2007, 2008 financial crisis? I mean, we're in the middle of reporting this week about a surprisingly robust recovery of the stock market. DESILVER: And that's true, but you have to remember that approximately half of Americans don't own stock in any shape or form, which is another way of saying that only about half of Americans are exposed to the stock market either directly or through their retirement accounts. And stock ownership tends to be very heavily concentrated in the upper income brackets. So the people who are most benefiting from the run-up in the stock market are folks who are already at the top of the distribution anyway. CORNISH: That's Drew DeSilver. He's a senior writer for the Pew Research Center's fact tank blog. Drew, thanks for speaking with us. DESILVER: Thank you very much for having me.

I'm Michel Martin. Later this hour, we will talk about some of the big changes to the American health care system that came in with the new year. We'll find out what you need to know right now and what dates you should keep in mind. That's coming up in a few minutes. But first, we're taking a look at an issue that got more and more attention and momentum as last year went by. We want to talk about wage levels, and President Obama raised the issue at his State of the Union address last year. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. (APPLAUSE)MARTIN: Well, that did not happen. The federal minimum wage remains at $7. 25 an hour. But since that speech last year, more than a dozen states decided to go on and are raising their own minimum wages this year, with some states going past the $9 figure. Yet the debate over whether this makes good economic sense, especially with the economy still in recovery, is continuing. We wanted to hear all the various points of view on this, so we've called, once again, on NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. And also joining us, Bloomberg Businessweek contributor, Roben Farzad. Welcome back to you both. Thank you both so much for joining us, and happy New Year. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. ROBEN FARZAD: Happy New Year. MARTIN: So, Marilyn, as you've told us before, the federal government first set a minimum wage in the mid-1930s during the Depression. The goal was to put sort of more money into people's pockets, lift people out of poverty, but it has to be - it's not tied to inflation. So Congress has to act. The government last raised the minimum wage in July of 2009. And as we said, you know, President Obama's been urging Congress to raise the minimum wage again. They haven't done that, but a number of states have gone on and done that, and a number of localities as well. I think it's, like, five localities, including the District of Columbia. What persuaded these places, and why now? GEEWAX: This whole issue of income inequality has really picked up a lot of steam lately. People are focusing on that because it does seem that wages haven't gone up for low-wage workers. Now keep in mind, the minimum wage sets a floor for wages, but a lot of things are based on that. It's kind of a benchmark. So if the lowest wage is $7. 25, there are an awful lot of people - about 15 million - who make $8, $9, $10 an hour. They're low-wage workers, but they're key to what the minimum wage is. So if you were to raise that from $7. 25 to $8, $9, whatever you want to set it at, that would push a lot of people up. The people who currently are making $8 an hour, they would get a raise, too. They would ratchet up as that floor goes higher. So there are really, literally millions and millions of people who are extremely focused on this issue. They would like to get that raise. And really when you do polls of voters, it's very popular. It's a surprisingly popular issue. Polls show anywhere from 70-80 percent of voters are in favor of it. So when it gets on a state ballot, on a city ballot, people vote for it because they want workers to get that raise. MARTIN: Roben, what about the other side of the coin here? We often hear from visible people in the business community who are against it and that they say that this advantages the employed at the expense of the unemployed, that they say it discourages people from hiring. What else do they say about that? And is the business community really of one mind on this, or are there some sectors that support it and some that don't? FARZAD: I could tell you it's not as black and white as people wanted it to be either, you know - business is against this and low-wage earners are for this. In reality, if you step back for a minute, this is the era of the $5 foot long, if you watch all those Subway ads, and McDonald's and its dollar menu and Walmart and everyday low prices and whatnot. They believe that they are doing a service to the American consumer and economy by passing through the benefits of globalization and purchasing power, economies of scale and that you're going to disrupt all that if you mandate that they have to pay their workers higher salaries. Well, in reality, if you step back from it - because I cover these companies - say Walmart and McDonald's, from a corporate finance perspective, they're AAA rated. They can issue debt at record-low terms, and some of the numbers are astonishing. U. S. fast-food workers alone receive more than $7 billion in public assistance. McDonald's has a help line called McResource that workers can dial into to get instructions on how to get food stamps and welfare. And Walmart, meanwhile, is the nation's largest private employer. It's also the single biggest consumer of taxpayer aid. You know, where would Walmart be without Medicaid? So the asymmetry of this - there's an element of, you know, heads, they win, tails, the taxpayer loses. They turn around. They make these outsize profits. They pay them out to executives and to shareholders in the form of dividends, and taxpayers are on the hook. MARTIN: So but your argument was also, or their argument was - those who are against raising the minimum wage argue that keeping wages low in part allows them to improve the quality of life by offering products at lower prices. Is that their argument? FARZAD: That's right. Walmart alone, if you look at it as a nation, is China's sixth biggest trading partner. And you hear all this stuff about manufacturing jobs going abroad and whatnot. And Walmart is correct in saying that we can offer the dividends of globalization immediately to people who come into our stores and can buy an $18 DVD player. You disrupt that benefit by mandating that we have to pay our workers, say, instead of $7. 25 an hour, $10. 10 an hour, which is what Obama is insisting on. But I would take that a step further and say, you should call them on this because they are - you know, it's a great soundbite - blue-chip welfare queens. They want to say that this is either for the people or against the people, but it's also very advantageous, the current structure for their shareholders. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about new minimum wage increases that are coming into place around the country. My guests are Bloomberg Businessweek contributor Roben Farzad and NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Marilyn, you were telling us that whatever point of view you have on this, you can generally find a study to support that point of view. But I'd like to know - but these kinds of studies are coming out all the time, and you were just making us aware of a new one. What are some. . . GEEWAX: Right. . . MARTIN: What's some of the new information coming out? GEEWAX: There've been studies for decades looking at the minimum wage, and as Roben was pointing out, there are all kinds of conflicting points of view. You could say it holds down prices, but it does this or that. But if you look at all the studies over time, the majority of them would come to the conclusion that a higher minimum wage, as long as it's not too high, is generally fairly helpful to the economy because it puts money into people's pockets. They can spend it. That helps stimulate the economy. And there was just a study that was released earlier this week from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. An economist there took a look at what would happen if you raised the minimum wage to $10. 10 an hour, and his conclusion was that nearly 5 million people would be lifted out of poverty by getting those higher wages. So, you know, the most recent studies are suggesting it would help reduce this income gap and lift some people up. But, you know, it really also - it's fair to point out that some of this just can vary so much depending on where you're at. If you're in North Dakota where the unemployment rate is less than 3 percent, a higher minimum wage is - can be fine. It'll help people get more money, and they can find an apartment or whatever. But if you are in a low-wage part of the country where the economy's very slow, if the federal government says, the wage has to go higher, maybe the business owner, she looks around and decides, I'll just work longer hours myself instead of adding one more employee. So it can be complicated, and it can vary by region. MARTIN: I was going to ask Roben this as well, is there a small business-big business divide on this? In that, there are big businesses who could perhaps absorb a wage increase and who are benefiting from these tax breaks as you were just describing, versus sort of small business people who have maybe one or two or however few employees who would either invest in technology or just work longer hours themselves. I mean, is there - do you feel in the business groups, those who advocate for and represent big business versus small business, do they have a point of view difference on this? FARZAD: Michel, that is an important question because as I said before, big businesses, they can absorb costs. They have purchasing powers. If you think about what McDonald's - McDonald's alone controls the potato crop in this country. Potato farmers must listen to what Illinois is saying in corporate headquarters of McDonald's. What they do in terms of beef and buying powers and - corporations broadly, if you want to look at Procter & Gamble, the big  consumer products company, Colgate-Palmolive, dairy yogurt companies. One thing that people aren't talking about is that they have these certain dark arts at their disposal. Over the past 10 years, if you compare - and this is germane to this conversation - what an average cup of Dannon yogurt looks like now versus what it did 10 years ago or a bottle of Head and Shoulders versus what it looked like 10 years ago. They don't necessarily have to pass costs down to the end customer in a weak economy. What they can do is cut corners and erode your purchasing power in another way. In the end, they are public companies. They have to report quarterly results, and they are not going to just take the hit in terms of profitability. There are other things they could do that ultimately hit the end consumer. MARTIN: Marilyn, why do you think this is and remains such a contentious issue? I mean, you've told us a number of times on this program as we've continued to follow this issue over the course of the year that actually this fight actually surfaces, like, every couple of years, and it's always contentious. GEEWAX: It's always. . . MARTIN: Why is that? GEEWAX: It is going on for three quarters of a century now and no end in sight. And the reason for that is that it's so deeply philosophical in a way. We can talk about all these economic studies and look at numbers and all that, but in the end, it really is about, what is the role of government? You know, there are a lot of business owners who say, we are consenting adults, my employee and I. We will make our own decisions about what the pay level is. If you don't like what I'm offering you, walk out the door. Nobody's holding you here. So you could say that just on a purely philosophical basis, wages should be negotiated between the employer and the employee. And it has nothing to do with what people in Washington are doing. MARTIN: And it inhibits freedom, and it sets kind of an artificial value of labor that should. . . FARZAD: But. . . GEEWAX: Right. . . MARTIN: But let her finish her point. . . GEEWAX: But there's another way of looking at that, and that is that in this country we do have the federal government set some standards. We don't have child labor. We - I mean, if you ask most Americans, do you want to see kids working on machines when they're 10 years old? They would overwhelmingly be in favor of child labor laws. They're overwhelmingly in favor of an eight-hour workday. They want overtime for more than 40 hours. There are standards that the government does set and - you know, whether it's health and safety or wages or hours - there are roles that the government plays in that. So this is a philosophical debate between two different ways of looking at government. MARTIN: OK, Roben, what about you? Final thought from you on this. Why do you think this remains so contentious over the years? FARZAD: Because especially now, you talk about two economies - one where Wall Street is really loving life, where the stock market is an all-time high and unemployment remains chronically high at the same time. People are feeling underemployed by and large. And they look around and say, I didn't expect to be making this little this late into the game. And the nightly news starts off with the Dow at another record. You're thinking, where's the love for me? I think it's also incredibly important to ask in this debate the same people who are funding the Chamber of Commerce and big business who are saying that an increase in the minimum wage would be ruinous, they're the same ones who support, on the side, agricultural subsidies. MARTIN: OK. We have to leave it there for now. Obviously, this debate will continue, and we'll continue to have it. Roben Farzad is a contributor to Bloomberg Businessweek, with us from Richmond, Virginia. Here in our Washington, D. C. studios, Marilyn Geewax, NPR senior business editor.

I'm Arun Rath. Back in November, 222,000 Californians opened their mailboxes to find an unnerving letter. It read: The federal extension of unemployment benefits that you have collected and may still be collecting are scheduled to end at the end of December 2013. It was a warning. While Congress was inching toward a budget deal, extending Emergency Unemployment Compensation was not a part of that deal. That's the extra government money that allows unemployed workers to collect payments for months longer than they could in better economic times. And sure enough, on December 18th, Congress passed that budget and packed up for Christmas recess, leaving those extended benefits for 1. 3 million Americans to expire just 10 days later. So what happens to the people and families whose payments were cut off? That's our cover story today. Ruth Mills is 28 years old and lost her job as a construction estimator back in June. She got one of those letters, warning her that benefits could end. Mills couldn't believe the news coming out of Congress. RUTH MILLS: I followed it every week, and I was just like, did they really just go home? RATH: After six months of unemployment, she was already scaling back her holiday plans. MILLS: But a couple little things that my wife asked for for Christmas were very small, and a couple of things for my son that he asked - you know, she asked me to get for my son, I got them. And I ended up, you know, taking everything back, just to get our cash back, so I could pay whatever bills we had. RATH: The rent is high in San Diego County. Even with her partner's salary, losing benefits meant Ruth Mills and her family are moving in with her parents. MILLS: No matter what way you do it, you can only stretch $2,000 so far. RATH: There are usually jobs for an experienced estimator, she says, though it can be hard to find work in the fall. To be safe, Mills decided to get her welding certificate at a nearby trade school. But it's a months long course and the fall session was already full. So she signed up for the spring semester. Class starts on January 27th. But now that her benefits have come to an end, there's a problem. MILLS: Those classes cost $600 to take. That payment is due next Friday by the 10th or I get dropped from the class. My unemployment was just cut off, so how the heck do I pay for the classes? RATH: That's the point of unemployment benefits. All states pay newly unemployed workers for around four to six months to help keep them on their feet. And usually, there's a little extra to fund the job hunt, things like gas, paying the cellphone bill for interviews and extra training like in Ruth's case. But as NPR's Chris Arnold explained to me, it takes people a lot longer to find a job when the economy goes belly up. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: When that happens, states have been able often to get the federal government to help, you know, extend benefits a little further. When the great recession hit in 2008, Congress passed a bigger emergency extension of the benefits, and that's totally paid for by the federal government. So up until December 28th, people could get unemployment checks for longer than a year in a lot of states. RATH: There are a lot of people that are still in bad shape, so what are the arguments in Washington against extending the benefits? ARNOLD: Right. Most Republicans say, look, we're not totally opposed to this. We'll consider extending benefits. But they want Democrats to make concessions to pay for it. So if you extended the program for another year, the Congressional Budget Office says that would cost about $25 billion. So Republicans want Democrats to agree to cut the budget and find ways to pay for that. And then there are a few Republicans who say, no, we don't even like that because we think that this enables people to stay out of work longer and not really work that hard to find a job. And if they were taken off the dole, then they'd go out there and be more aggressively looking for work. RATH: What are the arguments for extending the benefits? ARNOLD: Well, there's a lot of arguments for extending the benefits. And I talked to a liberal economist and a conservative economist this week. And they both said, look, right now, you've got three times as many people looking for work as there are jobs. So if you cut people off, a lot of them are just going to be unable to find work. There just aren't enough jobs out there. So they see this in economic terms as it's just bad to have that many people destitute in the economy. There's this human suffering that, of course, you don't want. But it's also just bad for the economy, and that if you put money into people's pockets, especially people with the fewest resources, they have to go out and spend that money. That's stimulative. And the White House and some other independent economists have said, look, if we don't extend this, we're going to lose between 200,000 and 300,000 additional jobs just because we're losing that stimulative effect. RATH: NPR's Chris Arnold. Just a few days into the cuts, we can't tell what the changes will mean for California or other states likely to be most heavily affected. But there is one case study to look at: North Carolina. Back in July, lawmakers there cut the maximum length of benefits all the way down to just 19 weeks, and cut the maximum weekly check from $535 to $350. Losing that safety net sent people searching around for others. One place that felt the drag almost immediately: food banks. RON PRINGLE: We've seen an average of about 17 percent increase over this time last year. RATH: Ron Pringle is a food bank director in southeast North Carolina. He says the surge felt by the food banks and the Department of Social Services makes sense. PRINGLE: Individuals that are receiving unemployment benefits are sometimes just above the threshold to receive food stamps. So after, you know, those unemployment benefits were cut, then our local DSS offices began to reach out because they started seeing such an increase of individuals coming and applying for food stamps. RATH: So he has a warning for food banks in the other 49 states. PRINGLE: And there's going to be a rush. It's going to be a surge that we're going to see over the next several months. Keeping that steady flow of product is something that food banks are going to be challenged with. So I would really, you know, encourage them to begin the conversation now and not wait for the impact to hit because it's going to hit all at once. RATH: As NPR's Chris Arnold explained earlier, most of the money going into homes through long-term unemployment insurance quickly goes right back out into the economy - to local stores, gas stations, landlords and more. But many conservatives aren't swayed by the stimulus argument. After the benefits were cut off, unemployment in North Carolina did drop dramatically. Conservatives say that's a sign the policy was a success. Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner explains. MARK VITNER: People are dropping out of the labor force. That's been an issue in North Carolina. It's been an issue all over the country. But the thing that seems to have changed is that some folks who may have passed up on a job because it wasn't all that desirable and didn't pay all that much now seem to be giving those jobs a second look because their extended unemployment benefits have ended. RATH: Vitner says it's true that unemployment payments can actually keep people unemployed for longer. Warren Williams lives in Murrieta, California, about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. He was laid off from his door-to-door marketing job back in March. This job hunt has been much tougher than his last. WARREN WILLIAMS: When you're 62 years old, a lot of companies don't want to hire you. RATH: Williams says he gets about $600 every two weeks from the government, deposited straight into his checking account. He and his wife share just one car. And since Murrieta is about 60 miles from L. A. or San Diego, commuting would be both tough and expensive. So the unemployment benefits have allowed him to be selective about a new job. WILLIAMS: Yeah. I mean, I was offered like part-time jobs, but again, it was - by the time you pay for gas and all that, you'd make more money not working. So I was only looking for jobs that paid more than what my unemployment was. RATH: Even with the insurance expiring, Williams isn't too worried. At 62, he can and has already begun to receive Social Security checks. But dropping out of the workforce often isn't an option, especially for those too young to retire. So where else do you go? VICKI DOLENGA: I decided that I was going to try and find something in Dallas, Texas. RATH: After getting laid off four times in four years, 42-year-old Vicki Dolenga packed her things in a storage unit and left Los Angeles. Dallas held a promising job opportunity, but it didn't pan out. Dolenga had to move in with her nearest family member - her mother in Jackson, Mississippi, a six-hour drive from Dallas. It's not at all what she wanted, but it's what she can afford. DOLENGA: If I were still in California right now renting an apartment, I would be completely stuck. So I do feel like I'm really lucky that I made this decision. And I'm now staying with family, and at least I don't have to worry about, you know, food or a roof over my head. RATH: Dolenga got her last payment earlier this week, but credit card bills and student loans are looming. And she says she has to pay for her cellphone. What if she does get an interview? And even if that dream job in Dallas opened up. . . DOLENGA: I have no money to be able to get to Dallas if I were to get an interview. It's $200 that I literally don't have. RATH: Vicki Dolenga and all the other unemployed workers we talked to this week were hanging onto Congress' every word, because there is still a chance that these benefits could be renewed. The Senate is expected to vote on a bipartisan bill to extend the benefits as soon as Monday. A similar bill has been introduced in the House, though passage is not assured in either chamber. NPR's Chris Arnold. ARNOLD: The word from a White House economic adviser was that, look, people need to pay their mortgages and eat, so let's pass this bill right away. It's - the bill's only going to be for a three-month extension, so let's just get this part done, get people their checks, and then we can figure out down the road, are we going to find ways to pay for it? Should we extend it longer? We'll see if Republicans go along with that. It's also worth mentioning that benefits could be renewed retroactively. So even if it takes a while, people might get that money back in their pockets. RATH: It's normal for emergency benefits to end when the economy recovers, but long-term unemployment has persisted through this recovery, and Congress has recognized that. The program has been renewed more than 10 times since mid-2008. Not all of those renewals have come on time. Four were at least two days late. California's next unemployment checks are scheduled to go out just over a week from now. If Congress can pass those bills quickly enough, those Californians and most of the other 1. 3 million Americans affected won't experience a delay in their payments. ARUN RATH, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. Back in November, 222,000 Californians opened their mailboxes to find an unnerving letter. It read: The federal extension of unemployment benefits that you have collected and may still be collecting are scheduled to end at the end of December 2013. It was a warning. While Congress was inching toward a budget deal, extending Emergency Unemployment Compensation was not a part of that deal. That's the extra government money that allows unemployed workers to collect payments for months longer than they could in better economic times. And sure enough, on December 18th, Congress passed that budget and packed up for Christmas recess, leaving those extended benefits for 1. 3 million Americans to expire just 10 days later. So what happens to the people and families whose payments were cut off? That's our cover story today. Ruth Mills is 28 years old and lost her job as a construction estimator back in June. She got one of those letters, warning her that benefits could end. Mills couldn't believe the news coming out of Congress. RUTH MILLS: I followed it every week, and I was just like, did they really just go home? RATH: After six months of unemployment, she was already scaling back her holiday plans. MILLS: But a couple little things that my wife asked for for Christmas were very small, and a couple of things for my son that he asked - you know, she asked me to get for my son, I got them. And I ended up, you know, taking everything back, just to get our cash back, so I could pay whatever bills we had. RATH: The rent is high in San Diego County.

S. Senate gets back to work tomorrow, and the first legislation up for a vote will be a three-month extension of long-term unemployment benefits. In his weekly radio address yesterday, President Obama urged Republicans to pass the bill. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Republicans should make it their New Year's resolution to do the right thing and restore this vital economic security for their constituents right now. MARTIN: The Senate unemployment measure is bipartisan but it's not clear it has enough votes to beat a GOP filibuster. As NPR's David Welna reports, Democrats are banging the drum on the issue as a midterm election year kicks off. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: On Friday afternoon, the Obama administration teed up tomorrow's Senate procedural vote on an unemployment benefits extension cosponsored by Rhode Island Jack Reed and Nevada Republican Dean Heller. In a conference call with reporters organized by the White House, Labor Secretary Tom Perez pointed out that when former President Bush first signed long-term unemployment benefits in 2008, the average unemployed worker went jobless for 17 weeks. The current out-of-work average, he said, is 36 weeks - 10 weeks longer than state unemployment benefits last. SECRETARY TOM PEREZ: It would be unprecedented, given the current rate of long-term unemployment, for Congress to fail to act to extend these benefits. And that is why we are so heartened by the bipartisan bill that Senators Heller and Reed have introduced. WELNA: And Betsy Stevenson of the president's Council on Economic Advisers warned that failure to extend benefits could mean the loss of another quarter million jobs this year, precisely when the overall economy is starting to pick up steam. BETSY STEVENSON: It seems like a silly time for Congress to fail to do something that's both essential for the people who need it and helpful for our economy. WELNA: Prospects for reviving the jobless benefits are uncertain at best in the Democratic-led Senate. But the legislation faces even bigger hurdles in the GOP-controlled House. Before he left Washington three weeks ago, House Speaker John Boehner was asked whether he'd let a jobless benefits bill come to the floor. Boehner did not say no. After all, extending those benefits enjoys wide public support, even among Republicans. But he did attach some significant strings. REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: When the White House finally called me last Friday about extending unemployment benefits, I said that we would clearly consider it, as long as it's paid for and as long as there are other efforts that'll help get our economy moving once again. WELNA: There are no offsets in the Senate bill to pay for the $6. 2 billion cost of the three-month extension, and House Democrats say they would not vote for any GOP attempt to pay for the bill by tapping other workers' benefits. Michigan House Democrat Sandy Levin is counting on Republicans ultimately caving to popular pressure.

Unemployment for young people is another one of those contentious political issues as well as a burden for people living through it. Overall, the unemployment rate in the U. S. is just over 7 percent, but for younger workers it's much higher. For some young workers or would-be workers in sub-groups like black teens, unemployment is at depression levels. But what you might not know is that youth unemployment is a global concern. Some 73 million young people were unemployed in 2013, according to the International Labor Organization - young people is defined as age 15 through 24 - and that could have significant consequences both now and in the future. Here to tell us more about this is Martina Gmur. She's senior director at the World Economic Forum. And she's joining us from Geneva, Switzerland. Martina Gmur, thank you so much for speaking with us. MARTINA GMUR: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So I understand that there are two significant issues here and that they're somewhat different. In the developing world, there are just simply not enough jobs. But in more developed economies the issue is that a lot of young people are not able to find jobs that meet the level of skill and education that they already have. Do I have that right? GMUR: Yeah, that's correct. Yes. MARTIN: Which is the more significant problem in your view - or just explain the dimensions of the problem in each case? GMUR: Well, I think both of them are equally problematic. And think of it also when you look in the long-term that structural unemployment is here to stay, and was one of the major issues that was highlighted also by our experts as something to look out for in the next 12 to 18 months. And, as you mentioned, the unemployment rate among the young is very high. It stands currently at 12. 6 percent. It's a key issue. If 1 out of 6 young people are unemployed globally, that's obviously a major issue. And it's also a major issue when you compare it to the older workers because young people are almost three times more likely to be unemployed than older people, which is key. And they're more vulnerable to changing economic conditions. So in South Africa, for example, when the economy slowed down, youth unemployment began to rise sooner than adult unemployment, so that's another aspect which is key. So over the next 15 years or so, to even just maintain the current employment rates in the developing world, we'd need 600 million jobs. That's a big, big number obviously. MARTIN: Around the world - I know that a number of analysts use this term, ticking time bomb, to describe this phenomenon. GMUR: Right. MARTIN: First I wanted to ask you, why do they use that term? And what kinds of conversations are global leaders having about it? I mean, is there kind of a global understanding of the significance of this? GMUR: Yeah, I think there is. You know, as I've mentioned, we've had our experts highlighting this as a major issue amongst the top issues. It's ranked number three, you know, in the ranks of climate change and other issues. So clearly they see this as a critical, critical issue to address. And the reason why it's, you know, a ticking time bomb is because it's a long-term issue. Some of the implications of this we won't see for the next decade or so, and particularly in countries or regions like Southern Europe where some of the unemployment rates amongst the youth are peaking well over half. This is going to have major implications over time. And another facet here is also the underemployment, which is particularly striking in the Middle East and North Africa and even in certain parts of South Asia as well, where we see a lot of underemployment of youth, which has a long-term effect on the economy and definitely some negative implications on the growth of these countries and their GDP. MARTIN: Are there areas in which leaders are taking specific measures to address this? I mean, you said that we need 600 million new. . . GMUR: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Jobs in the near future. GMUR: Yeah. MARTIN: It sounds like a huge number. Are there places where leaders are taking specific steps to address this that you could tell us about? GMUR: Yeah, absolutely. I think there is two aspects to this - to this problem. One is the long-term aspect, as I mentioned, of the structural unemployment, which clearly needs to be addressed. And here I heard your previous speakers talk a little bit about the skills gap - the skills shortage I think - and this is certainly something that is really key. The skills mismatch currently needs to be addressed. And a lot of our companies and CEOs are very concerned with this issue. And they are starting to rethink not only the labor market institutions, but also the traditional education systems - what does it mean for universities in the future and for apprenticeships in the future? And then there's a few more short-term solutions that people are working on in our circles. One of them is, as I mentioned just now, the apprenticeships. This is a proven approach to tackling youth unemployment. It's worked in countries like Austria and Denmark, who've very successfully been using apprenticeship to tackle this - also Germany. We've also seen a new area for green jobs emerging. You know, there's a huge potential for new jobs in that space as green jobs, as we look towards a more sustainable economy. And then of course entrepreneurship is another aspect that needs to be fostered across youth to help them and design frameworks where they can help build up, you know, entrepreneurial endeavors. And we've done some work in this in Africa where we started a program called Startup Africa, which helps people, young people, develop entrepreneurial thinking and helping them to think through what it means to set up businesses. MARTIN: Can I ask you to take a step back for just a minute and say part of the issue here is that there's a mismatch between young people acquiring skills and education at a faster rate than the economy can absorb those skills and education. How did this occur? GMUR: Well, I think there's obviously always a number of reasons why, but business today faces a major shortage of talent with the appropriate skills. I think in a recent McKinsey report, they estimated that by 2020, developing countries could have 45 million jobs for workers with secondary educations that will go unfilled. So clearly there is a massive, you know, gap in terms of what people are educated in and what the job market's looking for. And it's potentially also because the educational system maybe hasn't reformed fast enough to really look at what is needed in the current job market and what are the skills that are required. If you look at many of the educational institutions, there hasn't been a really big overhaul in some of their system in a long time. So this is something that really needs a big rethink. MARTIN: Before we let you go - we have about a minute and a half left - you know, the new year is a time where many people set goals for themselves and also it's a good time to kind of think about the year ahead - is there a way in which you would want our listeners to be thinking about this issue as we go forward? GMUR: Yeah, I think there is definitely a part of it which I would encourage the listeners to consider what they can do in their own organizations to encourage the shorter-term responses to youth unemployment because, as I've mentioned, the long-term implications are quite tragic and we've seen some of it in some countries already. And they're just a huge burden on the economies and on economic growth. So I would say see through what the organizations can do and sometimes it's quite simple - in just creating mentorship programs apprenticeships for youth to start understanding and building more soft skills and learning skills that they might not have learned in schools and really helping them sort of bridge that gap. And for companies to take on the role that maybe governments have in the past and to take a step forward and be proactive about it. MARTIN: Martina Gmur is senior director at the World Economic Forum. She was kind enough to join us from Geneva in Switzerland. Martina Gmur, thank you so much for speaking with us. I hope you'll keep us informed about this important issue. GMUR: Thank you for having me. Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Switching gears now. Unemployment for young people is another one of those contentious political issues as well as a burden for people living through it. Overall, the unemployment rate in the U. S. is just over 7 percent, but for younger workers it's much higher. For some young workers or would-be workers in sub-groups like black teens, unemployment is at depression levels. But what you might not know is that youth unemployment is a global concern. Some 73 million young people were unemployed in 2013, according to the International Labor Organization - young people is defined as age 15 through 24 - and that could have significant consequences both now and in the future. Here to tell us more about this is Martina Gmur. She's senior director at the World Economic Forum. And she's joining us from Geneva, Switzerland. Martina Gmur, thank you so much for speaking with us. MARTINA GMUR: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So I understand that there are two significant issues here and that they're somewhat different. In the developing world, there are just simply not enough jobs. But in more developed economies the issue is that a lot of young people are not able to find jobs that meet the level of skill and education that they already have. Do I have that right? GMUR: Yeah, that's correct. Yes. MARTIN: Which is the more significant problem in your view - or just explain the dimensions of the problem in each case? GMUR: Well, I think both of them are equally problematic. And think of it also when you look in the long-term that structural unemployment is here to stay, and was one of the major issues that was highlighted also by our experts as something to look out for in the next 12 to 18 months. And, as you mentioned, the unemployment rate among the young is very high. It stands currently at 12. 6 percent. It's a key issue. If 1 out of 6 young people are unemployed globally, that's obviously a major issue. And it's also a major issue when you compare it to the older workers because young people are almost three times more likely to be unemployed than older people, which is key. And they're more vulnerable to changing economic conditions. So in South Africa, for example, when the economy slowed down, youth unemployment began to rise sooner than adult unemployment, so that's another aspect which is key. So over the next 15 years or so, to even just maintain the current employment rates in the developing world, we'd need 600 million jobs. That's a big, big number obviously. MARTIN: Around the world - I know that a number of analysts use this term, ticking time bomb, to describe this phenomenon. GMUR: Right. MARTIN: First I wanted to ask you, why do they use that term? And what kinds of conversations are global leaders having about it? I mean, is there kind of a global understanding of the significance of this? GMUR: Yeah, I think there is. You know, as I've mentioned, we've had our experts highlighting this as a major issue amongst the top issues. It's ranked number three, you know, in the ranks of climate change and other issues. So clearly they see this as a critical, critical issue to address. And the reason why it's, you know, a ticking time bomb is because it's a long-term issue. Some of the implications of this we won't see for the next decade or so, and particularly in countries or regions like Southern Europe where some of the unemployment rates amongst the youth are peaking well over half. This is going to have major implications over time. And another facet here is also the underemployment, which is particularly striking in the Middle East and North Africa and even in certain parts of South Asia as well, where we see a lot of underemployment of youth, which has a long-term effect on the economy and definitely some negative implications on the growth of these countries and their GDP. MARTIN: Are there areas in which leaders are taking specific measures to address this? I mean, you said that we need 600 million new. . . GMUR: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Jobs in the near future. GMUR: Yeah. MARTIN: It sounds like a huge number. Are there places where leaders are taking specific steps to address this that you could tell us about? GMUR: Yeah, absolutely. I think there is two aspects to this - to this problem. One is the long-term aspect, as I mentioned, of the structural unemployment, which clearly needs to be addressed. And here I heard your previous speakers talk a little bit about the skills gap - the skills shortage I think - and this is certainly something that is really key. The skills mismatch currently needs to be addressed. And a lot of our companies and CEOs are very concerned with this issue.

Good morning, I'm David Greene. For many Americans who are out of work, the road got even tougher at the end of December. Their long-term unemployment benefits expired. An estimated 1. 3 million people stopped receiving checks. Congress is back in Washington this week, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says restoring these benefits is a top priority. But some lawmakers don't see this as the best solution. And the falling unemployment rate in the country has eased the pressure to keep these benefits in place. Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Sandra Patterson has had steady work, mostly in retail store management, for most of her 45 years. Since last February, though, she's had no luck. SANDRA PATTERSON: I've applied for customer service jobs. I've applied for reception jobs. I've applied to Hardees, McDonald's, Wendy's. NOGUCHI: Her benefits ran out at the end of the year and she's willing to trade down to any job she can get. She's often told she's too experienced for the minimum-wage work. PATTERSON: How can you be overqualified if you're willing to take that position? NOGUCHI: So Patterson is now on financial lockdown. She can't make this month's rent. She mostly stays home to save on gas and spends a lot less on groceries. PATTERSON: I used to spend about maybe 250 a month for myself. But now I'm maybe 50 to $75 a month. NOGUCHI: Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He says Patterson is a good example of how not extending long-term jobless benefits affects the economy overall. If she had more money, she'd spend more on food. JARED BERNSTEIN: The grocery then needs to restock the shelves, order more, so there's an inventory function there and a delivery function there. And you can kind of get a sense of how the economic activity creates ripples through the economy. Not just at the site of purchase there but with upstream industries as well. NOGUCHI: The Congressional Budget Office says expiration of benefits could shave as much as four-tenths of a percent off annual economic growth. The White House also notes the percentage of the workforce that's out of work for at least six months is still twice what it normally is when Congress cancels emergency benefits. But the national unemployment rate is down substantially from its peak and falling. So some states have cut back regular benefits. And some states no longer qualify for the most generous level of additional federal support, which at the height of the recession allowed for as much as 99 weeks of benefits. Many Republicans believe extended benefits keep some people from taking jobs they might otherwise accept. Bernstein, who was Vice President Biden's chief economist, says people who settle for lesser jobs or have to start new careers face a long road back to normal. BERNSTEIN: Lots of people who start out their career in a down economy or in a recession find that they don't progress as quickly over time. And it actually can take as much as 10 to 15 years to make up the kind of lost mobility that you get just by dint of kind of starting at the wrong time. NOGUCHI: Jada Urquhart suspects this may be true for her. JADA URQUHART: I'll never make as much money as I did teaching - I know that. Which is kind of sad, you know. NOGUCHI: As a libertarian, Urquhart says she feels squeamish about the government spending on jobless benefits. But on the other hand, she hasn't been able to find teaching jobs since she lost hers at a high school in Cardington, Ohio last year. She's going to school to become a social worker which means she's now an intern at age 60. URQUHART: I'll be the new kid on the block with the gray hair and wrinkles. NOGUCHI: She says she's made various changes to cut her budget by at least a third. URQUHART: I cut the cable. I had an alarm system but I turned that off. I can break my contract on my cell phone, so that will save a couple hundred dollars. I keep my heat a lot lower - I turn it down to like 58 at night. I didn't buy any Christmas presents. It was a kind of a skinny Christmas. NOGUCHI: And it will likely be an even skinnier New Year when her benefits run out later this month. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

And that jump in demand is boosting fuel prices. The cost of natural gas especially is way up in the Northeast. In recent years, drillers have been producing more gas than the country can use. That changed when temperatures plunged, as NPR's Jeff Brady reports. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Part of the problem is getting the gas from where it's produced, in places like Western Pennsylvania, to where it's used; population centers such as New York and Boston. Sometimes there just aren't enough pipelines to meet the demand. In those cases, utilities and other users start bidding up prices. At one point, prices for gas flowing into New York City jumped nearly tenfold over average winter prices. Anne Swedberg, with the firm Bentek Energy, says utilities were willing to pay the steep prices for one important reason. ANNE SWEDBERG: You can't let Grandma freeze and so they are required to continue to purchase gas to maintain their systems at whatever price, so that they can, you know, they can keep the lights on for Grandma and the heat on for Grandma. BRADY: Swedberg says analysts are still sorting out what happened when prices reached their peak. In addition to pipeline constraints, she says it appears something called freeze-off was a problem. SWEDBERG: The freeze-off is where the gas is not able to get out of the well to enter the pipeline. So they're actually freezing in the well or the pipeline. BRADY: In parts of the country where natural gas isn't available, propane is often used for heating and this year it's been in short supply, too.

JEFF PETRASH: This year we're actually having winter. In the last several years, winters have been warmer than normal. And therefore, the needs for all heating fuels - fuel oil, propane, natural gas, et cetera - have been significantly higher this year. BRADY: Petrash says farmers in the Midwest also need a lot of propane and this year the crops came in later than normal. PETRASH: Most people don't realize that huge amounts of propane are used in grain drying. So we had a large and later than normal grain harvest that called for large volumes of propane, just as we were entering the winter heating season. BRADY: Earlier this week, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin joined 18 other states in issuing executive orders to address the propane supply issue. Normally propane truck drivers are restricted in how long they can work each day. But for the next week or two, drivers will be exempted from those rules.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon Johnson declared unconditional war on poverty. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED SPEECH)CORNISH: The poverty rate was 19 percent at the time. It hasn't been that high since. SIEGEL: Johnson's war led to government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start and food stamps. Still, today more than 46 million Americans, around 15 percent, are poor. Many of them live in the Appalachian coal mining region of Eastern Kentucky. President Johnson once traveled there to promote his anti-poverty campaign. NPR's Pam Fessler takes us there today. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Colby Kirk is the kind of young man who would make a parent proud: polite, smart, focused. He's a junior at the University of Kentucky studying to be a financial analyst. COLBY KIRK: I'm really interested in, like, assessing risk and doing cash flows. It's not something most people I guess are interested in but it's always struck my fancy, so. . . FESSLER: He'd also like to come back here someday to his hometown of Inez, Kentucky, nestled in the mountains of Appalachia. We're sitting in the stands of the high school football field beneath one of those mountains, not far from where President Johnson came in 1964. Kirk says he knows things are a lot better here than they were back then. KIRK: You know, paved roads, everyone's got a car. There's a half of a McDonald's right there. FESSLER: He points to a nearby gas station. Still. . . KIRK: There's not really any opportunities for college grads back here unless you make your own. Really hard to do that if you're a financial analyst. MICHELLE HARLESS: I would say one of our biggest exports is, you know, bright young minds. FESSLER: Michelle Harless is the guidance counselor at the local high school. She says she sees it all the time, the best and the brightest leave Martin County, and those who stay and don't go to college often end up in dead-end minimum wage jobs. HARLESS: Twenty years ago, they went to the coal mines. My dad graduated high school and went to the coals mines. He is a maintenance supervisor in West Virginia, and I'll never make as much money as he does. FESSLER: Even though she has a college degree. But those high-paying jobs are disappearing like an early morning fog. Hundreds of miners here have been laid off recently, and there are no jobs to replace them. KAYLA: Big Sandy Area Community Action, this is Kayla(ph). May I help you? FESSLER: Which means lots of people here have had to turn for help to some of the many government programs that were spawned by the war on poverty: food stamps, Medicaid, heating assistance for their homes. The poverty rate in Martin County is lower than it was when President Johnson was here. But it's still 35 percent, more than twice the national average. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, ma'am. You're here to get help with kerosene lantern today. Is that correct? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: And you cite that this is your address as shown on your service (unintelligible)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yes, it is. FESSLER: Today, more than half the income in this county comes from government payments rather than from wages and salaries. MIKE HOWELL: In my opinion, you can never get out of poverty if you don't have a job. FESSLER: Mike Howell runs this community action program. He says many more people here would be struggling without the war on poverty but that it's only helped them so much. HOWELL: And it can't just be minimum-wage jobs. It can't be jobs that just will barely get you by. But in order to get those jobs, people have to have the education to be able to do those jobs. FESSLER: His program provides some of that education and training. But getting funding is a constant challenge. And there have to be jobs to fill. So this area, like many across the country, is grappling with how to attract new businesses. State and local leaders say they need more highways and broadband access to bring technology, tourism and factory jobs to this isolated region. MIKE DUNCAN: People in Martin County perform very well. We have very high-skilled laborers. FESSLER: Mike Duncan is chairman and CEO of a local bank and also a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. He's concerned about all the talent leaving and has offered internships to students like Colby Kirk in the hopes that they, like him, will eventually settle in Inez. Duncan says the war on poverty has been a mixed blessing for this area's economic growth. It's improved health and lifted many Appalachians out of poverty. DUNCAN: But there've been some problems too. There's in some instances a lack of self-reliance. I think the entitlement mentality has done away with some things that I consider very strong Appalachian values. Sometimes it's more difficult to get casual laborers today. FESSLER: Especially, he says, for lower-paying jobs, although others complain that those jobs pay too little to live on. Colby Kirk hopes that people here find a solution soon. He says a local newspaper editor used to ask one question repeatedly - what will we do when the coal is gone? Kirk thinks too few people here took that question seriously until now. Do you think the country needs another war on poverty? KIRK: I think we should re-evaluate our war strategy at least. FESSLER: He thinks today it's not so much about feeding families, as it was 50 years ago, but about giving young people hope. Pam Fessler, NPR News.

We start the program today with reflections on money, speaking broadly. In a few minutes, we'll talk about some myths and facts about credit. Consumer columnist Sheryl Harris will help us clear up some confusion over what exactly helps and hurts your credit. That's in just a few minutes. But first, we take on the issue of poverty, which we've come to see as far more than a lack of money. It's been exactly 50 years since President Lyndon Baines Johnson told the nation about his ambitious plans to fight this persistent enemy. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)LYNDON B. JOHNSON: This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. MARTIN: Since President Johnson made that speech, the rate of poverty has fallen, but only slightly. And whether it's fallen enough, whether the various strategies the country has employed have been the right ones - those are still a matter of debate as is the way forward. So we, along with our colleagues at other NPR programs, will be asking those questions in the weeks and months ahead. We're going to start today by hearing perspective from Anne Mosle. She is the executive director for Ascend. That's a part of the research organization, The Aspen Institute. And her group focuses its attention on poverty in families. Anne Mosle, welcome to program. Thanks so much for joining us. ANNE MOSLE: Thank you, Michel. It's a pleasure to be here. MARTIN: You know, it's been 50 years since President Johnson's famous was on poverty speech, but the poverty rate - and of course everybody always argues about these numbers - but the poverty rate, using the figures that the government uses, has only fallen a few percentage points since then - from 19 percent to 15 percent today. And why do you think that is? MOSLE: Well, I think there's two aspects to it, but the poverty rate has not - we have not made the dent that we would like. I think there's been some successes. I think, clearly, seniors are doing a lot better than they were before. We've made some real progress on that, and whether it's big programs like Social Security that we can say thank you to that. The area where I think we really have to pay attention to is really the growth of children growing up in low-income families. We have a real problem right now with almost half of our children are growing up in low-income families. And from that really kind of aspirational moment 50 years ago, to be where we are today knowing what we know, I think it's a big rallying call. MARTIN: Is the way we think about poverty as a country - I'm thinking mainly from a leadership - well, there's two aspects of it - there's the way leaders think about it, there's the way the public thinks about it - but is the way we think about poverty, has that changed in the 50 years since that speech? MOSLE: Yeah, I think - Michel, that's a great question. I think how we think about and go about attacking poverty has changed. I think, one, we have learned some lessons that, absolutely essential to the answer, is education. Education is at the forefront. And so how we think about one of the biggest successes of the war on poverty was Head Start 'cause Head Start got the government and got communities and got families thinking about the importance of investing early in children - all children. Another lesson that we've learned -and this I would say is somewhat of a success on the war on poverty - has been the soaring rate of college graduation. MARTIN: And that was not the case 50 years ago? MOSLE: I think it has changed, and it's gotten smarter. There were - basically people thought education is going to be the answer. We've all known that, but with the increase competition of today's economy, it's just nonnegotiable. Another area that we've seen changes is one of our recent research findings showed us that in the past - and this is definitely - when you look back to the 1950s, there was a very strong sense of neighborhood. People looked out for one another across the street. When we did our research with focus groups - our focus groups with low-income mothers and fathers, they don't know their neighbor across the street. There are very strong ties that are among a few friends and family. It's a small circle. It's a narrow set. It's not as wide. And so how people also think about those informal networks, not just the policies or the education, that the world has changed, and I think we need to update with it. MARTIN: Your work focuses specifically on a two-generation approach to dealing with poverty. Can you explain in practical terms what that means and how that fits into the way you're saying policymakers or thinkers think about poverty today? MOSLE: Yeah. I know, and that's a great question. I think one of the big, best of intentions with all the folks in the policy positions is to attack problems in a very focused way. One of the collateral issues has been - is our policies have gotten very siloed. So at the heart of a two-generation approach, it's actually quite simple. It's saying if we want families to thrive, we need to think about both the needs and the strengths of children together. And what that means is when we think, for example, like, kind of what are the core levers to making that happen? We think about education, kind of key economic supports, social capital and health. So just take education. Many times, I spend a lot of time with low-income mothers. Forefront on their mind is financial and sort of economic stability. Can we stay in our same home? Are we making enough paycheck to paycheck, and is my child getting a good education? For her to move up the ladder to the next job, her access to education, as well as strong early education for her child - those should go together. MARTIN: But that seems - that would just seem like common sense. You're saying that the existing programs and the existing kind of framework doesn't really do that. I mean, that just seems like common sense. Like, it's hard for a sick mother to raise a healthy child. It's hard for a mother with limited education to kind of inspire or support her child academically. So you kind of need to do both and. That would seem like common sense. MOSLE: It would see like common sense, and actually that's what my children say everyday. They're sort of like, you get paid to work on this. But it's sort of the dove factor. However - so let me give you a story. So in Tulsa, Oklahoma, there is a sort of Head Start program that had been working saying, if we want to solve poverty in Tulsa - they're working with a network of Head Starts across the city. They focus like a laser beam on giving that child everything that he or she needed. They realized they were only going to go so far if they did not connect with the family and the parent. So they said, if that parent is motivated and wants to get a job but is not connected to an economy or to an opportunity, how do we get them there? So they need an education. They need some training. So say that parent is working on sort of a, you know, cashier job or sort of maybe a minimum-wage job - going to Tulsa Tech, their community college, just one parent going into the community college system - for anybody who's ever done that, classes are all - the schedule is sort of at all points of the day. There's a need to sort of get some remedial education. So what they did in Tulsa - just putting this two-generation approach to life - they said, we're going to keep working with the students. We're going to get a group of the mothers and fathers that are interested in pursuing a career in health care, which is a growing part of the economy there, and we're going to work to get them trained. They created a partnership with the local community college so they can buy a block of classes so that these parents could both do - get educated and get trained for a real job, while also being a good parent and while also being able to maintain their sort of other job while they did this. MARTIN: Well, that leads me to a question which I have, which is the question which we started with. And if you're just joining us, we're talking about where the war on poverty stands now and different ways of dealing with it. My guest is Anne Mosle, executive director of Ascend. That's a project of The Aspen Institute - a think tank. And her group addresses poverty across generations. We started our conversation by asking why is it that the poverty rate really has not dropped very much since Lyndon Johnson's time, at least according to government figures - the figures that the government uses, from 19 percent then to 15 percent now. What I'm hearing you say is that all this infrastructure around addressing poverty really hasn't caught up with the way the world is lived now. MOSLE: Exactly. MARTIN: Is that about it? MOSLE: I think I couldn't agree more. How do we think about it? We've got great stuff to build upon, but how do we get a 21st century approach to what we're doing? We need the right leadership. We need to think about working across silos. And I think there's a lot of, how do we really get to connecting with families? There's a lot of good intention coming from programs or policies. Are they really connected to the dynamics of families? MARTIN: Of the way the world is now. Oh, speaking of the way the world is now, according to 2012 census numbers, a third of single female-headed households live in poverty. You know, that's one of the family changes that has occurred - family-style changes that has occurred since Lyndon Johnson's time. There are those who argue that the real issue is not kind of the structure of programs or the structure of work, it's the structure of families. And if there were not this many single female-headed households, who across racial groups, are much more likely to be poor - you know, white single female-headed households, as quiet as it's kept, are as likely to be poor as households headed by women of other ethnic groups - that that's really the big driver of the continuation of poverty, is that family breakdown. What's your perspective on that? MOSLE: A couple thoughts on that. First, I think it's really important for us, when we think about if we're really going to attack poverty, it's not on the individual. It's not going to come out of a program. Of all the conversations I've had with families out there, no one is out there - I want the greatest program. They want to have the kind of self-sufficiency and independence that we all want. MARTIN: OK. MOSLE: So as we're thinking about sort of the growth of women-headed families, I think one of the things that we can really pull upon is we've seen the importance and the power of investing in women. We've see that internationally. We've seen that globally. While there are some support programs out there that get to mothers, I actually think it would be very exciting and have some profound results to be even more intentional in those investments. There's a lot of women concentrated in low-wage jobs or dead-end jobs. How do we think about getting them onto paths where it's nontraditional jobs, whether it's security, police, construction, different forms of specialized manufacturing? In the U. S. , we do have a skills gap for higher-paying jobs. What if we were to track mothers and put them on a path for a stronger job at the same time that you're supporting their children? MARTIN: I want to conclude our conversation today with kind of where we started, which was with President Lyndon Johnson. I mean, one of the points that you made is that he put the stature - his personal stature and the weight of his office behind this as a national goal. He identified this as a national goal. Does this country still retain that as a goal? Do you feel that the national leadership of the United States at this point in our history is focused on this? MOSLE: I think they are getting focused. You're hearing more conversations both about poverty and about inequality. And I think this is one other profound shift from where we were 50 years ago. We had the issue of poverty, helping everybody move up the economic ladder. At the same time - and this gives me hope, but I think we have to get even more tenacious in our strategies - we have some of, still, the highest concentrations of wealth. And so I think to meet this challenge, we need the full political leadership of the government. However, at the same time, I think we really need to engage business. And we need to engage people as citizens. And I think people still want to be part of something larger and bigger and tap that aspiration from about 50 years ago. They don't always know how. It is a fast-moving world. It is a competitive world. It is a complicated world. But the simplicity of, can we engage with families? Can we think about engaging with mothers and fathers and children together in a more holistic way? I think people want to be part of that. We have to give them a clear roadmap and strategy for that. MARTIN: That was Anne Mosle. She is the executive director of Ascend, as well as the vice president of The Aspen Institute, with us from our studios in Washington, D. C. Anne Mosle, thanks so much for joining us. MOSLE: Thanks so much, Michel, for having me. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

They created a partnership with the local community college so they can buy a block of classes so that these parents could both do - get educated and get trained for a real job, while also being a good parent and while also being able to maintain their sort of other job while they did this. MARTIN: Well, that leads me to a question which I have, which is the question which we started with. And if you're just joining us, we're talking about where the war on poverty stands now and different ways of dealing with it. My guest is Anne Mosle, executive director of Ascend. That's a project of The Aspen Institute - a think tank. And her group addresses poverty across generations. We started our conversation by asking why is it that the poverty rate really has not dropped very much since Lyndon Johnson's time, at least according to government figures - the figures that the government uses, from 19 percent then to 15 percent now. What I'm hearing you say is that all this infrastructure around addressing poverty really hasn't caught up with the way the world is lived now. MOSLE: Exactly. MARTIN: Is that about it? MOSLE: I think I couldn't agree more. How do we think about it? We've got great stuff to build upon, but how do we get a 21st century approach to what we're doing? We need the right leadership. We need to think about working across silos. And I think there's a lot of, how do we really get to connecting with families? There's a lot of good intention coming from programs or policies. Are they really connected to the dynamics of families? MARTIN: Of the way the world is now. Oh, speaking of the way the world is now, according to 2012 census numbers, a third of single female-headed households live in poverty. You know, that's one of the family changes that has occurred - family-style changes that has occurred since Lyndon Johnson's time. There are those who argue that the real issue is not kind of the structure of programs or the structure of work, it's the structure of families. And if there were not this many single female-headed households, who across racial groups, are much more likely to be poor - you know, white single female-headed households, as quiet as it's kept, are as likely to be poor as households headed by women of other ethnic groups - that that's really the big driver of the continuation of poverty, is that family breakdown. What's your perspective on that? MOSLE: A couple thoughts on that. First, I think it's really important for us, when we think about if we're really going to attack poverty, it's not on the individual. It's not going to come out of a program. Of all the conversations I've had with families out there, no one is out there - I want the greatest program. They want to have the kind of self-sufficiency and independence that we all want. MARTIN: OK. MOSLE: So as we're thinking about sort of the growth of women-headed families, I think one of the things that we can really pull upon is we've seen the importance and the power of investing in women. We've see that internationally. We've seen that globally. While there are some support programs out there that get to mothers, I actually think it would be very exciting and have some profound results to be even more intentional in those investments. There's a lot of women concentrated in low-wage jobs or dead-end jobs. How do we think about getting them onto paths where it's nontraditional jobs, whether it's security, police, construction, different forms of specialized manufacturing? In the U. S. , we do have a skills gap for higher-paying jobs. What if we were to track mothers and put them on a path for a stronger job at the same time that you're supporting their children? MARTIN: I want to conclude our conversation today with kind of where we started, which was with President Lyndon Johnson. I mean, one of the points that you made is that he put the stature - his personal stature and the weight of his office behind this as a national goal. He identified this as a national goal. Does this country still retain that as a goal? Do you feel that the national leadership of the United States at this point in our history is focused on this? MOSLE: I think they are getting focused. You're hearing more conversations both about poverty and about inequality. And I think this is one other profound shift from where we were 50 years ago. We had the issue of poverty, helping everybody move up the economic ladder. At the same time - and this gives me hope, but I think we have to get even more tenacious in our strategies - we have some of, still, the highest concentrations of wealth. And so I think to meet this challenge, we need the full political leadership of the government. However, at the same time, I think we really need to engage business. And we need to engage people as citizens. And I think people still want to be part of something larger and bigger and tap that aspiration from about 50 years ago. They don't always know how. It is a fast-moving world. It is a competitive world. It is a complicated world. But the simplicity of, can we engage with families? Can we think about engaging with mothers and fathers and children together in a more holistic way? I think people want to be part of that. We have to give them a clear roadmap and strategy for that. MARTIN: That was Anne Mosle. She is the executive director of Ascend, as well as the vice president of The Aspen Institute, with us from our studios in Washington, D. C. Anne Mosle, thanks so much for joining us. MOSLE: Thanks so much, Michel, for having me.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But first, to matters of personal finance. Now this is the time of year when many people are making an effort to get a handle on their credit. But according to consumer columnist Sheryl Harris, there are a lot of myths out there when it comes to consumer credit, in particular, she says, many people are confused about the things that actually help your credit and the things that don't.

So she braved that to get to us. So thanks so much for joining us. SHERYL HARRIS: Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: It seems that there has been a lot of emphasis in recent years on helping Americans better understand their credit and putting a lot of emphasis on that. Why is that? HARRIS: Credit's important to a lot of different aspects of your life. It used to be important only to you and your bank or you and your credit card company. But now there are lots of different companies that are using credit reports to make decisions about you. MARTIN: What exactly is a credit report? HARRIS: Your credit report basically shows how you handle credit card and loan accounts and how many of those accounts you have. If you make payments that are more than 30 days late, that will show up on a credit report. But for most of us, we're making on-time payments. And our credit reports will reflect that. The other. . . MARTIN: And what's a credit score? Is that different than a credit report? HARRIS: The score is a grade, and it's based on the information that's in your credit report. Scores can be all different. And you just need to be aware of that, that one score may not look like another score. MARTIN: Well, that was one of the myths that you talked about first. You said, myth - you have one credit score that's constantly being updated. And you say, the fact is. . . HARRIS: You don't have a single score. And it's not like you're walking down the street, and as you walk south, your number's changing up and down. You only have a credit score when you or a company that you do business with pays to run one for you. Your score is not something that you should be constantly worrying about on a day-in, day-out or even month-in, month-out basis. MARTIN: Yeah, but you also say that you got to make sure your credit report is free of errors. And, you know, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have tell you that this is something that I have been dealing with off and on for months now, that these fraudulent reports keep popping up. And it's really a pain to deal with. So how do you deal with that? HARRIS: You have fraudulent information on your credit report? MARTIN: Yeah, and this is not a unique situation as I understand it. You know, from. . . HARRIS: Right, there are credit reports - about 25 percent of them have errors. And about 5 percent of those contain errors that are serious enough to cause someone to have to pay more for credit. So if you've tried to get an error off your credit report and you are unable to do so, you should file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And that's consumerfinance. gov. And it will contact the credit reporting agency that you're having difficulty with and find out what the problem is. They're looking into this right now, and it's a huge issue for them. They've got your back. MARTIN: OK. Well, good to know. Another myth you say is that closing a credit card account drags down your score. That's an interesting one. What is the truth? HARRIS: It's true that any change in your credit mix - adding an account or closing a paid-off account - will cause a dip in your score. But that generally is only a temporary dip. One of the factors in a credit score is the amount of debt you have on your credit cards versus the total credit limit on all your cards combined. And if you're using up a lot of that space on your cards, you don't want to close a credit card account because you need that unused space to kind of change that ratio and make it look little better and help your score. But the problem is there are a whole bunch of people who have great credit who pay off their cards every month, they've heard that closing an account will bring down their score and they're terrified to close old, unused accounts they don't want, accounts they're not happy with anymore. And they don't need to worry. This is the best rule of thumb. If you have good credit, you can close accounts that you no longer want as long as those accounts have been in good standing for a while and they are paid off in full and if you're not planning to apply for credit in the next six months. And the reason for that is you don't want to fuss with your credit mix in that six-month period before you plan to apply for, say, a home loan or car loan. You just want to look the same. MARTIN: You say another myth is that checking your credit report will lower your score. True or false? HARRIS: That's false. You can check your credit reports, and it won't make any difference to your score. When you check your own credit report or when a lender you already have an account with checks your credit report, it's called a soft inquiry. And soft inquiries do not affect your score. When a lender checks your credit report in response to an application that you fill out for new credit, that's called a hard inquiry. And hard inquiries can lower your score if you have too many of them at one time. So to avoid too many hard inquiries, you want to comparison shop for loans like car loans in a really short period - like maybe two weeks - and you want to avoid kind of serially opening credit card accounts because those - credit card applications, the inquiries for those, those each count as a separate hard inquiry. And they'll bang your score. MARTIN: This is - one thing I think would be of interest to a lot of people who've been through some difficult times in recent years. You say, myth, if you have bad credit or a bankruptcy, you'll never get credit again. Really? HARRIS: People do recover from bad credit all the time. I mean, people go through bankruptcy to wipe out their credit. In fact, it used to be when credit was really easy to get, they'd come home from bankruptcy court and find a bunch of new credit applications in their mailboxes, right? So the fact is there is no situation that you can get yourself in that you can't get yourself out with time and on-time payments. An on-time payment means you're paying at least the minimum amount due. So you can't - if your minimum payment on your card is $25, and you say, gee, all I can really pull together is 23 this month, that is not going to count as an on-time payment, no matter when it gets there. MARTIN: So you say time and on-time payments. . . HARRIS: That's right. MARTIN: . . . Heal all wounds. HARRIS: They do. MARTIN: Well, that's good, Sheryl. So thanks so much for that encouraging news. Is there one specific message that you would want to have people take with them? HARRIS: I don't want them to be afraid to order credit their reports or to look at them. I think once they do, they'll feel a lot more empowered by that. So if they have a pen in hand, your credit reports are free if you go through annualcreditreport. com or if you call 1-877-322-8228. You can get a free credit report, and you want to make sure it is accurate, it has all your accounts on it, that you're getting credit for all the good credit that you have. And just take a chance. Go look at them. Once you do, you won't be afraid of that process anymore. MARTIN: Sheryl Harris is a consumer columnist for the Plain Dealer in Cleveland.

Good morning. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. There was a surprise in the U. S. Senate yesterday. Six Republicans crossed party lines and voted to extend long-term unemployment benefits, benefits that expired for 1. 3 million Americans just after Christmas. The bill still needs to clear the House. GREENE: The Federal Unemployment Insurance Program dates back to the 1930s and the New Deal. And it was 50 years ago today that the American public heard a solemn promise to build on existing protections for the poor. It came from President Lyndon Johnson. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON: This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. MONTAGNE: Johnson said it was a war that the nation could not afford to lose. At the time, one in five Americans was poor. Today, things are better, but tens of millions of Americans are still poor, which raises the question: Did the war on poverty fail? GREENE: It's a question NPR will explore during the course of this year. We'll also be looking at what's being done today to reduce poverty. We begin in Appalachia, where President Johnson traveled to generate support for his new campaign. Here's NPR's Pam Fessler. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: People in the isolated hills of Martin County, Kentucky, rarely saw outsiders, let alone a president. So Johnson's visit in 1964 was a very big deal. Lee Mueller was a young newspaper reporter. He recalls the crowds in downtown Inez, the county seat, waiting for the presidential party to arrive at an abandoned miniature golf course. LEE MUELLER: It was just like a hayfield full of long grass, and it looked like helicopters landing in Vietnam or something when they came over the ridge. There were four or five of them, I think. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FESSLER: He says the locals didn't know their role in this new, domestic war, but a government film shows that the White House clearly did. (SOUNDBITE OF GOVERNMENT FILM)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: In this south central mountain country, over a third of the population is faced with chronic unemployment. FESSLER: It was to give poverty a face and a name. (SOUNDBITE OF GOVERNMENT FILM)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Typical of this group is Tom Fletcher, his wife and eight children. Fletcher, an unemployed sawmill operator, earned only $400 last year, and has been able to find little employment in the last two years. FESSLER: At the time, the poverty rate in this coal-mining area was more than 60 percent. Johnson visited the Fletchers on the porch of their home, a small wooden structure with fake brick siding. And photographers took what would become one of the iconic images of the war on poverty: the president crouched down, chatting with Tom Fletcher about the lack of jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF CARS PASSING)FESSLER: Fast forward 50 years, and some things haven't changed much at all: the Fletcher cabin for one. It's still standing along a windy road about five miles outside of town. It now has wood siding, painted orange. There's a metal fence with a no trespassing sign to keep out strangers. There are lots of small houses and trailers along this road, but also some new, bigger homes that could be found in any American suburb. And downtown, Inez has some new offices and a big bank. Roads are well-paved, and people say the schools and hospitals here are a lot better than they used to be. Still, Martin County remains one of the poorest counties in the country. Its poverty rate is 35 percent, more than twice the national average. Unemployment is high. Only 9 percent of the adults have a college degree. Much of the poverty today is tucked between the mountains, in what are called the hollers. NORMA MOORE: Hi. FESSLER: Hi. How are you? MOORE: We were up all night. Hi, I'm Norma. FESSLER: Norma Moore greets visitors from Appalachia Reach Out, a faith-based charity that helps the area's poor. Moore cares for her eight-year-old grandson, Brayden. She says his parents didn't want him, that he was born with a rare blood disease and is severely disabled. MOORE: And they said he was dying.  And then at four months, I got him. And I've had him ever since. FESSLER: Brayden doesn't talk or walk. But he's in constant motion, rolling on the floor of their double-wide trailer home, bumping into walls and doors. MOORE: Come on. Come in here, get mommy. Come on. FESSLER: There's no question that Moore's life is incredibly stressful. She says she gets by on her faith. But here's where the war on poverty has also made a big difference. Today, she gets food stamps, supplemental security income for her grandson and energy assistance to heat her home. She shakes her head thinking about life without it. MOORE: I would be homeless. I would be the one living on the street, if it wasn't for that. FESSLER: She looks down at her grandson on the floor. MOORE: He would probably be in a home somewhere. FESSLER: Today, many people here rely on government aid. In fact, it's the largest source of income in Martin County. People say it's helped reduce hunger, improved health care and given young families a boost, especially at a time when coal mining jobs are disappearing by the hundreds. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Singing) Get your body moving, get your body grooving. FESSLER: Children in a Head Start class skip across the lunchroom in a nearby school. This is one of the signature programs of the war on poverty, helping low and moderate-income children get ready for school. Budget cuts are always a concern here. Some of these children get their only hot meal of the day here at school. DELSIE FLETCHER: My name is Delsie Fletcher. I am a family service worker at Martin County Head Start. FESSLER: Fletcher helps Head Start parents with services, such as getting their high school diplomas, so maybe they can get a better job. And yes, Delsie is one of those Fletchers: married to one of the children who stood on the porch with President Johnson. I'm curious how the war on poverty has helped her husband's family, if at all. Turns out, along with the famous photo, it's a sore topic. FLETCHER: They don't like to talk about it, because, you know, they don't want to be known as the poorest family in Martin County. FESSLER: And she says they probably weren't, that most of the Fletchers have done OK for themselves. Still, it hasn't been easy. Her husband had some of his toes cut off when he worked in the sawmills, and now he's on disability. Work around here can be tough and dangerous, which is why coal mining jobs pay so well. But now they're scarce, and there's nothing to replace them, so people are struggling to adjust. THOMAS VINSON: My name is Thomas Vinson, and I've been a resident of Martin County for 41 years. And I work in the coal fields, and I'm unemployed right now. FESSLER: Vinson says he has a big house payment and three sons to raise. VINSON: You know, times is tough, but, you know, we're making it. FESSLER: One reason is Vinson's wife got a job at a gear factory through a federally funded program to help unemployed miners. Vinson's grateful for the short-term help, but worried about his future. Overall, he's disappointed in the war on poverty. He says he sees too many people around here just collecting checks. And to what end? VINSON: They call it poverty, but I call it abusing the system. You know, like, if you're going to file up for SSI, you go in there and say the right things, you'll come out of there with a check. FESSLER: His feelings are widespread around here: What good are all these government programs if they don't get you a job? Mike Howell runs the local community action program, where the Vinsons came for help. The program's a direct result of the war on poverty. Howell agrees that the war has yet to achieve its goals, but says the reason is a lack of support, that the burst of enthusiasm after President Johnson's visit has waned. Every year, his program has to fight for funds. MIKE HOWELL: We have kind of let poverty go to the side. It's still way too high. Somebody asked me one time about the war on poverty, and I said, well, it really wasn't a war. It was more of a skirmish. And we need to declare war on poverty again. FESSLER: One, he says, that goes back to Johnson's original goal, which was to help people not only survive, but to thrive. Pam Fessler, NPR News. GREENE: Later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, we'll hear how some are trying to convince young people to stay in Martin County, Kentucky. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News.

And it was 50 years ago today that the American public heard a solemn promise to build on existing protections for the poor. It came from President Lyndon Johnson. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON: This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. MONTAGNE: Johnson said it was a war that the nation could not afford to lose. At the time, one in five Americans was poor. Today, things are better, but tens of millions of Americans are still poor, which raises the question: Did the war on poverty fail? GREENE: It's a question NPR will explore during the course of this year. We'll also be looking at what's being done today to reduce poverty. We begin in Appalachia, where President Johnson traveled to generate support for his new campaign. Here's NPR's Pam Fessler. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: People in the isolated hills of Martin County, Kentucky, rarely saw outsiders, let alone a president. So Johnson's visit in 1964 was a very big deal. Lee Mueller was a young newspaper reporter. He recalls the crowds in downtown Inez, the county seat, waiting for the presidential party to arrive at an abandoned miniature golf course. LEE MUELLER: It was just like a hayfield full of long grass, and it looked like helicopters landing in Vietnam or something when they came over the ridge. There were four or five of them, I think. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FESSLER: He says the locals didn't know their role in this new, domestic war, but a government film shows that the White House clearly did. (SOUNDBITE OF GOVERNMENT FILM) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: In this south central mountain country, over a third of the population is faced with chronic unemployment. FESSLER: It was to give poverty a face and a name. (SOUNDBITE OF GOVERNMENT FILM) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Typical of this group is Tom Fletcher, his wife and eight children. Fletcher, an unemployed sawmill operator, earned only $400 last year, and has been able to find little employment in the last two years. FESSLER: At the time, the poverty rate in this coal-mining area was more than 60 percent. Johnson visited the Fletchers on the porch of their home, a small wooden structure with fake brick siding. And photographers took what would become one of the iconic images of the war on poverty: the president crouched down, chatting with Tom Fletcher about the lack of jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF CARS PASSING) FESSLER: Fast forward 50 years, and some things haven't changed much at all: the Fletcher cabin for one. It's still standing along a windy road about five miles outside of town. It now has wood siding, painted orange. There's a metal fence with a no trespassing sign to keep out strangers. There are lots of small houses and trailers along this road, but also some new, bigger homes that could be found in any American suburb. And downtown, Inez has some new offices and a big bank. Roads are well-paved, and people say the schools and hospitals here are a lot better than they used to be. Still, Martin County remains one of the poorest counties in the country. Its poverty rate is 35 percent, more than twice the national average. Unemployment is high. Only 9 percent of the adults have a college degree. Much of the poverty today is tucked between the mountains, in what are called the hollers. NORMA MOORE: Hi. FESSLER: Hi. How are you? MOORE: We were up all night. Hi, I'm Norma. FESSLER: Norma Moore greets visitors from Appalachia Reach Out, a faith-based charity that helps the area's poor. Moore cares for her eight-year-old grandson, Brayden. She says his parents didn't want him, that he was born with a rare blood disease and is severely disabled. MOORE: And they said he was dying.  And then at four months, I got him. And I've had him ever since. FESSLER: Brayden doesn't talk or walk. But he's in constant motion, rolling on the floor of their double-wide trailer home, bumping into walls and doors. MOORE: Come on. Come in here, get mommy. Come on. FESSLER: There's no question that Moore's life is incredibly stressful. She says she gets by on her faith. But here's where the war on poverty has also made a big difference. Today, she gets food stamps, supplemental security income for her grandson and energy assistance to heat her home. She shakes her head thinking about life without it. MOORE: I would be homeless. I would be the one living on the street, if it wasn't for that. FESSLER: She looks down at her grandson on the floor. MOORE: He would probably be in a home somewhere. FESSLER: Today, many people here rely on government aid. In fact, it's the largest source of income in Martin County. People say it's helped reduce hunger, improved health care and given young families a boost, especially at a time when coal mining jobs are disappearing by the hundreds. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Singing) Get your body moving, get your body grooving. FESSLER: Children in a Head Start class skip across the lunchroom in a nearby school. This is one of the signature programs of the war on poverty, helping low and moderate-income children get ready for school. Budget cuts are always a concern here. Some of these children get their only hot meal of the day here at school. DELSIE FLETCHER: My name is Delsie Fletcher. I am a family service worker at Martin County Head Start. FESSLER: Fletcher helps Head Start parents with services, such as getting their high school diplomas, so maybe they can get a better job. And yes, Delsie is one of those Fletchers: married to one of the children who stood on the porch with President Johnson. I'm curious how the war on poverty has helped her husband's family, if at all. Turns out, along with the famous photo, it's a sore topic. FLETCHER: They don't like to talk about it, because, you know, they don't want to be known as the poorest family in Martin County. FESSLER: And she says they probably weren't, that most of the Fletchers have done OK for themselves. Still, it hasn't been easy. Her husband had some of his toes cut off when he worked in the sawmills, and now he's on disability. Work around here can be tough and dangerous, which is why coal mining jobs pay so well. But now they're scarce, and there's nothing to replace them, so people are struggling to adjust. THOMAS VINSON: My name is Thomas Vinson, and I've been a resident of Martin County for 41 years. And I work in the coal fields, and I'm unemployed right now. FESSLER: Vinson says he has a big house payment and three sons to raise. VINSON: You know, times is tough, but, you know, we're making it. FESSLER: One reason is Vinson's wife got a job at a gear factory through a federally funded program to help unemployed miners. Vinson's grateful for the short-term help, but worried about his future. Overall, he's disappointed in the war on poverty. He says he sees too many people around here just collecting checks. And to what end? VINSON: They call it poverty, but I call it abusing the system. You know, like, if you're going to file up for SSI, you go in there and say the right things, you'll come out of there with a check. FESSLER: His feelings are widespread around here: What good are all these government programs if they don't get you a job? Mike Howell runs the local community action program, where the Vinsons came for help. The program's a direct result of the war on poverty. Howell agrees that the war has yet to achieve its goals, but says the reason is a lack of support, that the burst of enthusiasm after President Johnson's visit has waned. Every year, his program has to fight for funds. MIKE HOWELL: We have kind of let poverty go to the side. It's still way too high. Somebody asked me one time about the war on poverty, and I said, well, it really wasn't a war. It was more of a skirmish. And we need to declare war on poverty again. FESSLER: One, he says, that goes back to Johnson's original goal, which was to help people not only survive, but to thrive. Pam Fessler, NPR News. GREENE: Later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, we'll hear how some are trying to convince young people to stay in Martin County, Kentucky.", "section": "War On Poverty, 50 Years Later", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

Some of these are probably less crucial for the national economy, but others are vital to the health of certain industries. At least that's what the businesses that benefit say, as NPR's Chris Arnold has been finding out. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: In all, more than 50 different tax breaks expired at the end of the year. And if Congress doesn't vote to extend them, many companies and millions of average Americans will be paying higher taxes - by one count, $50 billion a year more. The list includes students who write off tuition, underwater homeowners and clean energy companies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARNOLD: An animated video on the company Sieman's website shows offshore wind-farms withstanding big storms at sea, complete with heroic music.

ROB GRAMLICH: Actually if you were to stack the blades end to end it would be almost 45 miles. ARNOLD: A factory in Iowa will build all those, which the governor there is happy about. But new construction in this industry has been getting a big boost from one of these tax breaks that just expired. GRAMLICH: Most people don't realize how important our tax policy is for our energy strategy of the country. ARNOLD: Rob Gramlich is a vice president with the American Wind Energy Association. He says something called the Production Tax Credit gives federal money to companies that generate clean energy. That allows them to sell electricity cheaper so that they can compete with fossil fuels. And he says this is such a big deal that when this subsidy has expired in the past new construction has crashed. GRAMLICH: Wind energy development in the country has dropped, year on year, from 70 to 90 percent. It really is disruptive each time the credit expires. And just a year, year and a half ago, we were in a situation where literally tens of thousands of jobs were being lost. People were being laid off left and right. ARNOLD: After that happened the subsidy got extended and the industry is now lobbying for another extension. Some economists like these targeted tax incentives because they think they foster the growth of industries and technologies that will be good for the country. Likewise, giving people a tax break to save money for retirement encourages them to do that and that's good. But other economists don't like any tax credits or tax breaks at all. JOHN MAKIN: I certainly am for the simpler system. ARNOLD: John Makin is an economist with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. He thinks the government should get rid of all tax breaks. And with the money that it's saved it could lower tax rates for ordinary people. And he says that that would boost the economy. MAKIN: If you phase out all the tax breaks - those for saving, those for housing, all wonderful ideas - and give people lower marginal rates, they'll end up better off. ARNOLD: Basically, Makin doesn't trust the government to make good decisions about which industries or behaviors should be promoted through tax breaks. MAKIN: You push one lever and a lot of other things happen. ARNOLD: For example, decades ago, the government said employees who got free parking at work didn't have to pay taxes on that perk. But that incentivized driving over mass transit. Larry Filler is a transportation consultant. He helped to champion another tax break to encourage more people to ride the train to work. But part of that just expired so now we're back with a bigger subsidy for people who drive cars, which for a transportation consultant is. . . LARRY FILLER: Well it's definitely backward. I mean it's one of the most horrendous situations you can imagine.

Their employer offered a new contract cutting back retirement and health benefits. It came with what looked like a threat. The company said it might have to move important operations out of Washington state and hire new workers. Union members approved the contract - barely - and Boeing is staying put. Journalist Hedrick Smith has written about the decline of the middle class. In an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, he says Boeing just contributed to that. Thanks for coming on the program. We appreciate it. HEDRICK SMITH: My pleasure, David. GREENE: I want to ask you, you wrote that this vote at Boeing had large implications for middle-class America. That's pretty sweeping language. Tell me what you mean. SMITH: Well, people ask me, I wrote this book, \"Who Stole the American Dream? \"GREENE: Right. SMITH: Who stole the American dream, they'll say. Well, Boeing just stole a chunk of it. And what I mean by that is that the American dream consists of a good salary, a steady job, health benefits, some kind of retirement benefit, the ability to buy your own home and help your kids do better than you do. Well, Boeing has just imposed a tremendous cut in the retirement benefits for tens of thousands of Boeing workers. That's taking away a chunk of the American dream. And at the same time, Boeing management and its board of directors voted a 50 percent increase in the stock for the company and a $10 billion buyback of the company's stock, and company executives get paid in stock. So they've added to the economic divide, this great inequality that everybody's talking about; Boeing just added to that. That's what I mean by larger implications for the middle class. GREENE: And specifically, when we look at this, I mean when we talk about, you know, pensions that people used to rely on for the long term, now their, the burden is on them to put more money into the retirement. The burden is on workers to pay more for their health insurance. You're seeing this just taking its toll on a lot of people in the country. SMITH: Absolutely. It's hard to believe today. But if you go back to 1980, 84 percent, five out of six of American workers who work for companies of more than 100 employees - certainly, Boeing and GE and GM, and - but lots of other middle-sized companies too, had a lifetime pension paid by their employer from the day they retired until the day they died every month they got a check. That kind of security on top of Social Security meant that people who had worked for 35, 40 years for a company all their lives could be secure in their retirement. When we switched over to 401(k)s - as companies began to do in the late '80s and the '90s, then the 2000s and now, the burden was shifted from the company's books to the pocketbooks and the checkbooks of ordinary Americans, and it makes an enormous amount of difference. GREENE: Hedrick Smith, you've raised a philosophical debate in your book and mentioned that there are some people in this country - George W. Bush was one of them - who talked about an ownership society. The idea that, you know, some people don't believe in so-called corporate welfare. They believe that people, families should be on their own, to, sort of, lift themselves up. Aren't there people, maybe some who aren't that wealthy in the country who would vote on that very thing and say, you know what, I don't need a lot of benefits these days from a big corporation, I don't need help from the government, I want to do things on my own? SMITH: Sure there are. But what was interesting is when that choice was first put to the machinists, who were pretty average people in Washington State, they voted two to one against this. It was only when their leadership really put pressure on them to come along with this deal and the governor said we're going to lose jobs. And, by the way, Boeing had also sweetened the kitty; they added $1 billion worth of restoring cutbacks that they had wanted to do. Yeah, there are people who would say that. But we've moved, David. This is a point, maybe, that should be underlined about Boeing. We've moved from an idea of stakeholder capitalism, where the leaders of GM and Boeing and General Electric believed back in the '50s, '60s and '70s in sharing the wealth. That a prosperous American middle class helped the American economy and helped the country to a notion of capitalism where the idea is maximum return to shareholders, boost your dividend, buy back your stock at the same time you're cutting workers' pay and workers' benefits. I mean that's a very different motion. Both of those are American capitalism. One is the traditional style, the other is the new economy. And my argument in my book, \"Who Stole the American Dream? \" is it's hurt the economy, it's lowering the economy and it's really crippled the middle class.

I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. The global recession hit Puerto Rico hard and left its budget in shambles. But some optimists say they can help solve the island's economic problems from the bottom-up. Tim Fitzsimons reports from San Juan. TIM FITZSIMONS, BYLINE: In the shadow of Castillo San Cristobal, a massive stone fort built by the Spanish in the 18th century, stands the Capitolio: Puerto Rico's seat of government. And on this December day, public school teachers were protesting on its steps. (SOUNDBITE OF YELLING)FITZSIMONS: Why were these teachers protesting? Because Puerto Rico's economy is in the dumps, and the government must reform its teacher pension system to avoid a credit agency downgrade of its municipal debt, which is currently just one level above junk status. Here in Puerto Rico, the situation is dire: the unemployment rate is more than double what it is on the U. S. mainland, and many young, educated people are moving away for better opportunities. But not everyone on the island is pessimistic. A growing movement of globally minded Puerto Ricans see a silver lining in this crisis and are planning for future growth. SOFIA STOLBERG: Well, this is Piloto 151, so welcome to our headquarters. We're the first co-working space in San Juan, Puerto Rico - actually, the first in Puerto Rico, to be exact. And. . . FITZSIMONS: That's Sofia Stolberg. Back in September, she started Piloto 151, a co-working office for small businesses. From inside a renovated colonial building in old San Juan, aspiring entrepreneurs can set up shop to work on freelance projects, tech startups, or whatever else. Piloto 151 will help them incorporate and take advantage of the island's various tax and business incentives. Her idea is to cultivate businesses that work and think globally. Stolberg says part of Puerto Rico's economic problem stems from its geographic isolation, what she calls an island mentality. STOLBERG: We fail, sometimes, as a culture to look beyond our borders and to what the rest of the world is doing, and to what the best practices are. One day, I hope we have companies that do what Skype did for Estonia. All we need is one company to make it really big, and Puerto Rico will be a completely different destination and landscape. FITZSIMONS: Tackling the task of professionalizing and globalizing the talent that already exists in Puerto Rico is one of the main focuses of an organization across town, in the business district of Hato Rey. JON BORSCHOW: I'm Jon Borschow, the chairman of the Foundation for Puerto Rico. FITZSIMONS: Jon is one of Puerto Rico's most successful businessmen. He sold his medical supplies company in 2008 in one of the island's largest-ever business transactions. He made his fortune in the medical supply industry that helped modernize Puerto Rico's economy during its boom in the mid-20th century. BORSCHOW: So I've actually seen, during the course of my life, the entire trajectory of Puerto Rico, from poverty to First World success. As a consequence of that, I was able to see when the winds began to changeFITZSIMONS: Borschow hopes his organization can act as a catalyst to reorient Puerto Rico from an inward-looking business environment to a more dynamic, global hub. BORSCHOW: What had really happened is that, in a way the very success that we had, had so insulated us from a lot of the changes that were taking place around the globe - you know, as we call it, globalization and internationalization - to a degree that we were really kind of a little self-contained economy. FITZSIMONS: Borschow's foundation is supporting the development of a new kind of organization for younger Puerto Ricans. It's called ConPRmetidos. One of its goals is to take the brain-drain problem and turn it into a brain circulation advantage. The organization runs workshops to bring educated and successful Puerto Ricans who have left back to the island to share their skills. ConPRmetidos co-founder Cristina Sumaza says since Puerto Rico's economic problems are so deep-rooted, focusing on the youth will ensure a brighter future for the island. CRISTINA SUMAZA: It's a long way to go. Its something won't be able to change, you know, in a year or two years. But I think that little by little, we could tackle that young, millennial generation coming up. They're going to be choosing whether they stay here or whether they go. You close the gap, that opportunity divide, as we call it. FITZSIMONS: At ConPRmetido's one-year anniversary gala, I spoke to Christian Padilla. After finishing his studies in Puerto Rico, he got an MBA on the mainland and now works for IBM in New York. CHRISTIAN PADILLA: We need to work for our island. And, in a way, it's a way of creating - we have a word in Spanish that is patria, you know, like, your homeland. So it's a way of creating patria. FITZSIMONS: These groups have their work cut out to boost the economy and improve Puerto Rico's reputation with investors. The government will have to raise money again in the bond market early in this New Year. For NPR News, I'm Tim Fitzsimons. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. The global recession hit Puerto Rico hard and left its budget in shambles. But some optimists say they can help solve the island's economic problems from the bottom-up. Tim Fitzsimons reports from San Juan. TIM FITZSIMONS, BYLINE: In the shadow of Castillo San Cristobal, a massive stone fort built by the Spanish in the 18th century, stands the Capitolio: Puerto Rico's seat of government. And on this December day, public school teachers were protesting on its steps. (SOUNDBITE OF YELLING) FITZSIMONS: Why were these teachers protesting? Because Puerto Rico's economy is in the dumps, and the government must reform its teacher pension system to avoid a credit agency downgrade of its municipal debt, which is currently just one level above junk status. Here in Puerto Rico, the situation is dire: the unemployment rate is more than double what it is on the U. S. mainland, and many young, educated people are moving away for better opportunities. But not everyone on the island is pessimistic. A growing movement of globally minded Puerto Ricans see a silver lining in this crisis and are planning for future growth. SOFIA STOLBERG: Well, this is Piloto 151, so welcome to our headquarters. We're the first co-working space in San Juan, Puerto Rico - actually, the first in Puerto Rico, to be exact. And. . . FITZSIMONS: That's Sofia Stolberg. Back in September, she started Piloto 151, a co-working office for small businesses. From inside a renovated colonial building in old San Juan, aspiring entrepreneurs can set up shop to work on freelance projects, tech startups, or whatever else. Piloto 151 will help them incorporate and take advantage of the island's various tax and business incentives. Her idea is to cultivate businesses that work and think globally. Stolberg says part of Puerto Rico's economic problem stems from its geographic isolation, what she calls an island mentality. STOLBERG: We fail, sometimes, as a culture to look beyond our borders and to what the rest of the world is doing, and to what the best practices are. One day, I hope we have companies that do what Skype did for Estonia. All we need is one company to make it really big, and Puerto Rico will be a completely different destination and landscape. FITZSIMONS: Tackling the task of professionalizing and globalizing the talent that already exists in Puerto Rico is one of the main focuses of an organization across town, in the business district of Hato Rey. JON BORSCHOW: I'm Jon Borschow, the chairman of the Foundation for Puerto Rico. FITZSIMONS: Jon is one of Puerto Rico's most successful businessmen. He sold his medical supplies company in 2008 in one of the island's largest-ever business transactions. He made his fortune in the medical supply industry that helped modernize Puerto Rico's economy during its boom in the mid-20th century. BORSCHOW: So I've actually seen, during the course of my life, the entire trajectory of Puerto Rico, from poverty to First World success. As a consequence of that, I was able to see when the winds began to change FITZSIMONS: Borschow hopes his organization can act as a catalyst to reorient Puerto Rico from an inward-looking business environment to a more dynamic, global hub. BORSCHOW: What had really happened is that, in a way the very success that we had, had so insulated us from a lot of the changes that were taking place around the globe - you know, as we call it, globalization and internationalization - to a degree that we were really kind of a little self-contained economy. FITZSIMONS: Borschow's foundation is supporting the development of a new kind of organization for younger Puerto Ricans. It's called ConPRmetidos. One of its goals is to take the brain-drain problem and turn it into a brain circulation advantage. The organization runs workshops to bring educated and successful Puerto Ricans who have left back to the island to share their skills. ConPRmetidos co-founder Cristina Sumaza says since Puerto Rico's economic problems are so deep-rooted, focusing on the youth will ensure a brighter future for the island. CRISTINA SUMAZA: It's a long way to go. Its something won't be able to change, you know, in a year or two years. But I think that little by little, we could tackle that young, millennial generation coming up. They're going to be choosing whether they stay here or whether they go.

They also want to tie further increases to the cost of living. At the same time, minimum wage efforts are underway in more than a dozen states and cities. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea caught up with several activists who say, in blue states and red, the moment for a wage hike has arrived. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: You never know where you might find a volunteer with a clipboard looking for signatures, trying to get a referendum on the local ballot. I caught up with Ed Flanagan on his cellphone in the town of North Pole, Alaska. ED FLANAGAN: OK. Well, I'm out in what's called the North Pole transfer station. This facility has about 50 metal dumpsters arranged in a fenced area. Folks back up and throw their household trash in there. This is a very busy place. GONYEA: There's no residential trash pick up here, so people have to haul their own. So for Flanagan, it's a great place to do some politicking for the minimum wage hike his group hopes to get on the August primary ballot. A car pulls up. FLANAGAN: Hang on just a second. Hello. We're trying to raise the minimum wage. Are you a registered voter? OK. Have a good day. GONYEA: Thousands of miles away, Lew Finfer spoke to me from his office in Massachusetts. He's with a coalition looking to get a minimum wage hike on the November ballot there. LEW FINFER: This would be something like 700,000 people in Massachusetts who earn between eight and 10. 50 would get a raise. And there would be a billion dollars that would go back into the economy because people would spend it locally. GONYEA: One of those Massachusetts workers who would benefit is 41-year-old Patty Federico. She makes 9. 10 an hour at a movie theater. She says they won't put her on full time. PATTY FEDERICO: Right now, with the money that I'm making, it just is a nightmare. It's not paying the bills. So I am desperately looking for a full-time job. GONYEA: Elsewhere, there are minimum wage hike campaigns in South Dakota, Illinois, Minnesota, Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Maryland and several cities. There's also Arkansas, where the current state minimum wage is a dollar an hour less than the federal level. Stephen Copley heads the Give Arkansas a Raise Now coalition. STEPHEN COPLEY: No, that's right. If any state needs an increase, we do. And you know, Arkansas traditionally has been a pretty poor state anyway. So we have a number of folks who are working hard and, you know, they're trying to share in the American dream but they just can't make ends meet. GONYEA: Arkansas also has a hotly contested U. S. Senate race this year. Some Democrats hope a referendum can boost turnout for their side in 2014, though political analysts say that's hardly a sure bet. Anywhere a minimum wage increase is on the ballot, expect an aggressive campaign to defeat it. At a U. S. Chamber of Commerce event in Washington this week, the organization's Randall Johnson laid out the counter-argument. RANDALL JOHNSON: Employers will react to this either by hiring less people or by reducing benefits and payroll in different ways to adjust to the money they've got to pay for this. So it's not a free lunch. And the people on Capitol Hill who push this understand it but they just don't want to admit it. GONYEA: But Patty Federico, that movie theater employee in Massachusetts, says she hopes voters are swayed by the numbers as she has to view them. FEDERICO: It's basically starting to get you over that hurdle. Where, say like you need an extra 200 a week, at least you'll be making an extra 50. So your deficit is not as bad, but it is still bad. GONYEA: Polls do show strong support for increasing the minimum wage nationally. Federico says they just have to make sure that translates into votes. Don Gonyea, NPR News.

The government reported the economy added just 74,000 jobs in December, well below expectations. The other surprise, the unemployment rate still dropped. NPR's John Ydstie spent the day talking with economists about the report, and many say they just don't believe it. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Mark Zandi is chief economist at Moody's Analytics. He says, today's report is a statistical aberration. MARK ZANDI: It doesn't represent reality. It's not consistent with any of the other economic data that we've got which shows a better economy. YDSTIE: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a global research firm, agrees. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: We've had good numbers on things like unemployment claims, surveys of businesses saying that they're going to high more. So, other indicators suggest that this number is a fluke and probably too weak. YDSTIE: Earlier this week, the payroll processing firm ADP released its survey of job creation in December. It found 238,000 jobs were added last month. Mark Zandi's firm crunches the numbers for that report, which includes an even larger sample of businesses than the government's monthly survey. Zandi believes the ADP number is much closer to the actual job creation taking place in the economy. ZANDI: The reality is, the economy is creating at least 200,000 jobs per month. That's what it's been doing for much of the past year. I think that's what it's doing right now. I think that's what it did in December. And I think that will be born out in subsequent data. YDSTIE: But how could the government data be so far off the mark? Zandi says, even large surveys can have statistical hiccups a couple times a year. ZANDI: You just have noise. I mean, these weird things happen. Some companies report late that normally don't report late. It's just the, you know, the sausage-making of data. And every once in a while, you get a bad piece of sausage, and I think that's what happened here. YDSTIE: Zandi says cold weather in December also likely hurt job creation, especially in construction and manufacturing. The other curveball in today's data was a sharp drop in the unemployment rate, from 7 percent down to 6. 7 percent. But the data behind that number isn't good news. That's because the decline was largely due to nearly 350,000 people leaving the labor market. Many, no doubt, because jobs are still too hard to find. Kourtney Leibman, who lives in Overland Park, Kansas, knows all about that. She's been looking for a job that makes use of her college degree in English, like teaching. But she's been able to find only a couple of low-paying, part-time jobs. KOURTNEY LEIBMAN: I'm a receptionist at a church, and then I work at a yarn shop on the weekends. YDSTIE: Leibman says she has become discouraged about finding a job in her chosen field. LEIBMAN: I'm not really pursuing that at this time. I'm kind of more trying to get into a different field, maybe like Web design. YDSTIE: So it's still a difficult job market, would you say? LEIBMAN: Yes, I would. YDSTIE: But despite today's disappointing jobs report, Mark Zandi thinks things will get better in 2014. So does Nariman Behravesh, for a number of reasons. BEHRAVESH: Consumer optimism is good. We're seeing the export situation improving. We're importing less oil. Housing's still doing well. So the variety of factors that lead us to be relatively optimistic about the outlook. YDSTIE: Financial markets reacted calmly to today's disappointing jobs report. Stocks were mixed. And in the bond market, interest rates were lower. There was some speculation that the weak report might delay the Fed's plans to wind down its stimulus. Fed policymakers will likely consider that when they meet again at the end of this month.

This week, we, like many of our colleagues, have been talking about poverty because this week marks 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty. Later this hour, we'll speak with a minister who now preaches from the same pulpit where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. once stood in Atlanta - Ebenezer Baptist Church. And he's asking whether the black church is still a force for addressing issues like poverty. That's later. But first, more on the politics and policy around poverty. Now one of the pillars of LBJ's attack on poverty was promoting employment. The idea that a good job is the best way out of poverty. Well, today's job report shows it's not that simple. The economy only added 74,000 jobs last month, which was below expectations. And most of the jobs that were added in 2013 were in low-wage industries like restaurants and retail. And that means that millions of Americans are still struggling to make ends meet even though they are working full-time. So we wanted to talk more about this. So we're joined by NPR's senior business editor Marilyn Geewax and Stephen Pimpare. He's the author of the book \"A People's History of Poverty in America. \" And they're both with us now. Welcome to you both. Thank you for joining us. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. STEPHEN PIMPARE: Happy to be here. MARTIN: Marilyn, let me start with you just on today's numbers. Today's labor report showed that the unemployment rate has fallen to 6. 7 percent. How are economists interpreting this? GEEWAX: It's a confusing report because of that. On the one hand, it was pretty bad news - only 74,000 new jobs. That's about a third of what economists had been expecting. So that's pretty darn disappointing - well, below what was typical for the past year. But on the other hand, the unemployment rate fell so that means what? Seems like a lot of people dropped out of the labor force. Now some of that is just baby boomers retiring. Maybe they're retiring a little bit early, but they just decide I'm out, I'm done. But a lot of people are also just discouraged. They're just dropping out of the labor force and just deciding to maybe go back to school or just focus on being a homemaker or whatever. But they're leaving the workforce, and that's not good for the economy. You'd like to see a lot of people out there looking for work and participating. MARTIN: What about wage levels, Marilyn? You know, in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings for all employees and private non-foreign pay rolls edged up by 2 cents to $24. 17. And over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 42 cents or 1. 8 percent. Is that a good number? GEEWAX: No. That's a bad number. MARTIN: No. GEEWAX: That's. . . MARTIN: In short, no. GEEWAX: No. Forty-two cents is not great. It was a tough year for wage earners. People who do have jobs, aren't really seeing much of an improvement. If wages have risen, they're only up 1. 8 percent for the year. That's just barely a little bit above inflation. So really we've seen this job market coming back for, you know, several years now. I mean, unemployment was 10 percent back in the fall of 2009. So it is better, but it's not strong enough to drive employers to offer more wages. So most workers are pretty well-stuck, and then of course, for the really low-wage workers, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7. 25 an hour since July of 2009. Now President Obama has been pushing, saying Congress should raise that wage, but it hasn't happened yet. So low-wage workers are not really getting that push-up from Congress. And employers don't feel compelled to offer more money so wages are really compressed. MARTIN: So Professor Pimpare, could you kind of give us the bigger picture here? Who exactly are the working poor? How many people - how many Americans are we talking about that would fit into this category? PIMPARE: Well, I mean, as with poverty numbers that we've seen some reporting on this week and as with the unemployment data, it depends on which date set you're looking at and how you do the math, right. These are - we do a shockingly bad job of getting a really good handle on these sorts of important social factors. That having been said, if we think about - of all the people who are working, how many of them are earning what are called poverty-level wages? So that means that - look at the hourly wage and assume that you're working 35 hours a week, 50 to 52 weeks a year, whether you are or not, will that wage bring you to the poverty line or above? That's, remember, about $23,500 for a family of four. We're at a moment where somewhere in the neighborhood of 28 percent of all Americans are working in poverty-level jobs. That's 32 percent of all women working in poverty-level jobs, right.  So it's not just that - we've got a real problem with insufficient number of jobs available for people who want to work. And that problem is, in many ways, much worse than those official since - those official DLS data show us. But even among those people who are working, they're not earning enough money to meet their basic needs. And looking a little bit at the longer kind of pattern, what we see, in a lot of ways, is not just problems with unemployment, not just problems with poverty, but real problems with insecurity. Meaning that even if you have a job today that is more or less meeting your basic expenses, there's no guarantee that that job is still going to be there for you a month from now or six months from now or a year from now or that it will continue to keep pace with your expenses. One of the things we're seeing over the last 40 years. . . MARTIN: Professor Pimpare, I need to interrupt here. PIMPARE: Sure. Of course, I'm sorry. MARTIN: I need to get some other ideas in this conversation. So - and if you're just joining us, we're talking about low-wage workers - so-called working poor. We're talking with Stephen Pimpare. He's author of \" A People's History of Poverty in America. \" And NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Marilyn, just on the whole question of the buying power of the minimum wage. The minimum wage back in 1964 was about $1. 25 per hour. So how does that compare in today's dollars? GEEWAX: Well, if you plug that into an inflation calculator, it would be about $9. 40 an hour today. So the buying power was much greater back then. And another factor is that if you look at the era that Lyndon Johnson was the president, from '64 to '69, the minimum wage went from a $1. 25 to $1. 60. That's a 28 percent increase. During President Obama's five years in office, the minimum wage hasn't gone up at all. So, you know, there's really quite a difference between what was happening in the '60s and now. MARTIN: So let's talk, also, about one of the president's - his latest initiative, which he announced yesterday was something called new Promise Zones. These are areas of the country that will get concentrated focus. And I just want to play a short clip of his announcement. This is President Obama yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If you can demonstrate the ability and the will to launch an all-encompassing, all-hands-on-deck approach to reducing poverty and expanding opportunity, we'll help you get the resources to do it. MARTIN: So, professor, what he's saying here is this isn't really new money, but what he's saying is we're going to give sort of concentrated attention to addressing and putting a lot of focus in these areas, and kind of coordinating, you know, getting the focused attention, and trying to coordinate and create efficiencies in the programs that already exist. And I just wanted to sort of ask you, you know, about that, you know, approach. And what do you think that means? PIMPARE: Well, I don't think it ultimately winds up meaning too much at all. We've tried these before. We've got decades worth of experiments. We called them Enterprise Zones when Jack Kemp proposed them, and we implemented them in the '80s. We tried it again in 1990s under Clinton. There's a fairly robust literature that looks at the effect of these. Notice, by the way, that the president has noted that there's not any additional money going into these poor communities. He's saying, we're going to do a slightly better job of coordinating services in some small handful of areas. And over the long-term, evidence tells us that if we do see improvements, it's going to be around the margins. And they are going to disappear as soon as that concentrated attention goes away. MARTIN: Well, let me ask Marilyn about it. . . PIMPARE: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . For another perspective on this. So what about looking at the bigger picture of all the programs that are kind of in the basket now like food assistance, housing assistance, things of that sort? Is there an argument to be made that these programs over time have kind of buffered the effects of poverty or not? GEEWAX: Yes, you can really see that when you look at consumption measures. That is, in 1964, you were lucky in a lot of ways. You had more buying power as a low-wage worker, and the job market was much stronger. You had an opportunity to move up. If you could be a low-wage worker in 1964, in a lot of ways, you'd like that because the future looked pretty bright then. But on the other hand, you didn't have much. If you look at like, how big were people's houses, did they have air conditioning, did they have a car, did they have enough food to eat, it was tough being poor in 1964. But then these programs came in - like food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, Headstart - all of these kinds of programs really put a floor under being poor. So when you look at statistics today for what is life like for a poor person, it's not as bad as it was 50 years ago. There. . . MARTIN: But you're saying the mobility, the opportunity for mobility seems to be. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . Less or at least frozen, not improved at all. GEEWAX: Well, let's just say that in the late 1960s, the jobless rate was 3. 4 percent. We would love to see that again. MARTIN: OK. GEEWAX: Union jobs were plentiful. Manufacturing jobs were plentiful. But if you didn't get to participate in that and you were a poor person, today the government gives you a lot more help to make sure that you're not actually hungry because you can get these supplemental nutritional help, you can get food stamps in effect. So, you know, we've helped people get a little bit less poor because of the legacy of these programs, but the economy is not great. If you're a low-wage worker, your prospects are bad. MARTIN: Professor Pimpare, we have about a minute and a half left, so I want to give you the final word here. And I feel it's OK to ask you your opinion, which is, what's your better idea? What would be a better way to handle these issues in your view? PIMPARE: Well, you know, I think in some ways that we mystify poverty. We talk about how complicated it is, how difficult it is, right? The poor you shall always have with you - those sorts of things. When all is said and done, it's actually not that complicated. And almost every other rich democracy on the planet has done a better job of reducing poverty, of reducing child poverty, of reducing elderly poverty than the United States has. And they do that in part because they have much stronger unions. They have much better representation of workers in their political systems. They got political systems that do a much better job of representing the large public rather than sets of narrow interests. But they also do much more by way of distributing cash money to people. I mean, in some ways, you want to make people less poor, give them money. And we should be talking about raising and expanding Social Security, not cutting it back. We should be talking, especially in periods of record long-term unemployment, expanding the unemployment insurance program, making more people eligible for it, expanding the food stamp program. Those will make people less poor in immediate direct kinds of ways as opposed to the kind of enterprise zone proposals, which Bruce Bartlett this morning compared it to sort of putting together a blue ribbon commission. It's the way to make it look as if you are addressing a problem without actually making the commitment to do what we know will work to reduce suffering and to improve the well-being. . . MARTIN: OK. PIMPARE: . . . Of Americans. MARTIN: We need to end it there for now. We're going to be talking about this throughout the month, and in fact, as I mentioned, throughout the year on this and other NPR programs. So we hope you'll stay with us for that and, perhaps, participate in future conversations. Stephen Pimpare is the author of \"A People's History of Poverty in America,\" with us from our bureau in New York. With us once again in Washington, D. C. Marilyn Geewax, NPR senior business editor. Thank you both so much for joining us. GEEWAX: You're welcome. PIMPARE: Thank you, Michel. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. This week, we, like many of our colleagues, have been talking about poverty because this week marks 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty. Later this hour, we'll speak with a minister who now preaches from the same pulpit where the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. once stood in Atlanta - Ebenezer Baptist Church. And he's asking whether the black church is still a force for addressing issues like poverty. That's later. But first, more on the politics and policy around poverty. Now one of the pillars of LBJ's attack on poverty was promoting employment. The idea that a good job is the best way out of poverty. Well, today's job report shows it's not that simple. The economy only added 74,000 jobs last month, which was below expectations. And most of the jobs that were added in 2013 were in low-wage industries like restaurants and retail. And that means that millions of Americans are still struggling to make ends meet even though they are working full-time. So we wanted to talk more about this. So we're joined by NPR's senior business editor Marilyn Geewax and Stephen Pimpare. He's the author of the book \"A People's History of Poverty in America. \" And they're both with us now. Welcome to you both. Thank you for joining us. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. STEPHEN PIMPARE: Happy to be here. MARTIN: Marilyn, let me start with you just on today's numbers. Today's labor report showed that the unemployment rate has fallen to 6. 7 percent. How are economists interpreting this? GEEWAX: It's a confusing report because of that. On the one hand, it was pretty bad news - only 74,000 new jobs. That's about a third of what economists had been expecting. So that's pretty darn disappointing - well, below what was typical for the past year. But on the other hand, the unemployment rate fell so that means what? Seems like a lot of people dropped out of the labor force. Now some of that is just baby boomers retiring. Maybe they're retiring a little bit early, but they just decide I'm out, I'm done. But a lot of people are also just discouraged. They're just dropping out of the labor force and just deciding to maybe go back to school or just focus on being a homemaker or whatever. But they're leaving the workforce, and that's not good for the economy. You'd like to see a lot of people out there looking for work and participating. MARTIN: What about wage levels, Marilyn? You know, in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings for all employees and private non-foreign pay rolls edged up by 2 cents to $24. 17. And over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 42 cents or 1. 8 percent. Is that a good number? GEEWAX: No. That's a bad number. MARTIN: No. GEEWAX: That's. . . MARTIN: In short, no. GEEWAX: No. Forty-two cents is not great. It was a tough year for wage earners. People who do have jobs, aren't really seeing much of an improvement. If wages have risen, they're only up 1. 8 percent for the year. That's just barely a little bit above inflation. So really we've seen this job market coming back for, you know, several years now. I mean, unemployment was 10 percent back in the fall of 2009. So it is better, but it's not strong enough to drive employers to offer more wages. So most workers are pretty well-stuck, and then of course, for the really low-wage workers, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7. 25 an hour since July of 2009. Now President Obama has been pushing, saying Congress should raise that wage, but it hasn't happened yet. So low-wage workers are not really getting that push-up from Congress. And employers don't feel compelled to offer more money so wages are really compressed. MARTIN: So Professor Pimpare, could you kind of give us the bigger picture here?

This morning we'll get a fresh snapshot of unemployment in the U. S. when the government releases new jobs numbers. NPR's Yuki Noguchi came by to talk about what to expect. Yuki, good morning. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So where does the job market seem to be going right now? NOGUCHI: Well, there does seem to be a warm front coming through, very slowly. GREENE: Let's keep the weather metaphor going. NOGUCHI: Keep it going. Surveys show economists expect a payroll number right at around 200,000. Now, that probably sounds familiar because it's almost exactly the same as November and only a little bit higher than the average for all of last year. But the reason there's talk that things are getting better is that the initial estimate for December was weaker. This week a payroll processing company released its estimate of job numbers that surprised to the upside, so a lot of economists revised their numbers upward. GREENE: So bottom line, though, I mean since you're saying they're familiar numbers, the job growth is about where it's been, right? NOGUCHI: That's right. GREENE: So what about the unemployment rate that we always keep our eye on? NOGUCHI: Well, that fell more than expected in November to 7 percent, so it's not expected to decline further. But if it does, economists will be looking to see if that decline happened because of healthy job growth or because a lot of people left the workforce, which sometimes happens and isn't less of an optimistic sign. But now it's 2014, a new year, and there is some optimism that the market is improving. The payroll report I mentioned showed growth in sectors that pay good wages and are considered high quality jobs. Also, the construction sector added more jobs than we've seen since the last housing boom, and those are the kinds of jobs that economists believe have a kind of multiplier effect. GREENE: Yeah, this is because, I mean when we talk about construction, that can sort of multiply because it means more demand for things like furniture and appliances and all sorts of other products. It can have a good snowball effect. NOGUCHI: Right, right, exactly. That speaks to the growing strength of the housing sector, which, as we know, dragged the economy down during the Great Recession. But now there's a lot of pent-up demand for new homes, and this year analysts expect to see a lot of backhoes and other on-the-ground signs we associate with economic growth, growth that has actually been quite a bit higher than many forecasters expected. GREENE: Well, Yuki, let's draw some connections here. I mean we were talking a few months ago about the sequester, the budget sequester in Washington and other uncertainty maybe slowing down growth. It sounds like growth is steady, the third quarter GDP was over 4 percent. Often an economy growing means people are hiring. Does all that mean that we might see unemployment start to decline faster as we go forward in this year? NOGUCHI: It could. Let's say the economy adds over 200,000 jobs a month in the new year, which some economists believe is realistic. Then, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate would be steadily trending lower, some say it could be around 6 percent. And if people are optimistic about the job market getting better, then consumer confidence will improve, consumers may spend more, and you'll have this kind of virtuous cycle. But one thing that you have to remember, one caveat, is that the economy has been getting a lot of help from the Fed, extraordinary measures that make it easier to borrow, cheaper to borrow, and as things improve, the Fed is going to take some of that support away. It's promised to keep interest rates low for a long time, but we'll just have to wait and see how the economy and the job market responds to this kind of changing environment. GREENE: Yuki, we should say a lot of debate in Washington right now, in Congress, about whether or not to extend long term unemployment benefits, which is a reminder that there are still a lot of people in this country who are still out of work and have been for a while. NOGUCHI: Well, the fact that there are four million people who have been out of work for at least six months is definitely still a big problem for the labor market and for the economy overall. It remains hard to find a job, being out of work for such a long time; there are still, you know, three people for every one available job, so the market is not robust enough to absorb all the people who want work. And, of course, it's unclear that Congress is going to extend those benefits again, in part because the job market is looking up. GREENE: NPR's Yuki Noguchi talking to us about monthly jobs numbers that will be coming out later this morning. Yuki, thanks a lot. NOGUCHI: Thank you, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   Supporters of a minimum wage say it can be especially important at a time of relatively high unemployment, when workers have little bargaining power.

But one thing that you have to remember, one caveat, is that the economy has been getting a lot of help from the Fed, extraordinary measures that make it easier to borrow, cheaper to borrow, and as things improve, the Fed is going to take some of that support away. It's promised to keep interest rates low for a long time, but we'll just have to wait and see how the economy and the job market responds to this kind of changing environment. GREENE: Yuki, we should say a lot of debate in Washington right now, in Congress, about whether or not to extend long term unemployment benefits, which is a reminder that there are still a lot of people in this country who are still out of work and have been for a while. NOGUCHI: Well, the fact that there are four million people who have been out of work for at least six months is definitely still a big problem for the labor market and for the economy overall. It remains hard to find a job, being out of work for such a long time; there are still, you know, three people for every one available job, so the market is not robust enough to absorb all the people who want work. And, of course, it's unclear that Congress is going to extend those benefits again, in part because the job market is looking up. GREENE: NPR's Yuki Noguchi talking to us about monthly jobs numbers that will be coming out later this morning. Yuki, thanks a lot.

I'm Scott Simon. Yesterday's jobs report came as something of a surprise after several months of positive economic news. Employers added just 74,000 jobs. Economists had been expecting businesses to generate nearly three times that many. A few people were heartened by the fact that the unemployment rate fell to 6. 7 percent, the lowest since October of 2008. As NPR's Chris Arnold reports, the numbers reflect that many of the long-term unemployed have simply given up looking for work. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: First, we should say that this latest jobs report could be kind of a fluke. There were private-sector reports that found just the opposite - much stronger job growth. So Friday morning, analysts were flummoxed. Randall Kroszner is a University of Chicago economist and a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board. RANDALL KROSZNER: This is an odd report, and a very disappointing number for December. There's a lot of volatility in these numbers, very large revisions that occur over the next month or two. And so we really have to wait and see. ARNOLD: We reached Kroszner after his flight got delayed at the Chicago airport. That's been happening to lots of folks lately. And Kroszner says bad weather doesn't just foul up travel. It can foul up employment data, too. For example, construction workers get told to stay home because it's too cold to work with certain materials. KROSZNER: We've had unusually snowy and cold weather in December, and so that certainly contributed to some of the oddities in the numbers. ARNOLD: But this, we do know: About 4 million Americans are looking for work, and have been looking for more than six months. This situation with long-term unemployment has been getting a little better, but it's still basically the worst that it's been since the 1940s. And that means that a lot of regular Americans, often through no fault of their own, have fallen into a seemingly never-ending twilight zone where they just can't find a job. MICHAEL KOCHER: Altogether, I ended up spending, I guess, 16 or 17 months unemployed. ARNOLD: That's Michael Kocher. He's 29 years old and when he got out of the Marine Corps a year and a half ago after serving in Iraq, he didn't expect it to be this hard to find work. He first moved back to his home state of Alaska. KOCHER: I got out thinking, like, oh, I'm a veteran, you know, it's going to be easy. I'm going to find a job. ARNOLD: And Kocher has a college degree, six years' experience in the military, a job before that. But things just didn't work out so well. KOCHER: I mean, it got bad because like, my unemployment ran out. I had no money coming in, and there was a period of time where I actually was living in my - I was living in my truck, my Chevy Tahoe. ARNOLD: Actually, it was Kocher and his dog. KOCHER: And I'm a pretty big guy. You know, I'm 6-foot-8 and about 270 pounds. And it was me and my 80-pound chocolate lab, living in my Tahoe. (Laughter)ARNOLD: After a while, Kocher moved to California to look for work but no luck there, either. He had worked in radio communications in the military, so he applied to cellphone and electronics companies and anything related to that that he could think of. But with so many job seekers, employers can be choosy, and they told him that he just didn't have the right experience. So Kocher lowered his sights. KOCHER: Oh, yeah. I mean, I tried to apply to sell, like, electronics at Targe; I tried applying at both UPS and FedEx; random, you know, restaurants to do, like, pizza delivery. ARNOLD: But, Kocher says, nobody would hire him. Labor experts say ironically, it can actually get harder to find even entry-level jobs like this the longer you're not working because employers start to think, well, maybe there's something wrong with this person. In Kocher's case, though, just a few weeks ago, he finally landed a job. Working from home in San Jose, he's now doing product testing for a company that's making a privacy software. It's called Virtru. Kocher says he's doing the job well and getting money in his pocket again, and that means a brighter future for him and his long-term girlfriend. They've been living at her parents' house for a while now. KOCHER: Just now, you know, I can think positively about the future again. I can think about things like getting married and having kids again. And it's just like everything in my life is better now that I'm employed with a real job, with a company I can see going places. ARNOLD: Every month that goes by, more Americans are finding jobs. But there are still three times as many unemployed people as job openings. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

Hackers stole the credit card numbers of 40 million Target shoppers over the holiday season. And on Friday, the retailer acknowledged that the names, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of at least 70 million customers were also stolen. Neiman Marcus has also admitted it was a victim of hacking, but has not said how many customers were affected. And according to Reuters, three other well-known U. S. retailers were the recent targets of similar breaches. For more on just how this hacking works, I'm joined by Mark Rasch. He's a former Justice Department prosecutor for cybercrimes. Mark, welcome to the program. MARK RASCH: Thank you. BLOCK: And technically, help us understand how the payment card data was taken. What happens? RASCH: Well, so far, Target has not released explicit details on how it was taken. But it seems to have been taken from two different places. One is from the point-of-sale terminal. That's the place where you swipe your credit card. They were able to scrape data off of there. And the second place is from inside Target itself; where they store your name, your address and your email address. BLOCK: OK. I want to ask you about that term. You're scraping data. What does that mean? What happens there? RASCH: You have data stored on your credit card, on the magnetic stripe. And it's got to be read by a machine to get into, say, Target's computer system. So it's read into the machine at this point-of-sale terminal, when you hand your card over and it's swiped. It's stored in something called RAM, random access memory. And the computer hackers have come up with something called a RAM scraper. And what it does, it sucks up that data and sends it to the hackers. BLOCK: The data is supposed to be encrypted, though, right? RASCH: It has to be read first and then encrypted. So the key for the hackers is to get it before it gets encrypted. And that's why they're using these RAM scrapers. BLOCK: We mentioned the additional information that we now know was stolen besides the credit card numbers - all of the personal information; names, addresses, phone numbers. What would that allow hackers to do? RASCH: If you have a lot of personal information about somebody, then you can do more than just commit credit card fraud. You can actually become those people. So you can get new credit in their name. You can apply for mortgages and bank loans in their name, and that's identity theft and identity fraud. That's much more serious than simple credit card fraud. BLOCK: Help us understand how the black market in these credit card numbers works. Once the information is stolen, what happens to it? RASCH: The problem for hackers is now they have a bunch of credit card numbers, and they want to turn that into money. So what they do is, they will sell the credit card numbers on the black market through these hacker or carder websites, C-A-R-D-E-R. And people will buy them; and they'll buy them based upon whether they're a gold card or a platinum card, and what the credit limit is, and what bank issued it and whether it's a U. S. bank. And they have different values. So people will buy the cards and once they buy the cards, they'll turn them into actual, physical plastic cards all over the world - buy goods, buy services, then sell those on the black market as well. So it's a fairly sophisticated operation. BLOCK: Who's running this black market? RASCH: Well, there are lots of people. A lot of it comes out of eastern Europe. A lot of it coming out of the former Soviet republics. But even within the fencing - that is to turn the goods that you buy at a Best Buy into money - that can happen anywhere in the world; typically, Southeast Asia, Africa and South America. BLOCK: And for investigators, how do you go about trying to shut this market down? RASCH: Well, there's two ways you're going to investigate this. One is to look at the Target store - when did they get hacked, how do they get hacked, how did the data get out? And the second one is follow the money backwards. So you see where the products that were bought with the stolen cards are coming from, and work your way backwards. Hopefully, that's how you catch these guys. BLOCK: Is there much of a history of successful prosecution? I mean, if all of this is as open as you seem to say it is, with these websites where you can trade in these numbers, it would seem like people should be able to shut this down. RASCH: To a great extent, U. S. law enforcement is playing a game of whack-a-mole. We catch one, and a dozen more pop up. But there have been successful prosecutions, and there are people in jail in the United States - and around the world - for participating in these carder activities. You only catch a small percentage of them. And with tens of millions of credit card numbers floating around, they have a big incentive not to get caught and a lot of resources with which they can hide.

Today, more than 46 million Americans are still poor. The government has a complex formula for defining poverty. Financial writer Tim Harford says roughly, it means a single American making less than $30. 52 per day is considered poor. Harford has a new book out this week. It's called \"The Undercover Economist Strikes Back. \" He describes how difficult it is to define poverty. TIM HARFORD: In the United States, the definition is an idea of absolute poverty. And what that means is we're looking at how much money you need to support a particular standard of living, to buy a certain number of calories, a certain amount of vitamins, to buy a certain standard of housing. GREENE: Mm-hmm. HARFORD: And how much does that cost? And somewhat controversially, that is based on a basket of goods that was worked out by a researcher called Mollie Orshansky over 50 years ago, and while the prices have been tweaked, what's in that basket of goods hasn't been tweaked at all. GREENE: It's things like potatoes, right? I mean, how many potatoes you can afford to buy. HARFORD: Yeah, potatoes, onions. So it's actually based on food, and then there's a rule of thumb that says if this is how much the food costs then you need another allowance for accommodation and for clothes and so on. It's all about the basic standards of living, but it doesn't incorporate any changes in the economy that have happened since the early 1960s. GREENE: OK. So it's adjusted for the change in prices in objects, like potatoes. The problem is it doesn't include things like cell phones, televisions. Which leads to something that you write about in the book, and that is that poverty can really be a social condition. Explain briefly what you mean by that. HARFORD: Well, this goes back to Adam Smith writing in the late 18th century. And Smith said that a man would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt. And then he pointed out that, you know, the Greeks and the Romans - even the emperors - didn't have linen shirts. His point is that poverty is partly about not having enough money to buy what society expects you to have. And if you don't have enough money to meet those social expectations, people will think of you as poor and you will think of yourself as poor. That's not to say that poverty is totally relative, but it is saying it's subjective - it's a social condition. And he's got to be right in some fundamental way about that. You're really tapping into something fundamental about what we mean when we say that somebody is poor. GREENE: It's important though, I mean you certainly don't need a television or a cell phone to survive. But you're saying today, you know, just being able to afford potatoes might not put you in the social place you want to be. HARFORD: Yeah. Absolutely. It's about more than survival. It's also about: Can you participate in social conversations? Are you ashamed to be seen in public or not? And, of course, there's some controversy as to whether that sort of thing should count for the poverty line or not. GREENE: What role does inequality play as we're looking at things like poverty and the state of a country's economy? HARFORD: Well, poverty and inequality are connected. Income inequality is just some kind of measure of the gap between the rich and the poor. And it's very contested because there were just so many different ways to think about it. Are you comparing the very richest to the very poorest? Are you looking at the assets that people have? Or are you just looking at their income? What we can be reasonably confident of saying is that inequality has been rising. GREENE: And what is the damage - if any - that can be done to a country and its economy when there is a lot of inequality? HARFORD: Yeah. Why should we care, I guess is the question. So one reason that you might want to care is just to say well, someone who is on the bread line, they could use the dollar much more than someone who is a millionaire. GREENE: Right. HARFORD: And I think that's pretty intuitive. Whether inequality really damages a country as a whole is less clear. I think the main argument that it's a problem is that it starts to corrode your political system. As you get fewer and fewer people with more and more money who were able to have a disproportionate influence on political priorities through their campaigning, their lobbying, they're political donations. And if that happens, then you're moving further and further away from the ideals of a democracy. GREENE: One thing that you wrote about that really struck me. You said that people who are looking for a job when an economy is not doing well, there can be a lasting impact on that person for many years in their career and in their life. What do you mean by that? HARFORD: What we've discovered is that if you graduate during a recession, that could be a problem for you for five years, for 10 years, even after the economy has recovered because what's happened is you've had to make compromises, you've had to take a career that really didn't suit you, and now you're starting to build up skills and contacts that this was never what you plan to do. And that's absolutely down to bad luck, bad timing. And the second issue is that if you are unemployed for a long time, you start to be very, very difficult to employ. So, there was a fantastic study done quite recently, where a student called Rand Ghayad, mailed out resumes. And he tweaked these resumes. So some had loads of relevant experience and some didn't have relevant experience. Some had recent employment and some were long-term unemployed. And what he found was the employers cared more about whether you had recently had a job than they cared about whether you had any relevant experience or not. GREENE: Even if you didn't necessarily have skills; if you had a job recently they might hire you over someone with the right skills but who has been out of work. HARFORD: Absolutely. These are people who could work, who want to work, who have the skills to work, and yet employers don't want to give them a second glance. Big problem. GREENE: Tim Harford is the author of \"The Undercover Economist Strikes Back: How to Run or Ruin an Economy. \" DAVID GREENE, HOST:  We've marking the anniversary of the war on poverty, declared 50 years ago by President Lyndon Johnson.

It's also about: Can you participate in social conversations? Are you ashamed to be seen in public or not? And, of course, there's some controversy as to whether that sort of thing should count for the poverty line or not. GREENE: What role does inequality play as we're looking at things like poverty and the state of a country's economy? HARFORD: Well, poverty and inequality are connected. Income inequality is just some kind of measure of the gap between the rich and the poor. And it's very contested because there were just so many different ways to think about it. Are you comparing the very richest to the very poorest? Are you looking at the assets that people have? Or are you just looking at their income? What we can be reasonably confident of saying is that inequality has been rising. GREENE: And what is the damage - if any - that can be done to a country and its economy when there is a lot of inequality? HARFORD: Yeah. Why should we care, I guess is the question. So one reason that you might want to care is just to say well, someone who is on the bread line, they could use the dollar much more than someone who is a millionaire. GREENE: Right. HARFORD: And I think that's pretty intuitive. Whether inequality really damages a country as a whole is less clear. I think the main argument that it's a problem is that it starts to corrode your political system. As you get fewer and fewer people with more and more money who were able to have a disproportionate influence on political priorities through their campaigning, their lobbying, they're political donations. And if that happens, then you're moving further and further away from the ideals of a democracy. GREENE: One thing that you wrote about that really struck me. You said that people who are looking for a job when an economy is not doing well, there can be a lasting impact on that person for many years in their career and in their life. What do you mean by that? HARFORD: What we've discovered is that if you graduate during a recession, that could be a problem for you for five years, for 10 years, even after the economy has recovered because what's happened is you've had to make compromises, you've had to take a career that really didn't suit you, and now you're starting to build up skills and contacts that this was never what you plan to do. And that's absolutely down to bad luck, bad timing. And the second issue is that if you are unemployed for a long time, you start to be very, very difficult to employ. So, there was a fantastic study done quite recently, where a student called Rand Ghayad, mailed out resumes. And he tweaked these resumes. So some had loads of relevant experience and some didn't have relevant experience. Some had recent employment and some were long-term unemployed. And what he found was the employers cared more about whether you had recently had a job than they cared about whether you had any relevant experience or not. GREENE: Even if you didn't necessarily have skills; if you had a job recently they might hire you over someone with the right skills but who has been out of work. HARFORD: Absolutely. These are people who could work, who want to work, who have the skills to work, and yet employers don't want to give them a second glance. Big problem.

I'm Michel Martin. This month, we, along with many of our colleagues, have been talking a lot about poverty. That's in large part because 50 years ago this month President Lyndon Johnson declared his war on poverty - an ambitious array of programs designed to ease suffering and offer opportunity. So we've been talking about how effective or not the war on poverty actually was and what remains to be done. We're also talking about wealth in other ways. Later this hour, for example, we'll talk about new information that describes why certain groups are better positioned than others for retirement. That's our money coach. But first, we continue our conversation about why poverty persists in this wealthy nation, and what, if anything, this country should be doing now to address poverty. So we've called upon two scholars with very different perspectives about this. Stephen Pimpare is a professor of public policy at Columbia University and author of \"A People's History of Poverty. \" [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Pimpare is a professor at New York University. ] He spoke with us last week and joins us again from our studios in New York City. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again. STEPHEN PIMPARE: Thank you. Glad to be back. MARTIN: And Michael Tanner is senior fellow at the Cato Institute. He is the author of \"The Poverty of Welfare: Helping Others in Civil Society. \" He's also spoken with us before. And we welcome you back as well to our studios in Washington, D. C. MICHAEL TANNER: It's always a pleasure to be with you. MARTIN: So, Professor Pimpare, let me start with you because you joined us last week when we talked about poverty. We talked a little bit about the history of these kinds of programs. And I want to jump in to a point that you made right at the end of our conversation. You said, in some ways, if you want to make people less poor, give them money. So let me start there. Why don't we just alleviate poverty by making people less poor? Transfer enough income or wealth to them, or whatever you want to call it, so that people aren't poor. PIMPARE: Well, you know, to some extent I think that we actually do do that and do a fair bit of that. In some ways, it might be helpful to step back just a little bit from talking about the war on poverty to go back earlier because in some ways the question that I think Michael and I and others have been discussing over the past week is can federal government efforts to reduce poverty actually reduce poverty? And if we look back at the very worst of the Great Depression in the early 1930s, we had a poverty rate that was probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 75 percent, give or take. And that's part of what spurred the creation of Social Security, of unemployment insurance, of ADC, which would become the welfare program, of the right to unionize, importantly. Once we get to the 1950s, we, in fact, start to see poverty declining and declining fairly steadily right through to the 1960s and the war on poverty and great society programs. MARTIN: So why is anybody still poor in this country? PIMPARE: Well, because we do a fair bit to reduce poverty, but we don't do enough. We cut poverty about in half from where it otherwise would be if we don't count the effects of those federal programs. It still leaves us with a 16 percent poverty rate - at a much higher poverty rate than in other countries that do more. MARTIN: OK, so, Michael Tanner, what about that? I mean, you heard Professor Pimpare's point. His point is that we actually do give people money to be less poor, but there's a certain level of poverty that we - at which we just stop. TANNER: Well, I certainly think there's something to that. We give a great deal of money to the poor. Last year we spent, at the federal and state level, nearly $1 trillion on 126 separate federal anti-poverty programs without making a significant real dent in poverty. Most of the poverty reduction that we've seen since the war on poverty began is actually a result of the earned income tax credit and the reduction in the lowest tax rate - the 15 percent tax rate down to 10 percent that took place more recently. It is not largely a result of the transfer programs, many of which have very little impact at all. MARTIN: Why isn't the earned income tax credit a transfer program by another name? TANNER: It is. It's a wage supplement program, if you will. And it has a lot of success. But that's really a Reagan-era program. It's not part of the great - the war on the great society or the great society program. MARTIN: OK, but - so what about the basic question? Why is anybody still poor in this country? TANNER: Well, a lot of behavioral issues affect poverty. The fact is we have a pretty good idea of how to get out of poverty and how to stay out of poverty. Number one is, finish school. If you drop out of school, you're likely to be poor. If you graduate college, you're not. Number two is, if you're a woman and you're not married, don't have a baby. You're about five times more likely to be in poverty if you give birth out of wedlock than if you wait 'til you've married. That's not a moral judgment, simply an economic one. And number three is jobs. If you - only about 3 percent of full-time workers are living below the poverty level in this country. So what we really need to do is focus on those things and not simply on giving people enough money to make their poverty more comfortable. MARTIN: In fact, you write a lot about that. And I presume you mean by that that it gives people incentives to stay poor. Is that a fair way to characterize your views? TANNER: Well, that's part of it, but it's also not enough work on getting people out of poverty in the long run. We tend to measure by inputs or by the fact that we've done away with, say, malnutrition in this country to a large extent. But what we're not doing is allowing people to be fully actualized human beings. To do that means more than simply surviving on a government check. It means having a job and supporting your family and rising in society, which is what we don't allow people to do today. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about solutions to poverty with two scholars with very different perspectives. We're speaking with Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute - that's who was speaking just now - and also Professor Stephen Pimpare of Columbia University. Well, so, Professor Pimpare, what about that? I mean, you heard Mr. Tanner's argument, which is an argument that you hear a lot of conservatives make, that really it's the behavioral issues at this point that are the main driver of the consistency of poverty. Your thoughts? PIMPARE: Sure. It's an argument we've been hearing since the Middle Ages. It's an argument that was predominant in the United States in the first Gilded Age in the late-19th century. The problem with it is that it portrays a failure to understand the actual constraints of low-income individuals, low-income families and low-income communities. I mean, to point to the fact that people with college degrees have lower poverty rates than others - that's absolutely true. But then you need to take a look at what are the obstacles to greater numbers of people moving into college. And if you look at a kid born in the south Bronx in one of the poorest districts and look at the quality of the public schools, already that child has a much harder hill to climb in order to be competitive. There are real life barriers to that sort of simplistic, get an education, get married, don't have children and get a job sort of equation. MARTIN: Can I ask a question about that, Michael Tanner? Which is that the federal minimum wage, which is something being discussed very actively at the moment as kind of a policy question, is $7. 25 an hour. If you work full-time at that wage, it is really not enough, particularly to support a family. So if some people argue, you know, what message does it send to have so many people working and still be unable to support themselves? Or support themselves well, particularly in neighborhoods where legal jobs are scarce, but illegal drugs, the black market, sort of, in general, offer what seems to be a more attractive lifestyle? TANNER: Well, I think you raise a very good point there. But only about 5 percent of minimum-wage earners are adults with children as the sole breadwinner in their family. In fact, studies have shown that if you raise the minimum wage to, let's say, $9. 50 an hour, you'd only reduce the poverty rate by about 10 percent. So what you've really got to do is try and find how you can create more prosperity within a community, how you can create more good jobs within a community because you also have to deal with the fact that raising the minimum wage is, of course, going to eliminate some of those jobs at the bottom rung of the scale altogether. MARTIN: Stephen Pimpare, what about you? I mean, what about his argument about the moral hazard? You know, what message it sends to people if you can live without or at least survive. . . PIMPARE: Well, the implication - yeah. MARTIN: . . . Without really making an effort, without working and without sort of meeting some of these other behavioral standards? PIMPARE: Right. MARTIN: What message does that send? PIMPARE: I mean, the implication is that there are - through the things that government does - there are means by which large numbers of people can live and live well without having to work. And that's simply not supported by either the scholarly research or, again, by actual encounters with poor people and with poor communities. One of the things that strikes me about what Michael just said is he sort of - I mean, I would disagree with his interpretation - but he sort of pooh-poohs the notion that a raise in the minimum wage would decrease poverty by 10 percent. Well, 10 percent is not nothing. And, you know, 10 percent here, 10 percent there and suddenly you're looking at large-scale effects on reducing poverty and increasing the well-being of people. So it's - I mean, I'm having a hard time sort of seeing where sort of the coherent claim lines up in those sorts of. . . TANNER: Well, the coherence. . . PIMPARE: . . . Critiques of intervention. MARTIN: Go-ahead, Michael Tanner. TANNER: The coherence is that it's an inefficient way of trying dealing with poverty. A wage supplement, like the earned income tax credit, does a much better job and is much more efficient. What you're actually doing by raising the minimum wage is raising wages for a lot of people who aren't in poverty. About 43 percent of the people who would benefit from. . . PIMPARE: And that would be a bad thing? TANNER: . . . Minimum wage have three times - well, if you're raising the wages primarily of people who are second and third earners, of teenagers getting their first job, things like that. And at the same time, you're doing away with a lot of those jobs that the first rung on the ladder out of poverty. You're helping the wrong group of people. MARTIN: Can I ask you, Michael Tanner, about Stephen Pimpare's kind of first argument, which is that we are - we in this country have simply become comfortable with accepting a level of poverty that other countries do not. Do you think that that's true? TANNER: Yeah, I think that's true. I think that we - we think - on the right, I think they don't care, you know, much about the poor. They don't think much about the poor. And on the left, I think they're content if they give enough money to the poor to solve their conscience. The real goal should be how many people don't need help in our society, how many people we lift out of poverty. MARTIN: Stephen Pimpare, what about - Michael Tanner's argument is that he agrees with you that, yes, we have come to accept a level of poverty in this country that other nations, wealthy nations, do not. But he says it's a pox on both our houses, on both philosophical houses. Do you think that that's true? PIMPARE: I mean, I'm certainly happy to launch complaints against Democrats and Republicans in not quite equal measure. But I think there's been a really sort of profound failure. Fine, if we want to recognize that the first option is employment, then we need to recognize a reality the moment that we inhabit. We have record-high employment rates. We've got somewhere in the neighborhood of three people looking for a job for every job that is available. What then do we do about that? If the answer is, don't offer people cash assistance programs but require work, then it would seem to me that the moral obligation is to then guarantee that job at a decent wage as a right of citizenship. MARTIN: That leads me to where I wanted to go next to conclude this conversation. I mean, you both alluded to the fact that some of the conversations we're having about poverty, we've been having for very a long time. So where would you like the conversation to go next? And so since you started us off, Professor Pimpare, I'm going to ask you that. Where would you wish this conversation would go next? PIMPARE: You know, I wonder if it wouldn't be productive for us to think instead of poverty, per se, but to talk about well-being, to talk about what would it mean to create a society in which Americans have the ability to live the kinds of lives they value. And what can we do collectively through our elected representatives in the institutions that we have built to ensure that? And one of the lessons that other countries tell us is that there does not need to be a trade-off in improving well-being and economic growth at large. MARTIN: Michael Tanner, final thought from you. TANNER: Well, I'd agree with the first part of that. I think we should be having a conversation about well-being and prosperity and how to create a society in which everybody can achieve their goals. I think the problem is that government really can't do that. I think that there's very little evidence to suggest that government is good at creating prosperity. I think there's a lot of evidence to suggest that government is a great barrier to prosperity. And I think - so what we really need to be thinking in terms of is not poverty, which is sort of the natural state of man, but how do we create prosperity.

Union membership is at its lowest point in decades. Recently, Washington state managed to keep a big contract with Boeing and the jobs that come with it only after union members agreed to wage and benefits concessions. And from KPLU in Seattle, Ashley Gross reports that what happened there says a lot about the state of organized labor across the country. ASHLEY GROSS, BYLINE: The night Boeing workers narrowly passed the offer, the mood at the union hall of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers was quiet, almost funereal. The machinists who had gathered there were the ones who wanted to reject the offer. Wilson Ferguson mourns the pension his union fought so long to get and then keep. WILSON FERGUSON: We didn't get that pension when we formed a union 78 years ago. We didn't get that pension till 1959. And now it's gone and it will never be back. GROSS: The Boeing contract phases out the pension over time, replacing it with a 401(k) and it hikes health costs at a time when the company's profits and stock are soaring. Ferguson says the workers felt backed into a corner. Boeing threatened to move the jobs away; local politicians, and even their own national union leaders, pushed the machinists to accept. FERGUSON: Everybody was fighting against us and we lost by one percentage point. So we put up a hell of a fight. But we lost. GROSS: This push to wring concessions from Boeing's unionized workers echoes what's happened at other big manufacturers. Two thousand miles away in Joliet, Ill. , machinists at Caterpillar went on strike in 2012 during a contract dispute. (SOUNDBITE OF STRIKE)GROSS: The workers shouted the word scab at anyone driving into the plant. They rejected cuts to the pension when Caterpillar, just like Boeing, was making big profits. Almost four months later, they wound up accepting an only slightly improved contract. Unions have noticed, says Andy Stern, former president of the Service Employees International Union. ANDY STERN: Boeing not only used the Caterpillar model, where it's extracted enormous concessions from its workers, which they didn't need in order to prosper, but then they went and took it a step further and hijacked and blackmailed the government. GROSS: Those are strong words. Still, Boeing got almost $9 billion in tax incentives. The company declined to comment, but University of Portland finance professor Richard Gritta says the aircraft industry is cutthroat and volatile and Boeing does have to worry about labor costs ballooning over time. RICHARD GRITTA: You try to keep all your costs to a minimum because you know this industry is highly cyclical. God knows what will happen to the airline business in the next four or five years. JAKE ROSENFELD: This here captures the real story of the plight of private sector middle class workers over the last 40 years. GROSS: Jake Rosenfeld at the University of Washington researches unions. He says pushing for workers to make sacrifices at a time of profits is new. ROSENFELD: For a period there, surrounding the decades around World War II, many major highly profitable and highly protected manufacturing firms, firms like Boeing today, just didn't take this type of step. GROSS: They didn't have to. There wasn't as much global competition, but that has changed. Union membership has dropped and the political winds have shifted. Organized labor has few allies in the GOP and has even lost support among some Democrats. But there is a bright spot. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)GROSS: Low-wage workers have struck a chord in the small town of SeaTac, Washington, near the airport. Voters there raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour for airport and hospitality workers. That's been partly reversed in court, but now unions and activists want Seattle to do the same thing. Stern, formerly with the SEIU, says sentiment is changing. STERN: People are starting to say, you know, I may not like unions and I may not like government and I may not like Democrats, but I really don't like the fact that my kids and my grandkids can't get ahead anymore, and something has to change. GROSS: Even some Boeing workers are living up to their nickname The Fighting Machinists. They've filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board and are pushing for a re-vote.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, BYLINE: And I'm Melissa Block. President Obama today tapped a California businesswoman to lead the Small Business Administration. He said Maria Contreras-Sweet has experience financing small businesses; first through a private equity firm, and later as a founder of ProAmerica Bank. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)BARACK OBAMA, HOST:  She understands the needs of small-business owners like herself. She knows how they can lift entire communities and ultimately, how they lift our country. So as we work to keep our economy growing, Maria will be charged with looking for more ways to support small businesses. BLOCK: Contreras-Sweet is a native of Guadalajara, Mexico. If confirmed by the Senate, she would fill the last vacancy in the president's second-term Cabinet. CORNISH: In other personnel news, the president has nominated Stanley Fischer to serve as the next vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He would replace Janet Yellen, who's been promoted to chairman of the central bank. Yellen reportedly recruited Fischer personally, to serve as her deputy. He spent much of the last decade running Israel's central bank. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, Stanley Fischer is credited with helping that country weather the financial crisis better than most, and with training many of the world's top economists. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Stanley Fischer is an economic oak tree whose acorns have taken root in financial capitals around the world. Outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was a student of Fischer's at MIT. So was Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, and former U. S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Another former student, Ken Rogoff - now an economics professor at Harvard - recalls Fischer as an inspirational teacher. KEN ROGOFF: A lot of people went to MIT economics not thinking about doing macroeconomics. And then they had Stan Fischer as their professor and suddenly, it's all they wanted to do. HORSLEY: At the time, academic economists were often divided into warring camps: the so-called Saltwater economists, from coastal universities, who tended to concentrate on market breakdowns; and Freshwater economists, centered around the University of Chicago. They prefer to build models in which markets function perfectly. Rogoff says Fischer managed to swim in both schools and still keep his head above water. ROGOFF: Fischer was one of the few people that both camps just totally respected - which took a lot of economic understanding but probably quite a bit of political acumen as well. HORSLEY: That political skill proved handy once Fischer came to Washington, first as chief economist for the World Bank and later as the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund. Mohamed El-Erian, who runs the giant PIMCO bond fund, worked under Fischer at the IMF. He describes his former boss as the rare person who's brilliant but also eager to learn from others. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: He's not only a very effective policymaker, but he's also a very popular policymaker. And these two don't go together very often. HORSLEY: During his tenure at the IMF, Fischer was confronted with a number of regional financial meltdowns, including Mexico's peso devaluation in 1994, and the Asian financial crisis three years later. EL-ERIAN: He was always as cool as can be. He was very analytical. He always was the adult in the room. He's never let stress get to him. HORSLEY: Born and raised in Africa, in what's now Zambia and Zimbabwe, Fischer has frequently counseled leaders from the developing world. El-Erian says he often stressed how even small improvements in economic growth could pay big dividends over time. EL-ERIAN: Let me tell you how many people you can bring out of poverty. Let me tell you about how you can reduce unemployment. For him, it was about making sure that growth is inclusive, that it creates sustainable jobs; and to make sure that you don't end up with a society that is excessively unequal, in terms of income and wealth. HORSLEY: Those concerns are not limited to developing countries. Slow growth and income inequality are now front and center here in the United States. While the Federal Reserve's main missions are promoting job growth and keeping a lid on inflation, it's also supposed to act as a banking watchdog, preventing the kinds of risky behavior that contributed to do the recent financial crisis. MIT economist Simon Johnson worries Fischer may not be tough enough on the nation's biggest banks, since he spent three years as vice chairman at Citigroup. SIMON JOHNSON: Does he believe that some of our largest financial institutions still are too big to fail? If they are too big to fail, how should we deal with them? Should they be forced to shrink? There's a long list of questions, but they all come back to attitude towards the big banks and how they run themselves. HORSLEY: That's just one of the hot-button topics Fischer is likely to be quizzed about during his Senate confirmation hearing. Harvard's Rogoff says after a long career making friends in financial foxholes, Fischer should be able to withstand any political flak. ROGOFF: We live in a world where it's not easy to be a centrist or a moderate, getting attacked from both sides. And that something Stan Fischer has somehow managed to do as an academic, at the IMF and later, as governor at the Bank of Israel - a very fractious society. He's managed to be respected by all sides, to maintain his ground in the middle. HORSLEY: And Rogoff says Fischer will find that a valuable skill at the Federal Reserve.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  And I'm Melissa Block. President Obama has been talking a lot lately about income inequality. Today, he visited a factory in North Carolina and announced new steps that he said would create more good-paying, middle class jobs. He plans to do that by boosting American manufacturing and at the center of that plan is a big idea: a new, federally-funded innovation institute. Here's NPR's Chris Arnold to explain how it would work and why some economists have doubts. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: In his last State of the Union address, the president said he wanted to create these new manufacturing institutes across the country. The goal is to bring together industry, universities and government to spur innovation and to help private companies come up with new products and to hire more workers. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We want to do that here in North Carolina and we want to do this all across America. ARNOLD: The president spoke at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He's been asking Congress to create dozens more of these innovations hubs. Congress hasn't passed any of that legislation yet, but the president says he can start the first few of these himself. OBAMA: And today, I'm here to act, to help make Raleigh Durham and America a magnet for the good high tech manufacturing jobs that a growing middle class requires and there is going to continue to keep this country on the cutting edge. So. . . ARNOLD: This particular institute will seek to develop a new generation of computer chips and electronics. The White House has committed $200 million so far to these institutes across five federal agencies. The president said Germany has more than 60 of these types of innovation institutes helping its manufacturing industry and the U. S. should do something similar. Still, some economists are less than enthusiastic. ENRICO MARETTI: Manufacturing employment has been declining for four decades now and it's one of the industries that has performed the worst over the long run. ARNOLD: Enrico Maretti is a labor economist at UC, Berkeley. He says that manufacturing has lost about 7 million jobs in the past 35-odd years and it's gained about half a million of those back during the recovery more recently. But still, he says, the long run trend is down. He'd rather see resources spent to support more promising industries in terms of job growth. MARETTI: If you look at jobs in life science, they've been growing at a rate that is 12 times faster than the rest of the labor market. ARNOLD: Maretti says it might sound good to say you want to help the middle class with manufacturing jobs, but he's not optimistic that that will do much to help, mainly because he thinks that those jobs will continue to get replaced by computers and machines. But other economists say that they like what the president's doing here. Peter Cappelli is a labor economist with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. PETER CAPPELLI: It's a good idea, you know. U. S. has the capability to do much better in manufacturing than we've been doing. ARNOLD: David Autor is also a labor economist. He's at MIT and he studies the impact of technology and globalization. What he likes about these government-backed innovation hubs is that they're not picking this technology or industry over that one, pushing a particular company, say, that makes solar panels or something. DAVID AUTOR: So I think they're aiming at the right target here. Whether it will all work, I doubt it, but some of it will work and some of it works really well, even if most of it doesn't it will still have been a good investment. ARNOLD: The White House says it will announce the creation of two more manufacturing innovation institutes in coming weeks. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

We, like a lot of other people in the news business, have been talking about poverty a lot this week and last. We're doing this because we have something called a news peg, which is a fancy word for a reason to talk about something we want to talk about anyway. That news peg is the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's first State of the Union address when he said this. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON: This administration, today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. MARTIN: What followed was a major package of social programs, what a writer for the Pew Research Center called the most ambitious domestic policy initiative since the Great Depression. And the great argument this week has been about whether it brought the poverty rate down, and if so, did it bring it down enough? Did it save poor people, or did it just trap them? And was there ever really a war? Or was it just a skirmish, a halfhearted attempt that got lost in a swirl of other priorities, including war fought with bullets and bombs? Can I just tell you I think we should talk about poverty? And, yes, I am biased because - hello - talk show host here. As a general rule, I think we should talk about all things that matter. As a crusty old police sergeant once told a subordinate who wanted to withhold information from a reporter, give the kid what he wants. Not talking about it doesn't make it  unhappen. I think we should talk about poverty because poverty is still with us. So I think we should talk about it until it isn't. But I also think what we suffer from is a poverty of words, of ideas and of imagination. The circumstances of poverty have changed in this country in a way that most of us, if we look, can see for ourselves. But the way we talk about it has not. It seems that we're stuck in tropes from back in the day --the drug-dealing layabout bum who just wants to make babies but doesn't want to work, the welfare queen, the noble striver who can't get a break. Those might be partially true or half true or never true. But in any case, the world has changed. What I noticed is that the labels we so often use don't match what we see right in front of our faces. Today, far fewer elderly people are poor, but many more people of working age are. Far fewer black people are poor, but many more Latinos are. Far fewer married couples with children are poor, but many more poor families are headed by single mothers. We live in an age when poor people can have a computer, a refrigerator and air conditioning, but still have no hope. We're in a world where you can deliver a paycheck across the world with the push of a button, where people cross centuries in the span of a plane ride, where a girl in a poor African village powered by generators can be a world-class chess champion. But a boy living in a high rise in the heart of a rich American city can feel he has no place to go. We need to catch up. We need to talk about poverty. But we need to talk about it as it is, not as it was because poverty is still with us, and it's not going away unless we talk about it. And that's our program for today. I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Let's talk more tomorrow. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Finally today, I'd like to end the program where we started, talking about poverty. We, like a lot of other people in the news business, have been talking about poverty a lot this week and last. We're doing this because we have something called a news peg, which is a fancy word for a reason to talk about something we want to talk about anyway. That news peg is the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's first State of the Union address when he said this. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON: This administration, today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. MARTIN: What followed was a major package of social programs, what a writer for the Pew Research Center called the most ambitious domestic policy initiative since the Great Depression. And the great argument this week has been about whether it brought the poverty rate down, and if so, did it bring it down enough? Did it save poor people, or did it just trap them? And was there ever really a war? Or was it just a skirmish, a halfhearted attempt that got lost in a swirl of other priorities, including war fought with bullets and bombs? Can I just tell you I think we should talk about poverty? And, yes, I am biased because - hello - talk show host here. As a general rule, I think we should talk about all things that matter. As a crusty old police sergeant once told a subordinate who wanted to withhold information from a reporter, give the kid what he wants. Not talking about it doesn't make it  unhappen. I think we should talk about poverty because poverty is still with us. So I think we should talk about it until it isn't. But I also think what we suffer from is a poverty of words, of ideas and of imagination. The circumstances of poverty have changed in this country in a way that most of us, if we look, can see for ourselves. But the way we talk about it has not. It seems that we're stuck in tropes from back in the day --the drug-dealing layabout bum who just wants to make babies but doesn't want to work, the welfare queen, the noble striver who can't get a break. Those might be partially true or half true or never true. But in any case, the world has changed. What I noticed is that the labels we so often use don't match what we see right in front of our faces. Today, far fewer elderly people are poor, but many more people of working age are. Far fewer black people are poor, but many more Latinos are. Far fewer married couples with children are poor, but many more poor families are headed by single mothers. We live in an age when poor people can have a computer, a refrigerator and air conditioning, but still have no hope. We're in a world where you can deliver a paycheck across the world with the push of a button, where people cross centuries in the span of a plane ride, where a girl in a poor African village powered by generators can be a world-class chess champion. But a boy living in a high rise in the heart of a rich American city can feel he has no place to go. We need to catch up. We need to talk about poverty. But we need to talk about it as it is, not as it was because poverty is still with us, and it's not going away unless we talk about it. And that's our program for today.

All this month, we and many of our colleagues have been talking about poverty and whether different strategies to help the poor are the right ones. Part of the equation is access to resources like the Internet. And in a few minutes, we'll look at how African-Americans and Latinos are faring when it comes to web access and new innovations in tech. We're going to do that by checking in with contributors from our #BlacksinTech series and #NPRLatism series. But first, we want to take a look at a new Obama administration initiative to tackle poverty that the administration is calling promise zones. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: They're neighborhoods where we will help local efforts to meet one national goal - that a child's course in life should be determined not by the ZIP Code she's born in, but by the strength of her work ethic and the scope of her dreams. MARTIN: The initiative is supposed to bring together federal agencies and local leaders to improve access to quality schools and affordable housing, improve public safety and create jobs. The administration says the zones will get a competitive edge when applying for federal grants. And the president has called on Congress to give tax incentives to businesses that invest in their communities. The president recently announced the first five promise zones, and there will be 15 more to come. We wanted to know more about this, so we've called upon the secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack. He's speaking from his office at the USDA in Washington, D. C. Welcome, Mr. Secretary. Thank you for speaking with us. TOM VILSACK: Well, it's nice to be with you. MARTIN: I want to mention that the first five promise zones include parts of Los Angeles, San Antonio, Philadelphia, southeastern Kentucky and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. And I know that you're particularly excited that a couple of these zones were in rural areas. So wanted to ask if you could just tell us how the idea came about, if you remember? VILSACK: Well, we had a conversation at the White House - when I say we, a number of Cabinet members - Kathleen Sebelius, Arne Duncan, Shaun Donovan from HUD, Education, HHS and myself and Tom Perez from Labor - had a conversation about the need for us to sort of layer our resources and to essentially leverage our resources. The thought was that if we all work together in a coordinated fashion, we would get actually more out of our investments. This effort was patterned after something that Shaun Donovan and others started with strong cities and what we were doing in rural areas with a thing called StrikeForce, really focusing our resources at USDA on trying to help people get into that middle class, deal with persistent poverty, which is prevalent in many, many rural areas. A lot of folks don't realize how much real poverty there is, which is why I was pleased that the president announced the islands in southeast Kentucky and the Choctaw Nation and tribe in Oklahoma. MARTIN: We are going to speak with the head of the group from Kentucky, and we'll be speaking with him for tomorrow's program. Can I just ask you to amplify that a little bit more? There's been a lot of talk this week, and as we have been focusing on poverty, in part because of - this is the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's announcement of his war on poverty and a lot of talk about what strategies have worked and not worked and what we do know and what we don't know. A lot of people say we don't talk enough about poverty. But I wanted to ask you specifically about rural poverty. Is there a picture that people just aren't getting who are not connected to these communities anymore? VILSACK: Well, I think so because if you take a look at the persistently poor counties in the United States, there's 703 of them. And of the 703, 571 persistently poor counties are rural in nature. So it is very much a rural issue, and one of the reasons is because the wage levels and income levels of folks who live, work and raise their families in rural communities are significantly below what you would see in urban-suburban areas. In fact, the median earnings for a wage-earner or salary-worker in a rural area is about $6,500 a year less than it is an urban or suburban areas. So that's why we are focused not just on one area of the country, but in all areas, trying to deal with this holistically. MARTIN: But what can you do with these promise zones that you can't do now? I mean, that, I think, would be the kind of question is, where is the added value here? VILSACK: Well, I think there are a couple of things. First of all, these promise zone areas do and will receive priority points in terms of competitive grants. And oftentimes, the difference between a winning competitive grant for a program may be a point or two. So if you get extra points because you're in a promise zone, you are going to be more competitive in terms of getting education resources or USDA, ag resources, rural development resources. Secondly, it provides additional staff. Each promise zone area is going to receive the benefit of five AmeriCorps volunteers. So they're going to help consolidate, coordinate, learn more about the needs of a particular promise zone area and be able to communicate those effectively to the various departments. And third, I think what's really important is that we will be working collaboratively. When I say we - various departments of government. Instead of USDA doing its own thing, separate and apart from what transportation is doing or what human service is doing or what education is doing, we're all going to know what each other is doing and we're going to look for ways in which we can leverage our resources and combine our resources for more effective use of those resources. We've seen a sort of a pilot of this within USDA, where we've broken down the silos within my department, in the StrikeForce states. And we've seen increased investment and increased activity in those impoverished areas. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're speaking with the secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack. We're talking about the Obama administration's new promise zone program. He's talking about how he hopes this will work in the more rural parts of the country. Two of the five newly announced promise zones are in rural areas. You know, we recently had a conversation with the author of a book called \"A People's History of Poverty in America\" - Stephen Pimpare, he's a professor at Columbia University. And asked him about this concept and he said, look, this has been tried before - the so-called enterprise zones in the '80s and the '90s. He said that these kinds of programs because they're not - they operate on the margins, essentially, and while margins are important, that they tend not to have a lasting impact. It just isn't big enough. And I'd like to ask you if you can address that. VILSACK: With all due respect, I just don't think that this is the same as what has been tried in the past. Enterprise zones have been primarily focused on tax policy. It has not been a situation where education was investing money, where transportation was investing money, where the United States Department of Agriculture and Rural Development folks were investing money. I think this understands that at the end of the day it really has to be driven locally. That's why we'll be working with a number of economic development groups in Kentucky. We'll be working, obviously, with the tribe to have them identify where their needs are, where their strategic opportunity are. If Congress is willing to do tax credits - all the better. But even if they don't do the tax credits, this is still going to - I think is going to make a difference. And I know it's going to make a difference because we've seen increased investment in housing, in conservation and in business development within USDA's programs because we have coordinated various mission areas in specific geographic areas. And we've seen nearly $10 billion invested in those areas, and over 80,000 different activities USDA sponsored in StrikeForce areas. So we know it worksMARTIN: To that end, could you give me - can you kind of help me see it a little bit better. Can you give me a picture of how you think this makes things better for people trying to bring the resources that do exist to bear on the problems that are there? VILSACK: Let me give you an example. So the Highlands in southeast Kentucky has a revolving loan fund, which is designed to help small business start. USDA could come in with additional resources to increase that loan fund or can come in with a loan guarantee that can supplement that loan fund or make it easier for that company to get credit. Now the company gets credit, but they can't find skilled workers. We contact the Department of Labor and say, look, are there apprenticeship programs, are there worker training programs that would help returning veterans in this area, for example, be able to be employed by this small business to get this business up and going. It's a coordinated effort to try to address the needs of businesses, the needs of communities in a much more comprehensive way than just simply USDA taking a grant in one community and the Department of Transportation having a grant in some completely different community where they don't leverage each other, and they don't, basically, amplify each other. MARTIN: Why don't the programs work this way now anyway? VILSACK: I can't speak to previous administrations as to why it didn't work or hadn't been tried. But what I can say is the president and the vice president are very clear about the need for us in these constrained resource environment to work collaboratively and work together. And in the past, I think, perhaps, it was more difficult for Cabinet members to get along, to work with each other, to work through the bureaucracy. But the great thing about promise zones, the great thing about StrikeForce, it is all about breaking barriers down. It's about educating people how the system works and making sure that they're successful within the system. This is a different approach. I am just convinced it will work. MARTIN: So you're one of the second termers. VILSACK: Yes. MARTIN: What made you decide to stay? VILSACK: I've got the greatest job in America. An opportunity to help the 15 percent of America that lives in rural communities that provides most of the food that we consume, a good deal of the water that we rely on, most of the energy. Military families disproportionately come from rural areas and so the ability to try to respond to the persistently poor areas in rural America, the ability to work with farmers who provide us so much freedom, the ability to work with people that really cared deeply about their community and their families and their country, it's just a great job. And we have so many opportunities within USDA to make a difference because of the broad portfolio. It's not just about farmers. It's about rural development, it's about land-grant universities, it's about food safety, it's about the forests. It's a wonderful, tremendous department and we've done amazing work in the last four years. And I just want to make sure that the work that we do gets institutionalized and cemented as we culturally transform this agency into a 21st century government agency. MARTIN: I'm just wondering how cemented as a metaphor kind of works with the agriculture department, but that's OK. We can go at that. I was hoping for more of a rural metaphor. Anyway, final. . . VILSACK: Well, let me put it this way - we'd like to see this programs rooted. MARTIN: Rooted. There you go. Thank you. I thought that made more sense. Sorry. Not to edit you. Before we let you go, what did you learn in the first term that you're going to bring to bear in the second? VILSACK: The need to do a better job of educating people about precisely what have done and what we are doing. So for example, it may surprise people that the Department of Agriculture has been involved in over 3,800 water projects that's provided better and cleaner water for millions of America's who live in rural committees. It may surprise folks to hear that our ag exports have increased to record levels in the last 4 or 5 years. The ability to communicate the results as well as the programs so that people understand that these programs are out there, that they're working, that they're making a difference in people's lives and they're helping to improve the situation in rural America. MARTIN: Tom Vilsack is the secretary of agriculture for the United States. He joined us from his office in Washington, D. C. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for speaking with us. I hope we'll speak again. VILSACK: All right, thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

He is expected to call upon Congress to try again to extend federal unemployment benefits. In Washington yesterday, Republicans in the Senate blocked a bill that would have restored the benefits that ended last month for 1. 3 million Americans. But in North Carolina, a state law has prevented people there from getting the benefits since last July. North Carolina Public Radio's Leoneda Inge examines the impact of shortened help. LEONEDA INGE, BYLINE: When Tammie Morris lost her job more than a year ago at a Chick-Fil-A in Durham, she and her husband Ortez Morris hit hard times. But at least they had Tammie's unemployment check to help them get by. Then last July 1, a new North Carolina law cut the maximum state unemployment benefits by roughly a third. As a result, the state no longer met the minimum federal standards for unemployment insurance. That meant North Carolina residents could not get the extended federal benefits available in every other state. It was a body blow for many jobless people. ORTEZ MORRIS: Very traumatic. INGE: That's how Ortez Morris described the abrupt cut off. The 2013 law slashed state jobless benefits from 26 weeks to just 20 weeks - the shortest length of help in the nation. And the Morris's got none of the federal benefits that might have added months more of coverage. During the worst of the recession, some Americans were getting as much as 99 weeks of help from their combined state and federal benefits. MORRIS: As soon as we needed unemployment, it got cut off. So that didn't feel proper, fair. INGE: That made life a lot tougher for the Morris's. By August, they were staying with an aunt. Before long, the aunt wanted them to move along. TAMMIE MORRIS: She left a note on the bed and told us we needed to find a place. INGE: Now the couple lives at a homeless shelter where dinnertime allows them to join a line for beef or vegetarian casserole, salad, fruit and carrot cake for desert. They are grateful for the charity, but wish the state legislature would undo the new law. Governor Pat McCrory says that won't happen. GOVERNOR PAT MCCRORY: We had to take some - make some very, very difficult decisions. INGE: He says the state's economic future is brighter now because the legislature has reduced its spending. And it's speeding up repayment of the $2. 8 billion it owes the federal government, for borrowing unemployment dollars for laid off workers, during the worst of the recession. Governor McCrory explained his position recently to business leaders at an economic forum in Durham. MCCRORY: We felt like our unemployment benefits were putting North Carolina in continued debt. And we needed to tear up the credit card and pay off that debt as quick as possible, so you in business could free up money and start hiring people again. INGE: He can point to progress, at least in terms of the unemployment rate. In the past year, it has dropped from 9. 4 percent to 7. 4 percent. But critics are not impressed. They say when 70,000 people abruptly lost jobless benefits many simply fell out of the workforce. JOHN QUINTERNO: Which means that our unemployment rate has come down sharply, but not necessarily for the right reason. INGE: That's John Quinterno, an economic analyst in Chapel Hill. He says the state is worse off now because its labor force is shrinking. QUINTERNO: And that's very - to me, very alarming. INGE: Back in Washington, Democrats want to restore extended benefits and include a special provision that could allow North Carolina to start getting federal money again. But many Republicans oppose new spending without off-setting budget cuts. Meanwhile, Ortez Morris is in a city-run worker training program. Tammie is looking for work. They both hope they won't be calling the shelter home come spring. For NPR News, I'm Leoneda Inge in Durham, North Carolina.

In Washington yesterday, Republicans in the Senate blocked a bill that would have restored the benefits that ended last month for 1. 3 million Americans. But in North Carolina, a state law has prevented people there from getting the benefits since last July. North Carolina Public Radio's Leoneda Inge examines the impact of shortened help. LEONEDA INGE, BYLINE: When Tammie Morris lost her job more than a year ago at a Chick-Fil-A in Durham, she and her husband Ortez Morris hit hard times. But at least they had Tammie's unemployment check to help them get by. Then last July 1, a new North Carolina law cut the maximum state unemployment benefits by roughly a third. As a result, the state no longer met the minimum federal standards for unemployment insurance. That meant North Carolina residents could not get the extended federal benefits available in every other state. It was a body blow for many jobless people. ORTEZ MORRIS: Very traumatic. INGE: That's how Ortez Morris described the abrupt cut off. The 2013 law slashed state jobless benefits from 26 weeks to just 20 weeks - the shortest length of help in the nation. And the Morris's got none of the federal benefits that might have added months more of coverage. During the worst of the recession, some Americans were getting as much as 99 weeks of help from their combined state and federal benefits. MORRIS: As soon as we needed unemployment, it got cut off. So that didn't feel proper, fair. INGE: That made life a lot tougher for the Morris's. By August, they were staying with an aunt. Before long, the aunt wanted them to move along. TAMMIE MORRIS: She left a note on the bed and told us we needed to find a place. INGE: Now the couple lives at a homeless shelter where dinnertime allows them to join a line for beef or vegetarian casserole, salad, fruit and carrot cake for desert. They are grateful for the charity, but wish the state legislature would undo the new law. Governor Pat McCrory says that won't happen. GOVERNOR PAT MCCRORY: We had to take some - make some very, very difficult decisions. INGE: He says the state's economic future is brighter now because the legislature has reduced its spending. And it's speeding up repayment of the $2. 8 billion it owes the federal government, for borrowing unemployment dollars for laid off workers, during the worst of the recession. Governor McCrory explained his position recently to business leaders at an economic forum in Durham. MCCRORY: We felt like our unemployment benefits were putting North Carolina in continued debt. And we needed to tear up the credit card and pay off that debt as quick as possible, so you in business could free up money and start hiring people again. INGE: He can point to progress, at least in terms of the unemployment rate. In the past year, it has dropped from 9. 4 percent to 7. 4 percent. But critics are not impressed. They say when 70,000 people abruptly lost jobless benefits many simply fell out of the workforce. JOHN QUINTERNO: Which means that our unemployment rate has come down sharply, but not necessarily for the right reason. INGE: That's John Quinterno, an economic analyst in Chapel Hill. He says the state is worse off now because its labor force is shrinking. QUINTERNO: And that's very - to me, very alarming. INGE: Back in Washington, Democrats want to restore extended benefits and include a special provision that could allow North Carolina to start getting federal money again. But many Republicans oppose new spending without off-setting budget cuts. Meanwhile, Ortez Morris is in a city-run worker training program. Tammie is looking for work. They both hope they won't be calling the shelter home come spring. For NPR News, I'm Leoneda Inge in Durham, North Carolina.

I'm Michel Martin. Coming up, Twitter runs on messages of 140 characters or less. So how could you possibly use it to deliver a polished piece of fiction? Writer Teju Cole figured out how, and he'll tell us about his experiment in Twitter-ature in just a few minutes. But first, we want to talk more about President Obama's so-called promise zones. These are the five areas around the country that the White House has chosen for special economic revitalization projects. Yesterday, we spoke about the administration's hopes for the program with the Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. He pointed out that the image of poverty a lot of us have down-at-the-heels urban neighborhoods isn't the whole story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING)TOM VILSACK: If you take a look at the persistently poor counties in the United States, there's 703 of them. And of the 703, 571 persistently poor counties are rural. MARTIN: And one of those is in Southeastern Kentucky. Eight counties in the Kentucky Highlands area were chosen to take part in the initial phase of the Promise Zone Initiative. Jerry Rickett is the president and CEO of the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation. And I talked with him earlier this week to find out more about the work his organizations and others have done to help earn that promise zone designation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING)JERRY RICKETT: The Kentucky Highlands area had been selected as a Stronger Economies Together region, and we were working with the U. S. Department of Agriculture and the extension service on health care that was actually growing. And we've been working over a three-year period to look for investments and things we could do to help expand that industry or help it grow. And because of that designation, the 22 counties were eligible. So. . . MARTIN: So talk a little bit about what's going on in those counties now if you would. As I understand it, the average poverty rate in the designated area is more than 30 percent. And why is that? What's been going on there that's led to that circumstance? RICKETT: Well, we're located in Central Appalachia. The region has been losing population. The economy has really struggled with the downturn. Recently, in the last few years, we've had a decline in the employment in the coal industry in our region. And those were pretty good paying jobs, which have a lot of supply businesses and trucking companies and things that supported that industry, you know, they've lost employment as well. MARTIN: I was understanding that there are about 2,000 coal-related jobs have gone away over the course of the recession. Is that right? RICKETT: Yes, ma'am. MARTIN: Were the coal companies cutting back, or what? They brought in technology that made those jobs redundant? RICKETT: It's all of the above. One of the bigger determinants has been the migration of coal-fired electrical generation plants. They're going to be converted over to natural gas or taken off-line. MARTIN: Were these pretty good paying jobs that have gone away in recent years? RICKETT: Well, the mining jobs paid an average salary of $63,000 a year. And those dollars were generated from outside our region. So, you know, the loss of the revenue coming into the region certainly has added to the distress the region already was experiencing. MARTIN: So how will this promise zone designation makes things better? What will you be able to do that you haven't already been doing? RICKETT: Well, you know, we're going to work with the groups that cover Eastern Kentucky. University of Kentucky's extension service is going to help us put a strategic plan together - you know, how we can take best advantage of the priorities that you mentioned early on. We also, you know, think there's a lot we can do by just working together with the technical assistance that's going to be provided from the different agencies that the president's asked to work with us on the promise zone. Also, I think the technical systems will bring best practices to us - you know, what has worked well in similar situations around the country. You know, are those things that we can do with the organizations that are part of their strategic plans as we try to go forward. MARTIN: Well, 'cause, you know, the skeptics are saying there's no new money here. So what's the good part about it? RICKETT: Go back 20 years. Kentucky Highlands was fortunate to be the lead entity for one of the Round 1 Empowerment Zones. And with that program, we received $40 million of grant funds. But also there was priority for other funding - very similar to what this program is, if I understand it properly. We were able to put together over $100 million through these programs that impacted the zone in a very positive way in the zone residents. MARTIN: Well, the fact that you - as we said, this was a competitive process and that you were selected, you know, for this has to feel like validation for the work that you've already done. Can you - you want to brag a little bit and tell us about some of the things that you've already done that maybe other groups might want to look at? RICKETT: Well, Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, we work in 22 counties. And we do economic development, primarily working in training and financing of entrepreneurial companies and try to keep existing businesses here. With USDA's approval, we can originate guaranteed loans through their business and industry guaranteed loans. Largest one was ever done was around $10 million to a business that, you know, helped them stay here and grow. All the way. . . MARTIN: What do they do? Anything I care about? Do they make shoes or something - something that I want? RICKETT: Well, they make transmission parts. . . MARTIN: Oh, wow. RICKETT: . . . For cars that you drive. MARTIN: Oh. Oh, OK, well. . . RICKETT: And we were really glad to keep them 'cause they're - you know, they pay well, and it's a very efficient company. They've grown nicely since we did that. MARTIN: OK. RICKETT: But we go all the way down to - loan size down to microloans. We've been around for 45 years. We were part of the War on Poverty. We were initially funded by the office of economic opportunity to, you know, try to generate employment opportunities in, you know, this region of Southeastern Kentucky. So we tried to work with the programs that are available to help us invest in our region. And when you invest in, you know, the American free enterprise system, jobs are a result of that. MARTIN: Jerry Rickett is the president and CEO of the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation. That's the organization that pursued and won a promise zone dedication. And he was kind enough to join us from London, Kentucky. Jerry Rickett, thank you so much for joining us. Will you keep us posted on how things are going? RICKETT: Certainly. Anytime.

SMITH: Forty-four year old Jennifer Taub(ph), a single mom who was laid off in May, was a finalist for a few jobs, only to find the hire put on hold because of the company's finances. Taub's unemployment check was just a small fraction of what she used to make, but she says it helped her make her mortgage and keep her condo. With the support now gone, she, too, is thinking of dipping into her retirement. TAUB: Now, I'm just worried about making ends meet and do I pull my child out of his afterschool program. I'm worried about my $1,400 Cobra payments. SMITH: For a while, Taub says she was glued to the news as Congress debated extending benefits, but she stopped, she says, when it made her too anxious and angry. Out on the street in Boston, the sentiment is largely shared, but there's also concerns about the cost of extending unemployment. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I figure they should not because where is the money coming from? We owe billions of dollars. We're a debtor nation. SMITH: Usman Secona(ph) who now works in IT for an engineering company says he himself was unemployed and got benefits for just six months. USMAN SECONA: When my unemployment stopped, that pushes me to look harder for a job because when I was getting my benefit, I was looking for a job, but not as hard as I've been doing afterwards when benefit was stopped.

I'm Arun Rath. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Two conference championship games tomorrow will determine the teams that advance to the Super Bowl, and the matchups could not be more exciting. Denver and New England, Brady and Manning for Pete's sake. The other game, pitting San Francisco against Seattle, might just feature the two best teams in the league. I expect both games will be better than the Super Bowl. You can tell how much I love the game, and many Americans feel the way I do. And America shows its love, giving back to the NFL with tax breaks and building stadiums with public money. But does the multibillion-dollar business really need the help, or is the NFL getting a free ride? That's our cover story today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREGG EASTERBROOK: NFL headquarters at 345 Park Avenue, New York, you walk into that facility, you think you're in the headquarters of Goldman Sachs. RATH: That's Gregg Easterbrook, author of \"King of Sports: Football's Impact on America. \"EASTERBROOK: That facility is registered as a not-for-profit. RATH: The National Football League is a tax-exempt organization, even with a commissioner that makes nearly $30 million a year. And from the tax code to big stadium deals, critics say they're getting millions of public dollars that would be better spent elsewhere. Now, a lot of organizations in America are considered tax-exempt - charities, trade groups and NPR. The NFL league office is organized as a 501(c)(6), a part of the tax code that exempts things like business leagues and chambers of commerce and trade associations. But that's just the league office, not the individual franchises. JEREMY SPECTOR: There is no tax break at the NFL for revenue earned from things like ticket sales, jersey sales or corporate sponsorships or television money. RATH: Jeremy Spector is outside tax counsel for the NFL and a partner at Covington & Burling LLP. He says the NFL, including teams, brings in about $10 billion of annual taxable income. SPECTOR: None of those revenues are escaping tax. It's the league office, that organizational or administrative arm, that's exempt. RATH: That administrative arm handles things like writing the rulebook, hiring referees, running the college draft and negotiating stadium deals. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma says it's absurd to call the NFL a trade association. He's proposed changing the tax code to end the exemption and start collecting taxes from pro sports organizations like the NFL or the PGA. SENATOR TOM COBURN: I'm saying in a time when we have a 640 billion deficit - and that's the best we've had in five years - shouldn't very wealthy to do sports leagues pay their share? RATH: Jeremy Spector, lawyer for the NFL, says sports organizations are being unfairly singled out. SPECTOR: I think it's very dangerous if Congress starts picking and choosing which industry or which industry trade associations are eligible for the tax exemption. RATH: Critics say the tax exemption is just one way professional football gets a handout from taxpayers. Another way is big-time stadium deals. Take, for example, the Dallas Cowboys. Back in the late '90s, the Cowboys and their owner Jerry Jones began plans to expand their current stadium or build a new one. He shopped in and around the city of Dallas for years asking for public assistance to fund the stadium. He found an audience in Arlington Texas, a city just outside of Dallas. And the price tag for the public, $325 million. Arlington Mayor Robert Cluck saw an opportunity for the city and a tough sell to voters. MAYOR ROBERT CLUCK: It was difficult, it certainly was. We explained to them how it was going to work, where it was going to be located, the amenities that it would contain. After we explained it thoroughly, it really was not very difficult. RATH: To pay for that, voters in Arlington agreed to raise taxes: a higher sales tax, plus hikes on rental cars and hotel rooms. Cowboys Stadium opened to the public in May 2009. Mayor Cluck says the economic benefits are tangible. He says groups use the stadium throughout the year, not just on game days. And he says building the stadium has increased property values in the surrounding area. All in all, he says, the stadium was worth it. CLUCK: I'm sure you could find somebody who's against it. I have not seen that person since it was completed. I think people are very, very happy with it. RATH: We decided to test out Mayor Cluck's assertion with some locals at Mavericks Sports Grill, just a mile away from the stadium. Dan O'Connell is the bar's manager. DAN O'CONNELL: When the original votes were cast for the tax increase, I voted against it. But in retrospect, I think it was probably a good thing for the city. It seems to draw a lot of people in on the weekends and during games. RATH: Jordan Fitzgerald doesn't agree and doesn't like the tax bill. JORDAN FITZGERALD: It was not worth it, whatsoever. Why? Because my tax money went to a damn stadium instead of my own benefit? RATH: Same goes for Alexia Whitehead. ALEXIA WHITEHEAD: I guess it pisses me off that, you know, my taxes go to that. And I don't even care about football, so. . . RATH: But some people, like Robert Henning, think the stadium put Arlington on the map. ROBERT HENNING: I love it. It's a worldwide - just icon for football, which I think is the greatest sport on the planet, and it's bringing a lot of income to our city. And it's bringing more people here. They see the promise, and that's what we want. RATH: Author Gregg Easterbrook says he's heard that argument before - that stadiums boost local economies. But he says it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. EASTERBROOK: Studies consistently show that the same amount of money spent on civic infrastructure, whether it's roads, bridges, subway, tunnels, if you spend on infrastructure, it has a multiplier effect every day of the year. If you spend on NFL stadia, it has a multiplier effect 10 or 12 days of the year. RATH: In terms of civic investment, football makes no sense at all, not only its lack of multiplier effect on the local economy, but far more importantly, all the owners are billionaires. The league has $10 billion of annual revenue. It can pay for its own stadiums. So can you give us a sense of scale in terms of the subsidies? How much is the NFL coming out ahead? EASTERBROOK: Research shows that about 70 percent of the cost of building and operating the NFL stadiums has been paid for by the public. I estimate if you roll it all together - subsidies, tax favors, et cetera - it's roughly $1 billion a year. Most NFL stadia either don't pay any property taxes or pay drastically reduced property taxes compared to comparable businesses. MetLife stadium, where this year's Super Bowl will be held in New Jersey - and wish me luck, because I'll be freezing my keister off at that game - should pay about $20 million a year in local property taxes if it was tacked to the comparable rate per similar businesses in the same county. It pays $6 million a year through a political agreement that exempted the billionaire ownership families of the Jets and Giants - who jointly own that stadium - from the kind of taxes that are paid by mere average people. RATH: Leaving aside, though, if it's not - I mean, not to sound silly about it, but even if it's not sensible, you know more than anybody how much people love this game. And there's that threat hanging over cities of, you know, you don't want your beloved team to go away, go somewhere else that's better. EASTERBROOK: The most recent example of that is Minnesota. A year ago, the billionaire ownership family of the Minnesota Vikings essentially blackmailed the state legislature into giving them half a billion dollars for a new facility. The key decision was made by the governor of Minnesota. His choices were two: One, he can say: I'm the man who kept the Vikings in Minnesota, or, maybe if they left, I don't think they would've left. I think the odds were very small. But if they'd left, then he would have been blamed for losing the Vikings. I mean, the former case where he boasts about, I'm the man who kept them here, he can claim ,and this will create thousands of jobs, even though that's transparently phony. If he does something that results in the Vikings leaving, then he's blamed. Meanwhile, the money that's been spent, it's all down the road. Some other politician will have to produce it. RATH: Gregg Easterbrook, author of \"King of Sports. \"Even if the public loses money in the end, there's that powerful variable in the equation: the intense love fans have for their teams. Again, Jeremy Spector from the NFL. SPECTOR: People like to have an NFL team at home. They like going to the stadium, and they don't want to lose that. And if the public at large or through their representatives decides that they want to spend some public dollars to keep the team there to help build a new stadium, you know, that's their decision to make. I don't deny that these are tough decisions for a community. There are limited dollars. And the communities have to decide where they want to spend them. RATH: The people who want to roll back the favors for the NFL are having a hard time finding allies. After four months, Senator Coburn has only one co-sponsor for his bill, and he's not at liberty to say who it is. And this week, Senator Coburn, this one lone voice in Congress against public help for pro football, announced he's retiring at the end of this congressional session. ARUN RATH, HOST:   This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: Two conference championship games tomorrow will determine the teams that advance to the Super Bowl, and the matchups could not be more exciting. Denver and New England, Brady and Manning for Pete's sake. The other game, pitting San Francisco against Seattle, might just feature the two best teams in the league. I expect both games will be better than the Super Bowl. You can tell how much I love the game, and many Americans feel the way I do. And America shows its love, giving back to the NFL with tax breaks and building stadiums with public money. But does the multibillion-dollar business really need the help, or is the NFL getting a free ride? That's our cover story today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREGG EASTERBROOK: NFL headquarters at 345 Park Avenue, New York, you walk into that facility, you think you're in the headquarters of Goldman Sachs. RATH: That's Gregg Easterbrook, author of \"King of Sports: Football's Impact on America. \" EASTERBROOK: That facility is registered as a not-for-profit. RATH: The National Football League is a tax-exempt organization, even with a commissioner that makes nearly $30 million a year. And from the tax code to big stadium deals, critics say they're getting millions of public dollars that would be better spent elsewhere. Now, a lot of organizations in America are considered tax-exempt - charities, trade groups and NPR. The NFL league office is organized as a 501(c)(6), a part of the tax code that exempts things like business leagues and chambers of commerce and trade associations. But that's just the league office, not the individual franchises. JEREMY SPECTOR: There is no tax break at the NFL for revenue earned from things like ticket sales, jersey sales or corporate sponsorships or television money. RATH: Jeremy Spector is outside tax counsel for the NFL and a partner at Covington & Burling LLP. He says the NFL, including teams, brings in about $10 billion of annual taxable income. SPECTOR: None of those revenues are escaping tax. It's the league office, that organizational or administrative arm, that's exempt. RATH: That administrative arm handles things like writing the rulebook, hiring referees, running the college draft and negotiating stadium deals. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma says it's absurd to call the NFL a trade association. He's proposed changing the tax code to end the exemption and start collecting taxes from pro sports organizations like the NFL or the PGA. SENATOR TOM COBURN: I'm saying in a time when we have a 640 billion deficit - and that's the best we've had in five years - shouldn't very wealthy to do sports leagues pay their share? RATH: Jeremy Spector, lawyer for the NFL, says sports organizations are being unfairly singled out. SPECTOR: I think it's very dangerous if Congress starts picking and choosing which industry or which industry trade associations are eligible for the tax exemption. RATH: Critics say the tax exemption is just one way professional football gets a handout from taxpayers. Another way is big-time stadium deals. Take, for example, the Dallas Cowboys. Back in the late '90s, the Cowboys and their owner Jerry Jones began plans to expand their current stadium or build a new one. He shopped in and around the city of Dallas for years asking for public assistance to fund the stadium. He found an audience in Arlington Texas, a city just outside of Dallas. And the price tag for the public, $325 million. Arlington Mayor Robert Cluck saw an opportunity for the city and a tough sell to voters. MAYOR ROBERT CLUCK: It was difficult, it certainly was. We explained to them how it was going to work, where it was going to be located, the amenities that it would contain. After we explained it thoroughly, it really was not very difficult. RATH: To pay for that, voters in Arlington agreed to raise taxes: a higher sales tax, plus hikes on rental cars and hotel rooms. Cowboys Stadium opened to the public in May 2009. Mayor Cluck says the economic benefits are tangible. He says groups use the stadium throughout the year, not just on game days. And he says building the stadium has increased property values in the surrounding area. All in all, he says, the stadium was worth it. CLUCK: I'm sure you could find somebody who's against it.

People in the region say they're tired of always being depicted as poor. When NPR's Pam Fessler went to Appalachia went to report on how the war on poverty is going, she was warned that people would be reluctant to talk. Instead, she got an earful. Here's her reporter's notebook. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Lee Mueller has lived in Martin County, Kentucky for much of his life, and he covered President Johnson's visit there as a young reporter. He says every few years since, more reporters have arrived. LEE MUELLER: We became kind of the poster child for the war on poverty, and any time somebody wanted to do a story about poor people, we were the first stop. FESSLER: And that's meant some very unwelcome attention over the years. News reports of kids struggling to survive among jobless, drug-addicted adults, trailer homes surrounded by trash. So, now here I was, another in a long line of unwelcome journalists. Michelle Harless, a high school guidance counselor, had one request when I interviewed her. MICHELLE HARLESS: I just ask when you portray us, please don't portray us as ignorant hill folk, I guess, because we are educated. We're poor, but we're educated, and everyone's pretty proud. It's not a desolate place where no hope can be found. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC MOVING)FESSLER: And indeed the county's got a lot going for it: well-paved roads, cheerful schools, beautiful mountains, albeit some have been strip mined. And yes, there are trailers surrounded by trash, but also tidy suburban homes. Even so, more than a third of the residents here are poor. But poverty's also in the eye of the beholder. For some here it's just the way life is. Like Normie Slone, who's 79 years old. She spends her days caring for her two severely disabled adult children - 58-year-old Sissy, who lies on a recliner in the family's cramped living room, chewing on a rubber toy, and Bobby, who sits in a wheelchair nearby. NORMIE SLONE: He's 55, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MOANING)SLONE: He has to sit in that chair all the time. He can't get up and do nothing. FESSLER: She says he can't get up and do anything on his own. Like lots of poor people, Normie Slone has strung together her own safety net with some help from the government, the rest from charities, family and friends. She says at least life is better than it used to be. SLONE: We're not starving. We're not starving to death. FESSLER: Many people here say told me they're rich in things that aren't included in any official measure of poverty. Things like family and faith. So, they're understandably a bit disturbed by how they're often seen from the outside. OWEN WRIGHT: We're probably one of the last few groups that it's still politically correct to make fun of. It's still OK to tell, you know, hillbilly, redneck jokes, or whatever. FESSLER: Owen Wright is with the Christian Appalachian Project. It's one of the nonprofits that helps Normie Slone. WRIGHT: And I think, you know, it can affect the self-esteem of the people that live here in Appalachia, 'cause once that's been drilled into them for so long, it's easy for them to start believing that themselves. FESSLER: And he says it only holds them back more. Lee Mueller, the journalist, says it wasn't always like that, especially before President Johnson came with the national media in tow. MUELLER: We knew the region was poor, but there wasn't a stigma to it to us. FESSLER: In part, he says, because there weren't any rich people around to show them otherwise. So, people didn't think of themselves as poor? MUELLER: Uh-uh. And we were surprised when we went someplace and found out that other people thought we were. FESSLER: But that was a long time ago.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. There are some fresh developments on the recent Target and Neiman Marcus security breaches. The theft of Target customer data was among the largest ever to hit the retail industry. And now, privacy experts are warning about so-called phishing scams that appear to offer help to those whose information was stolen. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Last week, Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel sent an email to more than 70 million people who had either their credit card or personal information stolen from Target's databases over the holiday season. In it, he warned customers to guard against possible scams by not responding to any text messages or to any emails requesting personal information. But around the same time, there were look-alike emails going out to some consumers posing as a warning from Target. Some of those emails asked consumers to protect themselves by clicking on a link. WILLIAM PELGRIN: They look legitimate. They're very realistic. Everyone I could see falling prey to a particular phishing attack if it was well drafted. NOGUCHI: William Pelgrin is the president and CEO for the Center for Internet Security, a nonprofit that advocates for greater public/private cyber security. PELGRIN: When you get something like that, again, you're going to react very quickly. And all we suggest is take a breath, think it through. Always contact that organization directly. NOGUCHI: Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder declined to comment for the record. But she confirmed the retailer has identified and, working with social media companies, taken down a dozen related online phishing scams. Meanwhile, over the weekend, two Mexican citizens were arrested in Texas near the U. S. -Mexico border. They were caught with cloned credit card information which local authorities are saying is related to the Target breach. But federal law enforcement officials say the connection is still unclear. The Secret Service declined comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Steven Boyer is co-founder of BitSight, a cyber security firm that tracks the kind of malware used to infiltrate Target systems. He says he expects scams resulting from the recent breaches to be especially well-crafted. STEVEN BOYER: What is particularly interesting about this attack is that because these adversaries were able to gain home address, email, name, they could do something very targeted. NOGUCHI: A security company called IntelCrawler says it believes it has traced the origin of the malware to a couple of young Russians who put it up for sale in online market places. Dan Clements is IntelCrawler's president. DAN CLEMENTS: When you have hundreds of IP addresses all pointing to a particular computer or person, it raises the probability of who they are and where they are.

We do know that the labor market is still weak, but that it's been getting better. There's really no question that it's a better job market today than it was a few years ago. In October of 2009, unemployment was about 10 percent. The latest reading on it is 6. 7 percent. So that's a lot better, but it's still lousy. And the question is how lousy? Is it even worse if we counted all the people who became discouraged and just dropped out of the workforce? So the Labor Department tries to understand that. Economists study it. I would say the consensus opinion is that a lot of it - probably something like half is attributable to aging baby boomers. That is people are just aging out of the workforce. You may have lost your job in 2009, and you were still in your late 50's. And you thought you'd get back into the workforce. Now you're in your 60's, and really you're just done. You're not going to find a job so you call yourself retired. And then there's another group of people that we have seen - a big surge in people who are disabled. They've applied for Social Security disability, and that's really surged. So there remains people in that category. And we're seeing younger people - maybe an 18-year-old who, a few years ago, might have been able to find a factory job and just get started working. That person maybe can't find a job that pays well so they just stay in school for longer. But, you know, then the remaining part of that is a question - how much of it is really attributed to these demographic factors? That's a big debate, and some people think it's just much worse than we think because there are all these people who are just discouraged. But maybe we're just not measuring things very well, and so the controversies continue. HEADLEE: Roben, let's talk a little bit about what Marilyn just said - that we're not measuring things well. And I think part of the reason people say that is because there are lots of nontraditional jobs that don't get really included in this unemployment number or the number of people who are working, right? FARZAD: You know, Marilyn, Celeste, is a really thorough business journalist. But she short shifted the fourth big category, which is journalists in transition. I think if you go to LinkedIn, you'll see these guys are keeping LinkedIn in business, man. No. I absolutely agree there. And this workforce is completely changed. So many people who have either - you know, in the psychological sense there is an element of learned helplessness. You learn for so long before you are chocked up as a discouraged worker or you decide, you know, you're freelance, you're in transition. I've tried my hand at floral arrangements and this and that and that - and consulting and landscaping. And that didn't work. And so I'm on sabbatical and then I'm on disability. And then I'm retiring. But not out of choice truly. And I think what's problematic is the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers are not granular enough to fully account for how much this workforce is changing, how many people out there have been jolted. The headline unemployment rate really doesn't tell you about the true level of underemployment or people who are hugely overqualified who are at Starbucks who might be getting benefits, but are biding their time until something else does or does not appear. GEEWAX: You know, I actually spoke to some department economists about this and said did you - do you think you're measuring the right things? You know, in a digital economy where, let's say you can, you know, develop software - an app just sitting in your bedroom, and this month you work and next month you don't work because there's no job. Are you working? Are you not working? And the economists said to me that there's a lot of value in asking questions exactly the same way for decade after decade. I mean, these data points go back to really just after World War II. And they basically track a very steady way of measuring the economy so that there's this value. FARZAD: There was a lot of value to an 8-track 40 years ago, too. GEEWAX: Right, so then you come. . . FARZAD: I mean, this is the problem. GEEWAX: Exactly. This is why. . . HEADLEE: Am I going to have to separate the two of you? GEEWAX: Well, that's why. . . HEADLEE: Let's take a moment here to remind everyone what we're talking about. If you are just joining us, we're talking about labor force participation - who is actually working and who's sitting at home watching \"Downton Abbey. \" We're talking about this with Roben Farzad of Bloomberg BusinessWeek and NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. And I made an offhand comment about sitting at home, Roben, but that leads to my question. If there are people who are dropping out of the labor force, what are they doing? Are they sitting at home or are they, as you say, cobbling together a living from a bunch of different projects? FARZAD: Well, when I was considering dropping out, I really got into Kathie Lee and Hoda. And I would get my muse. Some days I was like. . . HEADLEE: Come on. Be serious. FARZAD: Really. It would inspire me to write a story, and then I would freelance something and then - you couldn't exactly consider me fully dropped out for that day. I was like a part-time worker. But in any event, we are seeing a lot of people decide that, OK, if you're going to hit the reset button economically, this once-in-a-lifetime cataclysm, let's go to school. So college kids know that there's no shame right now in being unemployed out of college. That is the new normal, to use the cliched-to-death term. That, you know what? You can extend it. Take a year abroad. Go do a Teach for America fellowship, volunteer. Nobody's really going to judge you. It's not like it was when the economy was at full employment and Wall Street and consulting firms and tech startups were hiring every possible qualified 22-year-old in the country. So when you add all of these things together, you know, speaking almost existentially, how do you come to a true unemployment rate for the economy, one that represents those that are out there wholeheartedly wanting to work and wholeheartedly cannot get work? And I think that the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other people are trying to get their minds out of how do you do that in the year 2014, which now, increasingly with Obamacare, people are going to not have to be tethered to a job because of health care. That they can be increasingly free agents. And these numbers are going to be vexingly hard to track in the standardized way that they were saying we did since World War II. HEADLEE: So, Marilyn, the number vexingly hard to trackGEEWAX: Yes. HEADLEE: But also, Roben's saying it's going to be less meaningful as we move forward. GEEWAX: Right. HEADLEE: What do you think of that? GEEWAX: I've talked to people who operate sort of freelance exchanges, you know, kind of the eHarmony for workers who want to do some software development and employers. And they say that they - you know, somebody might work for a month and then go hiking for a month. And they're really not unemployed, but they're not employed. They're not looking for work, but they don't feel insecure. They're just taking a month off. So how do you count that kind of new digital worker? I think economic historians will have to look back on this period and say wow, they were miss-measuring everything. The economy was changing radically and they weren't capturing that. We have data collection that is ideally suited to 1955. And we're missing it so, you know. And there are these controversies that maybe won't be sorted out for decades to come until we look back on this period, but right now, the things we do know - the labor market is weak, and we wish we had more jobs - how weak it is exactly why it's this - the people are dropping out. There are known things. Yes baby boomers are retiring, but there are lots of unknowns. Maybe we will find out later that actually maybe the economy was a little bit better than we thought or. . . FARZAD: Sure. HEADLEE: Now maybe that's a known unknown. GEEWAX: Yeah or the. . . HEADLEE: And the unknown unknowns. . . FARZAD: Rumsfeldian sense. HEADLEE: Right, but let me go to you Sammy Hagar. Before we go. . . FARZAD: I'm a David Lee Roth guy. You know that. Don't even go there. HEADLEE: So what exactly does this mean? I mean, when you talk about somebody working for a month and then going hiking - I wish. You know, I am one of those people that cobbles it - cobbles my living together out of many different projects. That doesn't make me unemployed, but it also doesn't mean I'm reflected in either the unemployment numbers. . . GEEWAX: Exactly. HEADLEE: . . . Or the employment numbers. But that also means, I would assume, Roben, that the government is not set up to not only measure me, but help me. FARZAD: Absolutely. HEADLEE: And make me more secure. FARZAD: It's dysfunctional and requires a whole rethink at this point. And let's not just put the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Labor Department in the spotlight here. This goes back to everybody - the Treasury Department. . . GEEWAX: Yes. FARZAD: . . . The Council of Economic Advisers - all these people who look at these stats like the headline on unemployment rate as kind of gospel. And Wall Street does, too. Every time you get a jobs report. . . HEADLEE: Right. FARZAD: . . . There is this if-then scenario. Well, the feds are going to stay on hold if we see joblessness stay high. It's all a game of - and I don't mean to be so strong in saying this - but it smacks of self-delusion. The numbers are not very telling. And any statistician out there - anybody who'd say - would call them out on what is statistically significant and insignificant in this very rapidly changing economy. I think you step back from the whole thing and you pose the question - you know, we talked about the new normal cliche. When was it normal? If we can't trust the numbers, if we can't say that, OK, the unemployment rate is now approaching 6 percent and will be a natural rate of unemployment soon enough if we keep growing at 120,000 jobs a month, if you can't even count on that number - and then the Federal Reserve scrutinizes - I mean, after all, the Fed governors meet and they've set a hard target for unemployment rate to then pullback on quantitative easing and then increase. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. FARZAD: . . . Interest rates - what can you count on? So I just - I don't know what the urgency would be of some whistleblower shows up on Capitol Hill or on the steps of the Treasury Department, and says, you know, you guys need to figure out new numbers. You're juking the stats. I just don't see anybody out there with a vested interest in the federal government to say that this needs to be overhauled. GEEWAX: You know what's really peculiar is this number is so important and people watch it so closely. And yet, last October, when we had the government shutdown, those economists for the Labor Department were out of work at the very time they were supposed to be collecting even the minimal data. . . HEADLEE: That's right. GEEWAX: . . . That we do have. HEADLEE: Yeah. GEEWAX: It's not like Congress is just rushing forward to give the Labor Department a lot more money and hiring more economists. You know, given the importance of these numbers, we might want to think about how we fund this and take a little more seriously this whole data collection issue. FARZAD: I predict that this might be solved by the private sector. I know my employer Bloomberg certainly spends a lot of time polling economists, taking a poll of polls, taking a poll of various economists in its system. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. FARZAD: . . . Outside it's economists. ADP, the payroll operator, polls all sorts of hiring managers so there's got to be a better way to get at this true number. HEADLEE: I'm sorry. I'm offended by the implication that somebody could be more effective at problem-solving than Congress, Roben. That's Roben Farzad, a contributor to Bloomberg BusinessWeek. He joined us from member station WCVE in Richmond, Virginia. And Marilyn Geewax is NPR's senior business editor. She joined us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Thanks to both of you. GEEWAX: Great to be with you. FARZAD: Thank you. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  I'm Celeste Headlee, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Michel Martin is away. Coming up, much of the news out of Detroit has been bad lately, but one guy says it's a great place to live. We'll hear why he decided to help the Motor City comeback by purchasing a $500 wreck of a house. That's just ahead. But first, the national unemployment numbers seem to be heading down. And yet, that number doesn't really tell the whole story. The labor force has also been shrinking. And we want to know what that means so we've invited NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. And also with us is Roben Farzad. He's a contributor to Bloomberg BusinessWeek. Welcome back to both of you. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi. ROBEN FARZAD: Hi, Celeste.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. The U. S. Supreme Court hears arguments today in a case that could have big implications for public employee unions. The high court will be considering whether states may recognize a union to represent private health care workers who assist the elderly and disabled in their homes rather than in state institutions. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: To understand why a growing number of states actually want to recognize a union to represent home health care workers, listen to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, talking about her state's Medicaid program for adults with disabilities. LISA MADIGAN: The home services program has about 28,000 home care aides, and these people are working in homes all over the state. There isn't a centralized workplace, and the goal for the state here is creating and retaining a professional group of home care aides to meet the needs of what is an ever-increasing population of older people with disabilities. And we need to do that in a cost-effective manner. TOTENBERG: Prior to the state recognizing the union in Illinois, turnover was huge, leaving large gaps in coverage for disabled adults. In the 10 years since unionization, though, wages have nearly doubled; from $7 to $13 an hour. Training and supervision has increased, and workers now have health insurance. It's not a surprise, then, that retention has greatly increased. What may surprise many is that the home care system is cheaper than nursing home care, with savings of $632 million, according to the state. Nobody has to join the union, but non-union members - and there are three, in this case - do have to pay the costs of negotiating and administering the contract. Under long-established labor law, when a majority of workers vote to approve a union, those who do not join cannot be forced to pay for political activities of the union. But if the union is accepted by the public employer - as the service employees union was in Illinois - non-union members still have to pay their fair share of the expenses of negotiating a contract. That's to prevent non-members from free riding on the due of members. For some workers, however, even that is too much. William Messenger, of the National Right to Work Committee, is their lawyer. WILLIAM MESSENGER: They just don't want to deal with this organization whatsoever. TOTENBERG: Or as Pam Harris, who cares for her son at home, puts it. . . PAM HARRIS: I object to my home being a union workplace. TOTENBERG: Harris, however, is part of a separate group of workers, most of whom care for family members at home. They voted down union representation. Her only claim in this case is that she fears there will be another vote. Those who care for the bulk of disabled adults are quite different.  Not only did they approve union representation, most care for people who are not relatives. Those challenging the union representation have several claims. First, they say that the state is not their employer, since under this program, the individual patients - known as customers - hire and fire their own aides. The state replies that the aides are trained and supervised by the state, paid twice a month by the state, and that the state can fire them. The objector's second claim is that the union is little more than a lobbying group. Again, Bill Messenger. MESSENGER: Wages paid to government employees should be deemed a matter of public concern. TOTENBERG: So, you're saying, in essence, because they're public employees, they can't have an effective union, because they're dealing with the government, and the government, per se, involves political issues. MESSENGER: Yes, to a large degree, yes. TOTENBERG: In other words, messenger views bargaining with the government for wages and health care as a political act. MESSENGER: So I reject the notion that the SEIU somehow got higher reimbursement rates for them, and that can be a justification. Illinois could raise the reimbursement rates unilaterally. PAUL SMITH: There's three people who are complaining, out of 27,000. TOTENBERG: That's Paul Smith, the lawyer who will argue for the state and the union in the Supreme Court today. SMITH: Not one of the plaintiffs has turned down the wages they've gotten as a result of the union negotiations, or even said there's anything that the union is trying to get for them that they don't approve of. TOTENBERG: And Smith notes that no one here claims that any of the fair share money has gone for lobbying or political campaigning. Still, Bill Messenger of the Right to Work Committee sees it differently. MESSENGER: The question is: Can individuals be forced to support a union if they don't want to? And our position is no. TOTENBERG: In the end, what makes this case remarkable is that the Supreme Court, for decades, has allowed public employee unions to operate as long as non-members are not forced to pay for political activities. But the current conservative court has not been enamored of labor unions, hinting just two years ago that it might be time to revisit decades of doctrine on this issue. Paul Smith. SMITH: If they say you can't have an exclusive representative union, that would be a stake in the heart, not just of unions in the public sector, but all unions. TOTENBERG: And if the court were to say unions could not have a mandatory fair share contribution. . . SMITH: You'd have a serious free rider problem. People have no incentive to pay their share of the costs if they can free ride on everybody else. So, this would substantially weaken unions. TOTENBERG: A decision in the case is expected by summer.

S. Supreme Court hears arguments today in a case that could have big implications for public employee unions. The high court will be considering whether states may recognize a union to represent private health care workers who assist the elderly and disabled in their homes rather than in state institutions. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: To understand why a growing number of states actually want to recognize a union to represent home health care workers, listen to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, talking about her state's Medicaid program for adults with disabilities. LISA MADIGAN: The home services program has about 28,000 home care aides, and these people are working in homes all over the state. There isn't a centralized workplace, and the goal for the state here is creating and retaining a professional group of home care aides to meet the needs of what is an ever-increasing population of older people with disabilities. And we need to do that in a cost-effective manner. TOTENBERG: Prior to the state recognizing the union in Illinois, turnover was huge, leaving large gaps in coverage for disabled adults. In the 10 years since unionization, though, wages have nearly doubled; from $7 to $13 an hour. Training and supervision has increased, and workers now have health insurance. It's not a surprise, then, that retention has greatly increased. What may surprise many is that the home care system is cheaper than nursing home care, with savings of $632 million, according to the state. Nobody has to join the union, but non-union members - and there are three, in this case - do have to pay the costs of negotiating and administering the contract. Under long-established labor law, when a majority of workers vote to approve a union, those who do not join cannot be forced to pay for political activities of the union. But if the union is accepted by the public employer - as the service employees union was in Illinois - non-union members still have to pay their fair share of the expenses of negotiating a contract. That's to prevent non-members from free riding on the due of members. For some workers, however, even that is too much. William Messenger, of the National Right to Work Committee, is their lawyer. WILLIAM MESSENGER: They just don't want to deal with this organization whatsoever. TOTENBERG: Or as Pam Harris, who cares for her son at home, puts it. . . PAM HARRIS: I object to my home being a union workplace. TOTENBERG: Harris, however, is part of a separate group of workers, most of whom care for family members at home. They voted down union representation. Her only claim in this case is that she fears there will be another vote. Those who care for the bulk of disabled adults are quite different.  Not only did they approve union representation, most care for people who are not relatives. Those challenging the union representation have several claims. First, they say that the state is not their employer, since under this program, the individual patients - known as customers - hire and fire their own aides. The state replies that the aides are trained and supervised by the state, paid twice a month by the state, and that the state can fire them. The objector's second claim is that the union is little more than a lobbying group. Again, Bill Messenger. MESSENGER: Wages paid to government employees should be deemed a matter of public concern. TOTENBERG: So, you're saying, in essence, because they're public employees, they can't have an effective union, because they're dealing with the government, and the government, per se, involves political issues. MESSENGER: Yes, to a large degree, yes. TOTENBERG: In other words, messenger views bargaining with the government for wages and health care as a political act. MESSENGER: So I reject the notion that the SEIU somehow got higher reimbursement rates for them, and that can be a justification. Illinois could raise the reimbursement rates unilaterally. PAUL SMITH: There's three people who are complaining, out of 27,000. TOTENBERG: That's Paul Smith, the lawyer who will argue for the state and the union in the Supreme Court today. SMITH: Not one of the plaintiffs has turned down the wages they've gotten as a result of the union negotiations, or even said there's anything that the union is trying to get for them that they don't approve of. TOTENBERG: And Smith notes that no one here claims that any of the fair share money has gone for lobbying or political campaigning. Still, Bill Messenger of the Right to Work Committee sees it differently. MESSENGER: The question is: Can individuals be forced to support a union if they don't want to? And our position is no. TOTENBERG: In the end, what makes this case remarkable is that the Supreme Court, for decades, has allowed public employee unions to operate as long as non-members are not forced to pay for political activities. But the current conservative court has not been enamored of labor unions, hinting just two years ago that it might be time to revisit decades of doctrine on this issue. Paul Smith. SMITH: If they say you can't have an exclusive representative union, that would be a stake in the heart, not just of unions in the public sector, but all unions. TOTENBERG: And if the court were to say unions could not have a mandatory fair share contribution. . . SMITH: You'd have a serious free rider problem. People have no incentive to pay their share of the costs if they can free ride on everybody else. So, this would substantially weaken unions. TOTENBERG: A decision in the case is expected by summer.

It brings up images of poor, or homeowners and renters, being forced out of the neighborhood as more affluent people move in. Now, a series of new studies is showing that gentrifying neighborhoods may be a boon to the longtime residents who are able to stay. NPR's Laura Sullivan reports. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: On the corner of 6th and H Streets Northeast in Washington, D. C. , there's a wooden bench outside Murry's grocery store. Murry's has been an anchor in this neighborhood for decades - through the crack wars of the late '80s and the urban blight that followed, when most other businesses packed up and left. On the bench, you'll often find Bobby Foster Jr. reading the newspaper. BOBBY FOSTER JR. : Sun shines over here this time of day. It's always good where the sun shines. SULLIVAN: Foster is a retired cook. He's cooked in kitchens all over D. C. FOSTER JR. : I could take liver and make it taste like steak. SULLIVAN: And he's lived in this neighborhood for 54 years. But now, this neighborhood, and hundreds like it across the country, are changing - gentrifying. Every other shop is a new restaurant, a high-end salon or a bar. The term makes people feel excited and guilty. It's been several decades since the middle and upper class began returning to the cities. That kind of movement is bound to hurt someone. But recent research is starting to show the impact might not be as harmful as people feared. Even longtime residents, like Bobby Foster, are conflicted. FOSTER JR. : Some things are good. Some things are bad, you know. But sometimes, the good outweighs the bad. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING OF RIOT)SULLIVAN: Gentrification burst into the social consciousness on Aug. 6th, 1988, with the Tompkins Square Park riot in New York City. Residents carried signs reading, \"Gentrification Is Class War. \" Police carried batons. The bloody battle that ensued left more than 100 people injured. The protesters' fury centered on the idea that the poor would be homeless so the rich could live in their neighborhoods, destroying whatever character they may have had. Professor Lance Freeman is the director of the Urban Planning Program at Columbia University. And he says, yeah, that's what he figured had happened, too. LANCE FREEMAN: My intuition would be that, you know, people are being displaced, so they're going to be moving more quickly. I was really aiming to quantify how much displacement was occurring. SULLIVAN: Freeman launched a study first in Harlem, and then nationally, calculating how many people were pushed out of their homes when wealthy people moved in. FREEMAN: To my surprise, it seemed to suggest that people in the neighborhoods that were classified as gentrifying were moving less frequently. SULLIVAN: Yes, less frequently. Freeman's work found that low-income residents were no more likely to move out of their homes when a neighborhood gentrifies than when it doesn't. Freeman says higher costs can push out renters; especially the elderly or disabled, or those without rent-stabilized apartments. But it turns out, a lot of renters overall end up staying; especially if new parks, safer streets and better schools are paired with a job opportunity right down the block. That squares with a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. DANIEL HARTLEY: We're finding that the financial health of original residents in gentrifying neighborhoods seems to be increasing, as compared to original residents in non-gentrifying, low-priced neighborhoods. SULLIVAN: Daniel Hartley is a research economist with the bank. He found credit scores of original residents went up - regardless of whether they rented or owned - if they stayed put. HARTLEY: There may be these kind of side benefits to gentrification that we've been less focused on; that it can actually help the original residents of the neighborhood. SULLIVAN: As for Bobby Foster, he's staying. He and his family own their home. He's very concerned about what will happen to the beauty salon across the street. Its owners often do the elderly people's hair for free. FOSTER JR. : They are beautiful people. They've been here as long as I've known this place. SULLIVAN: But he says he kind of likes the new people, too, and he wasn't sure he would. He says he likes that they sweep their stoops, just like his grandma did. FOSTER JR. : The people are still good. People are still good. SULLIVAN: Two months ago, city officials announced a new retail apartment complex was coming to this street corner. Murry's will be closing. In its place will be a Whole Foods. Bobby Foster says he just hopes Whole Foods puts a bench out front. Laura Sullivan, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. A study released this week is shedding new light on economic mobility in the United States. Those two words have been in the news a lot lately, as President Obama has tried to focus attention on the issue. The new study, prepared by a group of economists, came to a surprising conclusion. It is no harder to climb the ladder now than it was 20 years ago. But, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, moving up is still a lot harder in the U. S. than it is in other developed countries. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Economists have been looking into the issue of U. S. economic mobility for a long time. But Gary Solon, professor of economics at Michigan State, says they've often been hampered by the lack of adequate data. Solon say the study released this week is much more comprehensive than anything that's come before. GARY SOLON: The unusual thing is that this research team has gotten cooperation from the Internal Revenue Service to access tax return data, which of course are not, you know, generally available to researchers. ZARROLI: The researchers were led by Raj Chetty of Harvard. They looked at low-income people born in the early 1970s, and how likely they were to advance to top income brackets. And then they compared them to people born later. Nathaniel Hendren of Harvard is a co-author of the study. NATHANIEL HENDREN: What we found is that mobility has remained remarkably stable. The chance in which kids can climb up or down the income ladder has remained pretty stable over the last 20 to 25 years. ZARROLI: The report comes at a time of growing concern about economic mobility and deep political divisions about how to address it. There is a widespread belief that the United States has become a much more class-bound society, a place where rising above your station has become a lot harder. David Autor is a professor economics at MIT. DAVID AUTOR: It addresses a very burning question about whether the recent rise in equality has substantially changed mobility. And at least in the short time window in which they're able to look, the answer is no. So that's good news. ZARROLI: The bad news, Autor says, is that growing income inequality has made the gap between income levels much wider than in the past. A person who's born at the bottom and stays there is further behind than ever before. AUTOR: The costs of immobility have risen because the lifetime difference in earnings now between someone born at the bottom quartile, versus top quartile, is much, much greater than it used to be. ZARROLI: The study also contained some other disturbing findings. It said economic mobility in the United States remains behind that of other wealthy countries. An American born at the bottom has about an eight percent chance of rising to the top; the odds are twice that in Denmark. Again, Nathaniel Hendren. HENDREN: The political rhetoric has gone down a path of saying, oh, maybe it's getting harder to move up in the income distribution. But the sad fact is that it's always been very hard in the United States relative to other countries, and it hasn't gotten any better, it hasn't gotten any worse. ZARROLI: But the study also says economic mobility varies a lot from place to place in the United States. Rates of advancement in the Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco metro areas compared favorably with European countries. But many parts of the Southeast and the Rust Belt look more like the developing world. HENDREN: In areas, say, like Charlotte, North Carolina, kids born in the bottom portion of the income distribution have about a four to five percent chance of reaching the top. But kids born in, say, Salt Lake City, have about an 11 percent chance of reaching the top if they're born to a poor family. ZARROLI: The study doesn't try to find out why economic mobility varies so much. But it does note that there's a strong correlation between advancement and certain kinds of social factors: the quality of schools, the degree of racial segregation, and whether you grew up in a two-parent household.

More on the latter now from Michael Dimock, vice president of research at the Pew Research Center. Pew has a new survey out, asking Americans what they think about income inequality. Michael Dimock, welcome once again. MICHAEL DIMOCK: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And first finding is Americans say there is growing income inequality, yes? DIMOCK: Yes, they do. Sixty-five percent said they think the gap between the rich and the rest of the country has been growing over the past 10 years. And that spans party lines, Republicans and Democrats pretty much agree on that factor. SIEGEL: Does this is also cut across demographic lines, as well? DIMOCK: It does. The young and old, even higher and lower income Americans, tend to see a growing divide in inequality - or growing inequality in overall income. The rich, though, being defined potentially differently by different people. SIEGEL: Now, to what extent do Americans say that income inequality, which so many say exists, is something that the government should do something about? DIMOCK: That's where the rub comes in. A majority of Americans want this issue to be addressed. Sixty-nine percent said the government should do at least something about inequality in this country. But the partisan divide couldn't be wider. Democrats - this is a uniform issue - 90 percent think that this should be a priority for the government. Among Republicans, it's much more controversial; fewer than half of Republicans think the government should play a role in this. SIEGEL: If you use the word redistribute - redistribute this - excuse me, I can't say it - redistribute wealth or redistribution at all in this survey? DIMOCK: We didn't use that word. We're not sure what people would necessarily think about with a term like that. But we tried to test the concept, which is, what's the best way to address poverty. Is it too raise taxes, in order to have more resources to expand programs for the poor? Or is it to lower taxes, in order to spur investment and more economic growth? SIEGEL: And here's where the party division now comes in pretty strongly. DIMOCK: That's it's - yeah, predictably that's really where the divide is. By well over 2-to-1, Republicans say the right way to do this is more of a rising tide lifts all boats model; you spur the economy, you lower taxes, you get things supercharged. For Democrats, this is a clear-cut issue, 75 percent say the way to do it is more redistributive. SIEGEL: Now, actually, I think you have a majority of the whole sample agreeing with the idea of a tax in that case. DIMOCK: That's right, because independents tilt a little bit toward raising taxes on the wealthy in order to expand programs for the poor. In fact, across a range of questions in this survey, we find independents eager to see some sort of action - both in the realm of reducing poverty but also in the realm of addressing inequality. SIEGEL: There have been debates in Washington recently over food stamps, unemployment benefits. Do people believe that those are things that the government should be doing more of? DIMOCK: Very much so. I mean, the unemployment benefit issue, 63 percent in the survey said that they want - they support an extension of those benefits. When it comes to the minimum wage, raising it to $10. 10 an hour is supported by 73 percent of Americans. Only 25 percent oppose. These are both issues that unify Democrats, get broad support from independents, and divide the Republican base. Republicans are really split 50/50 on these issues and there's a deep income divide within the Republican Party. Lower income Republicans really favor these kinds of programs. It's the higher income Republicans that are more opposed. SIEGEL: You said that while there is a majority in favor of a tax on the wealthiest Americans, to benefit people lower down, there is some difference of opinion as to what it means to be rich; as to who the wealthiest are. Are we talking about the one percent wealthiest, the 25 percent wealthiest? DIMOCK: It's one of the challenges when we were trying to design the survey. What do people mean by rich? It all is a matter of perspective. In fact, we tend to find that many people who - when we find out what their income and economic situation has - by most economic definitions, would be considered rich or in the highest percentiles, describing themselves very much as middle class. SIEGEL: Middle class. DIMOCK: And you find a bunch of that at the other end, too. There are many people who, by many economic measures, would be considered below middle class, thinking of themselves as middle class. It's a part of an American characteristic to kind of always consider your position relatively. But middle class is just a natural landing point for a lot of us. SIEGEL: Michael Dimock, thanks for talking with us about the survey. DIMOCK: Thank you. SIEGEL: That's Michael Dimock, who is vice president of research at the Pew Research Center.

In fact, across a range of questions in this survey, we find independents eager to see some sort of action - both in the realm of reducing poverty but also in the realm of addressing inequality. SIEGEL: There have been debates in Washington recently over food stamps, unemployment benefits. Do people believe that those are things that the government should be doing more of? DIMOCK: Very much so. I mean, the unemployment benefit issue, 63 percent in the survey said that they want - they support an extension of those benefits. When it comes to the minimum wage, raising it to $10. 10 an hour is supported by 73 percent of Americans. Only 25 percent oppose. These are both issues that unify Democrats, get broad support from independents, and divide the Republican base. Republicans are really split 50/50 on these issues and there's a deep income divide within the Republican Party. Lower income Republicans really favor these kinds of programs. It's the higher income Republicans that are more opposed. SIEGEL: You said that while there is a majority in favor of a tax on the wealthiest Americans, to benefit people lower down, there is some difference of opinion as to what it means to be rich; as to who the wealthiest are. Are we talking about the one percent wealthiest, the 25 percent wealthiest? DIMOCK: It's one of the challenges when we were trying to design the survey. What do people mean by rich? It all is a matter of perspective. In fact, we tend to find that many people who - when we find out what their income and economic situation has - by most economic definitions, would be considered rich or in the highest percentiles, describing themselves very much as middle class. SIEGEL: Middle class. DIMOCK: And you find a bunch of that at the other end, too. There are many people who, by many economic measures, would be considered below middle class, thinking of themselves as middle class. It's a part of an American characteristic to kind of always consider your position relatively. But middle class is just a natural landing point for a lot of us. SIEGEL: Michael Dimock, thanks for talking with us about the survey. DIMOCK: Thank you. SIEGEL: That's Michael Dimock, who is vice president of research at the Pew Research Center.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

NPR's Chris Arnold is following this and he joins me now. Chris, the year started off looking like the global economy was more stable. We didn't have a financial crisis unfolding somewhere. So what's going on now? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Right. Well, the last two days have definitely been bad for the stock market, and we haven't been used to seeing that for a while. But keep in mind that the Dow and the S&P were up a lot last year. The S&P was up 30 percent. The Dow was up 26. 5 percent in a single year. That's just a huge move. So a couple of down days really shouldn't rattle people too much. A lot of analysts were saying, look, maybe it's an understandable pull back. And it's important to say that investors themselves were not panicking today. This was not people running around with their hands in the air and selling everything they had. (LAUGHTER)ARNOLD: That was not happening today. It's hard to say exactly why these things happen. But yesterday, one thing did happen, and China came out with a disappointing report on how its manufacturing economy was doing. That got a lot of attention. And then there's this concern, as you talked about, with slowing economies in emerging markets. That's Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa. Currencies there are getting very beat-up. BLOCK: Yeah. And so even though the U. S. economy is recovering, Europe is doing a little better, a lot of concern that other economies around the world aren't doing as well as expected and especially China, right? ARNOLD: Especially China. China is the second largest economy in the world. We've heard that before, but it's actually the first largest economy if you look at it as a goods producer. So the largest manufacturer of stuff might be making less stuff, and so that means it's going to be buying less raw materials. That spills out into emerging markets because they supply those raw materials. So you can see those things are tied together. There's also some thought that the U. S. Federal Reserve has been juicing up or over-caffeinating(ph) the U. S. stock market and emerging markets to some degree. And so as the Fed pulls back on that stimulus, and it's been pulling back on that stimulus, that could cause some pain. But other people say, look, you know, we've been hearing about the Fed pulling back for so long. The market has to have digested this. People don't think, well, look, this has probably more to do with new news about China and emerging markets. BLOCK: So those emerging markets are in trouble. But why would that trouble be causing stocks then in the U. S. to take this tumble? ARNOLD: Well, some of this could be sort of technical, like investors lost a lot of money in emerging markets, so then they have to sell U. S. stocks. And, you know, there's a little bit of that going on. But I think the bigger thing is probably jitters that, look, U. S. companies do business abroad. And companies like John Deere Tractor and Caterpillar Tractor, they do a lot of business in developing countries, so their stocks got hit. Obviously, it's a global economy. Things are connected.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Let's go back now 100 years to a key moment in the long debate over the importance of a living wage. It was January 1914, a frigid month in Detroit, much like January 2014, still thousands lined up in the bitter cold outside a factory in Highland Park, Michigan. They were there to take Henry Ford up on an extraordinary offer: $5 a day for 8 hours of work. As Michigan radio's Sara Cwiek reports, for U. S. workers, it was one of the defining moments of the 20th century. SARA CWIEK, BYLINE: I'm standing here in front of what's now an abandoned factory complex along busy Woodward Avenue. It's hard to imagine now those big crowds lining up in the frigid cold eager for the chance to work in a bustling factory for $5 a day. That was more than double the average factory wage at that time. There's not much to distinguish this place from Detroit's other industrial ruins. But if you take the time to stop and walk up to the front of the building here, you'll find a pretty modest historical marker proclaiming this the home of the Model T. It tells us that by 1925, this place churned out more than 9,000 Ford Model T's a day. And it ends with this: Mass production soon moved from here to all phases of American industry, and set a pattern of abundance for 20th century living. But Henry Ford was a hardnosed business man. He didn't introduce the $5 workday because he was a nice guy. BOB KRIEPKE: It was mainly to stabilize the workforce. And it sure did and raised the bar all over the world. CWIEK: That's Bob Kreipke, corporate historian for the Ford Motor Company. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: By 1913, Henry Ford broke the 200,000 mark in Model T production, the first moving assembly line made this possible. Conveyor belts transported small parts to the worker. They performed a specific task. CWIEK: This tremendously sped up production, but Ford still had a problem. While he had standardized production, he hadn't standardized his workforce. Now he didn't need particularly skilled workers; he just needed ones that would do the same repetitive, specialized tasks hour after hour, day after day. Kreipke says there was chronic absenteeism and lots of worker turnover. So Ford gambled that higher wages would attract better, more reliable workers. KRIEPKE: It was an absolute, total success. In fact, it was better than anybody had even thought. CWIEK: The benefits were almost immediate. Productivity surged, and the Ford Motor Co. doubled its profits in less than two years. Ford ended up calling it the best cost-cutting move he ever made. Now, it's widely believed that Henry Ford also upped wages to expand his market, paying employees enough to buy the cars they made. While that wasn't Ford's main motivation, it was a welcome byproduct, and University of California-Berkeley labor economist Harley Shaiken says it was a game changer. HARLEY SHAIKEN: What that gave us was an industrial middle class, and an economy that was driven by consumer demand. CWIEK: Shaiken says Ford proved that higher wages lead to more productivity, which in turn was good for business. That positive feedback loop gave rise to a broad prosperous middle class. But over the years, waves of economic pressures and political changes have broken that link. SHAIKEN: Today, overwhelmingly employers view the lowest wage as the most competitive wage. CWIEK: These days, global supply chains feed a hyper competitive auto industry where no one wants to give up even an inch of ground. And keeping up with technology takes precedence over stabilizing the workforce. Harley Shaiken agrees that this just isn't Henry Ford's economy anymore. SHAIKEN: There are very real economic pressures out there that push down on wages so it's not a simple story, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a core truth into what Ford found. CWIEK: So a century after Henry Ford started paying $5 a day, it's not at all clear that today's employers and workers can reach a similar bargain and reboot a 21st century version of the working middle class.

That's the group of key officials at the Federal Reserve who together are supposed to make many of the Feds most vital decisions. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This week's meeting is the first of the year and the last to be run by Ben Bernanke. As the Fed chairman departs, the Fed is widely expected to do more than just say goodbye. It's expected to continue scaling back its bond-buying program. INSKEEP: That program has been a key part of the Central Bank's efforts to spur economic growth since the financial crisis. Maybe the story getting the most attention, though, is that by the end of this week there will be a new leader at the Fed. In five days, Janet Yellen takes over. She is the first woman ever to lead the nation's central bank. So let's look at Ben Bernanke's legacy as he goes away. NPR's John Ydstie has a first draft. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There's no doubt that during his two terms as Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke faced a challenge unlike any Fed chairman since the Great Depression: a global financial crisis that threatened to become financial Armageddon, followed by a deep recession. Bernanke talked about how he survived it all during an appearance at the Brookings Institution recently. BEN BERNANKE: I was so absorbed in what was happening and trying to find response to it that I wasn't really in that kind of reflective mode.  I mean later on, you know, it's kind of like, you know, if you're in car wreck or something, you're mostly involved in trying to avoid going off the bridge and then later on you say, oh my god, you know, but. . . YDSTIE: One of the passengers in that careening car has strong views on how well Bernanke did his job. HENRY PAULSON: Wow. You know, he's - I think he's going to go down as one of the greatest Fed chairmen of all times. YDSTIE: That's former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who worked arm-in-arm with Bernanke to keep the financial system from total collapse. PAULSON: He made tough, courageous, sometimes unpopular decisions, which I think were necessary to avoid economic catastrophe and prevent a second Great Depression. YDSTIE: And Bernanke's decisions were also extremely creative, says Harvard economist Ken Rogoff. KEN ROGOFF: I remember waking up the morning that they had turned the investment banks into ordinary banks so they could lend them money and think, Am I living in an alternate universe? This is crazy that places like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which do these fancy operations, we're going to call them banks. But it was a very creative way to try to prevent a complete implosion in the system. And they did these things with saving the money market fund. They're not supposed to back the money market funds. They did, and it - I think it helped save the system. YDSTIE: Rogoff, who has studied and written about the aftermath of financial crises, says a hundred years from now economists may still be marveling at what the Bernanke Fed did. There are some critics of Bernanke's decisions during the crisis. Vincent Reinhart, a top staff member at the Fed under both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, says the popular but in his eyes mistaken version of events is that the global financial system was hit by a perfect storm and the Fed came to the rescue. VINCENT REINHART: And the vision then we have is Ben Bernanke in the yellow slicker, fighting the elements to keep the ship of the economy afloat. I think that's the wrong metaphor, because policy actions influenced the course of the storm. YDSTIE: And, Reinhart says, actually made the financial crisis worse. Specifically, Reinhart has argued that Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Paulson and Timothy Geithner, then the president of the New York Fed, made a big mistake when they decided that the government should aid in the rescue of the Wall Street bank Bear Stearns back in March of 2008. REINHART: Policymakers didn't seem to explore enough alternatives before they arrived at the conclusion that they should lend to an investment bank for the first time in 60 years. YDSTIE: Reinhart says that set up the panic of September of 2008, when the government failed to rescue another big investment bank, Lehman Brothers. Alan Blinder, a former vice-chairman of the Fed and colleague of Bernanke's at Princeton, thinks he was a terrific chairman, but Blinder doesn't give him a perfect grade. ALAN BLINDER: Oh, I have to give him an A-minus, and the minus is the Lehman Brothers. YDSTIE: Bernanke responded to the criticism over the Lehman's collapse in an interview on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in March of 2009. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")BERNANKE: There were many people who said, Let 'em fail. You know, it's not a problem. The markets will take care of it. And I think I knew better than that. And Lehman proved that you cannot let a large, internationally active firm fail in the middle of a financial crisis. Now, was it a mistake? It wasn't a mistake for the following reason: We didn't have the option, we didn't have the tools. YDSTIE: The legal tools, that is. Blinder says the legal argument was that the Fed couldn't lend to Lehman to prop it up because the bank didn't have enough solid collateral. BLINDER: And therefore it was illegal for the Fed to extend credit to Lehman Brothers, as it had six months earlier to Bear Stearns. YDSTIE: Blinder thinks the Fed could have found a way around the legal obstacles, given the immense stakes. After the financial crisis subsided, the Bernanke Fed also took extraordinary action to try to stimulate growth, including pumping money into the financial system by purchasing $85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The aim was to reduce long-term interest rates. Critics warned it could lead to financial bubbles. And indeed many analysts believe it helped fuel a run-up in the stock market. That, along with the rescue of Wall Street banks, has led to charges that Bernanke's Fed cared more about Wall Street than Main Street and hard hit homeowners. Bernanke rejected that assessment during his recent Brookings appearance. BERNANKE: There certainly has been pushback. We hope that as the economy improves, and as we tell our story and as more information comes out about, you know, why we did what we did and so on that people will appreciate and understand that what we did was necessary, that it was in the interest of the broader public. It was aimed at helping the average American. YDSTIE: Telling the Fed's story more successfully and better communicating its policies was a goal for Bernanke when he took over the chairmanship in 2006, even before the financial crisis. He has made great strides at that, including instituting regular news conferences to help explain Fed policy decisions. Here he is at the first every news conference by a Fed chairman in April of 2011. BERNANKE: I personally have always been a big believer in providing as much information as you can to help the public understand what you're doing, to help the markets understand what you're doing, and to be accountable to the public for what you're doing. YDSTIE: Former Treasury Secretary Paulson says given the extraordinary circumstances he faced, Bernanke has left a remarkable legacy. PAULSON: And I think very importantly, he's leaving the Fed with its independence and credibility intact, and that's no small accomplishment given the extraordinary things both he and the Fed were forced to do. YDSTIE: On Friday, Ben Bernanke will step down from what many view as the second most powerful job in America and become a private citizen again. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week. That's the group of key officials at the Federal Reserve who together are supposed to make many of the Feds most vital decisions. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  This week's meeting is the first of the year and the last to be run by Ben Bernanke. As the Fed chairman departs, the Fed is widely expected to do more than just say goodbye. It's expected to continue scaling back its bond-buying program. INSKEEP: That program has been a key part of the Central Bank's efforts to spur economic growth since the financial crisis. Maybe the story getting the most attention, though, is that by the end of this week there will be a new leader at the Fed. In five days, Janet Yellen takes over. She is the first woman ever to lead the nation's central bank. So let's look at Ben Bernanke's legacy as he goes away. NPR's John Ydstie has a first draft. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There's no doubt that during his two terms as Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke faced a challenge unlike any Fed chairman since the Great Depression: a global financial crisis that threatened to become financial Armageddon, followed by a deep recession. Bernanke talked about how he survived it all during an appearance at the Brookings Institution recently. BEN BERNANKE: I was so absorbed in what was happening and trying to find response to it that I wasn't really in that kind of reflective mode.  I mean later on, you know, it's kind of like, you know, if you're in car wreck or something, you're mostly involved in trying to avoid going off the bridge and then later on you say, oh my god, you know, but. . . YDSTIE: One of the passengers in that careening car has strong views on how well Bernanke did his job. HENRY PAULSON: Wow. You know, he's - I think he's going to go down as one of the greatest Fed chairmen of all times. YDSTIE: That's former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who worked arm-in-arm with Bernanke to keep the financial system from total collapse. PAULSON: He made tough, courageous, sometimes unpopular decisions, which I think were necessary to avoid economic catastrophe and prevent a second Great Depression. YDSTIE: And Bernanke's decisions were also extremely creative, says Harvard economist Ken Rogoff. KEN ROGOFF: I remember waking up the morning that they had turned the investment banks into ordinary banks so they could lend them money and think, Am I living in an alternate universe? This is crazy that places like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which do these fancy operations, we're going to call them banks. But it was a very creative way to try to prevent a complete implosion in the system. And they did these things with saving the money market fund. They're not supposed to back the money market funds. They did, and it - I think it helped save the system. YDSTIE: Rogoff, who has studied and written about the aftermath of financial crises, says a hundred years from now economists may still be marveling at what the Bernanke Fed did. There are some critics of Bernanke's decisions during the crisis. Vincent Reinhart, a top staff member at the Fed under both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, says the popular but in his eyes mistaken version of events is that the global financial system was hit by a perfect storm and the Fed came to the rescue.

Investor anxiety about the state of the world's currency markets seemed to ease. The current turmoil is reminiscent of the 1997 currency crisis in Asia, which hurt economies all over the world. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, there are also some big differences. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: This crisis got underway when Argentina decided to devalue its peso earlier this month. But soon, doubts were being raised about just how safe it was to invest in emerging markets in general. DR. JERRY WEBMAN: Buying the bonds of a sovereign country is like, you know, making a loan to your neighbor. You're constantly evaluating whether you think he or she is going to be able to pay you back. ZARROLI: Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds says that as doubts have spread, people have been pulling their money out of countries like Turkey and Ukraine, driving down the value of their currency. WEBMAN: We've recognized that there are some of these emerging economies that face some serious problems, more serious than we thought they were. ZARROLI: On the surface, this downturn brings to mind the infamous Asian currency crisis of 1997. For years before that crisis, investors had been pouring money into Asian countries. Then, for reasons that are still being debated, the flow of money stopped, and countries all over the region, starting with Thailand, saw their currencies plummet. The International Monetary Fund tried to come to the rescue, but the damage had been done and growth slowed sharply throughout emerging markets. Could the same thing happen again? Economist Nariman Behravesh of IHS doesn't think so. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: While there are some similarities, I think we're not going to go through quite the crisis that we did in that '97, '98 period. ZARROLI: Behravesh says, for one thing, there aren't the huge levels of debt in the emerging markets that there were in 1997. And countries tend to have more currency reserves on hand. And there's another difference, he says. BEHRAVESH: In those days, before the Asia crisis, exchange rates were largely fixed, and that created big problems for these countries. ZARROLI: Behravesh says that in the 1990s, countries like Thailand and Russia pegged their currencies to the dollar. That meant that when the crisis happened, they had to spend a lot of money propping them up. Behravesh says most countries now let their currencies float on the open market. That can cause problems, too, among other things that makes imports like oil a lot more expensive. But countries no longer have to exhaust their reserves in a vain attempt to save their currencies. Hung Tran of the Institute of International Finance says there are countries with real problems out there. Some emerging markets have saddled themselves with too much debt and bad loans. HUNG TRAN: Those issues need to be dealt with very clearly, very firmly, so that investors have a feeling that the country is really under good management and on the road of recovery. ZARROLI: That may be why the countries that have suffered the most in the current downturn are politically turbulent places, like Turkey and Ukraine, and countries with a history of mismanagement like Argentina. But many other emerging markets have made important changes since 1997, and that could make this crisis end a lot differently than the other one. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)INSKEEP: President Obama has dropped a few hints that one of the themes of his State of the Union address tonight will be the growing gap between the rich and the poor. He recently called economic mobility and inequality the defining challenge of our times. So is it? Harvard researchers have been examining this question, including a co-author of a study, Nathan Hendren. So, when you looked at social mobility, ability for people to rise from one class to another, what did you find? NATHAN HENDREN: Right. So we found that if you explore the patterns of nobility over time, there hasn't actually been a whole lot of change in the United States. So the way to think about it is people are climbing up and down the ladder at the same rates as ever before, but because income equality has increased, the difference in outcomes to rich versus poor kids has increased. INSKEEP: Let's talk a little bit more about this and bring another voice into the conversation. David Wessel is a regular guest on this program. He is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: Should I be bothered by this finding, that mobility is not getting any worse but still, there's a far greater gap between rich and poor than there used to be? WESSEL: I think you should. One of the contributions this study has made is to destroy a myth that is widespread in Washington, that it's harder for kids to rise out of poverty into the middle class. INSKEEP: Mm-hmm. WESSEL: But the consequences of losing what they call the birth lottery are greater. And they also point out that it was and is harder to rise from poverty to the middle class or from middle class to wealth than it is in other countries. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Other countries, you're saying that France, England, Germany, wherever we're talking about, it's easier there to ride from poverty or to rise from the middle class to wealth? WESSEL: Correct. The notion that America is a special place where any kid can grow up to be president is very important to the American psyche, but when you look at the data, it's harder to rise from the bottom to the middle or from the middle to the top in the U. S. than in other rich countries around the world. INSKEEP: Nathan Hendren, you say things have not really changed that much in terms of social mobility in the United States. Are we falling behind? Are other countries getting any better at this? HENDREN: Yeah. I think, you know, just to put some statistics on what David was saying, kids born to the bottom fifth of the income distribution in the United States have about an 8 percent chance of reaching the top fifth when they grow up. If you make comparisons to other countries, that actually ranks about as low as it gets amongst developed countries. In Denmark, that same statistic is 16 percent. So 16 percent of their kids born in the bottom fifth of the income distribution reach the top fifth. INSKEEP: I'd like to know this is completely different than the America you grew up thinking you were growing up in, Nathan Hendren, because it's different than what I learned when I was a kid. HENDREN: Absolutely. You know, I grew up thinking that the United States is a place where people have greater opportunities. And what I interpreted that to mean was that people who were born into poverty had a higher chance of reaching the top regions of the income distribution. And I think what's really surprising throughout this study is the extent to which that's not true when you make comparisons relative to other countries. INSKEEP: David Wessel, what are Republicans and Democrats saying and thinking about when it comes to inequality and mobility? WESSEL: Well, there is a substantial amount of agreement. Republicans Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan and Chuck Schumer - Democratic senator - and Barack Obama, all agree that they would like to do things to make social mobility greater, to make it easier for people to climb from the bottom and the middle to the top. They disagree on what to do about it. Oversimplifying only a little, the Republicans think the government ought to step back and people ought to do more for themselves. And the president is likely to emphasize both the responsibility of parents - which is something he talks about quite a bit, but also what the government can do to increase the chances that poor kids can make it to the middle class. Better pre-K, better access to college, removing the barriers to people getting jobs, particularly those who have been out of work for a long time. All those things that the government can do to speed up the escalator of mobility. INSKEEP: What do you think is beyond the government's control here? WESSEL: I think that there's evidence that parents matter, and being born to parents who are married, who haven't been to jail, who read to you, who make sure you go to school, who help you avoid getting pregnant as a teenager, who keep you out of jail, those kids are more likely to make it. The government can do things to encourage good parenting, but I think even among liberals there's agreement now that parents have a responsibility to their kids and that some parents are failing in their duty. INSKEEP: When we talk about things the government can do - and Nathan Hendren -having done this study, what would you recommend? HENDREN: Well, you know, I think that's the hardest question. I think there's a lot of good evidence out there that suggests the quality of schools matters a lot and areas that have a higher fraction of their kids in public schools tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. INSKEEP: Meaning that when more students are attracted to the public school system it's a sign the public school system is pretty good and is doing very well for a wide range of students. HENDREN: Yeah, that's the basic idea. Now, you know, that's not a story for or against, say, a voucher program or other programs that could improve the quality of access to a good education, but I think it suggests, and is consistent with a large range of other studies, that suggest that the quality of the schooling system and the schools that people go to matters a lot for improving upward mobility. INSKEEP: So are different parts of the country more mobile than other parts? HENDREN: Absolutely. So if you look across the United States, that 8 percent statistic I was talking about before - the fraction of kids going from the bottom fifth to the top fifth - that varies from about 4 to 5 percent in places like Charlotte and Atlanta, up to about 12 percent in places like Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Dubuque, Iowa. These places are much more mobile. So it varies by a factor of three, the extent to which kids are rising out of poverty across areas. INSKEEP: David Wessel of the Brookings Institution and The Wall Street Journal, thanks to you. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: And also, thanks to Nathan Hendren, an assistant professor of economics at Harvard and co-author of a study on social mobility. Thanks to you. HENDREN: Thanks a lot. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   NPR's business news starts with income inequality. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: President Obama has dropped a few hints that one of the themes of his State of the Union address tonight will be the growing gap between the rich and the poor. He recently called economic mobility and inequality the defining challenge of our times. So is it? Harvard researchers have been examining this question, including a co-author of a study, Nathan Hendren. So, when you looked at social mobility, ability for people to rise from one class to another, what did you find? NATHAN HENDREN: Right. So we found that if you explore the patterns of nobility over time, there hasn't actually been a whole lot of change in the United States. So the way to think about it is people are climbing up and down the ladder at the same rates as ever before, but because income equality has increased, the difference in outcomes to rich versus poor kids has increased. INSKEEP: Let's talk a little bit more about this and bring another voice into the conversation. David Wessel is a regular guest on this program. He is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: Should I be bothered by this finding, that mobility is not getting any worse but still, there's a far greater gap between rich and poor than there used to be? WESSEL: I think you should. One of the contributions this study has made is to destroy a myth that is widespread in Washington, that it's harder for kids to rise out of poverty into the middle class. INSKEEP: Mm-hmm. WESSEL: But the consequences of losing what they call the birth lottery are greater. And they also point out that it was and is harder to rise from poverty to the middle class or from middle class to wealth than it is in other countries. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. Other countries, you're saying that France, England, Germany, wherever we're talking about, it's easier there to ride from poverty or to rise from the middle class to wealth? WESSEL: Correct. The notion that America is a special place where any kid can grow up to be president is very important to the American psyche, but when you look at the data, it's harder to rise from the bottom to the middle or from the middle to the top in the U. S. than in other rich countries around the world. INSKEEP: Nathan Hendren, you say things have not really changed that much in terms of social mobility in the United States. Are we falling behind? Are other countries getting any better at this? HENDREN: Yeah. I think, you know, just to put some statistics on what David was saying, kids born to the bottom fifth of the income distribution in the United States have about an 8 percent chance of reaching the top fifth when they grow up. If you make comparisons to other countries, that actually ranks about as low as it gets amongst developed countries. In Denmark, that same statistic is 16 percent. So 16 percent of their kids born in the bottom fifth of the income distribution reach the top fifth. INSKEEP: I'd like to know this is completely different than the America you grew up thinking you were growing up in, Nathan Hendren, because it's different than what I learned when I was a kid. HENDREN: Absolutely. You know, I grew up thinking that the United States is a place where people have greater opportunities. And what I interpreted that to mean was that people who were born into poverty had a higher chance of reaching the top regions of the income distribution. And I think what's really surprising throughout this study is the extent to which that's not true when you make comparisons relative to other countries. INSKEEP: David Wessel, what are Republicans and Democrats saying and thinking about when it comes to inequality and mobility? WESSEL: Well, there is a substantial amount of agreement. Republicans Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan and Chuck Schumer - Democratic senator - and Barack Obama, all agree that they would like to do things to make social mobility greater, to make it easier for people to climb from the bottom and the middle to the top. They disagree on what to do about it. Oversimplifying only a little, the Republicans think the government ought to step back and people ought to do more for themselves. And the president is likely to emphasize both the responsibility of parents - which is something he talks about quite a bit, but also what the government can do to increase the chances that poor kids can make it to the middle class. Better pre-K, better access to college, removing the barriers to people getting jobs, particularly those who have been out of work for a long time. All those things that the government can do to speed up the escalator of mobility. INSKEEP: What do you think is beyond the government's control here? WESSEL: I think that there's evidence that parents matter, and being born to parents who are married, who haven't been to jail, who read to you, who make sure you go to school, who help you avoid getting pregnant as a teenager, who keep you out of jail, those kids are more likely to make it. The government can do things to encourage good parenting, but I think even among liberals there's agreement now that parents have a responsibility to their kids and that some parents are failing in their duty. INSKEEP: When we talk about things the government can do - and Nathan Hendren -having done this study, what would you recommend? HENDREN: Well, you know, I think that's the hardest question. I think there's a lot of good evidence out there that suggests the quality of schools matters a lot and areas that have a higher fraction of their kids in public schools tend to have higher rates of upward mobility. INSKEEP: Meaning that when more students are attracted to the public school system it's a sign the public school system is pretty good and is doing very well for a wide range of students. HENDREN: Yeah, that's the basic idea. Now, you know, that's not a story for or against, say, a voucher program or other programs that could improve the quality of access to a good education, but I think it suggests, and is consistent with a large range of other studies, that suggest that the quality of the schooling system and the schools that people go to matters a lot for improving upward mobility. INSKEEP: So are different parts of the country more mobile than other parts? HENDREN: Absolutely. So if you look across the United States, that 8 percent statistic I was talking about before - the fraction of kids going from the bottom fifth to the top fifth - that varies from about 4 to 5 percent in places like Charlotte and Atlanta, up to about 12 percent in places like Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Dubuque, Iowa.

Clearly, it's a subject that he is determined to get the country talking about and talking about in a different way; more broadening of opportunity, less talk of raising taxes on the rich. Here's part of what he said last night. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher and those at the top have never done better, but average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. SIEGEL: Well, joining us now are two economists with very different approaches to economic problems. Paul Krugman is liberal, a columnist for the New York Times and a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University. Welcome to the program. PAUL KRUGMAN: Hi there. SIEGEL: And Douglas Holtz-Eakin is president of the American Action Forum, which he describes as a center-right policy institute. Holtz-Eakin is former chief economist of the president's Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush. Good to see you again. DOUG HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: Let's start with the facts here. And Paul Krugman, let's begin. Has inequality in America, whether over the past four years as the president said or over a longer period, has it deepened and didn't a Harvard study just say that social mobility, in fact, hasn't changed all that much? KRUGMAN: Those are different questions. So they basically - the Harvard study said that your chance of moving from, you know, middle class to upper middle class or whatever hasn't changed, at least as far as I can tell, statistically, significantly. But the gap between those classes has widened enormously. I just had my favorite statistic of this morning. The top 40 hedge fund managers in America earned as much as 300,000 schoolteachers in 2012. So that gives you an idea of how unequal a society we've become. SIEGEL: Doug Holtz-Eakin, do you agree with that description of what's happened to the economy and wealth? HOLTZ-EAKIN: Yeah. The facts, I think, are pretty clear now and one of the things that I thought was nice about the president's remarks last night is he took the time to point out that this has been going on for decades. You know, three decades at least and these are deep economic forces that are driving the widening wage gaps. SIEGEL: So we have some agreement on what the facts are, to begin with. KRUGMAN: Yeah, which actually, by the way, I mean, the substantial part of Washington does not agree on these facts so I'm glad that Doug and I are - we're in the same universe of reality. That's good to note. SIEGEL: But to what degree is economic equality desirable? I think most of us would like to feel that people who work harder should make more than people who don't work hard, and education is virtually marketed as an increase-your-wealth scheme in our country, that you should be rewarded more for acquiring very useful skills. To what extent should there be some degree of economic inequality? KRUGMAN: Well, for sure, there are no Cuban Communists in American political life, right? Nobody thinks that we should be a society without monetary incentives. No one thinks that we should have exact equality or even anything close to that. The point, however, is that our notion of what kind of society we should be, I think, is something like the kind of society we actually were 30, 40 years ago where we had a broad middleclass, where the gap between people at the top and the average or the median American was not that large. When it gets this extreme, a couple things happen. There's a disconnect. You know, we've had several decades when productivity of workers had been rising, but the wages of the typical worker really barely have. We have a feeling that socially we're ceasing to be an integrated society. This is not the kind of country we want to be and so it is a problem when inequality gets to this extreme. SIEGEL: Well, Doug Holtz-Eakin, one solution, raise marginal tax rates sharply so that people, at some point, start giving back into the public domain and money is redistributed. HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think that's going to be the answer. I mean, we already have the wealthy paying the vast majority of the taxes and you could raise marginal taxes more, but at some point, you have to recognize that the forces dwarf any of these tiny policies, for instance, like tax rates or minimum wages and go back to what the president was actually quite careful about in the speech he gave a while back on - when he defined this as the compelling issue of our time. He talked about opportunity and social mobility and not just inequality. And I think that's the key. We know that the dividing line between being poor and non-poor in the United States is having a job. We've had poor job performance recently. And we also know that the dividing line between success in the labor market once you have a job and less success is skills and education. We need to really focus on and get serious about that, not just talk about it. SIEGEL: What about that, Paul? What about all this focus on the bottom of the scale and not so much at the top? KRUGMAN: No, I think both matter. There is still a substantial amount of money at the top and you don't want to punish the rich. But there is money there and it can be used to help people in need. It can be used for a stronger social safety net. And I will say I think Doug is exactly wrong here, about saying that taxes and government policies that do some, you know, shuffling of income around can't make a big difference. On the contrary, the one thing that we actually know works to limit inequality is exactly taxing and strengthening the social safety net. SIEGEL: Doug Holtz-Eakin? HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, I think it has worked in the U. S. , and one of the frustrations I think many people who look at these data carefully suffer from is that the usual measures of poverty exclude most of the social safety net. They don't count the transfers that we give to the low-income Americans to try to support them in their need. And so, if you look at more broad measures of income that include food stamps and the kinds of support programs we have, you don't get near the same pictures you do by just looking at money income earned in markets. And so, our safety net does need to be strengthened because it's under a huge financial stress: Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, all have financial problems that need to be fixed. But it's not that it's failed to address the problem. SIEGEL: Just like to hear from both of you what you make of the current level of discussion in Washington about income or wealth inequality, whichever. Paul Ryan, the vice presidential candidate last time out, gave a speech about it. There seems to be some consensus now that this is a problem - some degree of consensus. On the other hand, the solutions are the same solutions that we've heard in the past. The Democratic solutions tend to be to support social programs more and Republican solution is to cut taxes and have people create more jobs. What do you make of this discussion, Paul Krugman first? KRUGMAN: Oh, it's a pretty pathetic discussion. Objectively, Paul Ryan's policies are anti-poor. His policies are all about slashing the social safety net and cutting taxes on the rich. But he's decided, I think this is maybe significant, that his rhetoric has to be: But I really care about the poor and this is going to help them. Democrats I think are actually - they're saying the kinds of things Democrats have already said but they're actually saying them with a little bit more conviction now. In some ways, Democrats have recaptured their mojo. They're no longer ashamed of standing up for New Deal-type liberalism. SIEGEL: Doug Holtz-Eakin, what do you make of the discourse over this? HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the most significant change is the agreement on the facts that opportunity in the United States is not what it once was; that there are significant challenges that have to be addressed. That's no longer a one-party discussion. You're hearing it from both sides. In terms of policy proposals, I don't think there's been a tremendous (unintelligible) new approach on either side. I, at least, was pleased to hear the president talk last night about expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to single parents who aren't custodians of children. That's the biggest gap in what has been one of the most successful anti-poverty tools we have. SIEGEL: This is in effect a negative income tax. . . HOLTZ-EAKIN: Yeah, and it's worked. SIEGEL: . . . for people below a certain level get money back. HOLTZ-EAKIN: It's worked for everyone else quite well. If you want to be serious about tax reform, and you want to be serious about the kinds of things that Republicans want to accomplish, I think that should be in the mix. KRUGMAN: This is something where you are, in fact, hearing Republicans say some good things about. And this was originally a very bipartisan policy. On the other hand, question: Can we actually do this extension of the EITC to help people who do not have children with new money, or are we just going to rob Peter to pay Paul? Are we going to take away from the people who are now benefiting to give to some other group of people? And that. . . SIEGEL: You mean if you cut food stamps in order to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit. KRUGMAN: Well, or actually even just reallocate, reduce the rates of payment for parents of children. And that's, right now, everything we've really heard from the Republican side is, is basically no new money. And that means that we're not anywhere close to a consensus on what we should actually do. SIEGEL: Do you think part of what's happened here is that we're seeing the economy recover from the Great Recession and people are saying: Oh my, this is what normal could be and it's not just that we were laid low by the collapse? HOLTZ-EAKIN: It's not what we call recover. I mean but, you know, if you measure the recovery by corporate profits or measure recovery by GDP or the kinds of things we look at, yeah, there's been a recovery. If you just looked at the labor market there's no recovery. SIEGEL: We haven't recovered yet. HOLTZ-EAKIN: We have a smaller fraction of people working today than we did before the recession. It's not a recovery yet. And the pain is real and you're seeing people say this pain has got to be changed. Now there's got to be a debate about how to fix it, but the pain is real. KRUGMAN: In fact, I think it's almost exactly the opposite. I think what's actually happened is that the social safety net has better support among the general public because more people realize that it might be something that matters for them. In a peculiar way, the persistence of a weak economy has made it more possible to do things that will in the end alleviate inequality. SIEGEL: Paul Krugman of The New York Times and Princeton and Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum, thanks to both of you. KRUGMAN: Thank you. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.

The new chair, Janet Yellen, will take over on Saturday. After a two-day meeting, the message today from Fed policymakers was simple: Stay the course. The Fed released a statement saying it will continue dialing-back its stimulus. NPR's John Ydstie has more on that decision and Bernanke's legacy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Fed policymakers said they will reduce their monthly stimulus by another $10 billion. And they justified the move by noting that the economy is growing moderately and the job market is improving. But they indicated again that they'll keep short-term interest rates near zero, at least until the unemployment rate falls below six and a half percent. It was Ben Bernanke's final meeting as chairman, and in assessing his legacy, it's useful to divide his tumultuous tenure into three periods, starting with the pre-crisis days of 2006 and 2007. During that period, the Bernanke Fed took a hands-off approach, says Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder. ALAN BLINDER: The Fed basically did nothing in the early Bernanke days, just as it has done nothing in the Greenspan days, to curtail the crazy mortgage lending that was going on all over the country. YDSTIE: And it was slow to reduce interest rates as the housing bubble burst. But, says Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, in the second act, Bernanke's response was masterful, as the financial system melted down in 2008. KEN ROGOFF: Overwhelmingly, Ben Bernanke's most importance contribution is he steered us through the depths of the financial crisis, when it could have been really awful. It was bad but we could have experienced the Second Great Depression. There's no doubt about it. YDSTIE: Rogoff says the creative ways Bernanke saved Wall Street banks, money market funds, and the commercial paper market that provides critical daily funding for U. S. companies, will be studied by economists for 100 years. Blinder agrees Bernanke was very skillful during the crisis, with one exception. He says the Fed chairman should have done more to keep the big Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers from failing. Bernanke has been countering that criticism since Lehman's collapse, including in this \"60 Minutes\" interview from back in March of 2009. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO)YDSTIE: Bernanke said the Fed could only lend to firms that put up solid collateral and Lehman didn't have enough. The Bernanke Fed's policies ultimately stabilized the financial system, but getting the basic economy back to normal remains a challenge. The Fed has tried to help stimulate the economy with its quantitative easing aimed at lowering long-term interest rates. Rogoff says the jury is still out on how successful that's been. ROGOFF: You can certainly debate the quantitative easing. I mean I'm sort of the school they actually should have done more. YDSTIE: Others say the Fed's stimulus efforts are dangerous and could produce financial bubbles and inflation. Bernanke responds that the policy has lowered interest rates and helped the housing and auto sectors recover. Meanwhile, inflation remains historically low and Bernanke says he doesn't see any bubbles developing. In a public appearance recently at the Brookings Institution, Bernanke said his goal was to help Main Street, not Wall Street. : We hope that as the economy improves, and as we tell our story, that people will appreciate and understand that what we did was necessary; that it was in the interest of the broader public. It was aimed at helping the average American. YDSTIE: Given the challenges that Bernanke faced and the extraordinary policies he employed, it's likely his legacy will remain a topic of debate for years to come. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Ben Bernanke steps down this week as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The new chair, Janet Yellen, will take over on Saturday. After a two-day meeting, the message today from Fed policymakers was simple: Stay the course. The Fed released a statement saying it will continue dialing-back its stimulus. NPR's John Ydstie has more on that decision and Bernanke's legacy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Fed policymakers said they will reduce their monthly stimulus by another $10 billion. And they justified the move by noting that the economy is growing moderately and the job market is improving. But they indicated again that they'll keep short-term interest rates near zero, at least until the unemployment rate falls below six and a half percent. It was Ben Bernanke's final meeting as chairman, and in assessing his legacy, it's useful to divide his tumultuous tenure into three periods, starting with the pre-crisis days of 2006 and 2007.

The state sits atop one of the world's largest oil deposits. The industry employs some 60,000 workers there, and every day people flock to the Williston Basin, as it's known, looking for work. The boom is also causing growing pains. Long time residents hardly recognize their own home towns. NPR's Kirk Siegler has the first story in our series on the Great Plains oil rush. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Jennifer Brown is watching the snowy plains of northern Montana pass by outside the frosty windows of the Amtrak empire builder. On a Sunday at dusk, this eastbound train is jam-packed. People are heading to their jobs in North Dakota towns like Minot, Williston and Watford City. Brown is moving there from Idaho to join her husband, who's been working in the oil fields since the summer. JENNIFER BROWN: I haven't seen him in two months. SIEGLER: Are you kidding? BROWN: No. It's been really hard. SIEGLER: The Browns ran a logging truck business in northern Idaho, but work was hard to come by. And out here they've heard you can make a hundred grand or more just starting out in the oil fields. Jennifer Brown says they had no other choice. BROWN: So we've been financially living paycheck to paycheck. We've been married for 20 years, living paycheck to paycheck in that area. So we're going to try something different and basically start all over. SIEGLER: Start all over in this remote corner of Northwestern North Dakota. Just a few years ago that would've been laughable. A hundred grand in wages out here? Believe it. And more and more people like Jennifer Brown are moving here every day. This frozen frontier now boasts the nation's lowest unemployment rate. Help wanted signs are everywhere - in the oil fields, the hotels and restaurants that support them, in construction, hospitals, you name it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible) station stop, Williston, North Dakota, will be coming up in about 10 to 12 minutes. SIEGLER: At the heart of it all is the rough-and-tumble boomtown of Williston. The first thing you see leaving the Amtrak station are two strip clubs, Heartbreakers and Whispers, that cater to the wave of men coming into town from the oil fields, their pockets stuffed with cash. Oil workers with the smell of diesel still fresh on their Carhartt overalls also pack watering holes further up the street, downing Buds and burgers after work. Every gas station here has a special on 5-Hour Energy. The local Wal-Mart can't keep its shelves fully stocked. Forty miles to the south, in the once-sleepy farming hamlet of Watford City, a line of trucks clogs snowy Main Street. New hotels, grocery stores and man camps - that's oil-field slang for cheap temp housing - sprout up on the prairie overnight. The 2010 census counted 1,500 people here; today there are an estimated 10,000. A fivefold increase in just over three years. ALICIA DEEDEE: The example I always give people of how it's changed, my little sister and I used to be able to walk all over town. Our parents didn't worry. And I have a daughter of my own, and my husband and I won't let her outside by herself anymore. SIEGLER: From behind the cash register at Larson's Drug, Alicia Deedee says a lot of these changes are bittersweet. While she welcomes the money, she doesn't like all the trucks and the big city traffic and the crime that's come with the boom. DEEDEE: At the same time I'm thankful, you know, we have good jobs and we have jobs. A lot of people in the country don't. SIEGLER: The boom brings money to local coffers while straining infrastructure. Town leaders say they only have enough water to sustain about 7,000 people. Good luck finding a one-bedroom apartment for less than 1,500 a month. And then there's the crime. JESSE WELLEN: Hi. I apologize for being so late. . . SIEGLER: Watford City's police chief Jesse Wellen offers me a seat in his cramped 28 by 28 foot station. His force has also grown fivefold. There are now 10 officers sharing these four desks, but they're usually out on patrol or calls. WELLEN: Our domestic violence calls have definitely increased; alcohol-related calls have drastically increased as well. We seem to go to quite a few assaults. SIEGLER: Wellen says they responded to an unprecedented 18 domestic violence calls in December alone, and his officers are arresting about one person a day now for drunk driving. These are stats nobody in a town of 10,000 people can be proud of. WELLEN: It's basically call to call, I mean instead of kind of a proactive, going out there and trying to get stuff, you're jumping from call to call all the time, crashes and, you know, bar fights. SIEGLER: Chief Wellen, who's 28 and new here, got some help from the state lately and will be able to hire four more officers. Watford City has seen oil booms before, most recently in the 1980s. That boom ended in a bust, and those memories are still fresh for some people here. Still, you get the sense that this boom may be different. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Ready? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: We're ready to rock and roll. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Okay. Here we go. . . SIEGLER: Steve Holen is counting on that, because he has to plan for it. He's the superintendent of the local school district. STEVE HOLEN: We know we are probably in about the second or third inning of a nine-inning game here. Our demographic studies say they'll expect about 1,600 kids by 2017, '18. SIEGLER: Holen is watching a line of kindergartners bundling up in their snow pants, face masks and hats, as school is about to let out. Since 2010, enrollment here has more than doubled to 1,000 kids. HOLEN: And even just today is a good example. We probably picked up another 15 kids today after the post-Christmas little push. SIEGLER: Holen plans to ask voters to approve a property tax hike to pay for building a new high school, but he knows that won't be an easy sell. HOLEN: Some of our community members do believe that the industry, the state, somebody else should be paying for this. It shouldn't be me. And so getting a bond passed in that environment can be a real challenge. SIEGLER: And even if the school bond passes, there's another challenge weighing heavily on Holen's mind. His district has lately had to get into the real estate business. So far it's bought about 20 housing units, but they need a lot more. After all, how do you recruit teachers to come all the way out here to this boomtown when there's no place to live? Kirk Siegler, NPR News. INSKEEP: The oil rush series continues tonight on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED with a report on the tensions between oil production and the state's largest industry, agriculture.

The space company would like to build a commercial orbital launch site at a remote spot on the state's southern tip. The prospect of a space port has stirred quite a buzz in the border city of Brownsville. As NPR's John Burnett reports, locals wonder if this depressed area will be home to the world's newest aerospace hub. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: This really is the end of the road. Texas Highway 4 abruptly ends at the warm waves of the Gulf surrounded by cactus, Spanish dagger and sand dunes. GILBERTO SALINAS: Welcome to Boca Chica beach, Brownsville, Texas. It's where the United States really begins. BURNETT: Or ends, depending on your perspective. This is Gil Salinas, executive vice president of the Brownsville Economic Development Council. He's spent three years toiling to get SpaceX to build its first launch facility out here, which would include a hangar, fuel storage, payload processing facility, and launch control center. SALINAS: Right there you would have the actual launchpad itself where the rocket would - they would erect it and then off into space it goes. BURNETT: SpaceX has been sending up its rockets at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Cape Canaveral in Florida. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Four, three, two, one, zero. BURNETT: Now they want a place to call their own, and it turns out that this lonely patch of coastal prairie only three miles north of Mexico is a sweet spot for orbital spacecraft launches. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk told South by Southwest in Austin last year that Texas is his leading candidate. ELON MUSK: It makes sense to have a commercial space port. We need to be able to launch eastward, and we want to be close to the equator. BURNETT: Eager to make the deal work, Texas has offered SpaceX a $15 million incentive package, and passed a special law that would close the public beach during launches. The FAA is now in its final fact-finding and public-comment phase to decide whether or not to grant a launch license to Space Exploration Technologies Corp, the formal name for SpaceX. Other federal agencies have weighed in. The National Park Service is concerned that rocket launches will disturb the view of nearby Palmito Ranch Battlefield, the site of the last land battle of the Civil War. And the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service has a wildlife refuge on the fence line of the proposed launch site. Spokesperson Lesli Gray says the tidal flats, thorn scrub and adjacent Gulf waters are home to 10 endangered species. LESLI GRAY: Including the ocelot and the aplomado falcon and Kemp's Ridley sea turtle. We obviously are looking at what the potential impacts are, and we've been working with SpaceX to minimize any impact from the SpaceX facility being there. BURNETT: Fish & Wildlife is concerned that increased noise, traffic, light, storm water runoff will disturb the wild things in the neighborhood. But it concludes SpaceX is \"not likely to threaten their continued existence. \" Other curious species down here that will be affected by the nighttime launches can speak for themselves. JIM WORKMAN: We liked it down here, but now it's going to be a lot busier, a lot more loud, a lot more, you know, congestion. I guess it's something that Texas wants and Brownsville wants, so we'll have to go along with it. BURNETT: Jim Workman is a winter Texan who lives in a village across the road from the SpaceX site. He's a retired truck driver from Minnesota who escapes subzero weather every year here in his little brick house in balmy Bock Chica. His neighbor, Ed Schumann, is also a retired Minnesota trucker and has a different opinion. ED SCHUMANN: I like rockets. I watch them on TV when they shoot off and go to the moon and wherever. That'd be fine with me, I mean, I got nothing against that. That's good. BURNETT: The lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas is known for sprawling citrus orchards, car parts factories across the river in Mexico, and farmworkers living in substandard housing. SpaceX could represent hundreds of good-paying full- and part-time jobs. Again, local business booster Gil Salinas. SALINAS: A project of this magnitude and of this significance is a game changer for - especially for a region like ours. Brownsville, Texas, is one of the poorest regions in the United States. BURNETT: The SpaceX project has raised hopes for young people like Louis Dartez, a 22-year-old physics grad student at the University of Texas, Brownsville. Dartez says growing up in the tip of Texas, ambitious students like him learn a hard lesson. LOUIS DARTEZ: And that's quite simply put as get the heck out of Brownsville. Whatever you do, if you don't leave the first time an opportunity presents itself, you never will. All of this and much more could change with SpaceX having a presence down here.

I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. This week, NPR News is taking a close look at the North Dakota oil rush. The oil boom is also producing a lot of natural gas, but there's a problem with that. North Dakota does not have the pipelines that are necessary to transport all that gas to market. There's also no place to store it. So in many cases drillers are just having to burn it. NPR's Jeff Brady reports. (SOUNDBITE OF FLAMES)JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: I'm in Western North Dakota just south of Watford City. And that sound you hear in the background, that is a huge flame - bright orange, about 15 to 20 feet high. You see flames like this all over the region. And they burn all day and all night. MARCUS STEWART: People are estimating it's about a million dollars a day, just being thrown into the air. BRADY: Marcus Stewart is an analyst with Bentek Energy, where he tracks the amount of gas burned off - or flared - in North Dakota. His latest figures show drillers are burning about 27 percent of the gas they produce. Stewart says while that percentage has been declining, the overall amount of wasted gas is still rising as more oil wells are drilled. STEWART: I mean it's significant just because we don't really see anything like that anywhere else in the country. BRADY: Part of the problem is the industry's focus. As drillers arrive to tap the riches of the Bakken Shale formation under Western North Dakota, they were looking for oil, not natural gas. Now that they found gas, it's taking time and money to build the pipelines and processing plants to use it. Meanwhile, infrastructure for the oil rush needs to be built too. Oil prices are relatively high while natural gas prices are really low. Ron Ness with the North Dakota Petroleum Council says it's commodity prices that determine where companies invest first. RON NESS: Where would your emphasis be if you've got a barrel of oil that's worth $95 and you've got an MCF of gas, because that's usually kind of the ratio, that's worth $4. 25? Which infrastructure would you build first? BRADY: Ness says $6 billion has been spent on new plants and equipment so far but it's not enough to keep up. Oil industry critics suggest a solution: slow down the drilling boom until that infrastructure is in place. Don Morrison heads the Dakota Resource Council. DON MORRISON: The flaring problem wouldn't have been a problem had we had a state government who was going to make sure that oil was developed in a way that didn't impact the people who live here and the land and the water. BRADY: Drilling in North Dakota is regulated by the state's Industrial Commission, made of up Republican Governor Jack Dalrymple, the attorney general and the agriculture commissioner. Critics say Dalrymple is too cozy with the oil industry, but even the governor thinks burning more than a quarter of the natural gas is a problem here. GOVERNOR JACK DALRYMPLE: That's more flaring than we would like and we are working very, very hard to get the percentage of flaring down. BRADY: An industry task force released a plan this week designed to reduce flaring to 10 percent within six years. Now another interest group is weighing in -royalty owners. These are the people who own the rights to the underground oil and gas. When gas is wasted, they lose money. Some of them have filed class action lawsuits against oil companies. NPR contacted four of those companies but all declined interview requests. Sarah Vogel is one of those plaintiffs and also is a former agriculture commissioner in North Dakota. Vogel owns a farm on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. SARAH VOGEL: It is fabulously beautiful and windswept. And we just got electricity last year and running water. (LAUGHTER)BRADY: Vogel says the oil rush has changed her experience. VOGEL: It used to be extraordinarily quiet. And it used to be extraordinarily dark at night. We'd just see the stars. Now at night we see flares. BRADY: Attorney Derrick Braaten is representing Vogel. DERRICK BRAATEN: Essentially the lawsuit is requesting that the royalty owners be paid their royalties on the gas that has been flared. BRADY: Braaten says that could amount to tens of millions of dollars in gas that is now just being wasted amid North Dakota's rush for oil instead. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

Ben Bernanke hands over the reins of the Federal Reserve to Janet Yellen. It's a position that many call the second most powerful in the country. Yellen will be the first woman ever to chair the Fed. NPR's John Ydstie reports on how she's likely to lead. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The world of central banking is largely a man's world. But Janet Yellen has been undeterred by such barriers since she was in high school in Brooklyn. Charlie Saydah, a former classmate, says she was probably the smartest kid in the class. CHARLIE SAYDAH: Clearly smart and she was smart among a lot of smart kids. YDSTIE: But she couldn't attend Stuyvesant, the competitive public school for Brooklyn's best and brightest. SAYDAH: She didn't go because, you know, she was a girl. YDSTIE: And back then, in the early 1960s, Stuyvesant only admitted boys. Saydah, a retired journalist, said that meant girls dominated the regular public schools, like Fort Hamilton High in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. SAYDAH: I graduated 26th out of the class. Everybody ahead of me was a girl. YDSTIE: Janet Yellen graduated first. SAYDAH: I would have expected her to not only succeed but excel in anything she did. YDSTIE: Yellen studied economics at Brown University and got her doctorate at Yale. She was deeply influenced by Professor James Tobin, who had lived through the Depression and impressed upon her the toll inflicted by unemployment and the government's responsibility to fight it. Yellen voiced that concern during a speech before the AFL-CIO about a year ago. JANET YELLEN: These are not just statistics to me. We know that long-term unemployment is devastating to workers and their families. YDSTIE: Yellen certainly knows her way around the Fed. After teaching at Harvard, she went to the Fed as a staff economist back in 1977. She met her husband, Nobel Prize-winning economist George Akerlof, in the Fed cafeteria. After another stint in academia at UC Berkeley, Bill Clinton named Yellen a Federal Reserve Board governor. Brookings economist Alice Rivlin was a vice chair of the Fed during that period. ALICE RIVLIN: She was an extraordinarily effective board member and she's been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. She's been the president of the San Francisco Fed. And for the last several years, she's been vice chair at the Fed. YDSTIE: Another former Fed vice chair, Alan Blinder, now an economist at Princeton, says even Ben Bernanke didn't have a better resume than Yellen. And, Blinder says, she understood the threat of the housing bust early on. ALAN BLINDER: Seeing much earlier than most - I think even a bit earlier than Ben Bernanke - that what was happening in the mortgage market was posing a grave peril to the economy. YDSTIE: But there are those who are concerned that Yellen is a dove on inflation. That is, willing to tolerate more inflation to get the unemployment rate down. Harvard economist Ken Rogoff thinks that's true. KEN ROGOFF: I think it is a fair assessment that she's perhaps even more dovish than Ben Bernanke, more concerned about unemployment, more willing to take some risks on inflation. YDSTIE: Rogoff thinks that's the right position under the current circumstances when inflation is historically low and unemployment is high. But Laurence Meyer, another former Fed governor, says he witnessed Yellen's commitment to keeping inflation low when they were both Fed governors back in the mid-1990s on the Greenspan Fed. Meyer says both he and Yellen were concerned that with the economy strong and the unemployment rate low, there was a growing threat of inflation and that the Fed should raise interest rates to head it off. LAURENCE MEYER: We went to the chairman with that concern. Of course, I'll say that the response was, nice to see you. Have a good day. But the important point was that, at that point, like myself, Janet was concerned about inflation and perhaps more concerned than most other members on the committee. YDSTIE: Right now, with unemployment still high and U. S. growth still slower than desired, Yellen is likely to continue to keep interest rates low for some time. She suggested that at her confirmation hearing late last year. YELLEN: We've made good progress, but we have further to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession. YDSTIE: Given that Yellen worked with Bernanke to develop the Fed's current policies, it's widely expected the transition will be smooth. As the Fed vice chair, Yellen takes over operationally when Bernanke leaves today. She will be officially sworn in as the new Fed leader on Monday morning. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

I'm David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And I'm Steve Inskeep. We travel next to an economic magnet. New oil fields are transforming North Dakota. GREENE: The state has become the second largest oil producing state in the nation. The industry is changing America's energy picture and changing the North Dakota landscape as tiny towns burst in population. INSKEEP: What may be surprising is the way the boom is affecting distant states. The oil money is so attractive that some people who do not move to the oil fields commute there, hundreds of miles. NPR's Kirk Siegler continues our reports on the Great Plains Oil Rush. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Think your commute is bad? Try 580 miles. One way. RORY RICHARDSON: Hi, Kirk, how are you doing? SIEGLER: Good. Door to door, that's how far Rory Richardson travels between his home in western Montana and his job in the oil fields near Williston, North Dakota. Today he's getting off a plane his company now charters to shuttle workers back and forth between here and the Northwest. Clutching a duffel bag and a cooler full of food, Richardson walks out of the one-room Williston Airport and into the biting North Dakota winter. RORY RICHARDSON: Right now it's no fun coming over to North Dakota. SIEGLER: But this is Richardson's new life. RORY RICHARDSON: Probably three-quarters of the people that I know and talk to are kind of the same way, you know, got their family back at home and commute back and forth. SIEGLER: Including at least twenty of the guys he used to work with at the Montana paper mill, before it abruptly shut down four years ago. Richardson decided to go back to school get his business degree. That took two years. He spent another year looking for work. He would either never hear back or they'd call and tell him he was over-qualified. RORY RICHARDSON: There's very little jobs and there all kind of that minimum wage type stuff, you know, eight, 10 dollar an hour jobs. You can't really make it on that, especially one person working. SIEGLER: And with a wife and two year old son to support, he says his family ran out of options. RORY RICHARDSON: I tried to avoid coming over here, best I could. I didn't want to move to North Dakota, I didn't want to come over here working, so to speak, but it's one of the only spots where it's really booming and there is opportunity over here. SIEGLER: Rory Richardson found work here in western North Dakota last summer as a cement operator, putting casings on new oil wells. He has a bed in a man camp on the outskirts of Williston. But with so much drilling going on, it's rare that he even goes back there at night. He works 18 hours straight usually, and sleeps when he can in the back of a giant Kenmore rig that he drives from one drill site to the next. RORY RICHARDSON: It's pretty tough, you know, trying to adjust living in a truck, working on the job site on location, 24 hours a day, for three, four days at a time before you make it back to camp. SIEGLER: His typical shift is two weeks on straight, then a week off. It's really more like five days off after you count the two travel days back and forth, including a three-hour drive to the airport where the chartered plane leaves from. He feels lucky that he can usually fly. RORY RICHARDSON: I had to drive back here a couple weeks ago, and it took me almost 18 hours. They had the interstate shut down out of Livingston. SIEGLER: The Richardsons are neighbors of my parents near Missoula, Montana, next to the Idaho state line. And what's interesting is that three of the four families right around them are in this exact position. One or both of the spouses commutes back and forth to the Bakken oil fields. (SOUNDBITE OF DOGS BARKING)RORY RICHARDSON: Hi, dogs. Hi. SIEGLER: The Richardson's hunting dogs are the first thing to greet you in their muddy driveway in the rain. Rory's wife, Jennifer, is inside their modular home with the couple's two-year-old son, Colton. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: Can you say hi? Colton. SIEGLER: Colton is lying on the living room floor watching cartoons. COLTON: Hello, Mommy. SIEGLER: The wall opposite the TV is crowded with Montana wildlife that Rory shot and had stuffed. There's a Christmas tree in another corner by the window. It's just the two of them here alone over the holidays. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: I'm basically a single parent. I have no help. I'm it. I'm the only person that does all the disciplining, the raising, everything, all the caretaking. He comes home once a month, for a week. It's not - it's not easy, that's for sure. SIEGLER: And when Rory comes home, Jennifer says he's wiped out. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: He comes home and he wants to spend time with his family. He wants to hunt, and he wants to, you know, do fun things. But yet the dishwasher needs to be fixed, and he needs to put a new transmission in my car. SIEGLER: Jennifer Richardson says this long distance commuting arrangement is far from ideal. But life is better now than it has been these past four years. She remembers when Rory and more than 400 others were laid off, just like that, when the last of the three timber mills in this area closed. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: It was crazy 'cause he got off work at like 6:00 in the morning. He jumped in his truck to go out cat hunting with a friend and they were driving around and next thing you know on the radio it says Smurfit Stone was closing their doors. Didn't even tell them at work that he was no longer having a job or nothing. They just fired him right there in his truck, on the radio. SIEGLER: Jenn says emphatically that moving to Williston is not an option. She grew up there. Her family moved there during the last oil boom in the 1980s. And she doesn't like the idea of raising her son Colton there now, with all the crime and other social problems that have come with this latest drilling rush. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: That's not your T-Rex. SIEGLER: Besides, their home, on three pristine Montana acres, their horse, their dogs, their lives are here. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: Yeah, and when his dad's home, it's all about dad. I tell you, Colton doesn't even want me around. He tells me to go work. He goes, Mommy, you work. RORY RICHARDSON: He's excited every time. He'll jump up and down and come running and give you a big hug and holler, Daddy, Daddy. SIEGLER: Back in his truck in North Dakota, Rory says being gone so much is taking its toll on his family, even just six months in. RORY RICHARDSON: Do you try to find a lower paying job back at home or do you move your family over here? And how long is this oil boom going to last? You know, it's a big commitment to come over here and resettle to have something happen in four or five years. SIEGLER: For now, Rory's just hoping he can switch schedules to get two weeks off at a time. The money he's making here is good. Still, after you factor in what it costs to travel back and forth, the extra housing and food, it's basically the same pay as he made back at the Montana Mill. It's a sobering truth of this economy, and one of the only options for a guy like him now is to travel 600 miles one way just to find a comparable job. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

He wants to hunt, and he wants to, you know, do fun things. But yet the dishwasher needs to be fixed, and he needs to put a new transmission in my car. SIEGLER: Jennifer Richardson says this long distance commuting arrangement is far from ideal. But life is better now than it has been these past four years. She remembers when Rory and more than 400 others were laid off, just like that, when the last of the three timber mills in this area closed. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: It was crazy 'cause he got off work at like 6:00 in the morning. He jumped in his truck to go out cat hunting with a friend and they were driving around and next thing you know on the radio it says Smurfit Stone was closing their doors. Didn't even tell them at work that he was no longer having a job or nothing. They just fired him right there in his truck, on the radio. SIEGLER: Jenn says emphatically that moving to Williston is not an option. She grew up there. Her family moved there during the last oil boom in the 1980s. And she doesn't like the idea of raising her son Colton there now, with all the crime and other social problems that have come with this latest drilling rush. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: That's not your T-Rex. SIEGLER: Besides, their home, on three pristine Montana acres, their horse, their dogs, their lives are here. JENNIFER RICHARDSON: Yeah, and when his dad's home, it's all about dad. I tell you, Colton doesn't even want me around. He tells me to go work. He goes, Mommy, you work. RORY RICHARDSON: He's excited every time. He'll jump up and down and come running and give you a big hug and holler, Daddy, Daddy. SIEGLER: Back in his truck in North Dakota, Rory says being gone so much is taking its toll on his family, even just six months in. RORY RICHARDSON: Do you try to find a lower paying job back at home or do you move your family over here? And how long is this oil boom going to last? You know, it's a big commitment to come over here and resettle to have something happen in four or five years. SIEGLER: For now, Rory's just hoping he can switch schedules to get two weeks off at a time. The money he's making here is good. Still, after you factor in what it costs to travel back and forth, the extra housing and food, it's basically the same pay as he made back at the Montana Mill. It's a sobering truth of this economy, and one of the only options for a guy like him now is to travel 600 miles one way just to find a comparable job. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

I'm Arun Rath. (SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States. RATH: Last Tuesday night, President Obama stepped up to a podium before Congress and the country, and he declared that the state of our union was strong. (SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The lowest unemployment rate in over five years, a rebounding housing market, a manufacturing sector that's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s. RATH: Critics quickly pointed out that, of course, things look better if you use the lowest point in the economy, 2009, as the baseline. But the president didn't keep the rose-tinted glasses on for long. Here's the same speech just a few minutes later. (SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)OBAMA: Average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone to get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all. RATH: And that's our cover story today: the long-term unemployed, the state of the economy and what can be done. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: To figure this out, I asked Zanny Minton Beddoes. She's with The Economist magazine, and she says the president isn't wrong. ZANNY MINTON BEDDOES: Well, I think the U. S. economy is recovering, and it's recovering more rapidly. RATH: There are definitely good signs, Minton Beddoes says. She points to things like housing sales and the GDP, which grew about 3. 5 percent by the end of last year. Most economists agree that that's the right amount for a healthy economy - not too fast, not too slow. BEDDOES: That said, there's a lot of very big challenges, and the president pointed them out, right? I mean, you have a lot of people who have been unemployed for a very long time. You have a lot of - a huge widening in income disparities in this country. You have stagnant social mobility. These are not things that arrived in the few years since the financial crisis. These are very big secular changes that are taking place in the U. S. economy, thanks to new technology, thanks to globalization. And I think now as we've sort of emerged from the kind of big trough of the crisis and then the very sluggish recovery after it, if indeed the economy is on a more sustainable path of faster recovery, now is the time to turn to these longer term things. RATH: So Stanford University just released their own State of the Union study. It considers a lot of different points, and they said they have found what they call, quote, \"a broadly deteriorating poverty and inequality landscape. \" And it seems that every day, Americans agree that their views about the economy are still pretty pessimistic. BEDDOES: I think that's absolutely right. And I think one of the big reasons is that, of course, we have these very big secular changes going on, which are making, you know, income distribution much worse in this country. A lot of the gains of the recovery that we've seen have come to people at the very top, particularly the very top 1 percent. And so ordinary people's incomes have not accelerated that much. And so it doesn't seem as though the economy is doing that well. The thing that makes it feel as though the economy is humming, for most people, is when the labor market is strong. RATH: And one figure that's stuck out to me, this is people age 25 to 54, the, quote, \"prime age\" adults, people who, when in good economic times, about 80 percent of them are working. At the end of last year, that number was closer to 76 percent. It doesn't seem like a lot of movement, but that's still five million people. BEDDOES: Absolutely. And that's been one of the really striking things about the U. S. economy in the past few years is that you've seen this very big decline in the share of the labor force that is employed and the share of people that are employed. Now, partly that is to do with the fact that the population is aging and the baby boomers are aging. And as you get older, fewer people work. But a lot of it probably has to do with the weakness of the recovery itself. And there are people who would like to work but haven't been able to find jobs. And I think you're absolutely right. That is a signal of a weakness in the economy. It's both a sign of the weakness of the recovery. But if you look the other way around, it's also a sign of potential trouble ahead because the economy's potential is obviously weaker if you've got fewer people working. First of all, in the short term, you have a weaker recovery, right? You have fewer people who have the income and hence the ability to spend. Secondly, you can have some potential long-term effect on the economy, what economists called scarring, which is that the longer people are detached from the labor force, the longer they don't have a job for, the harder it becomes for them to get a job. Their skills don't keep up with what's going on in the workplace, and the more you can really have permanent damage, permanent hit to those people themselves and to the economy's potential. RATH: Zanny Minton Beddoes of The Economist. We asked the question of ordinary Americans: What is the state of your personal economy? Are you optimistic? ISAAC VEGA: Right now, it's very, very good and stable. I'm able to save money, retirement. I can go out. TRALEE THORN: It's been hardship after hardship after hardship. And I just - I keep hoping that it's going to get better, but I don't see it changing. KYLE GALLE: We're not the richest people on the block by any stretch of the imagination, but we're doing OK. RATH: That was Isaac Vega of San Diego, California; Tralee Thorn of Salem, Oregon and Kyle Galle of Worthington, Minnesota. If they sound like they have mixed views, well, that's true of the whole country. Carroll Doherty is the director of political research at the Pew Research Center. Just last week, they released a poll about how Americans are feeling about the economy. While some people reported they're doing well, Doherty says that the majority have a more pessimistic message. CARROLL DOHERTY: People are telling us in a lot of ways that they're struggling financially. Fifty-seven percent in our poll say that their family incomes are not keeping up with the cost of living. RATH: And Doherty says it's remarkable how long the negativity about the economy has lasted. DOHERTY: It's been years since there's been any real substantial improvement in people's feelings about the economy. RATH: Over the last few years, Pew has been asking people where they stand economically. Do they consider themselves upper class, middle class, lower class? And since the start of the recession, there has been one dramatic pattern: More and more people are identifying as lower-middle or lower class. DOHERTY: That went up from 25 percent about six years ago to 40 percent today. So quite a climb. RATH: In other words, a year or two after the recession started, losing your job could be viewed as a temporary setback. You were still middle class. You had a house, a car, a retirement fund. But on the brink of the recession's seventh year, as you've looked for a new job or taken a big page cut, broken into your savings, struggled with the mortgage, maybe it's time to face the facts and rate yourself a little lower on the economic ladder. Brandy Swanson is one of those people. She's a licensed respiratory therapist and teacher from Conway, Arkansas. She was working three 12-hour shifts a week at her local hospital, but as the economy tanked, that work dried up. Now. . . BRANDY SWANSON: I'm looking, and I'm trying to get a job, any job. But currently, I don't have a job. RATH: Swanson considers herself lucky. Her husband is still employed, and that has helped their family to keep their house and pay the bills. Still, she says, with two kids, expenses continue to pile up. SWANSON: We've cut corners. We're doing everything we possibly can to save every single dollar just so we can eat and pay our bills and buy gasoline. I don't go out and buy just anything because I want them. We don't go out to eat as much. And that's a big thing. I mean, I used to be able to spend excess money on things like that, and I no longer can. And we have to be really careful, like can we really afford that type of meat at the grocery store? RATH: At 40 years old, Brandy Swanson is part of those five million prime-aged workers who have been unemployed for a long time. Add to that, a new problem: Most new jobs these days pay very well or not very much at all. Jobs with salaries in the middle just aren't returning at the same rate. Of course, that's a great formula for income inequality. According to that same Pew poll, two-thirds of Americans agree that the gap between the rich and everyone else was growing. But we're split on whether the government should be doing anything about it. Again, Carroll Doherty of Pew. DOHERTY: Ninety percent of Democrats say it should, and only 45 percent of Republicans say it should. So on the fundamental question of whether the government should get involved in this issue, there's this huge partisan gap. RATH: But when the poll gets specific about solutions, the answers tell a different story. DOHERTY: Seventy-three percent of Americans, for instance, favor raising the minimum wage, 63 percent favor increasing long-term unemployment benefits. Those policies are popular. You know, the question is, you know, if implemented, would they have a significant effect on either inequality or poverty? RATH: Certainly, the Obama Administration thinks both of those things will help the millions of Americans still struggling. Last Tuesday night, Obama urged Congress to pass both those measures and more. On Friday, he went a little further. JASON FURMAN: The president convened a summit here at the White House, and he used his pen and his phone to do everything he can to help those people get jobs. RATH: Jason Furman is the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the three White House economists who advise the president. He says Obama has persuaded about 300 companies to end discrimination against the long-term unemployed for new hires. As Zanny Minton Beddoes of The Economist explained earlier, it could kill the recovery to have millions of people with no job, no income, no way to buy anything or put that money back into the economy. Furman, though, is optimistic. That dropping unemployment rate puts natural pressure on wages to grow, he explains. He says we've already seen it happen a bit. FURMAN: We can't take for granted, though, that those wage gains are going to happen across the entire income spectrum. And that's why the president, on Tuesday night, said that he was going to be raising the wages for federal contractors to $10. 10 an hour, and he'd like to see businesses, localities, states and, most importantly, the federal government through legislation by Congress follow through. RATH: At the same time - and you can read between the lines there - President Obama really can't do that much on his own. Long-term unemployment insurance has taken a backseat in both chambers. Prospects don't look good for the $10. 10 minimum wage bill either. And as much as the president can ask companies to help out the long-term unemployed, there simply aren't enough jobs for the millions who would like one. While Congress and the president search for solutions, Brandy Swanson and her family are settling into their new reality. SWANSON: I think that my family is learning how to survive in the economy now. If I'm lucky and I get a job, a job at a living wage, not minimum wage, but a living wage, then I think that the recovery may be possible. I might be able to see that light. But if I don't get a job, then no. ARUN RATH, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath.

Just last week, they released a poll about how Americans are feeling about the economy. While some people reported they're doing well, Doherty says that the majority have a more pessimistic message. CARROLL DOHERTY: People are telling us in a lot of ways that they're struggling financially. Fifty-seven percent in our poll say that their family incomes are not keeping up with the cost of living. RATH: And Doherty says it's remarkable how long the negativity about the economy has lasted. DOHERTY: It's been years since there's been any real substantial improvement in people's feelings about the economy. RATH: Over the last few years, Pew has been asking people where they stand economically. Do they consider themselves upper class, middle class, lower class? And since the start of the recession, there has been one dramatic pattern: More and more people are identifying as lower-middle or lower class. DOHERTY: That went up from 25 percent about six years ago to 40 percent today. So quite a climb. RATH: In other words, a year or two after the recession started, losing your job could be viewed as a temporary setback. You were still middle class. You had a house, a car, a retirement fund. But on the brink of the recession's seventh year, as you've looked for a new job or taken a big page cut, broken into your savings, struggled with the mortgage, maybe it's time to face the facts and rate yourself a little lower on the economic ladder. Brandy Swanson is one of those people. She's a licensed respiratory therapist and teacher from Conway, Arkansas. She was working three 12-hour shifts a week at her local hospital, but as the economy tanked, that work dried up. Now. . . BRANDY SWANSON: I'm looking, and I'm trying to get a job, any job. But currently, I don't have a job. RATH: Swanson considers herself lucky. Her husband is still employed, and that has helped their family to keep their house and pay the bills. Still, she says, with two kids, expenses continue to pile up. SWANSON: We've cut corners. We're doing everything we possibly can to save every single dollar just so we can eat and pay our bills and buy gasoline. I don't go out and buy just anything because I want them. We don't go out to eat as much. And that's a big thing. I mean, I used to be able to spend excess money on things like that, and I no longer can. And we have to be really careful, like can we really afford that type of meat at the grocery store? RATH: At 40 years old, Brandy Swanson is part of those five million prime-aged workers who have been unemployed for a long time. Add to that, a new problem: Most new jobs these days pay very well or not very much at all. Jobs with salaries in the middle just aren't returning at the same rate. Of course, that's a great formula for income inequality. According to that same Pew poll, two-thirds of Americans agree that the gap between the rich and everyone else was growing. But we're split on whether the government should be doing anything about it. Again, Carroll Doherty of Pew. DOHERTY: Ninety percent of Democrats say it should, and only 45 percent of Republicans say it should. So on the fundamental question of whether the government should get involved in this issue, there's this huge partisan gap. RATH: But when the poll gets specific about solutions, the answers tell a different story. DOHERTY: Seventy-three percent of Americans, for instance, favor raising the minimum wage, 63 percent favor increasing long-term unemployment benefits. Those policies are popular. You know, the question is, you know, if implemented, would they have a significant effect on either inequality or poverty? RATH: Certainly, the Obama Administration thinks both of those things will help the millions of Americans still struggling. Last Tuesday night, Obama urged Congress to pass both those measures and more. On Friday, he went a little further. JASON FURMAN: The president convened a summit here at the White House, and he used his pen and his phone to do everything he can to help those people get jobs. RATH: Jason Furman is the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the three White House economists who advise the president. He says Obama has persuaded about 300 companies to end discrimination against the long-term unemployed for new hires. As Zanny Minton Beddoes of The Economist explained earlier, it could kill the recovery to have millions of people with no job, no income, no way to buy anything or put that money back into the economy. Furman, though, is optimistic. That dropping unemployment rate puts natural pressure on wages to grow, he explains. He says we've already seen it happen a bit. FURMAN: We can't take for granted, though, that those wage gains are going to happen across the entire income spectrum. And that's why the president, on Tuesday night, said that he was going to be raising the wages for federal contractors to $10. 10 an hour, and he'd like to see businesses, localities, states and, most importantly, the federal government through legislation by Congress follow through. RATH: At the same time - and you can read between the lines there - President Obama really can't do that much on his own. Long-term unemployment insurance has taken a backseat in both chambers. Prospects don't look good for the $10. 10 minimum wage bill either. And as much as the president can ask companies to help out the long-term unemployed, there simply aren't enough jobs for the millions who would like one. While Congress and the president search for solutions, Brandy Swanson and her family are settling into their new reality. SWANSON: I think that my family is learning how to survive in the economy now. If I'm lucky and I get a job, a job at a living wage, not minimum wage, but a living wage, then I think that the recovery may be possible. I might be able to see that light. But if I don't get a job, then no.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

GREENE: We hope that people do have an open mind and they come out and they, you know, take in the show and see what we're all about.

Congressional forecasters said today the federal deficit will be smaller this year than they previously expected, but they warn slow growth will produce bigger deficits later in the decade. Forecasters also looked at how the Affordable Care Act is likely to affect the job market, and we'll have more on that in a moment. CORNISH: All this week, we're examining the dramatic turnaround in the government's bottom line. This is the fastest drop in the deficit since the demobilization after World War II. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley with more on today's news and a look at whether the economy would be in better shape if the government hadn't pushed so hard to shrink the deficit. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The tide of red ink that's been floating Washington in recent years is going out fast. Maybe too fast. Five years ago, during the depths of the recession, the government was spending $1. 4 trillion more than it took in, a deficit equal to 10 percent of the whole U. S. economy. Last year, that figure was down to 4 percent, and by next year the deficit is expected to shrink to just over 2. 5 percent of GDP. President Obama boasted about the improvement in a White House news conference six week ago. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Our fiscal situation is firmer, with deficits that are now less than half of what they were when I took office. HORSLEY: But in slamming the breaks on deficit spending, the government also slowed the economic recovery. MARK ZANDI: It was a big weight on the economy. HORSLEY: Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says while the private sector has added more than eight million jobs since bottoming out, even more people would be working today if the federal government hadn't been so intent on narrowing the deficit. ZANDI: If there wasn't fiscal austerity, then, you know, job growth would've been a million and a half, two million higher. We'd have created a boatload of jobs. HORSLEY: The intense focus on deficit reduction began three years ago after Republicans took control of the House. The Obama administration's temporary stimulus program had already mostly expired. But Congress decided to cut spending further. And last year lawmakers added a tax hike as well. All of that contributed to the sharp drop in the deficit, but Christian Weller of the left-leaning Center For American Progress says even if it was the right prescription at some point, it was the wrong time to administer it. CHRISTIAN WELLER: Policymakers did exactly the opposite of what economists would advocate. That is, you don't want to raise taxes. You don't want to cut spending in the middle of a weak recovery. HORSLEY: Weller says the government cutbacks kept the recovery weaker than it otherwise would have been, with unemployment now expected to remain above 6 percent through the end of 2016. The government's drag on the economy is easing up now, though, and Zandi says as tough as it's been to swallow, the bitter fiscal medicine worked. ZANDI: If you'd have asked me that question a year or two ago, I'd say we were biting off too much here, that we were trying too much fiscal austerity too fast, that the economic recovery was too fragile, couldn't handle it. But we accomplished it. The economy is still standing. The recovery is gaining traction and we've got a smaller deficit to boot. It's not what I would've done, but we fortunately got through it. HORSLEY: Dire predictions that a big deficit would lead to a spike in interest rates have not come true. But conservatives still applaud the improvement in the government's bottom line. Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum says it was important to get government borrowing under control so businesses that want to borrow can do so at attractive rates. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: The good news is, the progress we've seen is real, comes from a better economy, comes from tighter spending controls. The bad news is it won't last. HORSLEY: Today's budget forecast says the deficit is likely to start widening again around 2016 thanks to increased demand for healthcare and Social Security as more baby boomers retire. Thus far, policymakers have done little to tackle those long term costs and there's no sign they'll do so any time soon. If anything, the urgency to make the tough choices about taxes and spending has evaporated now that the short term recession driven deficit has been reigned in. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Good morning. We've be spending time on the program this week looking at the nation's federal budget deficit, which is getting a lot smaller. The Congressional Budget Office said this year's deficit is likely to be about a third the size it was back in 2009, when the Great Recession bottomed out. A recovering economy is the main reason for this shrinking deficit, but moderating health care costs is also contributing. And reining in those costs appears to be the key to solving the long-term deficit, as NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Harvard economist and health policy specialist David Cutler says getting the federal government's finances under control is all about health care. DAVID CUTLER: A fairly accurate summary of the federal budget is that the U. S. does not have a deficit problem. It has a health care problem. YDSTIE: The problem is that health care costs grew significantly faster than the economy in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, driving up the cost of government health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. In the 1990s, increases slowed a bit, but then peaked again in 2001. CUTLER: These increases have led to projections of huge, unsustainable budget deficits in the future, as the baby boomers retire and demand more health care for their aging bodies. So, if you say what's affecting the long range outlook for the federal budget, it is almost entirely health care. But a decade ago, increases in health care spending began to decline, and in the past few years, they've been historically low, between 3 and 4 percent a year. That moderation, if it continues, could have an enormous impact on the country's finances, says David Cutler. Just as an example, the Congressional Budget Office has modified, a little bit, its forecasts for cost increases over the next few years, in health care, particularly Medicare and Medicaid. And that by itself has taken about $100 billion out of the expected deficit in 2020. YDSTIE: But the CBO projects ballooning health care costs and exploding deficits in the decades after 2020. That's partly because a big factor that's reined in health care spending in recent years is fading. Joe Antos is a health policy specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. JOE ANTOS: Certainly the biggest factor - although it's hard to put a number on it - is the recession and the slow recovery since then. GREENE: People reduced their spending on health care during the recession that ended almost five years ago, and cost increases have been subdued ever since. And some other factors holding down health care costs increases may also reverse. For instance, Antos says there's been less innovation in medical devices and procedures in recent years, and fewer new expensive blockbuster drugs. ANTOS: And, you know no reason to think that that's a permanent state of affairs, and it's certainly is no reason to think that that's a good state of affairs. We do need better pharmaceuticals. YDSTIE: But David Cutler, who helped develop cost-control measures in Massachusetts, says there are forces in motion that could keep cost increases significantly lower than they have been historically. They include limits on Medicare payments and other cost containment elements of the Affordable Care Act. CUTLER: My own personal sense is that at the moment, the race is being won by the cost savings more than the cost increasing. YDSTIE: And Cutler says that's led him to believe there's a real chance that the country's long term finances can be brought under control. CUTLER: If we see cost increases remain as low as they are now, the health care problem would go from something that we have no idea how to address into something that we could address along the lines of social security. YDSTIE: And there's broad agreement Social Security could be made solvent with a mix of relatively small tax increases or benefit cuts. But Joe Antos is less optimistic that health care cost increases have been reined in enough to significantly reduce the threat of long-term budget deficits. ANTOS: I think it's possible. I hope it's true. I think it's too early to know. YDSTIE: Antos points to a recent report from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services, the official arbiters of health care cost projections. They say more evidence is needed before concluding that health care cost increases have moderated for the long term. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And I'm David Greene. Good morning. We've be spending time on the program this week looking at the nation's federal budget deficit, which is getting a lot smaller. The Congressional Budget Office said this year's deficit is likely to be about a third the size it was back in 2009, when the Great Recession bottomed out. A recovering economy is the main reason for this shrinking deficit, but moderating health care costs is also contributing. And reining in those costs appears to be the key to solving the long-term deficit, as NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Harvard economist and health policy specialist David Cutler says getting the federal government's finances under control is all about health care. DAVID CUTLER: A fairly accurate summary of the federal budget is that the U. S. does not have a deficit problem. It has a health care problem. YDSTIE: The problem is that health care costs grew significantly faster than the economy in the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, driving up the cost of government health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. In the 1990s, increases slowed a bit, but then peaked again in 2001. CUTLER: These increases have led to projections of huge, unsustainable budget deficits in the future, as the baby boomers retire and demand more health care for their aging bodies. So, if you say what's affecting the long range outlook for the federal budget, it is almost entirely health care. But a decade ago, increases in health care spending began to decline, and in the past few years, they've been historically low, between 3 and 4 percent a year. That moderation, if it continues, could have an enormous impact on the country's finances, says David Cutler. Just as an example, the Congressional Budget Office has modified, a little bit, its forecasts for cost increases over the next few years, in health care, particularly Medicare and Medicaid. And that by itself has taken about $100 billion out of the expected deficit in 2020. YDSTIE: But the CBO projects ballooning health care costs and exploding deficits in the decades after 2020. That's partly because a big factor that's reined in health care spending in recent years is fading. Joe Antos is a health policy specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. JOE ANTOS: Certainly the biggest factor - although it's hard to put a number on it - is the recession and the slow recovery since then.

Employers added a scant 113,000 jobs to payrolls last month. That's the second straight month where hiring fell far below expectations. On the other hand, the unemployment rate fell slightly and a good number of people who've been out of work for a long time found jobs. Taken together, it's a bit of a head scratcher. And as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, the data have economists talking about the weather. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: When December hiring proved very low, Jason Furman had a ready culprit. Snow. Furman chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisors. For January, he says, that's not the case. JASON FURMAN: I don't think weather was a particularly important factor in the jobs numbers. NOGUCHI: For one thing, the weather wasn't particularly bad the week the surveys took place. And, he says, much of the hiring that did take place was in sectors that depend on good weather, construction and manufacturing. Also, people didn't sit at home and hibernate. In fact, the labor force, the measure of the number of people working or looking for work, increased by half a million people. Kevin Pfleger is a senior portfolio manager at Investors Security Trust. He thinks the weather could have been involved. KEVIN PFLEGER: We did have additional weather problems in January, but, you know, we should have seen some amount of bounce-back. NOGUCHI: But we didn't. Pfleger did manage to find a silver lining. He says for many months, the complaint has been that hiring has only been taking place at the lower end of the pay scale. But construction and manufacturing both pay better than average. PFLEGER: The quality of jobs is what we would like to see and that is probably the most positive thing. NOGUCHI: But Pfleger concedes most of the report reads negative. Last year, average monthly job gains were nearly 200,000, more than double the average in December and January. PFLEGER: We're far short of that and it makes you start to think that there's some underlying economic weakness. NOGUCHI: And then there are those like Mark Hamrick who believe bad weather was still a big factor in the January report. Hamrick is Washington bureau chief for Bankrate. com. MARK HAMRICK: Severe winter weather has really been impacting two-thirds, three-quarters of the nation and that has been showing up in a lot of the economic data. NOGUCHI: Namely, he says, auto sales are down, as are home sales, as consumers stay home. HAMRICK: I think this is a situation where we really take a deep breath, hope that spring does arrive and hope that we have a better idea of what's actually happening, say, when we get into late March, early April. NOGUCHI: Jack Kleinhenz is chief economist for the National Retail Federation. He says debates about the effects of the weather on the economy are not unusual this time of year. JACK KLEINHENZ: January is one of the most difficult times to understand the seasonal forces. NOGUCHI: In addition to holidays and weather, adjustments are made about how to account for temporary holiday jobs that go away. KLEINHENZ: We've had some soft spots like this before early in the year for the last several years. So I think that we'll just have to wait for these numbers to thaw out a little bit more. NOGUCHI: Thaw out, pun intended? KLEINHENZ: Pun intended. (LAUGHTER)NOGUCHI: One thing all the market watchers interviewed for this story do seem to agree on, the Federal Reserve, which started scaling back on its bond-buying stimulus program, is likely to continue to stay the course, even if it has to wait until the spring to evaluate whether to blame the weather for what happened in the job market last month.

I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. There's lots of anticipation about the government's monthly jobs report that will be released later this morning. Last month's job creation numbers were very disappointing - just 74,000 jobs added to the payroll - far below the recent monthly averages. NPR's John Ydstie joined us to talk about job creation and what it's telling us about the economy. Good morning. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Renee. MONTAGNE: So, do we expect the numbers will rebound this month from the last report? YDSTIE: Yeah, there are some signs they will. A big private survey of employers found 175,000 new jobs were added to payrolls in January and surveys of economist show expectations that about 185,000 jobs were created. These are about the average number of jobs created over the past 12 months so they're reasonable expectations. And remember, even though the governments survey showed far fewer jobs added in December it's only one month's data and the margin of error is 100,000 plus or minus so it many have been a statistical outlier. MONTAGNE: But there does seem to be concern about the economy. The stock market has had a big sell-off in these first few weeks of the new year. Could the economy be slipping again? YDSTIE: Yeah, there certainly is concern that some of the rosy expectations of the economy accelerating into 2014 may not be fulfilled. We've seen some disappointing signs that manufacturing is losing steam in the U. S. and in China, which of course is a big export market for the US. And there's also been concern about currency problems in some emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina and investors are pulling money out of those countries. In the past couple of years China and emerging countries have been helping out the global economy; now there's concern they could become a drag. Another worry is that the Federal Reserve has started pulling back on its big stimulus program, which has supported both the U. S. economy and the global economy. So you're right - there's a nervousness about where we are right now. MONTAGNE: How about the cold weather and the winter storms in a lot of parts of the country? That must be a disruption for the economy. YDSTIE: Right. A lot of economists say that was part of the reason for the disappointing job creation in December. Of course, bad weather keeps people home from work, out of the stores and shopping malls, and nobody I know wants to go shopping for a car in a frozen lot where the cars are all covered by snow. MONTAGNE: Right. YDSTIE: Not surprisingly, we've seen that in disappointing car sales recently. But of course, the winter will end, we hope, and people who want a car will buy it so the drag will disappear. And, you know, when you look at the last half of last year, the economy really did seem to be gaining speed, even weathering the government shutdown pretty well. So it could be the current gloom will turn into better growth. MONTAGNE: John, this is also the end of Janet Yellin's first week as the new leader at the Federal Reserve, she's replacing Ben Bernanke. Do you think she might rethink the Fed's winding down of its stimulus because the economy needs another boost? YDSTIE: You know, I don't think so. Although if today's job report is as disappointing as last months, that could change the calculus. But, I think the Fed really wants to get out of its big bond-buying stimulus program partly because they view it as no longer effective and creating more risks than benefits.

The idea is to provide banking services that are not available in many communities. But there's also a lot of skepticism. NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: More than a quarter of all Americans, some 68 million, are now underserved by banks. Underbanked, as the report from the Inspector General of the U. S. Postal Service calls them. They live in places were there are no bank branches, or just one. Many have to rely on check cashing outlets and payday loans, which often charge exorbitant fees. Betsy Cavendish, president of Appleseed Network, says being able to go to the post office for simple financial transactions would be an ideal solution. BETSY CAVENDISH: Many people are spending $2,500 a year or so in extra fees. They have a lack of options for small dollar loans and too few savings vehicles. Meanwhile, the postal service is in every zip code in the country and could potentially offer needed financial services. NAYLOR: The so called underbanked are mostly are low income, many live in cities, but plenty live in rural areas. And while banks have been closing branches, of the nations 35,000 post offices, more than half are in zip codes with one or no banks. Saying I'm going to the post office to cash a check or make a deposit may sound strange to our ears, but for our grandparents or great grandparents it wasn't at all unusual. Post office banking was an even a campaign issue in 1908 and might have helped Republican William Howard Taft win the White House. PRESIDENT WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT: It will be a great incentive for thrift in the many small places in the country having now no savings bank facilities which are reached by the post office. NAYLOR: In 1910, Congress established the Postal Savings System. It was aimed at getting people to take their money out from under their mattresses, and give those who didn't trust banks another option. Phil Rubio, a historian at North Carolina A&T, says for awhile, it was quite successful. PHIL RUBIO: By the year of the Wall Street crash 1929, they had $153 million on deposit. Postal savings banks were considered safe during the '30s, when commercial banks were crashing and 1947 is when they had their peak at $3. 4 billion. NAYLOR: But after the war, banks raised their interest rates, making the two percent the Post Office was paying for savings less appealing, and by 1967, the Postal Savings System was out of business. Is it time to try again? The Inspector General's report estimates the Postal Service could make almost $9 billion a year in new revenue by offering banking services. For an agency that lost $5 billion last year, that's a tempting prospect. But the banking industry is dead set against post office getting into their business. Richard Hunt is CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association. RICHARD HUNT: That is the typical Washington, D. C. mentality, is you've got an agency of the government losing money. So what do they say? Well, maybe we should go to a field that we know nothing about 'cause there's possibly money there. That would be like my flying a 747 because I slept at a Holiday Inn Express last night. NAYLOR: It's unclear whether the Postal Service would need approval from Congress or it could simply decide to offer financial services on its own. It does now sell money orders, and could argue providing other financial services, such as a reloadable prepaid card, would simply be an extension of its current offerings.

(SOUNDBITE OF RAIN)NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Wayne Warren shakes wet dirt out of a plastic bucket and into a metal chute, tossing aside the bigger rocks. He's all smiles because for him, California's drought is. . . WAYNE WARREN: Golden. ROTT: Yes, golden. Warren is knee-deep in the San Gabriel River, an hour outside of Los Angeles. That chute next to him is a sluice box. The water washes away the dirt in a muddy cloud, and he leans over the box. WARREN: I don't know if you can see all that yellow in there. ROTT: Oh, yeah. Out of the creek, he taps his findings into a green plastic gold pan and gives it a few swirls. What's left. . . WARREN: Sure is pretty in the sun, huh? ROTT: Yeah. It's beautiful. Guess that's why they call it gold, huh? WARREN: Yeah. ROTT: Consider this the golden lining of California's historic drought. CURT TIMMONS: Yeah. It's good for the gold prospectors. They love it because they can get down to that bedrock without using any scuba equipment. ROTT: This is Curt Timmons, another gold prospector and the owner of a mining supply shop just down the mountain. He's been walking the riverbanks of the San Gabriel his whole life. TIMMONS: Normally, it'd be six feet over your head. And now it's so low, it'd probably be up to your knees in depth, if that. ROTT: Little rain and even less snowpack have made the San Gabriel River more of a stream. And it's not just here. Kevin Hoagland is with the Gold Prospectors Association of America. KEVIN HOAGLAND: And it's beyond just the state of California. Where I'm at in Arizona, we haven't even had our first snow yet. ROTT: He says that's opened up riverbeds there too. HOAGLAND: It's given people an opportunity to literally just go in with a gold pan and a shovel, and be able to get in some of these cracks and crevices and find gold that you wouldn't normally be able to recover. ROTT: Hoagland says it's not 1849 again. No need to pack the wagon and head West. But it is exciting for most people, not Maury Roos. He's the chief hydrologist at California's Department of Water Resources. MAURY ROOS: Well, it's a bad thing for those who need water, and I imagine it's not the best thing either for the fish that live in the rivers. ROTT: Roos says it's a good thing some people are benefitting, but overall, this drought is bad. Many of California's rivers are at or near record low water volumes. And even with rain, their outlook isn't good. He says that will affect fisheries, already endangered salmon, watersheds. . . ROOS: It will even affect the trees and the vegetation. ROTT: And that's not to mention the people, the cities that are under mandatory water restrictions, or the farmers who let their lands go fallow, or unplanted. For a clearer picture, just go back to where our guys were looking for gold, on the San Gabriel River. Follow it south, to where it pools behind the San Gabriel Dam, and you'll see high water lines some hundred feet above the reservoir's surface. The three major dams in this canyon hold nearly 40,000 Olympic-size swimming pools' worth of water. According to the Los Angeles County Public Works, less than 1 percent is available for release.

I'm Michel Martin. We'd like to start the program today by talking about Friday's jobs report which was once again disappointing. The report also shared bad news for people who are working that wages remain stagnant. There was good news, though, for employers. Worker productivity has gone up. We wanted to talk more about what productivity means and what this whole issue means for the economy, so we've called once again on NPR's senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Welcome back, Marilyn. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. Great to be with you. MARTIN: Always productive. GEEWAX: Thanks. MARTIN: So why don't we just start by helping us understand what is this productivity measure? I think that a lot of people, you know, have in mind that episode from \"I Love Lucy\" where Lucy was working on the assembly line with chocolates. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . And the line is speeding up to the point where she kind of can't keep up. And, of course, mayhem ensues. But what if you don't work on an assembly line? GEEWAX: Well, that's what - last week, we really had two different reports that said different things about the economy. The one report - the labor report - got a lot of headlines because that was pretty disappointing. But we also had a productivity report from the Labor Department, and that showed that over the last six months, productivity's really been surging. A normal rate of growth of that is about 2 percent, and lately we've been seeing way more than 3 percent. So that's great. You think, well, gosh, we love to see more productivity. And that's a measure of how much your business is putting out. How efficient are you? And to be. . . MARTIN: How much it puts out per worker? GEEWAX: Per worker. Yes, the output per employee. And to be a very efficient business, you need to have good equipment, the latest stuff, you know, great computers. Just whatever equipment you need for your business, you want it to be the best, and you want to have skilled workers who know how to work with that equipment. So if we're seeing this surging productivity, that means businesses are able to do more with less. And so that's great for businesses. But, you know, so far, we're not seeing it really drift down into the employee's paycheck. And that's the thing that's been a little painful for the economy. MARTIN: And is this traditionally the case, that wage increases follow productivity gains? Is that generally the way it works? GEEWAX: That's what economists will tell you, is that when you have surging productivity, you'll have higher living standards. You're doing more with less. You become a richer country. And eventually that filters down. Economists still - that's their story, and they're sticking with it. But for a lot of people who have lost their jobs because the equipment is so much more efficient now that you've lost your job, for any given individual, it can be a pretty painful transition. MARTIN: But can we just sort of - be sort of keeping it kind of on the bird's-eye level. Why is it if traditionally wage increases do follow productivity gains - because as sort of just thinking logically - that the same people are doing more and producing more, why is it that that. . . GEEWAX: Is not happening. MARTIN: . . . Is not happening now? GEEWAX: It seems that the economists - again, this is their story, and they believe it, and they'll all say it - is that it's just a lag factor, that eventually it will catch up. The problem right now with the job market is that we still have more than 10 million people who are unemployed. Nearly 4 million of those people are long-term unemployed. So it's such a huge labor pool. As businesses improve, as their demand picks up, as their efficiency increases - eventually they're going to want to hire more workers. But right now, why give anybody a raise? Even if your productivity has increased greatly, you don't need to share the wealth at the moment because people will still take relatively low wages. There's not enough competition for those workers. MARTIN: Well, let's. . . GEEWAX: So we really need to get those 10 million people back into the workforce to create the pressure on wages to help go along with that productivity gain. MARTIN: Well, but let's - so let's ask the other end of the equation. You said that - you know, we said at the beginning that the jobs report was also disappointing. If there are these increases in productivity, does that suggest that employers. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . May now be hiring? GEEWAX: Exactly, Michel. That's what the hope is, that when we look at those productivity gains, you're sort of at this point when you're growing productivity at 3. 6 percent, 3. 2 percent as we've seen recently in the last six months, you know, there's only so much that you can get Lucy to wrap those chocolate faster and faster. Eventually, you need to add more than just Lucy and Ethel on the chocolate line. You're going to need a third person to come in and help boost that productivity even further. So the overall hope is that we will actually see the productivity numbers start to slide a little bit. That productivity will go down because you're going to start bringing in new workers, and they'll need to be trained. So in the coming year, the hope is that wages will start to go up, that employment will start to go up. And maybe we'll slack off a little bit on these surges in productivity, but that overall it will start to match up better - that we'll start to get this evened out. MARTIN: But let me ask you this, Marilyn. And if you're just joining us, I'm speaking with NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. We're talking about last Friday's jobs numbers, which were disappointing. But also, another report that suggested that worker productivity is actually increasing and has been increasing over the last couple of months. You know, sort of two questions here. Is part of the productivity increase that employers are investing in equipment, which makes each worker more productive? GEEWAX: Exactly. MARTIN: And if that's the case, does that necessarily suggest that there is a looming increase in employment. . . GEEWAX: Right. Right. MARTIN: . . . You know, ahead? I mean, if you can invest in a piece of equipment that allows the same employee to do more. . . GEEWAX: To do more, exactly. MARTIN: . . . Why would you necessarily progress? Do we know? GEEWAX: Well, you know, the thing is, we've had very low interest rates for the last couple of years. So businesses have been able to go out and borrow money and invest in new equipment so that they're - they have better ways of becoming more efficient. So now they've spent the money. They've improved their - their capital, you know, has been infused into the business. And now they need people who are well educated to run that equipment. So when you think about, like, just a farm, for example. We do so much more now because farms are so much more efficient. You don't have to get out there with, you know, the ox and then - and your plow and try to - you have big tractors that can do that now. So you can grow a lot more corn with far fewer people. And that's great because now we have cheaper food, and you can feed more people. And - but, of course, the person who lost their job that used to work on that farm, they're not so happy. They've lost their job. But what's coming next maybe, instead of having fewer workers working on those tractors, what if they're all run by GPS? You know, Google Driver will take over all those tractors. And now you'll be able to run your whole farm with, effectively, no employees. MARTIN: But. . . GEEWAX: You'll have all this greater technology. MARTIN: Do we know whether we are at such an inflection point or not? GEEWAX: Well, that's kind of. . . MARTIN: Or is this a short-term trend or is this a long-term trend? GEEWAX: That's the big thing that everybody's looking at is are our technology leaps so great that we won't catch up. There will be this bigger lag. That things will happen that will have Google Driver take over truck driving and tractor driving and forklift operating, and lots and lots of people will be without work. Maybe we'll be a richer society because we'll be more efficient, but there will be an awful lot of people who need work. So right now it's almost like economic historians are watching something unfold where they say don't worry, eventually it all comes out in the wash. A stronger economy will eventually produce more jobs. Just hold your horses. Everything will be fine in the long run. But if you're one of those 10 million people who hasn't had a job in two years, the long run isn't helping you. It's very tough to be one of those unemployed people looking at all this productivity growth and feeling like you're the person who's left behind. MARTIN: Let's talk - in the time that we have left - about the, you know, the other report that we started with, the jobs report. The big picture is that employers added jobs at a slower than expected pace in January. It was the second month in a row that hiring has been disappointing. Is this a - and this also comes at a time when, you know, there's new leadership at the Fed. And they are expected to sort of pull back on the kind of stimulus that they've been pumping into the economy. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . For these last few years as the economy has been very kind of, you know, anemic. So I wanted to ask, first of all, do we know why the jobs report was disappointing? Were there unusual factors, for example, severe weather, something that may have affected that? And are people starting to question whether it is the time to move off of. . . GEEWAX: Change, yes. MARTIN: . . . The strategy that the Fed had been employing all these years? GEEWAX: Well, you know, I've talked to so many economists, and I've read a lot in the last couple of days about this. And I don't think there is a clear-cut story as to what happened in the last two months. Yes, weather seems to have been a factor. Some retailers will say that, that it really hurt things like hobby stores and music stores, sort of the marginal things that, you know, on the weekend it's like, oh, it's really snowing. I'm not going to go there. So a lot of small businesses did get hurt by a loss of customers. But overall, was it bad enough that it really derailed the economy? No. It seems like there's something else going on. And we're not entirely clear what that something else is. And that's what makes it really tough for the Federal Reserve to decide, is this the right moment to raise interest rates, to take the kinds of steps that lead to a drifting up in the interest rate? And some people say. . . MARTIN: It seems it's so - it just seems like there's so much uncertainty. And it just seems that some of that uncertainty is really ideologically driven. I mean, it seems as though that, you know, various people want to sort of blame various factors depending on what their politics are. GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: You know, obviously, there are a lot of people who are still complaining about, you know, the health care law and the resources it takes to participate and so forth. And other people would say that that's certainly not true. It just - is there any kind of center of gravity around this? GEEWAX: Here's what makes life so hard, Michel - is we are a giant economy. The United States has more than 300 million people. We have a trillion, trillion, trillion dollar economy, all sorts of things are swirling around, and it's hard in any given month to really understand exactly what's going on. You have to stand back and look over six months and see what happened in the past to try to understand where we're going. And right now, everybody wants to argue, there's a lot of politics - you know, is this caused by the health care changes, is this caused by - and honestly, the most honest answer is we don't really, really know what's going on. Something seems to be slowing down the economy. It could be that it has to do with forces overseas and really has nothing to do with us. It could be that China and emerging markets are the real drag on the economy right now. So we're going to need more time to tell what's going on, but the things that we do know - the sort of big picture things that we are able to measure right now - is that productivity has been growing, and that's good for the economy in the long run. Wages are very flat because the economy - the labor market is very weak still. And interest rates remain at really historic lows. So you put all that together, there's a lot of slack in the labor market, but, you know, things are seeming to move in the right direction. So we'll see how this year turns out, but right now it's a very unclear picture. MARTIN: Marilyn Geewax is NPR's senior business editor. She was with us here in our Washington, D. C. studios.

And I don't think there is a clear-cut story as to what happened in the last two months. Yes, weather seems to have been a factor. Some retailers will say that, that it really hurt things like hobby stores and music stores, sort of the marginal things that, you know, on the weekend it's like, oh, it's really snowing. I'm not going to go there. So a lot of small businesses did get hurt by a loss of customers. But overall, was it bad enough that it really derailed the economy? No. It seems like there's something else going on. And we're not entirely clear what that something else is. And that's what makes it really tough for the Federal Reserve to decide, is this the right moment to raise interest rates, to take the kinds of steps that lead to a drifting up in the interest rate? And some people say. . . MARTIN: It seems it's so - it just seems like there's so much uncertainty. And it just seems that some of that uncertainty is really ideologically driven. I mean, it seems as though that, you know, various people want to sort of blame various factors depending on what their politics are. GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: You know, obviously, there are a lot of people who are still complaining about, you know, the health care law and the resources it takes to participate and so forth. And other people would say that that's certainly not true. It just - is there any kind of center of gravity around this? GEEWAX: Here's what makes life so hard, Michel - is we are a giant economy. The United States has more than 300 million people. We have a trillion, trillion, trillion dollar economy, all sorts of things are swirling around, and it's hard in any given month to really understand exactly what's going on. You have to stand back and look over six months and see what happened in the past to try to understand where we're going. And right now, everybody wants to argue, there's a lot of politics - you know, is this caused by the health care changes, is this caused by - and honestly, the most honest answer is we don't really, really know what's going on. Something seems to be slowing down the economy. It could be that it has to do with forces overseas and really has nothing to do with us. It could be that China and emerging markets are the real drag on the economy right now. So we're going to need more time to tell what's going on, but the things that we do know - the sort of big picture things that we are able to measure right now - is that productivity has been growing, and that's good for the economy in the long run. Wages are very flat because the economy - the labor market is very weak still. And interest rates remain at really historic lows. So you put all that together, there's a lot of slack in the labor market, but, you know, things are seeming to move in the right direction. So we'll see how this year turns out, but right now it's a very unclear picture. MARTIN: Marilyn Geewax is NPR's senior business editor. She was with us here in our Washington, D. C. studios.

JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: The study focuses on young adults and looks at some key measures like income and unemployment. Pew's Paul Taylor says it's pretty much case closed. PAUL TAYLOR: In a modern knowledge-based based economy, the only thing more expensive than going to college is not going to college. LUDDEN: Here are the numbers. Those with a college degree now make $17,500 more a year on average than those without, a wage gap that has doubled in recent decades. Unemployment? Those with no degree are four times more likely to be out of a job. Pew also surveyed young adults. Taylor says you can imagine a college-educated barista struggling with loan payments having second thoughts. TAYLOR: But you ask them, was it worth it? And boy, even those with debt, eight out of 10 say absolutely, either it's already worth it or it will be worth it. DAKOTA GOFORTH: In this generation, you have to go to college. Like, it isn't even an option. LUDDEN: Nineteen-year-old Dakota Goforth(ph) is a freshman at the University of the District of Columbia. At first, he did not plan on college. After all, neither of his parents went and they make a fine living, his dad in special education, mom is an accountant. But Goforth says his high school was all over the disparity that the Pew report chronicles. GOFORTH: And they would show you like statistics of people who didn't go to college the and people who did. And once I saw the numbers, I'm like, yeah, I'm going. LUDDEN: But Pew also finds it's not just going that matters. It's what you study. On his way to morning class, 29-year-old Michael Benten(ph) says he already has a master's degree, but like nearly a third of those Pew surveyed, he regrets his major. MICHAEL BENTEN: Political science and international relations and international development. LUDDEN: So not a lot of job opportunity there? BENTEN: No. Very little. LUDDEN: So Benten is now at UDC for a second bachelor's. He's taking out loans and dipping into savings to major in computer science. BENTEN: I want be in a field where it's growing and I know what the future looks like and I think the future's bright. LUDDEN: Compared to those without a degree, grads today are much better off.

They're flat. I mean there's no great sense of forward progress among this group. LUDDEN: Pew finds the wage gap is widening at the lower end. Prospects for those with just a high school diploma have been collapsing since the late '70s. ARNIE KALLEBERG: The blue collar jobs of yesteryear, which built the American middle class, those jobs have simply disappeared. LUDDEN: Arnie Kalleberg is a sociologist at the University of North Carolina and the author of \"Good Jobs, Bad Jobs. \"KALLEBERG: The kinds of jobs that are being created are relatively low wage, low skilled jobs such as fast food and big box stores, and so for most of Americans we've seen a stagnation in wages and a decline in purchasing powers.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'm Robert Siegel. And we begin this hour with a rarity in Congress these days: a clean bill. Today, the House passed one to raise the debt limit. The move avoids a possible default later this month. In the past, House Republicans have used these moments to extract concessions from President Obama and congressional Democrats, but not this time, as NPR's David Welna reports. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: After huddling behind closed doors with fellow House Republicans for the second time in less than a day, Speaker John Boehner emerged with this message. REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: Our members are not crazy about voting to increase the debt ceiling. WELNA: Call it the understatement of the year. Boehner went on to acknowledge that despite days of efforts, he and his fellow GOP leaders had failed to find something they could add to a debt ceiling bill that would make it palliative enough to get a majority of 218 Republicans to vote for it. Instead, Boehner had to turn to plan B, bringing a bill to the House floor for a vote today that suspends the debt limit for another year with no strings attached, just as President Obama had demanded. And even though it's Congress that approves all spending, Boehner blamed the debt entirely on the president. BOEHNER: So the president driving up the debt and the president wanting to do nothing about the debt that's occurring will not engage in our long term spending problem, and so we'll let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants. WELNA: In the debt ceiling showdown of the summer of 2011, the speaker prevailed with what became known as the Boehner Rule, that for every dollar the debt ceiling was raised, another dollar of spending had to be cut. A reporter asked him today if that Boehner Rule is now dead. BOEHNER: I would hope not. As I said before, this is a lost opportunity. We could've sat down and worked together in a bipartisan manner to find cuts and reforms that are greater than the increase in the debt limit. WELNA: While the House GOP retreat on the debt ceiling was a big win for the White House, there was not a lot of dancing in the end zone going on there today. At a breakfast today organized by the Christian Science Monitor, White House economic advisor Gene Sperling simply hailed the clean debt limit bill as a good sign. GENE SPERLING: What the president has long said is that the era of threatening default has to be over, that the era of anyone threatening the full faith and credit of the United States has to be over because it's not a partisan issue. WELNA: But many Republicans in Congress don't see it that way. Renee Ellmers is a House member from North Carolina. REPRESENTATIVE RENEE ELLMERS: I cannot vote for a clean debt bill. It's something that I have - that is a commitment I have made to my constituents, that there has to be something in it that's worth voting for if I'm going to raise the debt ceiling and increase the credit card. WELNA: In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid promised to bring up the debt ceiling measure quickly for a vote. SENATOR HARRY REID: In the meantime, I commend Speaker Boehner for doing the right thing. I hope this common sense approach will continue throughout the year so we can actually get some things done. WELNA: But like their House counterparts, Senate Republicans showed little inclination to vote for the no-strings-attached extension. Here's what John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's number two Republican, had to say today when asked if he'd vote for the debt measure. SENATOR JOHN CORNYN: I would say probably not. Not - especially when it's clean, without anything to deal with the debt. WELNA: But another Senate Republican, Arizona's John McCain, said the House Republicans' capitulation on the debt ceiling showed a lesson was learned from last fall's government shutdown about the perils of provoking government crises. SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: I think it made them realize that you don't do things like shut down the government because the American people overwhelmingly disapprove of such a thing.

And we're using the occasion to explore some challenges facing today's poor. One is a lack of affordable housing. Today, millions of poor families spend more than half of their income on rent, leaving little money for anything else. NPR's Pam Fessler reports some nonprofit groups are trying to change that with a new business-like approach to real estate. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Christopher LoPiano's job is to buy and operate housing for low- and moderate-income families. So it was frustrating when he made offers on eight properties in Virginia and got the same answer every time. CHRISTOPHER LOPIANO: No, thank you. That's what kept happening to us. No, thank you. FESSLER: It wasn't the price. LoPiano's group, a nonprofit called Community Preservation and Development Corporation, was competitive on price. LOPIANO: What we're not competitive on is closing quickly because we're dependent upon public financing, and public financing just takes longer. FESSLER: He's talking about getting approval for government bonds and tax credits often used in these deals. It can take months, even a year. LOPIANO: And sellers in today's market are not willing to wait that. FESSLER: So, LoPiano's group and something called the Housing Partnership Network decided it was time to get creative, to do what private investors have done for decades. They formed what's called a real estate investment trust, or REIT. It allows investors to pool their funds to buy property and collect dividends. The nonprofits figured they could offer a modest return, 5 to 7 percent. And they got several big investors, like Prudential and Morgan Stanley, to chip in $100 million. LoPiano says it's made all the difference. Late last year, the Housing Partnership Equity Trust successfully closed on a 300-unit garden apartment in Norfolk, Virginia. It's called Woodmere Trace, where workers now are busy fixing things up. GEORGIA PITRONE: This is the renovated kitchen. FESSLER: Georgia Pitrone is the property manager. She shows me one unit where the 40-year-old kitchen has been updated with sleek, new appliances, cabinets, and floors. The bathrooms and decks are also being redone. PITRONE: We found when we took everything out that there was a lot of dry-rotted wood and a lot of issues at poor repairs. So we're addressing all of that before they put anything back. FESSLER: And that's what the housing partnership hopes to achieve, fixing up moderately priced apartments that might otherwise fall into disrepair or be purchased by developers who jack up the rents, forcing existing tenants to move. Drew Ades runs the housing trust. He says they're here for the long haul. DREW ADES: What we're trying to do is, you know, keep rents affordable, but also really invest in the property, really invest in the community and really invest in the residents. FESSLER: Who, for the most part, are low-income working families or retirees. Many have jobs at nearby military bases or retail stores and make as little as $30,000 a year, just the kind of people being squeezed out of today's rental market, sometimes into homelessness - people like 80-year-old Frank Spicer. FRANK SPICER: Please come in. FESSLER: Spicer moved to Woodmere Trace two years ago after he sold his house nearby. He says other apartments in the area were too expensive. SPICER: Everything was 1,000 or $1,200 if I wanted to move in. I just couldn't really afford to that. FESSLER: Here, he pays about $800 a month for a one-bedroom. Did you know what you would do if you couldn't find an affordable apartment right here? SPICER: I would go live with my daughter, I think. FESSLER: But he says, to be honest, he'd rather live on his own. So far, the Housing Partnership has purchased three properties like this around the country. CEO Drew Ades says they're hoping to raise an additional $250 million. Keven Lindemann, who analyzes the real estate market at the firm of SNL Financial, thinks the nonprofit's plan has promise. He says the challenge will be attracting new investors. KEVEN LINDEMANN: I would guess that their ability to do that on an ongoing basis will be determined by how successful they are with this first $100 million. FESSLER: And by successful, he means balancing competing demands - keeping rents low and the property in good shape, while also satisfying investors who could be making more money elsewhere. Lindeman thinks the housing groups will have to appeal to investors' desire to do something good for society. Pam Fessler, NPR News.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Educators all over the country are paying close attention to what's going on in North Carolina. Teachers' salaries in the state are losing ground fast. No state has seen a more dramatic decrease in teacher salary rankings in the past 10 years. North Carolina is also making unprecedented changes to its pay practices for educators. For example, teachers who earn a master's degree no longer get an automatic salary increase. Teachers are angry about the changes and they're filing suit. Dave Dewitt of North Carolina Public Radio reports. DAVE DEWITT, BYLINE: Jennifer Spivey has been a teacher for three years at South Columbus High School, on the north side of the border between the Carolinas. She's been recognized as an outstanding teacher. She has a master's degree and, last summer, won a prestigious fellowship. She also still lives in her parents' basement. JENNIFER SPIVEY: Can't afford to move out. I'm glad my mama cooks dinner every night 'cause wouldn't be able to afford to live if I didn't. DEWITT: Spivey has never had a raise, and as bad as that sounds, the news for teachers in North Carolina got worse over the past year. In an effort to give more control to local school districts, the state legislature passed sweeping changes to public education. Many affected teachers directly. The Republican-controlled general assembly ended teacher tenure, halted a salary bump for earning a master's degree, and eliminated a cap on class size. TERRY STOOPS: They did it all at once. DEWITT: Terry Stoops directs education studies at the conservative John Locke Foundation, a Raleigh-based think tank. STOOPS: They don't get style points for it but the number of reforms that were passed received some awe from some of my colleagues in other states that said, I can't believe that North Carolina was able to do all that in one year. And in particular, the elimination of the master's degree supplement. DEWITT: That's a standard salary increase for teachers across the country who earn an advanced degree. In 2013, North Carolina became the first state ever to eliminate it. Teacher tenure is also gone, replaced by a merit-based system that rewards long-term contracts to the top 25 percent of teachers and shorter contracts to everyone else. Rodney Ellis is president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the state's largest teacher advocacy group. RODNEY ELLIS: Morale is at the bottom of the barrel right now throughout this state. Teachers are really questioning why they want to teach, why they want to teach here in North Carolina. They have to take care of their own families, and it's difficult to do that when our salaries are as low as they are. We've got educators who right now qualify for government assistance. DEWITT: Because North Carolina is a right-to-work state, teachers are prohibited from collective bargaining or going on strike. But they have fought back, marching on the state capitol and staging a walk-in before the school day. They've also put pressure on Republican Governor Pat McCrory. McCrory first defended the budget cuts and changes, but has since sounded more conciliatory. One feedback that I get from teachers is, will you respect us? Will you show us some respect? They just feel like they're walked over. And no one likes to work for a company where they're just taken for granted and a lot of teachers feel like they are taken for granted at this point in time. McCrory and the Republican leadership in the state's general assembly are now talking about ways to give teachers a small raise next year. That may not be enough. Spivey, the science teacher, would only have to drive a few miles down the road to be in South Carolina. And she's figured out, with her qualifications and experience, what her salary would be if she taught there. SPIVEY: Seventeen thousand dollars more. For my levels of experience and then my master pay, it would be $17,000. And then with my coaching supplement on top of that because I coach cheerleading, I mean, that's 55 percent of my salary now. DEWITT: It's unlikely there will be a mass exodus of public school teachers from North Carolina next year, but bigger problems loom. Freshman enrollment in the state university's schools of education is down between 20 and 40 percent. For NPR News, I'm Dave DeWitt in Durham, North Carolina.

Educators all over the country are paying close attention to what's going on in North Carolina. Teachers' salaries in the state are losing ground fast. No state has seen a more dramatic decrease in teacher salary rankings in the past 10 years. North Carolina is also making unprecedented changes to its pay practices for educators. For example, teachers who earn a master's degree no longer get an automatic salary increase. Teachers are angry about the changes and they're filing suit. Dave Dewitt of North Carolina Public Radio reports. DAVE DEWITT, BYLINE: Jennifer Spivey has been a teacher for three years at South Columbus High School, on the north side of the border between the Carolinas. She's been recognized as an outstanding teacher. She has a master's degree and, last summer, won a prestigious fellowship. She also still lives in her parents' basement. JENNIFER SPIVEY: Can't afford to move out. I'm glad my mama cooks dinner every night 'cause wouldn't be able to afford to live if I didn't. DEWITT: Spivey has never had a raise, and as bad as that sounds, the news for teachers in North Carolina got worse over the past year. In an effort to give more control to local school districts, the state legislature passed sweeping changes to public education. Many affected teachers directly. The Republican-controlled general assembly ended teacher tenure, halted a salary bump for earning a master's degree, and eliminated a cap on class size. TERRY STOOPS: They did it all at once.

Her message was clear - there will be no sudden changes in Fed policy. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, Yellen said the central bank is likely to keep pulling back its big stimulus program despite concerns about the economy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: It was a long day for Janet Yellen. The House Financial Services Committee has 60 members and today, all of them wanted a chance to question the new Fed chair, the first woman ever to lead the Fed. Michigan Republican Bill Huizenga had a welcome and a warning for her. REP. BILL HUIZENGA: Chair Yellen, congratulations on being confirmed as the first woman chair of the board of governors of Federal Reserve, and I think as you see with this group of cameras ahead of you, buckle up and hang on. This is going to be an interesting ride, I'm sure. YDSTIE: Of course, interesting is a relative word when it comes to discussions of quantitative easing, forward guidance, capital requirements and accounting rules. Yellen brought her best central banker's game, providing patient and unflappable answers. She was congratulated by Colorado Democrat Ed Perlmutter for being just like her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. REP. ED PERLMUTTER: You know, I really appreciated three things about him. One, he's very smart, very steady and not very exciting. And I want to say, you're following in his footsteps. JANET YELLEN: Thank you. Appreciate that. YDSTIE: And there was no detectable change in policy as Yellen took the helm. She argued the Fed's controversial bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, had been a success. Its goal, she said, was to help the economy by producing lower long-term interest rates. She pointed to a stronger housing market and brisk auto sales as evidence of its positive impact. YELLEN: When spending and employment increase in those sectors, the availability of jobs increases, unemployment tends to come down, growth picks up. YDSTIE: Yellen added that since the beginning of the program, the unemployment rate has fallen one and a half percent. More progress needs to be made on the jobs front, said Yellen. But she didn't waver from the Fed's current course of dialing back its stimulus. Given the disappointing job growth in December and January, Yellen was asked whether the Fed might consider a pause before further winding down its stimulus. She didn't rule that out but said it's important to be cautious in interpreting the recent jobs data. YELLEN: There were weather factors. We've had unseasonably cold temperatures that may be affecting economic activity in the job market and elsewhere. YDSTIE: Yellen said by the Fed's next meeting in March, policymakers will have more data and a clearer idea about whether growth has slowed so much that the Fed should pause. But she said it would take a significant deterioration in the outlook for the economy for the Fed to boost its stimulus once again. Throughout the long day, Yellen defended the Fed's policies but acknowledged the economy remains a work in progress. YELLEN: There has been substantial job creation, so that I think we have made progress. Certainly, there is a significant way to go. YDSTIE: The financial market seemed comfortable with Yellen's testimony and the transition at the Fed. The major stock indexes all rose more than one percent. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Michel Martin. It's been 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty so all this year we've been looking at poverty here in the U. S. We've been talking about strategies to end poverty, what's worked, what hasn't and what's on the table because according to the U. S. Census, the rate of poverty seems to be stuck at 15 percent. That's about 46 million people. And, as we said, we've talked some already about the various ideas to end poverty. Today we want to drill down on one of them, which is this - why not just keep it simple? Why not just give people who are low income enough money so that they're not poor? Here to talk more about this is Mauricio Lim Miller. He is the founder and CEO of the Family Independence Initiative, that's a nonprofit that assists small groups in pulling themselves out of poverty. Also with us is Moises Velasquez-Manoff. He is a freelance science journalist who's written about the stresses of poverty for the New York Times. Welcome to you both. I'm so glad both of you could join us. MAURICIO LIM MILLER: Thank you for having us. MOISES VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So, Moises, what about this idea of just giving people enough money so that they're not poor? This is actually been tried in some places and you've been reporting on that. Could you just tell us what you found out? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Yes, this was an interesting series of studies that I came across. It was on the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians that in North Carolina. And they opened a casino in the mid-'90s and so this epidemiologist happened to be following them and a bunch of other people in the area. It was mostly a rural area and many people were poor. And so she had this opportunity to ask the question - what happens when a bunch people who are poor start receiving some money? Because the tribe had decided to pay out about half of the profits to every member equally. So she had a four-year baseline before the money started, with her first study of four years after. And she was interested in mental health outcomes. She saw improvements in children's mental health outcomes for the children for whom that little bit of extra money sort of brought them above the poverty level. MARTIN: And why do people think that is? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Probably because it helps ease stresses on parents and then parents are better parents. So this is this emerging theme in the science where actually the quality of your parenting really matters to how kids grow up and whether they're - you know, whether they develop substance abuse problems or whether they develop other psychiatric problems. MARTIN: Mauricio Lim Miller, what does your group do? It kind of operates on similar lines, but the core principle that you operate is trust families to make their own decisions. Is that right? MILLER: Yes, it is. And that money actually is maybe one piece. I think that, you know, even the rich want more money and we also know that families in kind of poverty get money from welfare. And, you know, all of us kind of feel like that doesn't really make it. So it's not actually the transference of money, it is really the nature of how that transfer happens. So for us, our work has been to bring forth that it is this collective nature within people that actually is the driving force and money can obviously help and is needed but having choices also and then working working with your neighbors really is what brings about change. MARTIN: Well, what do you do exactly, though? How do you do that? MILLER: So what we do is actually we approach the families and we ask them to come in with their friends, that they will get no direction from us. So once we have a group of 6, 8, 10, 15 families that have been identified and self-identify, and we ask them, OK, so what would you do to change your own life? How would you help each other 'cause you're not going to get help from us? What we are going to do - what FII, the Family Independence Initiative does is we're going to collect the data and the stories that tell society what works and doesn't work for you - what those patterns are. So in many ways, my initiative is much more in the business of information and then sharing it both with the families and with society as a whole. So the families see their own progress. They also - through the data and stories, information, through a social media site that we have, they actually get to see what other families are doing. The Boston families became interested what San Francisco families were doing in lending circles. So they started then communicating and start changing those behaviors. And the last piece we do is we have kind of a Yelp system so that the families now - how you and I would use Yelp to say to our friends that we like this restaurant or don't like that - they say, well, I like this head start program. I don't like that head start program. And so they actually start advising each other. And the power of peers working together is huge. That's what happened in the study that Moises actually was pointing out. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we are talking about poverty. This is part of our year-long look at poverty. We have been looking at this because this is the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty. We're examining the various ideas that have come forward to address poverty. One of the things we're drilling down on today is this whole question of, why not just give people enough money to not be poor? I'm joined by Mauricio Lim Miller from the Family Independence Initiative and science reporter Moises Velasquez-Manoff who's been reporting on this. So, Moises, you also noted in your reporting that the families who are already well-off, the supplements didn't do that much good or didn't change very much. For the families who were really on the edge, it made a huge difference. Why did it make a huge difference? Like, what did it help them to do that they couldn't do before? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: There's this sort of emerging idea in this science that, for example, that kids who are on welfare have this deficit that begins early on with vocabulary. And there was this observation that it was because the parents just didn't speak to them as much. And, you know, there are many reasons for that. It could be education. It could just be 'cause the parents are stressed. But now there's this also added nuance that how you communicate really matters. You know, is it - are you always yelling at them? Or are you - and why do people end up sort of snapping at their kids and not being as nurturing as they might be? One reason is outside stresses on the parent. And of course, money helps you escape those stresses, at least at that socioeconomic level. So it could be that simple, that basically they just relaxed, and they could do what comes naturally to them anyways with a little extra money because they weren't so worried about paying the rent. MARTIN: Mauricio Lim Miller, what kind of thinking undergirded your group's efforts in this area? I know that you, you know, had a background in kind of traditional social services as they are traditionally kind of run. So what gave you the idea to try to organize things differently? MILLER: I think, you know, that for me, it had a lot to do with my family and the friends and the people 'cause I was - you know, we're Mexican and being raised really poor - a single mom, all the other things. So the influence was really more like common sense and what makes sense to all of us. And, you know, in terms of money, my mother needed money. I mean, we needed money just to eat and to get housing and whatever. But my mother would not go into welfare where, you know, she would get a check. So it wasn't about the money. And what my mother made clear is that if she did that, she would start losing the respect from me, from my sister, from her friends. And I know nobody wants to go into this issue of self-respect and self-efficacy and whatever and try to find something simple like, well, let's just transfer money. Well, we've been transferring money. But, again, it's that nature that what we've seen with a lot of young people at a very early age is that if there is pride within that family or within the collective of a tribe or whatever, then the nature of that relationship really improves. MARTIN: Moises, you've reported on this as part of the data that we're talking about here. You know, one of the things you pointed out is that the money wasn't just money. I mean, this was not - it didn't just appear. These income supplements came from a business owned by the beneficiaries. The tribe decided how to do it. The supplements were not enough for members to avoid working entirely, but they were unconditional. How did people look at this? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: This is such a unique situation with the Cherokee. It's more like shareholders of a business. They own the business, and they created the business to some degree. And they receive the benefits of it. And then they also took half the money and put it toward social services in a kind of - I mean, you might even call it, like, a mini  social - a mini Sweden, let's call it, where they have all these social benefits like addiction counseling and various other things that are essentially free. And they are in charge of those things. And what's interesting is that in other science, having a sense of control over your destiny actually has all these biologically measurable things that are healthy for you, that are good for your brain development, that are good, you know. And they can see them sort of when they look in your blood, so to speak, and how your genes express. And that's what's really remarkable that this thing that's sort of a soft concept is actually - you're able to measure it these days with hard science. MARTIN: Moises, can I ask how has this reporting been received? I understand that you were - the point that you wanted to make is that a lot of this research comes from a very specific set of circumstances in a specific place with specific people, which is the Cherokee nation. But has this research penetrated the thinking about addressing poverty elsewhere? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Yes. Well, there's other work being done in the developing world using what's called conditional cash transfers. They basically just give money to poor people but with certain conditions - usually that you attend nutritional classes or that sort of thing or child development classes. And they actually show beneficial outcomes with the caveat that they usually tend to show outcomes when there's also infrastructure in place like a clinic you know you can come to or a school. So there also has to be this sort of social infrastructure there. And that's an argument - 'cause those are top-down interventions. Those are not exactly the sort of bottom-up interventions we're talking about. And that's not even that - yes, money makes a big difference at certain levels of poverty. MARTIN: And, Mauricio, final thought from you. And I'd like to ask you how would you like us to think about this question going forward? If you were in charge of our thoughts. . . MILLER: I would. . . MARTIN: . . . How would you like us to think about it? MILLER: I would like us to get past the issue of just discussing about poverty 'cause that discussion centers around a certain income level. And, again, this issue of if there's a base, you know, that we could provide people the safety net, etc. , etc. and that what's wrong in this country is really that we kind of lost our social-economic mobility. And there are studies that show we're near the bottom in terms of mobility. So for us, I feel like what we need to do is get people conscious of the fact that there are resources of people, you know, that are resourceful in the community that we're trying to help and that what we need to do is tap that. and we need to invest in it dollar-wise, in terms of connection-wise, in terms of giving them actually the control over it. And the focus needs to be on not getting people above the poverty level, which happens all the time, you know, it really is about, is the next rung of the ladder too far away for families? You know, is our system so fractured that a family can't actually piece their life together to really move ahead and get the kind of mobility that people used to actually exercise when - you know, whether it was African-Americans before and after slavery that built entire townships. We have a huge history before there were any programs, before there were any studies, of people working together. And actually, this country had a history of economic and social mobility. My work is really about trying to take us back to that history and back to those models which really were about people working together, helping each other and investing in that initiative. MARTIN: Mauricio Lim Miller is the founder and CEO of the Family Independence Initiative. Also joining us, Moises Velasquez-Manoff. He's a freelance science reporter. They both joined us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Gentlemen, thank you both so much for speaking with us. VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Thank you. MILLER: Thank you so much for having me.

I don't like that head start program. And so they actually start advising each other. And the power of peers working together is huge. That's what happened in the study that Moises actually was pointing out. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we are talking about poverty. This is part of our year-long look at poverty. We have been looking at this because this is the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty. We're examining the various ideas that have come forward to address poverty. One of the things we're drilling down on today is this whole question of, why not just give people enough money to not be poor? I'm joined by Mauricio Lim Miller from the Family Independence Initiative and science reporter Moises Velasquez-Manoff who's been reporting on this. So, Moises, you also noted in your reporting that the families who are already well-off, the supplements didn't do that much good or didn't change very much. For the families who were really on the edge, it made a huge difference. Why did it make a huge difference? Like, what did it help them to do that they couldn't do before? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: There's this sort of emerging idea in this science that, for example, that kids who are on welfare have this deficit that begins early on with vocabulary. And there was this observation that it was because the parents just didn't speak to them as much. And, you know, there are many reasons for that. It could be education. It could just be 'cause the parents are stressed. But now there's this also added nuance that how you communicate really matters. You know, is it - are you always yelling at them? Or are you - and why do people end up sort of snapping at their kids and not being as nurturing as they might be? One reason is outside stresses on the parent. And of course, money helps you escape those stresses, at least at that socioeconomic level. So it could be that simple, that basically they just relaxed, and they could do what comes naturally to them anyways with a little extra money because they weren't so worried about paying the rent. MARTIN: Mauricio Lim Miller, what kind of thinking undergirded your group's efforts in this area? I know that you, you know, had a background in kind of traditional social services as they are traditionally kind of run. So what gave you the idea to try to organize things differently? MILLER: I think, you know, that for me, it had a lot to do with my family and the friends and the people 'cause I was - you know, we're Mexican and being raised really poor - a single mom, all the other things. So the influence was really more like common sense and what makes sense to all of us. And, you know, in terms of money, my mother needed money. I mean, we needed money just to eat and to get housing and whatever. But my mother would not go into welfare where, you know, she would get a check. So it wasn't about the money. And what my mother made clear is that if she did that, she would start losing the respect from me, from my sister, from her friends. And I know nobody wants to go into this issue of self-respect and self-efficacy and whatever and try to find something simple like, well, let's just transfer money. Well, we've been transferring money. But, again, it's that nature that what we've seen with a lot of young people at a very early age is that if there is pride within that family or within the collective of a tribe or whatever, then the nature of that relationship really improves. MARTIN: Moises, you've reported on this as part of the data that we're talking about here. You know, one of the things you pointed out is that the money wasn't just money. I mean, this was not - it didn't just appear. These income supplements came from a business owned by the beneficiaries. The tribe decided how to do it. The supplements were not enough for members to avoid working entirely, but they were unconditional. How did people look at this? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: This is such a unique situation with the Cherokee. It's more like shareholders of a business. They own the business, and they created the business to some degree. And they receive the benefits of it. And then they also took half the money and put it toward social services in a kind of - I mean, you might even call it, like, a mini  social - a mini Sweden, let's call it, where they have all these social benefits like addiction counseling and various other things that are essentially free. And they are in charge of those things. And what's interesting is that in other science, having a sense of control over your destiny actually has all these biologically measurable things that are healthy for you, that are good for your brain development, that are good, you know. And they can see them sort of when they look in your blood, so to speak, and how your genes express. And that's what's really remarkable that this thing that's sort of a soft concept is actually - you're able to measure it these days with hard science. MARTIN: Moises, can I ask how has this reporting been received? I understand that you were - the point that you wanted to make is that a lot of this research comes from a very specific set of circumstances in a specific place with specific people, which is the Cherokee nation. But has this research penetrated the thinking about addressing poverty elsewhere? VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Yes. Well, there's other work being done in the developing world using what's called conditional cash transfers. They basically just give money to poor people but with certain conditions - usually that you attend nutritional classes or that sort of thing or child development classes. And they actually show beneficial outcomes with the caveat that they usually tend to show outcomes when there's also infrastructure in place like a clinic you know you can come to or a school. So there also has to be this sort of social infrastructure there. And that's an argument - 'cause those are top-down interventions. Those are not exactly the sort of bottom-up interventions we're talking about. And that's not even that - yes, money makes a big difference at certain levels of poverty. MARTIN: And, Mauricio, final thought from you. And I'd like to ask you how would you like us to think about this question going forward? If you were in charge of our thoughts. . . MILLER: I would. . . MARTIN: . . . How would you like us to think about it? MILLER: I would like us to get past the issue of just discussing about poverty 'cause that discussion centers around a certain income level. And, again, this issue of if there's a base, you know, that we could provide people the safety net, etc. , etc. and that what's wrong in this country is really that we kind of lost our social-economic mobility. And there are studies that show we're near the bottom in terms of mobility. So for us, I feel like what we need to do is get people conscious of the fact that there are resources of people, you know, that are resourceful in the community that we're trying to help and that what we need to do is tap that. and we need to invest in it dollar-wise, in terms of connection-wise, in terms of giving them actually the control over it. And the focus needs to be on not getting people above the poverty level, which happens all the time, you know, it really is about, is the next rung of the ladder too far away for families? You know, is our system so fractured that a family can't actually piece their life together to really move ahead and get the kind of mobility that people used to actually exercise when - you know, whether it was African-Americans before and after slavery that built entire townships. We have a huge history before there were any programs, before there were any studies, of people working together. And actually, this country had a history of economic and social mobility. My work is really about trying to take us back to that history and back to those models which really were about people working together, helping each other and investing in that initiative. MARTIN: Mauricio Lim Miller is the founder and CEO of the Family Independence Initiative. Also joining us, Moises Velasquez-Manoff. He's a freelance science reporter. They both joined us from member station KQED in San Francisco. Gentlemen, thank you both so much for speaking with us. VELASQUEZ-MANOFF: Thank you.

One way for magazines, brochures and websites to illustrate a story or a message is with stock photos - those generic images of just about anything you can think of. And those stock photos come mostly from a company called Getty Images. PAMELA GROSSMAN: It's a really unique kind of image because we don't necessarily know how it's going to be used. So one has to be very predictive about how the image is going to look, and what the concept is behind it. MONTAGNE: That's Pamela Grossman, director of visual trends at Getty Images. This week, the company announced it's teaming up with LeanIn. org, the nonprofit foundation created by Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, to update the look of its photos of women. The new collection will contain 2,500 images of modern women. Grossman says the new images update an otherwise stereotypical repository. GROSSMAN: I think there has been a lot of women in power suits with boxing gloves or women in stiletto heels, stepping on men. And that's definitely the kind of work that we are aggressively shifting away from. MONTAGNE: Well, there is one that has been made endless fun of, of a woman sitting at her - sitting at her laptop in a suit, perfect hair, with a cellphone to her ear, and she's got a fork - eating salad. GROSSMAN: Absolutely - we all kind of giggle ourselves about the woman laughing alone, eating salad. I certainly eat my salad, but I have rarely laughed when doing so. MONTAGNE: And it's a little hard to eat and talk. But so that image, which has now has a total life on the Web and all kinds of parodies of it, that image is gone. Is that what you're saying? And there's a new image replacing it. What would that be? GROSSMAN: I think a new image of a woman multitasking would be somebody who maybe has her arms filled with - certainly a tablet or some kind of creative plans, and then she's also engaged in a conversation. You know, certainly she still looks busy, but it's a little bit more subtle of a visual read. MONTAGNE: Give us just another example of the new line of stock photos. GROSSMAN: So in the LeanIn collection on GettyImages. com, you'll find really powerful athletes; women involved in robotics; mothers who actually look really modern and contemporary, as opposed to a much more stagnant, cliched image of motherhood. MONTAGNE: How do you mean modern rather than stagnant? GROSSMAN: I think the older model would be either that the mother looked incredibly harried. And she would be juggling a dinner plate in one hand and a baby in the other. Sometimes even more arms would be Photoshopped onto her, to show just how, indeed, she was juggling it all. MONTAGNE: And a briefcase, just to remind you she was working. GROSSMAN: That's exactly right. Where the images of motherhood that we were careful to choose for the LeanIn collection, the mothers just feel incredibly dynamic. They seem interesting; they seem like they have more going on in their lives. They really feel like they have contemporary style, and they're engaged and energetic. MONTAGNE: Why is this initiative coming now? GROSSMAN: One of the interesting things that we know is that it's primarily women who are the users of social media. And that means that it's women who are creating these images of themselves and their actual lives, and who are demanding to have these images reflected now in advertising and in media. MONTAGNE: Well, when you say women are demanding, what does that exactly mean? GROSSMAN: Virtually every conversation I've been having, at least for the last three years, has been our client asking for these much more authentic images that don't feel posed or staged or contrived in any way, but that actually feel much more relatable and much more authentic.

I'm Audie Cornish. We're not too far into 2014, but already this year's been a tough one for some big retail chains. J. C. Penney is closing 33 stores. Macy's is laying off 2,500 workers and Sears announced it's closing its flagship store in Chicago this spring. The moves will mean a glut of excess space and as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, that's just one of several forces changing the face of retail. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Jason Moser focuses on one key number in retail: revenue per employee. In Amazon's case, every person the company employs generates an average of $800,000 in sales. For Best Buy? The number is much less than half that. JASON MOSER: What that means is Amazon is able to do a lot more with a lot less. NOGUCHI: Moser is an analyst at Motley Fool One. He says that inefficiency in legacy brick-and-mortar chains is bleeding some iconic brands. MOSER: Does the world really need a Sears at this point? I mean, I don't think it really does, actually, and I think the numbers bear that out. And I think the same really goes for J. C. Penney. NOGUCHI: Retail is, along with the rest of the economy, recovering. Vacancy rates at shopping centers are low. But analysts like Moser say that belies some dramatic changes going on in the industry. MICHAEL BURDEN: And I think that over the course of the next decade, I am counting on the retail space to look very, very different than it does today. NOGUCHI: Michael Burden agrees. Burden is a principal with Excess Space Retail Services, a company whose job it is to figure out what to do with unused retail space. He says the footprint of stores is shrinking because consumers are shopping online more. And technology has streamlined inventory systems, making them more efficient, so stores need far less room to keep stock. BURDEN: And that translates into the need for less space. NOGUCHI: And that is creating demand for what might be called smaller boxes as well as a dilemma as to what to do with some of the old big box space. Burden says some of it might be repurposed as warehouses for mega-retailers like Amazon and Wal-Mart. But Burden says those in far out suburbs or in rural areas pose the greatest risk of becoming ghost boxes. BURDEN: The more rural it is, the less likely that there is a need or an ability for another single tenant to come in and utilize the space. In those markets in particular, you are going to be looking at churches, bingo places, flea markets, medical uses, call centers. NOGUCHI: One old Wal-Mart in suburban Milwaukee is now the Ridge Community Church. Lead pastor Mark Weigt says there was some skepticism about whether religion could fit in a space designed for retail. For starters, it meant sharing a plot with the new adjacent Wal-Mart. MARK WEIGT: People to get to the new Wal-Mart actually drive through a driveway that's connected to our property. NOGUCHI: But the location was central, and the cost unbeatable. WEIGT: The beauty of a big box is once the demolition from the interior standpoint is taken care of, you just have to work around the posts. NOGUCHI: Is there anything that looks reminiscent of a Wal-Mart now? WEIGT: Most of it, oddly enough. NOGUCHI: The old Subway sandwich shop took new form as the church kitchen. The floors and the ceilings were simply repainted. And the church plans to lease the remaining two-thirds of the still-unoccupied remaining space to other retailers. It's not just the buildings that are getting revamped. Maureen McAvey says there's a deeper shift happening where retail is becoming much more integrated with housing, especially in cities. McAvey is a fellow at the Urban Land Institute, an urban planning nonprofit. She says in previous decades, homes, stores and offices were usually designed to be driving distances away from one another. Now, she says, that trend is reversing. You can find evidence of the trend in places like Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, a classic office park. MAUREEN MCAVEY: That's having a new master plan being developed where it will become much more mixed use, adding shopping, adding restaurants, adding residential. NOGUCHI: We are standing in another such example, the new Wal-Mart near the Capitol in Washington, D. C. Above the store there are 200 residential units. MCAVEY: Eighty percent of all the jobs in the country are basically in cities, and it's where the growth is. NOGUCHI: So it's no surprise that retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target, are trying to adapt their models to suit urban areas, with their smaller, more expensive lots that don't have as much parking. Along another stop of our retail tour, McAvey stands in front of a construction site in Bethesda, Maryland slated for more mixed retail and residential development. She says demand from baby boomers and the millennial generation is also driving the remaking of city life. MCAVEY: And on both sides of those demographic barbells, these are groups who want to be close to restaurants, they want to be close to places to exercise, and they don't want to be tied down to the yard and mowing grass and all of those things. NOGUCHI: In decades past, McAvey says, people considered it declasse to live above a store. But social tastes change. And retail development simply follows that lead.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. A new report out this afternoon poured some gasoline on the already raging debate over whether to raise the minimum wage. The report from the Congressional Budget Office says boosting the federal minimum to $10. 10 an hour, as President Obama has proposed, would lift 900,000 people out of poverty. But it would also cost about half-a-million jobs. NPR's White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us now to talk about the CBO report. And, Scott, that sounds like a pretty big tradeoff. A lot of low-wage workers would get a raise. But a lot of people would also get pink slips. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: That's right, Audie. For the vast majority of low-wage workers, a higher minimum would be a good thing. CBO says by 2016, when the increase is fully phased in, some 25 million people would see a boost in their pay checks. That extra money in their pockets could also increase demand and give a further boost to economy over all. But CBO estimates there would be a downside, for some workers who either lose their job or are not able to find a job at the new higher wage. And the midpoint estimate of that would be half a million fewer jobs in 2016. CORNISH: And how is the White House responding? President Obama and his fellow Democrats have made raising the minimum wage a centerpiece of their economic agenda. HORSLEY: Yeah, hiking the wage is really popular, certainly with Democrats and Independents but Republicans too. So politically, the White House thinks they have a winner here. And the CBO report could pour a little cold water on that. White House economic advisor Gene Sperling took a cafeteria approach to the report out today. He embraced the findings about higher incomes for millions of families at the low end of the income ladder. But he said forecaster at CBO were wildly off the mark in their estimate of job losses. GENE SPERLING: Look, a Congressional Budget Office is a very professional place. But sometimes they're wrong and this is one of those times. HORSLEY: Now, we should say there's a lot of uncertainty in the CBO forecast. Forecasters say it's possible there would be almost no jobs lost with the higher minimum. On the other hand, there could be as many as a million fewer jobs in 2016. So that tells you just how little precision there is here. CORNISH: We've had a lot of experience with minimum wage increases in the past. Why is there so much uncertainty this time around? HORSLEY: Well, CBO says this increase would be different than some of those we've seen in the past. Most importantly, it would be bigger. It could go from seven and a quarter, which is the federal minimum now, all the way to 10. 10 an hour. That's a 39 percent increase. Now, it would come in stages, not all at once, but it's a pretty big boost. And so, CBO thinks employers might be more sensitive to that, than they some smaller increases that Congress has OK'd in the past. For comparison purposes, CBO also tried to estimate what would happen if you raise the minimum just to, say, $9 an hour. That's something the president proposed last year. And in that scenario, forecasters said the income gains for those at the bottom would be smaller you'd only bring about 300,000 people out of poverty, rather than 900,000. But the job losses would be smaller too - only about 100,000 instead of half a million. CORNISH: Now, supporters have also talked about indexing the wage to inflation, so minimum-wage workers would get an automatic cost of living adjustment. What does that do to the numbers? HORSLEY: Well, it's a mixed picture. On the one hand, if employers knew that they were going to have to pay their low-wage workers more year after year, they might be more inclined for an alternative way of doing things. So the job losses might be higher - that's the approach that the CBO takes. Proponents, of indexing the wage, on the other hand, say: Look, pegging the wage to inflation would give employers predictability, which is something business people always say they're interested in. So they think that this could actually lead to a smaller decrease in the number of jobs. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thank you. HORSLEY: My pleasure, Audie. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. A new report out this afternoon poured some gasoline on the already raging debate over whether to raise the minimum wage. The report from the Congressional Budget Office says boosting the federal minimum to $10. 10 an hour, as President Obama has proposed, would lift 900,000 people out of poverty. But it would also cost about half-a-million jobs. NPR's White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us now to talk about the CBO report. And, Scott, that sounds like a pretty big tradeoff. A lot of low-wage workers would get a raise. But a lot of people would also get pink slips. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: That's right, Audie. For the vast majority of low-wage workers, a higher minimum would be a good thing. CBO says by 2016, when the increase is fully phased in, some 25 million people would see a boost in their pay checks. That extra money in their pockets could also increase demand and give a further boost to economy over all. But CBO estimates there would be a downside, for some workers who either lose their job or are not able to find a job at the new higher wage. And the midpoint estimate of that would be half a million fewer jobs in 2016. CORNISH: And how is the White House responding? President Obama and his fellow Democrats have made raising the minimum wage a centerpiece of their economic agenda. HORSLEY: Yeah, hiking the wage is really popular, certainly with Democrats and Independents but Republicans too. So politically, the White House thinks they have a winner here. And the CBO report could pour a little cold water on that. White House economic advisor Gene Sperling took a cafeteria approach to the report out today. He embraced the findings about higher incomes for millions of families at the low end of the income ladder. But he said forecaster at CBO were wildly off the mark in their estimate of job losses. GENE SPERLING: Look, a Congressional Budget Office is a very professional place. But sometimes they're wrong and this is one of those times. HORSLEY: Now, we should say there's a lot of uncertainty in the CBO forecast. Forecasters say it's possible there would be almost no jobs lost with the higher minimum. On the other hand, there could be as many as a million fewer jobs in 2016. So that tells you just how little precision there is here. CORNISH: We've had a lot of experience with minimum wage increases in the past. Why is there so much uncertainty this time around? HORSLEY: Well, CBO says this increase would be different than some of those we've seen in the past. Most importantly, it would be bigger. It could go from seven and a quarter, which is the federal minimum now, all the way to 10. 10 an hour. That's a 39 percent increase. Now, it would come in stages, not all at once, but it's a pretty big boost. And so, CBO thinks employers might be more sensitive to that, than they some smaller increases that Congress has OK'd in the past. For comparison purposes, CBO also tried to estimate what would happen if you raise the minimum just to, say, $9 an hour. That's something the president proposed last year. And in that scenario, forecasters said the income gains for those at the bottom would be smaller you'd only bring about 300,000 people out of poverty, rather than 900,000.

Now we want to take a look at the economy, and we wanted to focus today on people who have been unemployed for a while. There are currently 3. 6 million Americans who've been unemployed for more than six months. That's according to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor statistics. And that's an improvement from, say, 2010 when some 6. 4 million people were counted as long-term unemployed. But there's a dark cloud to this silver lining. Even if these workers do eventually find work, they will probably earn much less in the long run than people who were unemployed for a shorter period of time. We wanted to talk about this, so we've called, once again, Sudeep Reddy. He is an economics editor for the Wall Street Journal. Sudeep, welcome back. Thanks for joining us. SUDEEP REDDY: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So when we say that long-term unemployed people end up earning less, how much are we talking about? REDDY: We're talking about a fairly significant difference. People who obviously are continuously employed are doing the best off. Even if you're unemployed for a short period of time - let's say, less than six months - research has found that over the course of decades, your pay might be 10 percent lower than it would have been otherwise. That's significant. If you're long-term unemployed - six months or more - then over - it can take a couple of decades before you even narrow that gap. And even if you narrow the gap a bit, the studies that have been done show that it's as much as a third less as you would be making otherwise if you had been continuously employed. MARTIN: Now why would that be? I mean, is there a theory about this? Is it people feel like if they've been long-term unemployed, they have less negotiating strength up front so people - employers are inclined to pay them less? You know, why would that be? REDDY: It's two problems. One is the negotiating ability. If you've been unemployed for six months or more, you're going to be really almost desperate to get a job. And you're going to take whatever you can get, at that point. In some cases, people are taking jobs below their skill set. And so they automatically drop down from where they would have been earning anyway just to make sure they get a job of some kind. And so that's a notch down already. The bigger problem people who are long-term unemployed are finding is that they just can't even get a job at all. Employers are looking at stacks and stacks of resumes these days and applications, and they have a lot of people to choose from. They're less likely to choose from people who have been unemployed for a long time. There have been attempts to deal with this, but not really successful attempts to deal with this problem. MARTIN: What are some of those attempts? That's what I was going to ask you next. I understand that there are certain administration officials who have started jawboning this issue, you know, as it were, suggesting to employers that they should not discriminate - and I'm putting, you know, air quotes here because I don't know that they're really using the word discriminate - against workers who are long-term unemployed. So talk a little bit about what some of those strategies are, even if they haven't worked. . . REDDY: You. . . MARTIN: . . . Up to this point. REDDY: You actually heard this from President Obama. In the latest State of the Union address, he announced an initiative to encourage employers to not discriminate - to use that word again - against people who are long-term unemployed. It's really - that is just a voluntary pledge from major employers to say, we're going to judge people based on their credentials and their qualifications. That's - it's unenforceable. MARTIN: So what's he doing? Is he calling them up and saying - you know, what exactly does that mean? REDDY: The companies have signed a pledge saying that they would not discriminate because it is in their policies already to judge people based on qualifications. But if you are a hiring manager, if you're somebody who's sitting there trying to judge between a few different applicants, you're probably going to choose somebody who had a job more recently rather than somebody who might've been out of work for a longer time. The reason long-term unemployment matters so much is because skills can be degraded so easily. If you're out of touch with an office environment, if you're out of touch with your normal skills, then you tend to withdraw a little bit. You tend to be just a step behind other people. That's why it's so important to have skills training while people are unemployed, and that's why it's so important to at least attempt to stay active in whatever your career field is. MARTIN: The White House says that more than 300 companies have signed pledges to undertake, quote, \"best practices for hiring the long-term unemployed,\" unquote. And the president is also planning, we understand, to sign a presidential memorandum on Friday directing the federal government to follow these rules with its own hiring practices. But what about - are there any strategies, Sudeep, that individuals can employ to try to overcome this, you know, whatever it is - this kind of mindset or barrier or whatever it is? REDDY: The most important thing is to make sure that you're keeping your skills up to date. And people - I've talked to people who've been unemployed for a year or two because their industry has been hit hard, and so they wait a long time. You spend a lot of time looking for work instead of trying to figure out how to make sure your skills are up to date. And a lot of things can happen in the economy. You can see in any industry, over the course of a year or two, major changes can happen. And that's what employers are looking for to make sure they're going to have a worker who's always staying up to date on these kinds of things. MARTIN: So, you know, the conventional wisdom has been that if you are unemployed, you need to address job hunting as a full-time job. I mean, does your reporting suggest that that might not be the best strategy, that skills - maintaining skills and other things like that might actually be more to your advantage than continuing to look for work in the same field or something of that sort? REDDY: If you're going to end up as somebody who is unemployed for a long time, then that's something you really have to take into consideration. What we've found is people who are unemployed for a short period of time - weeks or months - are usually not at a huge disadvantage in something like that because they might take some bit of a pay hit, but they're not going to take some devastating drop in pay as a result of it. And those are the cases where you do OK. If you're out for an even longer period, you kind of have to start reevaluating what you're doing, whether your job search is even going to pursue on the same course. A lot of people go back to school. That's one way to do it, to make sure you get through the spell of unemployment. The problem here is of course when you're unemployed, you need money. And what we're seeing in the social support system, the government is pulling back - the federal government is pulling back on how much support you're going to get if you're unemployed for a long period of time. The debate we've been having for the last few months about unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work for six months or more, that's all playing a part into this, where eventually if you're stuck in this kind of situation, you force yourself to just make a decision and get a job - any job you can get. MARTIN: Just briefly, let me just mention that the president has already signed that memorandum that he suggested - that you mentioned - that he first talked about in the State of the Union. And he's obviously gone ahead and signed that. So finally, you've done a deep dive into this back in 2011. Has anything changed that you want to tell us about? REDDY: Unfortunately, not much has changed for the people who are still stuck out there. You have more people who have gone on to disability benefits. You have more people who ultimately decided that they are going to take a lower-paying job. And this has consequences all the way down the ladder. If you're a higher-skilled worker and you take a lower-paying job, you're displacing somebody who might have lower skills, and they can't find a job as a result. And these are conditions that can, as we said, play out for decades. And that's the real long-term trauma of an unemployment spell like we've had. MARTIN: And it also ends up in your retirement account later on, you know. REDDY: Indeed. MARTIN: That was Wall Street Journal economics editor Sudeep Reddy with us once again in Washington.

The documents show Fed policymakers struggling to understand and respond to failing Wall Street banks and a global financial system in turmoil. NPR's John Ydstie has been reading through the transcripts and joins us now. Hey there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So we've had these minutes, at least - right? - from most of these meetings, for years. What do we learn from the transcripts? YDSTIE: Well, what we get is the actual dialogue and debate, the back and forth between Fed Chairman Bernanke and the other policymakers. So, you know, we get a much more human picture of what was going on. CORNISH: So what was the tone, I mean, given what these policymakers were facing? Were they frantic, calm, somewhere in the middle? YDSTIE: Well, you know, you'd expect some pretty dramatic moments. But the rhetoric is really quite restrained, not hair-on-fire kind of stuff. Mostly what you get is policymakers struggling to understand the full scope of the threat, and what to do about it. Now, as early as the Jan. 9th meeting, Chairman Bernanke does talk about the threat of something more than a garden-variety recession. But for much of the year, policymakers don't seem as aware as they should be about what they're facing. Now, of course, we get to criticize them with the help of 20/20 hindsight. CORNISH: Now there are a mountain of transcripts, but you've got a few of them - right? - from a dozen different meetings. Is there one that really stands out? YDSTIE: Well, that would be the Sept. 16th meeting, which occurred just a couple days after the Wall Street bank Lehman Bros. failed. And remember, neither the Fed nor the Treasury stepped in to rescue Lehman. Bernanke had concluded that the Fed didn't have the authority to do it. So at that September meeting, board members were discussing the implications of the failure. Tom Hoenig, the - then the Kansas City Fed chairman, says: I think what we did with Lehman was the right thing because the market was beginning to play the Treasury and the Fed. But Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, says: I think it's too early to know. We took a calculated bet. If we have a run on money market funds, that may not look nearly so good. And a couple days later, there was a run on money market funds, and the economy began to really tank. So now, a lot of people think that allowing Lehman to go down was the biggest mistake that the Fed made. CORNISH: Do you get the feeling from this transcript that there was a real sense of urgency in that meeting? YDSTIE: Well, you know, it's kind of a mixture. There's actually a bit of joking around, maybe to break the tension in the room. It is clear that the policymakers know there's a huge crisis in the financial markets. After all, Tim Geithner, who was then president of the New York Fed, isn't at the meeting because he's in New York, finalizing the government takeover of AIG, the giant insurance firm. But it's also clear they're still trying to understand the full dangers to the broader economy. Janet Yellen, the current Fed chair who was then president of the San Francisco Fed, says she is decidedly more pessimistic about the economic outlook. And then she points out that discretionary spending is softening. For example, she says, East Bay plastic surgeons and dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures. Of course, it got a lot worse than that. CORNISH: Now, where does Chairman Bernanke come down in that discussion of economic implications and what to do? YDSTIE: Well, at that September meeting, Bernanke says: I think our policy is looking pretty good. They'd already cut interest rates earlier in the year, so the Fed officials decide to leave their benchmark interest rate at 2 percent. Now just three months later, in December, Bernanke's tone is much more sober. He says: We are at a historic juncture, both the U. S. economy and the Federal Reserve. It's not a moderate recession, and it's not a normal financial downturn. At that meeting, the Fed cuts its rate to essentially, zero. CORNISH: NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Audie.

Of course, it got a lot worse than that. CORNISH: Now, where does Chairman Bernanke come down in that discussion of economic implications and what to do? YDSTIE: Well, at that September meeting, Bernanke says: I think our policy is looking pretty good. They'd already cut interest rates earlier in the year, so the Fed officials decide to leave their benchmark interest rate at 2 percent. Now just three months later, in December, Bernanke's tone is much more sober. He says: We are at a historic juncture, both the U. S. economy and the Federal Reserve. It's not a moderate recession, and it's not a normal financial downturn. At that meeting, the Fed cuts its rate to essentially, zero. CORNISH: NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie.

TIMOTHY MAYOPOULOS: I'm very proud of what our employees have achieved, and I'm very, very happy for the taxpayers. NOGUCHI: For the past couple of years, Fannie Mae has been required to deposit all its profits into the U. S. Treasury. And last quarter, a combination of tax benefits, large settlements with banks, and an improving housing market helped. MAYOPOULOS: Our total dividend payments will be $121. 1 billion, which is $5 billion more than the $116. 1 billion we received in taxpayers' support.

The government acting through Fannie, its sibling firm Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration, guarantees well over 90 percent of mortgages. In the past, private money from lenders funded a much a bigger chunk of mortgages. But right now, Petrou says the government is reaping nearly all the gains because it's also bearing all the risks. PETROU: It's still a very unnatural business model. It's the result of something very weird in the wake of the crisis that still needs to be resolved by Congress. NOGUCHI: And Congress is indeed entertaining proposals. In addition to existing legislation, Petrou says there could be another bill introduced in the next week or two. All proposals aim to bring private capital back into mortgage finance and wind down Fannie and Freddie. They differ in how much they would preserve the role of government in the mortgage market.

CARLOS WATSON: Arun, great to be with you. RATH: So here's a situation that anybody who's been a freelancer in the last 10 years has faced: you need that precious Wi-Fi at the coffee shop, but how many cappuccinos do you have to buy to justify sitting there all day? And finally, someone saw an opportunity there, right? WATSON: So for those who are not shameless, like you and me, and are willing just to buy one and sit there for eight hours, there's now a new option called pay-as-you-go cafes, where instead of paying for the coffee, you actually just pay for the amount of time you're there. Some of the spots are only literally a nickel a minute, so about $3 an hour. But it's taken off in Europe as well as South America. RATH: It's great because, I mean, if you've been in that situation, as I have, you're doing this constant, like, moral math in your head. Well, it's not too crowded, so I can hang around a bit longer or do I need to have a second one to justify my spot or - it's surprising nobody thought about this before. WATSON: One of the places called Urban Station has been around since 2009. And the other place called Ziferblat, which now you can enjoy in London, among other places, really got its start in Russia. But a lot of young people and a lot of just freelancers in general are finding this makes all the sense in the world. And for less than five bucks an hour, I have kind of a clean, safe place to do my work without any kind of moral shame or discomfort. RATH: It's nice to work without moral shame. So I'm hearing Russia, Europe, Latin America - so are we going to get some of these in America? WATSON: You know, at the moment, we have not. And the answer's kind of simple - it hasn't been profitable enough. Again, people are charging the equivalent of about a nickel a minute. And, you know, when you talk about some of the real estate prices and other things here in the States, it may be harder to make it work here than it is, say, in Istanbul or Bogota. RATH: So that double Frappuccino or whatever might actually make more money than charging you for the space. WATSON: You know, indeed. RATH: Well, that's too bad. Well, hopefully, it'll work out here soon enough. Finally, you have a very interesting story about a biotech boom in a place that people might not expect. I'll set it up by quoting \"Spinal Tap\": \"Hello, Cleveland. \"(LAUGHTER)WATSON: Cleveland, which is my hometown, by the way, Arun. . . RATH: I did not know that. WATSON: Very, very true. RATH: I'll hold the jokes. (LAUGHTER)WATSON: Please do. It is no longer the mistake by the lake. We now refer to it as the fury by the Erie. While lots of folks thought about the Rust Belt and thought about the struggling manufacturing sector there, a whole new area has boomed, and in particular medical technology companies that are spinning out of the Cleveland Clinic and several other universities there and now are providing just under half-a-million jobs. RATH: Wow. I know about this because I actually have visited the Cleveland Clinic. They have a brain health center that's actually in Nevada, of all places, doing, you know, amazing cutting-edge work. WATSON: The Cleveland Clinic recognize that a lot of the brilliant research they were doing had practical application, and close to 100 companies have spun out of some of the work that's happened there and its surrounding institutions. And, in fact, the city of Cleveland has set aside a 1,600-acre parcel where you see lots of innovative companies, including one that we profiled this week called HeartLab, are doing lots of good and important work.

I'm Melissa Block. The digital currency bitcoin has hit a major hurdle. A leading exchange for bitcoin has halted all transactions and has frozen customer accounts. This exchange is called Mt. Gox. And earlier today, it temporarily disappeared from the Internet. The happened amidst reports that Mt. Gox was hit by an alleged theft that could amount to about six percent of all the bitcoins in circulation. NPR's Steve Henn joins me to talk about what happened and what it means for the future of the cyber-currency. And Steve, if this was indeed a digital heist, just how big was it? STEVE HENN, BYLINE: Well, it may well have been enormous. There are widespread but still unconfirmed reports that roughly 740,000 bitcoins were stolen. This was sort of a slow motion robbery that occurred apparently largely undetected over a number of months. And if those reports are accurate, at current exchange rates, those bitcoins are worth somewhere between $350 and $400 million. BLOCK: Wow. So we're going to get more in a little bit into how that alleged theft happened. Before we do that, why don't you try to walk us through just how bitcoin works? HENN: Sure. Well, you know, one of the defining characteristics of the digital world is that stuff is easy to copy. I can send you a photo and keep a copy for myself. I can make millions copies. But this is actually a big problem for digital currencies. If I'd buy something from you with a bitcoin or a digital coin, it's tough to ensure that I don't use that same coin to buy something else from, say, Robert Siegel. BLOCK: For example. (LAUGHTER)HENN: Right. (LAUGHTER)HENN: In the conventional banking system - trusted third parties, like banks and credit card companies - keep ledgers to make sure I can't do that. But bitcoin solved this problem by creating a public record of every transaction. So if I buy something from you with a bitcoin, a record of that transaction is shared and recorded across the entire bitcoin network - everyone knows. The theory is that public ledger make it impossible for me to spend a bitcoin twice. Because after I spent it, everyone would know that coin was actually yours. You know, one of the appeals of this system is that it eliminates those trusted third parties, those banks and credit card companies, and at least in theory could make moving money around the world much, much cheaper. BLOCK: OK. But wait, Steve. If you're telling me that every transaction is supposed to be recorded in a publicly-shared ledger, right, how does it happen that thieves could apparently manage to steal, what you say, could be $350 or $400 million from this exchange, Mt. Gox? HENN: Well, that's a great question. So sharing and recording all these transactions on the bitcoin network it turns out takes some time. So for this and a couple other reasons, the community developed kind of a short-cut: A temporary ID number that would be attached to each transaction and making tracking transactions in the short-term easier. But these temporary ID numbers can be faked. Apparently people were approaching Mt. Gox with fake ID numbers, telling the exchange they hadn't received the bitcoins they were owed. And then Mt. Gox was relying on these numbers and giving the thieves real bitcoins. This may well have drained Mt. Gox's resources to the point were it's now insolvent. BLOCK: So for the people who think that bitcoin is the future, this digital currency is the future, does this set them back? Does it make them think, oh, you know, maybe not so much? HENN: Well, you know, it's certainly a setback. But I think it's an open question about whether or not bitcoin is dead. You know, any currency, any banking system only works because people believe in it and trust it. And at its peak, Mt. Gox was processing more than a billion transactions a day. It was this key part of this economy. So when news broke that Mt. Gox was possibly bankrupt, I called around to big bitcoin investors and asked if it was too big to fail, if they were going to bail it out. And I got back a resounding no. Mt. Gox was pretty widely perceived to be mismanaged. Several big investors in the bitcoin economy told me that they hoped that the next exchange would be regulated and based here in the U. S. BLOCK: That's NPR's Steve Henn, we were talking about troubles for Mt. Gox. That's one of the big trading platforms for the digital currency bitcoin. Steve, thanks. HENN: My pleasure.

That includes work done not only at home but anywhere outside one's regular office. The study also looks at who teleworks. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, the finding may surprise you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: When I say remote worker, who do you picture? Maybe a harried mom in her bathrobe, a millennial at a coffee shop? Wrong, says workplace flexibility strategist Cali Williams Yost. CALI WILLIAMS YOST: A remote worker, someone who does most of their work outside of their employer's location, is not a woman, is not a parent and is not a Gen-Y millennial. LUDDEN: In fact, the study she commissioned finds three out of four remote workers are men of all ages, just as likely to have kids as not. Yost and others attribute part of this gender gap to the kind of work women are more likely to do, jobs that can't be done remotely; think teachers and nurses. Her study also finds women are much more likely to work in a cubby or open office space rather than a private office. YOST: And those cubicle, open-office-space workers were significantly more likely to say that they did not increase or improve their flexibility last year for fear of being perceived as not working hard and fear it will hurt their career. LUDDEN: To test this, I walk into a Starbucks near my home in Washington. There in the back is a middle-aged man with a grande and a laptop. MICHAEL GERSON: I do have an office, but I do most of my writing in coffee shops. LUDDEN: Michael Gerson is a columnist who writes for The Washington Post. But even when he was head of speechwriting with a nice office at the White House, he says he often worked at Starbucks. GERSON: When you're in the office, people are asking you to do things. When you're at the Starbucks, you're both with people but isolated, and can actually get things done. LUDDEN: So telework helps people escape the chaos of the office. But what about that modern quest to balance the conflicting chaos of work and family? JENNIFER GLASS: For most people, most of the time, telecommuting is simply a facilitator of longer work hours. LUDDEN: Jennifer Glass, of the University of Texas at Austin ,studied thousands of teleworkers over two decades. She found that for most, that remote work was overtime, above and beyond the at least 40 hours they'd put in at the office. GLASS: We tend to give people autonomy and control over their work hours as they ascend the career ladder and get in more and more upper-level positions of responsibility. The problem with that is that the work hours also increase. So all that flexibility is really just about where you're going to do your 80 hours of work per week. LUDDEN: Glass has also found that when workers ask for a flexible work schedule, managers are far more likely to say yes to men and no to women. All this helps explain a conundrum experts see. Remote work and flexible hours may be more popular and accepted than ever, but they still seem hardest to get for those who need them the most. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.

LUDDEN: To test this, I walk into a Starbucks near my home in Washington. There in the back is a middle-aged man with a grande and a laptop. MICHAEL GERSON: I do have an office, but I do most of my writing in coffee shops. LUDDEN: Michael Gerson is a columnist who writes for The Washington Post. But even when he was head of speechwriting with a nice office at the White House, he says he often worked at Starbucks. GERSON: When you're in the office, people are asking you to do things. When you're at the Starbucks, you're both with people but isolated, and can actually get things done. LUDDEN: So telework helps people escape the chaos of the office. But what about that modern quest to balance the conflicting chaos of work and family? JENNIFER GLASS: For most people, most of the time, telecommuting is simply a facilitator of longer work hours. LUDDEN: Jennifer Glass, of the University of Texas at Austin ,studied thousands of teleworkers over two decades. She found that for most, that remote work was overtime, above and beyond the at least 40 hours they'd put in at the office. GLASS: We tend to give people autonomy and control over their work hours as they ascend the career ladder and get in more and more upper-level positions of responsibility. The problem with that is that the work hours also increase. So all that flexibility is really just about where you're going to do your 80 hours of work per week. LUDDEN: Glass has also found that when workers ask for a flexible work schedule, managers are far more likely to say yes to men and no to women. All this helps explain a conundrum experts see. Remote work and flexible hours may be more popular and accepted than ever, but they still seem hardest to get for those who need them the most.

I'm David Greene. The Affordable Care Act will change the way millions of Americans think about their jobs. That's essentially what the Congressional Budget Office has said in its assessment of the law's effect on the economy. They think the law will give some people the option to retire early and others the flexibility to work less. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, this is already happening. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Karin Warren hated her full-time job as a technical writer for a technology company in Corvallis, Oregon. KARIN WARREN: I was experiencing some pretty heavy job burnout. It's a very stressful job, and I was very unhappy. YDSTIE: It was made worse by a bout of breast cancer in 2012. Warren, who's single, wanted to work less, but couldn't.  She needed her employer-sponsored health insurance. Then in November of 2012, when President Obama was reelected, Warren says she realized the Affordable Care Act would be implemented, and her situation could change. WARREN: I cried that night. I was so happy, because I knew that was my ticket to freedom. YDSTIE: She quit her job early in 2013, insured herself through Cobra, and then got covered by Obamacare in January of this year. WARREN: So, now I'm working happily a half-time job. I'm more relaxed and feel healthier than I did before. And my health insurance is in place and it's affordable, and I'm in bliss. YDSTIE: Part of the reason Warren's health insurance is affordable is that she earns less at her part-time job and qualifies for a subsidy. Her monthly premium is just $131. WARREN: Without the subsidy, that 131 would be closer to $500. YDSTIE: MIT labor economist David Autor says that the CBO is right: the ACA will incentivize some people to work less. DAVID AUTOR: If we move into a world, all of a sudden, where you can get health care relatively affordably through the individual marketplace, on the one hand, and in addition, you receive a subsidy for that, that's going to cause some people to say, well, I don't need to work as many hours. Or I can choose to not participate at present. YDSTIE: Deciding not to participate is exactly what Todd Ryder did. He was a database administrator in Helena, Montana. TODD RYDER: I've always wanted to and thought about retiring early, and then with this Affordable Care Act situation, it looked kind of promising for me in terms of having that flexibility, you know, of having medical coverage without having to have employment. YDSTIE: Ryder quit his job this month at age 52, and has signed up for health care under the ACA. David Card, a labor economist at UC Berkeley, says there will undoubtedly be some people like Ryder who choose to retire early. But, Card says, the CBO's analysis doesn't take into account some evidence from studies in the real world. Card looked at whether there is an abrupt flood of people quitting their jobs, or reducing to part-time hours when they become eligible for Medicare. He found no abrupt change in employment patterns. DAVID CARD: You might think that the availability of that good insurance would cause them to, if they really were waiting around and just dying to get out of work, that they would stop the minute they got to 65. And you don't see that. YDSTIE: So he wonders whether the Affordable Care Act will actually have the effect of reducing hours worked by the equivalent of two-and-a-half-million jobs by 2024, as the CBO forecasts. Card says right now, it wouldn't be hard to find workers willing to take the hours or jobs being vacated by others. CARD: Right now - and maybe for the next few years, even - that's not going to be the major concern. YDSTIE: But when the economy returns to more normal levels of employment, having some workers withholding their labor will likely slow growth, says David Autor - at least a bit. CARD: I don't think this is enormous, relative to the other types of economic fluctuations that we've seen. YDSTIE: But, Autor adds, the government subsidies will have to be paid by someone, which means taxation somewhere in the economy, and that will reduce economic efficiency. Added dollars spent on health care because of the ACA will create some jobs and growth, and there are some who argue providing health insurance will create happier, healthier and more productive workers. That may turn out to be true, says Autor, and he agrees there are physic benefits to individuals. But so far, he says, there's no hard evidence of actual improvements to health or overall economic activity. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Home sales are slowing nationwide and are now at their lowest point in 18 months. So, does that mean we headed for another housing swoon? Well, NPR's Chris Arnold says that things might be better than they appear. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: OK. Let's start with those layoffs. It's always a sad thing when thousands of people lose their jobs, of course. But a bit counter-intuitively, those people are actually getting laid off because the housing market and the economy have been recovering. GUY CECALA: In the mortgage market, there was a lot more employment than you'd normally see in that market. ARNOLD: That's Guy Cecala, who publishes Inside Mortgage Finance. He says a few years ago, mortgage rates were at record lows and so millions of people were refinancing their home loans to save money. But now with the economy and the housing market recovering, interest rates are naturally rising back up. CECALA: Mortgage originations are dropping like a rock, so people who underwrite, who process mortgages, they just don't have as much business to keep them busy so they're being laid off. ARNOLD: And there could be a silver lining here. Many economists think that lending standards are too tight right now. But now banks might have to compete more for business and make it easier for more people to qualify to buy houses. CECALA: And I expect to start seeing that happen in 2014. ARNOLD: As far as home sales slowing down, in five of the past six months, Americans bought fewer homes than the month before. And sales of existing homes are now at their lowest level in a year and a half. That doesn't sound very good. But those numbers might be getting thrown off, in part by that pesky polar vortex. BILL POWERS: The unusually harsh weather with snowstorms in the eastern half of the United States. ARNOLD: That's Bill Powers who runs Encore Housing. It's a real estate investment and development company. Powers has done very well in real estate. We spoke to him from his house in Aspen, Colorado, where he has his own Picasso hanging on the wall. And right now, Powers is bullish about the future of housing and the economy. POWERS: Absolutely. And I would say there is below average supply and in some markets I would go so far as to say a chronic shortage of new homes available. ARNOLD: Powers says millions of Americans have had to delay getting their own place to live. For example, young people have been living with their parents or a bunch of roommates. In fact, after the housing crash across the entire country, new household formations fell to about half their normal rate. And now that's changing. POWERS: Inevitably these individuals will be purchasing more homes and renting more units. ARNOLD: So, Powers says we need to build a lot more houses and apartments both for people to buy and rent. And right now he's in the process of raising money to build $1. 5 billion worth of new rental housing - that's 7,000 units across five states. As far as where home prices are headed next, that has everything to do with where you live. LOUISE KEELY: Housing has always been and will always be kind of a local phenomenon. ARNOLD: Louise Keely is the chief research officer with the Demand Institute, which is a division of the Conference Board - it tracks the U. S. economy. She says in Jacksonville, Florida prices crashed and are expected to rise back up 20 percent in the next few years. Whereas in Washington, D. C. , prices have stayed strong and will likely only rise 3 percent. Keely's group has just come out with a forecast of prices for the 50 biggest metro areas and profiles of more 2,000 other cities:KEELY: That's 2,200 cities and towns.

S. economy absorbs the impact of winter storms without much trouble. But here we are in March, and from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic to parts of the South, once again people are digging out from another snowstorm. This year, there've been so many storms and long stretches of freezing temperatures, the weather is costing us more than usual. Here's NPR's Chris Arnold. (SOUNDBITE OF BANGING)CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The evening is getting off to a slow start at Il Cortile. It's a restaurant in Manhattan. It's cold outside and heading down to 15 degrees. The doorman is wearing a furry hat. Manager Sal Sambataro says when the weather is better they can pack people in here, including some you've probably heard of. SAL SAMBATARO: It's a family owned Italian restaurant in Little Italy, a great clientele that's been coming here. I have all their pictures here too. Just last week, Bruce Willis was here. Billy Joel. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, 'SCENES FROM AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT')ARNOLD: But what happens when outside that table near the window, it's freezing cold and there's a foot of snow clogging the streets? SAMBATARO: Business is off about 50 percent because of the weather. ARNOLD: How much? SAMBATARO: About 50 percent. ARNOLD: Big 5-0, 50 percent. SAMBATARO: 50 percent loss of business. People don't want to go out. You know, they don't want to go out in the ice and snow and the storms or predicted storms also. Supermarkets might get busy. New Yorkers, anyway, they panic. They run in there, buy milk, bread and eggs like they'll never be able to get it again. ARNOLD: And they're not at his restaurant. Sambataro says that's been tough as rents keep going up around here, even though business has been softer since the recession. It's not just the weather, but all you have to do to see the impact of all this is look out the window. SAMBATARO: And see one, two, three, four of the businesses for rent. All that went out of business this year because, obviously, they can't afford to. . . ARNOLD: Yeah, that's like right across the street, there's a giant red for rent sign. SAMBATARO: Right. Positano, for rent. ARNOLD: If somebody needs a new car or a bigger house for their family, bad weather might keep them home for a while. But they'll eventually go out and buy it anyway. But with restaurants. . . CHRIS CHRISTOPHER: If you stay away a week or two, that doesn't mean when the snowstorm is over with that you'll start eating hamburgers at double the pace. ARNOLD: That's Chris Christopher. He's an economist with IHS Global Insight. He says that restaurants, airlines, hotels, lots of businesses are losing sales this winter. But he says the good news is that with much of the economy, it's more like the car example. People buy things they want or need and they'll still go out and buy them when it stops snowing. CHRISTOPHER: Most things, they do recover quite a bit. ARNOLD: Still, a big problem for economists right now is that a bunch of economic data has been soft; job gains, figures on overall national economic growth and maybe we're blaming too much of that on the weather. Chris Mayer is an economist at Columbia University. He follows housing. CHRIS MAYER: There's no statistical way to figure out, to disentangle two things so we've seen existing home sales fall over the last, you know, six months. ARNOLD: But how much of that is, one, the bad weather or, two, a bunch of other factors, like rising interest rates that make it more expensive to buy a house? Or Mayer thinks it's still too hard to get a mortgage. MAYER: The tight credit and the challenges that people have getting into the housing market could be, you know, biting harder, and there's just no way of knowing. ARNOLD: So for the moment, trying to figure out the direction of the economy is like sailing through the fog and we just don't really know what course we're on until we get past all this bad weather. In the meantime, some economists say that the weather has cost the economy billions of dollars, it's hard to say exactly how much, and one major insurance company says that businesses have filed six times as many claims for weather-related losses as we would see in a normal year.

Headlines tend to read something like: China is buying up Detroit. In fact, there's really not much hard evidence to support that kind of dramatic claim. Michigan Radio's Sarah Cwiek reports that Chinese investors are eyeing Motor City real estate, but they don't seem in a big rush to buy. SARAH CWIEK, BYLINE: When Detroit went bankrupt, it made headlines all over the world. And that's how many people in China found out about the city's incredibly cheap real estate, sparking a lot of excited Internet chatter. And some Detroit real estate agents started talking about growing interest from Chinese property buyers, many of whom wanted to make bulk purchases on the cheap. And finally, a China-based international real estate website listed Detroit as the fourth most-popular U. S. city for Chinese homebuyers. But those rankings came from counting search terms not tracking actual deals. All this added up to some rather dramatic headlines but hard numbers have been elusive. DAVID SZYMANSKI: One of the indicators, of is there actually interest from China, and are the funds flowing into Detroit, would be an indicator of participation in our auctions. CWIEK: That's David Szymanski, chief deputy treasurer for Wayne County. He's talking about the county's annual tax foreclosure auction. Last year, nearly 20,000 properties hit the auction block, the vast majority of them in Detroit. When the auction went online three years ago, investors from all over the world could start bidding. But when Szymanski crunched the latest numbers, he found that 99 percent of buyers are still based in the U. S. And while a tiny portion did go to foreign investors, not one purchase appears to have come from China. Admittedly, this is an imperfect measure. Overseas buyers can hire a U. S. agent to bid on their behalf. And there are lots of other ways to buy property. But Szymanski says all this talk about massive Chinese investment in Detroit real estate seems to have been exaggerated. SZYMANSKI: This thought that the rest of the world is buying Detroit seems to be misplaced. Although I'll be very honest, I want the participation of other countries. I would love to see the money flow in. CWIEK: A lot of people feel that way. Detroit's many abandoned homes and vacant properties are a big reason why the city went bankrupt. And while the idea of a massive Chinese land buying spree in Detroit still seems pretty thin, there are some very strong signs that Chinese investors have a growing interest in the city. At least, Jerry Xu thinks so. He's president of the Detroit Chinese Business Association. Xu says that while most Chinese investment in Detroit thus far has been in the automotive industry, with the bankruptcy, Detroit real estate has also become a hot topic in China. JERRY XU: We have the most beautiful riverfront and we have lots of beautiful buildings, that if you can polish them up, it can be a top-notch building. CWIEK: Xu says it's just getting started. Late last year, a Shanghai-based investment group bought three major, historic commercial buildings in downtown Detroit sight unseen. They couldn't believe the price tag. State and local political leaders have also played a big role in courting Chinese investment, particularly Michigan Governor Rick Snyder who's visited China every year he's been in office. Some people in Detroit aren't thrilled about this. With so much cheap land available, there's fear that lots of big purchases could concentrate ever-more land in wealthy investors' hands. And when those buyers are from overseas, people can get even more uneasy. But that's not a big concern for Detroit resident and property manager Eric Criteser - at least, not yet. Criteser says he's more concerned about finding community-minded investors who do quality work, and less about where the money comes from. Even though his business is still pretty new, he's already hearing from some international investors. ERIC CRITESER: Here I am, a small fry, and I get phone calls from people from Hong Kong. CWIEK: So while this idea that Chinese or other foreign investors are swallowing up Detroit land may be significantly overhyped, people are interested. They're just doing more shopping than buying at the moment. For NPR news, I'm Sarah Cwiek in Detroit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CWIEK: This is NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Since Detroit filed for bankruptcy last summer, there have been lots of stories about money from Chinese investors pouring into the city. Headlines tend to read something like: China is buying up Detroit. In fact, there's really not much hard evidence to support that kind of dramatic claim. Michigan Radio's Sarah Cwiek reports that Chinese investors are eyeing Motor City real estate, but they don't seem in a big rush to buy. SARAH CWIEK, BYLINE: When Detroit went bankrupt, it made headlines all over the world. And that's how many people in China found out about the city's incredibly cheap real estate, sparking a lot of excited Internet chatter. And some Detroit real estate agents started talking about growing interest from Chinese property buyers, many of whom wanted to make bulk purchases on the cheap. And finally, a China-based international real estate website listed Detroit as the fourth most-popular U. S. city for Chinese homebuyers. But those rankings came from counting search terms not tracking actual deals. All this added up to some rather dramatic headlines but hard numbers have been elusive. DAVID SZYMANSKI: One of the indicators, of is there actually interest from China, and are the funds flowing into Detroit, would be an indicator of participation in our auctions. CWIEK: That's David Szymanski, chief deputy treasurer for Wayne County. He's talking about the county's annual tax foreclosure auction.

That's certainly one story of the urban boom, another is this: plenty of neighborhoods, especially low income areas, remain far from those appealing conveniences. This is a challenge Washington, D. C. is confronting, as NPR's Leah Binkovitz reports. LEAH BINKOVITZ, BYLINE: Just a 10 minute drive south of the U. S. Capitol building, across the Anacostia River, sits Congress Heights. The neighborhood, less than two miles long, is home to more than 8,000 people, many in single-family houses. But if you're looking for a sit-down meal, options are scarce. Up Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, just outside the neighborhood's boundaries, is Georgena's. It's a former strip club that serves a gracious soul food menu. It's long been the block's only bar and restaurant. Beyond that, your options are the liquor mart, an IHOP and a couple of carryout places. Still, the city's planning office thinks this busy corridor has potential. So do the people who live here. Donny Seto saw an opportunity about a year ago when he opened his own cell phone store. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER)DANNY SETO: With this particular store, I have a larger variety of merchandise, including D. C. Lottery, scratch tickets, hats, gloves, just a large variety. BINKOVITZ: He's lived in Congress Heights in Southeast, D. C. for six years. It's a largely low-income area. It's also a stable one with century-old churches, a nearby military base and pockets of a professional class. But for potential businesses, low-income can seem an insurmountable hurdle. Seto doesn't see it that way. SETO: As long as you cater to the needs of the customers and you listen to what the customers say and what they want and you bring it into the stores, yes, they will buy it. And they will patronize your business. BINKOVITZ: If it's that simple, why aren't restaurants and retailers popping up along this well-trafficked street? There's more than one answer here, but what it often boils down to can be said in two words: Bulletproof glass. SETO: I get to know the families. I know from the kids, the grandmothers, the parents. That's why I'm not behind bullet proof glass - whereas, a lot of other businesses you go into, everyone has bullet proof glass. Why? What are you so afraid of? BINKOVITZ: For businesses, it's often two things: Actual crime and the perception of crime. Heather Arnold studies great streets for a living. She directs research for the D. C. -based planning and design firm StreetSense. At a Thursday night meeting in the neighborhood, she says one can impact the other. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER)HEATHER ARNOLD: It's almost like if you don't have the confidence in your neighborhood to deserve a vibrant street, then you're not going to strive for it. BINKOVITZ: Crime is a real concern here. Congress Heights had more than 100 violent crimes in the past year. But other trendier nightlife spots in the city with their own crime problems don't have the same reputation. Which leads to the second issue: Perception. Arnold explains that residents often didn't feel Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, really belonged to them. ARNOLD: They didn't think it was representative of their community, they had really in some ways abandoned it a long time ago. BINKOVITZ: When she asked residents to describe the main drag, many said it was unsafe and that they preferred to spend their time - and money - elsewhere. Arnold says there's hope for Congress Heights. That's where the so-called Vibrant Retail Streets Toolkit comes in. Arnold worked with the city planning office to break down the numbers behind great streets around the world. The program then applies those same metrics -things like density, education attainment and daytime population. From there it charts what types of businesses a community can realistically attract. ARNOLD: And I always say to them, I would love an Ann Taylor in my basement, but I don't shop there enough to justify having one in my own house. And so I try to explain to communities that just because you would shop there doesn't mean that there's enough money being spent within your market in order to justify there being a store. BINKOVITZ: Once they know what's in reach, the toolkit gives specific steps to get there. Some are big, like helping stores get zoned for outdoor seating. Others are smaller, like efforts to slow down traffic to make the street more pedestrian-friendly. Arnold is already working with groups like the local Main Street organization, led by Rodney Bunn. At the meeting, Bunn says he believes this could work. RODNEY BUNN: I grew up in Congress Heights, so I know it's a great place to come. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah, it is. BUNN: . . . but, you know, there are some people who still have reservations, you know. I believe we can change that. BINKOVITZ: He says the money and demand is there. Just look at the new Giant supermarket right outside the neighborhood. He says lines there are always long. BUNN: Believe it or not, if we had another Giant somewhere on Martin Luther King Avenue, we could be stealing like half that money. (LAUGHTER)BINKOVITZ: A grocery store? A restaurant?

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. There was some positive economic news today. Job growth in February was stronger than expected. The government's monthly employment report showed 175,000 jobs were added to the economy last month. There were also upward revisions for December and January. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, that improvement comes despite evidence that stormy winter weather may have restrained job growth. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Standard & Poor's economist Beth Ann Bovino says we know the weather had an impact on the job market in February because the government asked people about it in its monthly survey of households. BETH ANN BOVINO: The government asked households, so can you go to work? And if you couldn't go to work, what were the reasons why? There were over 600,000 workers who said they were unable to go to work due to the weather. That was huge. YDSTIE: Normally in February, only about half that number say the weather temporarily kept them from work. Still, the 175,000 jobs added last month was better than most economists had predicted. John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, says the report was a pleasant surprise. JOHN SILVIA: I think it is a very positive signal that while weather has had an impact on job gains in recent months, the underlying strength of the economy is starting to show itself. YDSTIE: That said, February's job growth was still less than the average monthly job growth for all of last year. The unemployment rate did tick up a notch, to 6. 7 percent. That's usually a bad sign. But Beth Ann Bovino says not this time because the uptick was caused by people rejoining the labor force. BOVINO: People coming back to the workforce looking for a job, that could be because of optimism. People left the workforce because they didn't think they could get a job, so they just stopped looking. Well, maybe they've come back feeling more confident that they're going to get a job this time around. YDSTIE: John Silvia agrees. SILVIA: I take it as good signal, more people looking for employment; that that's actually the traditional signal for an improving economy. YDSTIE: Another positive sign in this report is a healthy increase in average hourly earnings in February. Slow wage growth has been restraining consumer spending and the overall recovery. Silvia says this report will likely change some views of where the economy is headed. SILVIA: I think there was sort of a growing pessimism among some people that the economy was weakening pretty dramatically, and I think that's just not playing out. And I think, also, this is very reassuring to the Federal Reserve that, you know, their tapering policy has not had a big negative impact in the economy. YDSTIE: And that means the Fed is likely to continue dialing back its big stimulus. One negative sign in today's report: an increase in the long-term unemployed, from 3. 6 million to 3. 8 million people. Their situation is made more difficult by the expiration of extended unemployment benefits at the end of last year. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the economy has added 175,000 jobs last month. That is more than analysts were expecting. And that came in spite of some freezing weather across the country that some experts thought might put a chill on job growth. We wanted to hear more, so we've called once again Marilyn Geewax. She is a senior business editor here at NPR. Marilyn, welcome back. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So just tell us the news. What did we learn today about employment? GEEWAX: It was a pretty good day. Most economists had been thinking that job growth would be maybe 150,000, and it came in at, you know, a good bit more than that - 175,000. So it's a pretty sharp acceleration from what we had seen in December and January. Those were pretty slack months. So there's more optimism now about the underlying strength of the economy. And we also saw a little bit of wage growth. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. . . GEEWAX: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Because that's a subject you've talked with us about before that even when the economy's adding jobs that wages. . . GEEWAX: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Don't seem to be moving at all. GEEWAX: Now I don't want to suggest that people are running out to buy champagne here. It's up 2. 2 percent. But that's the first time I've seen in a while where it's really ahead of the inflation rate - so great. If people are getting a little bit of a raise and employers are adding more workers given how bad the weather's been this winter, it's pretty encouraging. MARTIN: Well, tell me more about the weather if you would. I mean, a lot of people on the East Coast and in the southeast have been affected by cold weather in this part of - where we are. We just had an unusual snow for this time of the year. Has that had any effect? GEEWAX: It did show up in these numbers. People didn't lose their jobs because of it, but they did lose hours. There were nearly 7 million people who say they usually work full-time, but they got cut to below 35 hours. And that was because a lot of the cases they lost a day of work. For example, a week ago here in D. C. , the place where I get my haircut was closed for a day. Well, now in terms of how - what is the big economic impact? My hair was still growing. I still needed to get it cut. So I just shifted to a different day. So the workers. . . MARTIN: But the people who work that day - let's say the person. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . Who normally cuts your hair was scheduled to work that day, she or he didn't get paid that day. And if you made. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . An appointment for Thursday or the next day. . . GEEWAX: Right, right. MARTIN: . . . And that person wasn't scheduled, they aren't going to get paid for that day. GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: So. GEEWAX: So people did lose some work, but there's some help there that, let's say, you worked in a place where maybe you were in a factory or you're stocking shelves or something. You lost a day of work, but maybe this week you're getting some overtime. So just how it all comes out in the wash, it probably about evens out. But there's some negative impact there. But maybe not as bad as people were thinking because it'll sort of smooth out over time. MARTIN: Well, it may not feel like it I know where you are, but we are heading into spring, which is traditionally a big time for selling houses. GEEWAX: I've heard of that season. MARTIN: Yes, exactly. We've heard that it does exist. Apparently in some places it does get warm. But is there any sense of optimism - or what's the picture for the housing sector? GEEWAX: Yes, even in this jobs report, there were reasons to have some optimism about housing. Construction continued to add jobs. And you would think that almost nobody would've been adding construction jobs. But there they were. In residential construction, they were up about 3,400 jobs. So there's this hope that maybe there's a lot of pent-up demand out there and mortgage rates have ticked down a little bit. They're about 4. 25 percent, and it had been about 4. 5 percent on 30-year mortgages. So if mortgage rates are a little bit easier, construction has continued, so maybe more houses will come onto the market. Those are reasons to be optimistic. And of course, the time for most home shopping, usually April and May are really strong months for that. People want to be able to move in the summertime when the kids are out of school. So people are out there shopping soon. So these are good indications. And even the idea that home prices are rising for buyers, there's some good news even in that. MARTIN: Why is that? GEEWAX: Well, if you're a buyer, you want to have something to buy. MARTIN: You need some choice. GEEWAX: You need some choices. And a big problem we've had is low inventories. That is, people haven't been putting their houses on the market because they've been, what they call, underwater. That is, you owe more on your mortgage than you could sell the house for in recent years. Well, who wants to move and end up owing the bank, you know, on your old mortgage. That's a pretty terrible scenario. So people have been holding off, hoping that house prices would rise. And now they have enough to allow people to soften up and move. So you'll see more inventory. MARTIN: All right. Let's keep an eye on that. Marilyn Geewax is a senior business editor for NPR. She was with us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Marilyn, thank you once again. GEEWAX: Oh, you're welcome. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Let's turn now to the latest jobs numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the economy has added 175,000 jobs last month. That is more than analysts were expecting. And that came in spite of some freezing weather across the country that some experts thought might put a chill on job growth. We wanted to hear more, so we've called once again Marilyn Geewax. She is a senior business editor here at NPR. Marilyn, welcome back. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So just tell us the news. What did we learn today about employment? GEEWAX: It was a pretty good day. Most economists had been thinking that job growth would be maybe 150,000, and it came in at, you know, a good bit more than that - 175,000. So it's a pretty sharp acceleration from what we had seen in December and January. Those were pretty slack months. So there's more optimism now about the underlying strength of the economy. And we also saw a little bit of wage growth. MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that. . . GEEWAX: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Because that's a subject you've talked with us about before that even when the economy's adding jobs that wages. . . GEEWAX: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Don't seem to be moving at all. GEEWAX: Now I don't want to suggest that people are running out to buy champagne here. It's up 2. 2 percent. But that's the first time I've seen in a while where it's really ahead of the inflation rate - so great. If people are getting a little bit of a raise and employers are adding more workers given how bad the weather's been this winter, it's pretty encouraging. MARTIN: Well, tell me more about the weather if you would. I mean, a lot of people on the East Coast and in the southeast have been affected by cold weather in this part of - where we are. We just had an unusual snow for this time of the year. Has that had any effect? GEEWAX: It did show up in these numbers. People didn't lose their jobs because of it, but they did lose hours. There were nearly 7 million people who say they usually work full-time, but they got cut to below 35 hours. And that was because a lot of the cases they lost a day of work. For example, a week ago here in D. C. , the place where I get my haircut was closed for a day. Well, now in terms of how - what is the big economic impact? My hair was still growing. I still needed to get it cut. So I just shifted to a different day. So the workers. . . MARTIN: But the people who work that day - let's say the person. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . Who normally cuts your hair was scheduled to work that day, she or he didn't get paid that day. And if you made. . . GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: . . . An appointment for Thursday or the next day. . . GEEWAX: Right, right. MARTIN: . . . And that person wasn't scheduled, they aren't going to get paid for that day. GEEWAX: Right. MARTIN: So. GEEWAX: So people did lose some work, but there's some help there that, let's say, you worked in a place where maybe you were in a factory or you're stocking shelves or something. You lost a day of work, but maybe this week you're getting some overtime. So just how it all comes out in the wash, it probably about evens out. But there's some negative impact there. But maybe not as bad as people were thinking because it'll sort of smooth out over time. MARTIN: Well, it may not feel like it I know where you are, but we are heading into spring, which is traditionally a big time for selling houses. GEEWAX: I've heard of that season. MARTIN: Yes, exactly. We've heard that it does exist. Apparently in some places it does get warm. But is there any sense of optimism - or what's the picture for the housing sector? GEEWAX: Yes, even in this jobs report, there were reasons to have some optimism about housing. Construction continued to add jobs. And you would think that almost nobody would've been adding construction jobs. But there they were. In residential construction, they were up about 3,400 jobs. So there's this hope that maybe there's a lot of pent-up demand out there and mortgage rates have ticked down a little bit. They're about 4. 25 percent, and it had been about 4. 5 percent on 30-year mortgages. So if mortgage rates are a little bit easier, construction has continued, so maybe more houses will come onto the market. Those are reasons to be optimistic. And of course, the time for most home shopping, usually April and May are really strong months for that. People want to be able to move in the summertime when the kids are out of school. So people are out there shopping soon. So these are good indications. And even the idea that home prices are rising for buyers, there's some good news even in that. MARTIN: Why is that? GEEWAX: Well, if you're a buyer, you want to have something to buy. MARTIN: You need some choice. GEEWAX: You need some choices. And a big problem we've had is low inventories. That is, people haven't been putting their houses on the market because they've been, what they call, underwater. That is, you owe more on your mortgage than you could sell the house for in recent years. Well, who wants to move and end up owing the bank, you know, on your old mortgage. That's a pretty terrible scenario. So people have been holding off, hoping that house prices would rise. And now they have enough to allow people to soften up and move. So you'll see more inventory. MARTIN: All right. Let's keep an eye on that. Marilyn Geewax is a senior business editor for NPR. She was with us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Marilyn, thank you once again.

The question was how much. And it turns out less than expected. That's the message from the government's monthly employment report that's out today. It found that U. S. employers added 175,000 jobs to their payrolls last month. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, it's more than expected. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Surveys showed economists had expected around 150,000 new jobs, and some, like John Sylvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, had expected even fewer. So he was pleasantly surprised. JOHN SILVIA: I think it is a very positive signal that while weather has had an impact on job gains in recent months, the underlying strength of the economy is starting to show itself. YDSTIE: In addition to 175,000 net new jobs in February, employment growth in December and January was revised upward by a total of 25,000 jobs. However, despite the stronger job growth, the unemployment rate ticked up a notch to 6. 7 percent. That's normally a bad sign, but not this time, says Silvia. That's because the data show more people coming back into the workforce or entering for the first time. SILVIA: In either case, I take it as a good signal. More people looking for employment, so that that's actually the traditional signal for an improving economy. YDSTIE: There was some evidence of the weather tamping down employment growth. Average hours worked actually ticked down slightly. But in another sign of improvement, average hourly earnings rose by a strong 4/10 of a percent. That's important because it improves the consumer's ability to spend and fuel additional growth and job creation. Silvia says he believes the economy is coming out of the snowy woods and will pick up in coming months. SILVIA: I think there was a growing pessimism among some people that the economy was weakening pretty dramatically. And I think that's just not playing out. And I think also this is very reassuring to the Federal Reserve, that you know, their tapering policy has not had a big negative impact in the economy. YDSTIE: Silvia says that means the Fed will continue to dial back its stimulus. And he says he's reassured that growth this year will be better than it was last year.

I'm David Greene. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: And I'm Linda Wertheimer. President Obama and Russian President Putin have had another long telephone conversation about how to end the crisis in Ukraine. The White House says President Obama stressed that a diplomatic solution is possible, but Russian soldiers have to leave their current positions in Crimea and return to their base in the region. GREENE: The Kremlin released a statement saying that Russia is answering calls for help from Crimea. The Kremlin says the new officials who took over after President Viktor Yanukovich was ousted are illegitimate. Now, that fragile new government in Kiev had asked the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to send unarmed military observers into Crimea to get their take on the situation. According to Poland's defense minister, the delegation yesterday was blocked by unidentified men in military fatigues. WERTHEIMER: Western efforts are continuing to help stabilize Ukraine. The European Union says it's ready to give $15 billion in loans and grants. Even before the current crisis over Russia, Ukraine was facing massive debt and a stagnant economy. NPR's Jim Zarroli looks at how Ukraine got into so much trouble. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, a lot of people had high hopes for Ukraine. It had a solid manufacturing base, and its agriculture sector was so strong, Ukraine was sometimes called the breadbasket of the Soviet Union. Today, it's more likely to be called an economic basket case. Steven Pifer is a former U. S. ambassador to Ukraine. STEVEN PIFER: In 1990, 1991, if you looked at gross domestic product per capita in Poland and Ukraine, they were about even. If anything, Ukraine was a little bit ahead. Today, gross domestic product per capita in Poland is three times what it is in Ukraine. ZARROLI: Pifer says several things have gone wrong in Ukraine. PIFER: One is huge corruption. The estimate is that former President Yanukovich and the group around him stole billions of dollars. It just disappeared from the state budget. ZARROLI: In addition, Ukraine never quite recovered from the global financial crisis. It used to sell a lot of steel and agricultural products, then commodity prices fell. Ukraine today is deep in debt, and investors are rushing for the exits. Its currency is falling, and interest rates on its debt have soared. RAJAN MENON: There's only one country that's performed worse, and that's Venezuela. That tells you something. ZARROLI: Rajan Menon is with the Powell School of Government at New York City College. He says Ukraine's government responded to the downturn by borrowing heavily. Now it can't pay back what it owes. MENON: So, bottom line, they owe more than they have, and Turchynov, the new interim president, has said they need $35 billion in two years, and that they're hovering on the brink of default. ZARROLI: In December, Moscow promised to lend Ukraine's pro-Russian government $15 billion. Now that the old government has been replaced by a less-friendly one, Russia isn't likely to be as generous, says Alex Brideau of the Eurasia Group. ALEX BRIDEAU: The political crisis in Ukraine has made it unlikely that that Russian support will continue. So now we're at the point where a new government is reaching out to the IMF and to Western governments to get the kind of financial support that they need. ZARROLI: But the crisis leaves the West in something of a quandary. It's anxious to help Ukraine's new leadership survive. And a full-blown economic crisis could push the tottering government over. BRIDEAU: You have a government that has barely sunk roots yet, and it's facing revolt and rebellion and a Russian incursion, shall we say. And at the same time, if it's called upon to take tough economic austerity measures, it's really caught in, if not a perfect storm, then certainly something of a storm. ZARROLI: IMF officials have been pressing Ukraine for years to make economic reforms, like cutting the generous energy subsidies it gives its citizens. And Ukraine has a rather poor record of following through on its promises. IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde. CHRISTINE LAGARDE: It's obviously it's an economy that has to reform, that has to adjust. And where, as authorities have said, hard decisions need to be made and implemented. ZARROLI: To former Ukraine ambassador Steven Pifer, the new government is making all the right noises about reform. PIFER: The expectation is that if they do that, within a year or two, they can actually get the economy in a much better place where they can begin to realize some of the huge economic potential there is there. ZARROLI: A bailout would allow Ukraine to pay back some of its creditors. Ironically, that includes Russia, which is owed a lot of money for natural gas it shipped to Ukraine. In the current standoff with Russia, the U. S. and its allies may have little choice but to funnel aid to Ukraine, even though some of the money may end up getting passed on to Russia itself.

S. Labor Department said employers added 175,000 jobs. That's more than economists had expected, but the U. S. unemployment rate is still high. Yet, many employers say they can't find the kind of employees they need, workers with specific skills. Economists say the U. S. has a skills gap. Companies just can't find workers who are ready to do the jobs that they need to be filled. Now, the Obama administration says that something is wrong with America's job training program and it wants to find out how to fix it. From Atlanta, Susanna Capelouto reports. SUSANNA CAPELOUTO, BYLINE: President Obama freely admits that America doesn't do a good job of training workers. Here he is speaking at a GE plant in Wisconsin earlier this year. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And we've got to move away from what my labor secretary Tom Perez calls train and pray. You know, you train workers first and then you hope they get a job. CAPELOUTO: In other words, not enough Americans are training for the jobs industry needs. Just look at the job openings. There are about four million nationwide, but still ten million people are unemployed. That's according to government labor statistics. The White House has tapped Vice President Joe Biden to review America's jobs programs. That's a move welcomed by industry, including the German-American Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta. That's where Martina Stellmaszek works with about 1500 German companies throughout the south. MARTINA STELLMASZEK: It's pretty much that middle gap, so they have no problems finding engineers. I mean, there are great engineers in the United States. Or really very low qualified jobs, there's also no problem filling that, but it's really that middle segment where in Germany we have the vocational training system to exactly train for that. CAPELOUTO: Stellmaszek is talking about the three-year apprenticeship German workers must undergo before being certified in a skilled job. They work three or four days at a company and go to school for one or two days a week and it's the Chamber of Commerce which gives out the certificates and decides what's being taught in vo-tech schools. STELLMASZEK: If you have a certificate that you're an electrician, it doesn't matter if you do it in Hamburg or in Berlin. Companies know what they get. CAPELOUTO: And that, she says, trips up some Europeans hiring U. S. workers. STELLMASZEK: You don't really know what you get. I mean, if someone tells you they are an electrician, they could have just exchanged light bulb at an amusement park, or they could have really worked maybe at complex problems. CAPELOUTO: But Stellmaszek knows it's impossible to import such an elaborate program to the U. S. because it grew out of the old guild system of the 1800s and counts on reciprocity. Every company trains workers that can leave after three years, even to the competition. But it's also the reason Germany isn't seeing a skills gap like the U. S. RAYMOND HILL: If you tell everybody get a college education that gets you into the middle class, doesn't matter what you major in, you know. You just need that college degree. Well, is it any surprise? CAPELOUTO: Raymond Hill is an economist at Emory University. He says boosted by college financial aid policies that get-to-college message worked in the U. S. for a while as manufacturing went offshore and many factory jobs were lost. But now, higher wages in China and a U. S. energy boom are making a difference. HILL: Now we see this manufacturing coming back to us and that's really what we have to get ourselves prepared for. CAPELOUTO: Hill is banking on a local approach to create a skilled workforce where companies partner more closely with tech schools. Industry tailored job programs are a growing trend. For example, in Tennessee, Volkswagen partnered with Chattanooga's community college to import the first full three-year apprenticeship from Germany.

After years of selling drugs and serving prison time, he's now a site supervisor for the organization. We sat down in the break room at the back of the work shop after Lott had finished his shift and we started off talking about how proud he was just to make it through the training program that got him the job. This week's Sunday Conversation from Detroit with Isaac Lott. LOTT: This is the first time I really completed anything. And I've been working ever since. And I enjoy coming to work every day. MARTIN: Why? What's different about that. . . LOTT: 'Cause I'm not doing this. I'm not looking over my shoulder for anybody - the police or the stick-up man or anybody. MARTIN: There's a lot of stress in that lifestyle. LOTT: Yes, it is. And I've never been so happy in my life. My mom - if she hear the phones ringing late at night, she doesn't think that it's something bad. MARTIN: Do you have a family? LOTT: Yes. I have a mom and I have a sister who's married. My dad has passed. And two brothers that are - they passed from the street activity. MARTIN: Is this the first legitimate job that you've had? LOTT: First legitimate job. Yes, ma'am. MARTIN: You were dealing drugs your whole adult life, or? LOTT: Yeah, and I wasn't good at it 'cause I'm not rich now. (LAUGHTER)LOTT: Because you can't sell drugs and use drugs too. MARTIN: Did you? LOTT: I used drugs and sold drugs. I became one of my best customers, so to speak. MARTIN: Heroin? LOTT: And cocaine. And all the behavior that goes with it. I never robbed anybody or anything like that. But just the kind of people you deal with, I no longer deal with those kind of people. If I see them, I just wave and keep going. MARTIN: Do you live in the same neighborhood? LOTT: I've lived all over the city. MARTIN: OK. It wasn't matter of you needing to get out of a certain space so you didn't fall back into that. . . LOTT: No. Because I came from a two-parent home that both parents worked and they provided for us. I just swayed to the left a little bit. You know, my mom and dad always have worked. I've never had a hungry day or our lights or gas never got turned off or none of that. My father worked for General Motors and my mom worked for Neiman Marcus. MARTIN: Yet you and two of your brothers were living on the street. LOTT: Right. We all kind of swayed to the money. 'Cause we made more money than my dad ever made when we were younger. MARTIN: That's kind of intoxicating, to make more money than your dad at a young age. LOTT: Yeah, but we couldn't stay there and do that though. He didn't allow, or my mom wouldn't even accept money from us. They did not believe in that kind of lifestyle. MARTIN: How long have you lived in Detroit? Is your family from Detroit? LOTT: My whole life, my whole life. MARTIN: It's interesting though, your life and the life of the city have moved in different directions. Because now you're doing really well but the city's not doing so great. LOTT: No. But I believe that the city in the next 10 years, you won't know Detroit. I really believe that. Once we get rid of all this blight and educate these younger kids, I think it's going to change. MARTIN: Thank you, Isaac. LOTT: Thank you. MARTIN: That was Isaac Lott with the group Reclaim Detroit. Later this morning, we'll hear about other efforts to rebuild the Motor City, proposals to fix longstanding divisions between Detroit and its suburbs and the reinvention of the symphony orchestra.

S. housing market is slowing down again. After rising sharply in 2013, home prices in many areas have leveled off and fewer homes are being sold. Interesting and also worrisome developments for most Americans because their home is often their most valuable asset. Joining us now is Chris Arnold, who follows housing for NPR News. Good morning. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: So sales down, prices flat. What should we make of that? ARNOLD: Right. So last year home prices rose a lot, like we just heard about in Greg Allen's piece. In Florida it might have been 20 percent, nationally they were up 13 percent around the country by one measure. That can't keep happening. You know, we saw that in the housing bubble, prices just kept going up and up and up, and then eventually the bubble pops and it's like a train wreck. So the fact that prices are leveling off is probably more of a good thing than a bad thing. The thing that might be a sign of trouble is that the pace of home sales has been slowing down. So in five of the past six months Americans bought fewer homes than the month before and home sales are now at their lowest level in 18 months. MONTAGNE: Which does not actually sound very good. ARNOLD: No, it doesn't, but we should also stress that it's too early to know exactly what's going on with home sales. It's been a crazy cold winter with all kinds of storms. I'm sure everybody's aware of that. If things keep slowing down, as the weather gets better, we get into the spring, that might be cause for concern, but we really just have to wait and see. And right now, each month Americans get more jobs, the economy's getting better, so we very well may start to see more homes getting bought. MONTAGNE: In the spring, when the weather's better, many people usually do start looking around for a house. How hard will it be for them to get a mortgage? ARNOLD: This is interesting. So a lot of economists think that it's still harder than normal and the credit is too tight, that it's too hard to get a mortgage. Banks right now are making the same number of loans for home purchases that they were back in 1995. Meanwhile, we've got 20 percent more households today, so that's a clear disconnect. You'd expect to see more purchase mortgages, more mortgages that are used to buy houses. Now, people are buying more houses now than they were in 1995, but a bigger part of the market are these investors going in and buying up properties like we just heard about in the previous story. Now, as home prices level off, there aren't as many deals, those investors are going to stop buying houses, so if banks don't loosen up and normalize their lending standards, some analysts say, look, it's tough to see how home sales are going to keep rising. MONTAGNE: And Chris, where are we now with the rate of home ownership in the U. S. ? ARNOLD: Well, I've got a chart in front of me here. Can we do this on the radio? Can I talk about the chart? MONTAGNE: If you're very clever, yes. ARNOLD: Okay. Well, I don't know if I'm very clever, but - so here we go. So this chart, it looks like a mountain, of course, and the home ownership rate started at 64 percent in the early 1990s and it went up and up and up and up and up and then the bubble burst and then, wham, it comes slamming down the other side of the mountain, and now it's at 65 percent. So we've fallen almost all the way back down to where we were before things started to go up in the '90s. Now, the question is what happens next. Some analysts say, hey, we can level off here. Others say no, home ownership's going to keep declining. But this is really important 'cause for generations owning a home has been a big part of middle class American life. You build equity in your home and over the course of your life that builds up a big nest egg. MONTAGNE: Okay. So there's a new government report that finds household wealth has increased to a record level and I'm guessing that a lot of that has to do with home values. ARNOLD: It absolutely does. Two things have gone up. Home prices have gone up and the stock market was on a total tear last year. So those two things together have pushed that up. And for Americans of retirement age, this is an interesting statistic, 85 percent of them own a home. So this is all great for them and it's a big part of why economists say, look, what happens with the home ownership rate is a really big deal, it gives people a stake in something of real value.

Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. The state of Florida was hit hard by the 2008 housing bust. Now, the real estate market there is heating up. Prices are on the rise. They were up sharply last year, but there's a twist in this narrative. The homebuyers in many cases are hedge funds, private equity firms and other large investors. Over the last two years they have aggressively moved in and bought up tens of thousands of distressed properties, often at bargain prices. Their demand is helping to drive up prices, potentially forcing middle-class buyers out of the market. Here's NPR's Greg Allen from Miami. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Jeff Lichtenstein is a realtor in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. , and he's busy. He's listing and selling homes at a pace reminiscent of the go-go days of the last real estate boom, in 2005 and 2006. JEFF LICHTENSTEIN: I have 19 or 20 under contract right now, which is the most I've ever had at any given time. ALLEN: Lichtenstein is currently showing a home he has listed in PGA National, a resort and residential development with more than 5,000 homes. It's a community of palm trees, lakes, golf courses and manicured lawns. LICHTENSTEIN: This was built in '92, '93; a little over 1,700 square feet - three bedrooms, three baths. The view is what people come here to Florida for. ALLEN: The back patio looks out onto a golf course. It's listed for $499,000, Lichtenstein says a bit below what it would have sold for at the peak. But here in Florida, Arizona, Las Vegas and some parts of California, prices are rising fast. In South Florida, home prices climbed 21 percent last year. Homes, especially foreclosures and short sales, are being snapped up as soon as they go on the market, mostly by large investment groups. Companies like the Blackstone Group, Colony Capital and Starwood Property Trust have spent billions over the past two years, buying homes across the country and putting them on the rental market. It's a buying frenzy that was just getting underway when famed investor Warren Buffett made these comments on CNBC in 2012. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)WARREN BUFFETT: If I had a way of buying a couple of hundred thousand single-family homes, and had a way of managing - the management is enormous, is really a problem because they're one by one. They're not like apartment houses. But I would load up on them, and I would take mortgages out at very, very low rates. ALLEN: Since then, that's exactly what dozens of investment groups, big and small, have done. But as prices have risen and foreclosures have slowed, there are fewer bargains out there. Some investors are cutting back on their buying. One who's still in the market is Chip Bryan. He's with Rebound Residential, a company that's bought nearly 200 homes in South Florida. As investor groups go, Bryan's company is tiny, but it operates much like the big guys - buy homes at a discount, rent them out for a good return until prices rise, and then sell when the time is right. Bryan says after going through foreclosures, many former homeowners now find themselves renting in their old neighborhoods. Once their credit improves, Bryan expects they'll be back in the market as homebuyers. CHIP BRYAN: That's kind of the pattern we see so, you know, everybody that was a displaced homeowner as a result of foreclosure is most likely a renter and most likely is going to be a buyer again, at some point. ALLEN: Up to now, the main downside to all the investor activity has been that individual homebuyers have been largely left out. With tight credit, many prospective buyers have found mortgages hard to come by, and when a bargain is on the block, cash buyers are usually the winners. Jack McCabe, an independent real estate consultant, has worked with some of these investment groups. He says he's seen many cases where they outbid the competition by paying more than the asking price - in some cases, 25 to 50 percent more. JACK MCCABE: You ask yourself, why would these smart financial guys be overpaying for things? I believe it's to bolster the market, to shut out their competition, and to realize as much profit as they can in as short a period of time as they can. ALLEN: Some analysts worry that the big investors have artificially inflated prices, making them too steep for middle-class wage earners. McCabe says a recent federal housing report shows South Florida is already becoming unaffordable. MCCABE: We have about 30 percent of our population that's already paying 50 percent of their income or more just for their housing expenses. When people start having a hard time deciding whether to make a mortgage payment, buy their medicine, put food on the table, that's when you have a troubled market. ALLEN: And it raises a question: When the hedge funds and other investors are ready to sell, who will their buyers by? Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. There have been many stories about the challenges that the new health care law poses for businesses, especially those with 50 or more employees. Those businesses will eventually be required to provide health care for their workers, or pay a penalty. But as NPR's John Ydstie reports, there is another group of business people who could benefit from the Affordable Care Act: entrepreneurs. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Joshua Simonson has a new, 26-acre farm near Sheridan, Ore. JOSHUA SIMONSON: Which is in the Williamette Valley of Oregon. And I'm staring at a couple of chickens. . . (LAUGHTER)SIMONSON: . . . tilling up our flower beds. YDSTIE: Simonson has lots of chickens roaming around, searching for worms and bugs. SIMONSON: We're raising just under 3,000 laying hens for pasture-raised eggs that we'll sell into the Portland metropolitan area. And we've got pigs coming in a couple of weeks. And we're planning on doing pasture-raised meat birds as well. YDSTIE: Simonson and his partner started this farm with the assistance of a group called Friends of Family Farmers. They helped him locate this property. But there was another development that prompted this young entrepreneur to take the leap and start a new business. SIMONSON: One of the biggest factors was the Affordable Care Act and that our family would be able to be covered by health care, starting the beginning of 2014. YDSTIE: That convinced Simonson he could quit his job at a Portland-area grocery store, New Seasons Market, which he says provided excellent health care for him and his family. He was reluctant to give that up, especially since he has a pre-existing condition that's prevented him from getting insurance in the private market. SIMONSON: I was ineligible for any health care. I'd been denied by five different companies because I have back problems. I'd broken some vertebrae in my back, and nobody wanted to cover me because of that. YDSTIE: What Simonson is describing is his escape from what economists call job lock, or entrepreneur lock. DANE STANGLER: Entrepreneur lock has proven to be a significant barrier to potential entrepreneurs.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. There have been many stories about the challenges that the new health care law poses for businesses, especially those with 50 or more employees. Those businesses will eventually be required to provide health care for their workers, or pay a penalty. But as NPR's John Ydstie reports, there is another group of business people who could benefit from the Affordable Care Act: entrepreneurs. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Joshua Simonson has a new, 26-acre farm near Sheridan, Ore. JOSHUA SIMONSON: Which is in the Williamette Valley of Oregon. And I'm staring at a couple of chickens. . . (LAUGHTER) SIMONSON: . . . tilling up our flower beds. YDSTIE: Simonson has lots of chickens roaming around, searching for worms and bugs. SIMONSON: We're raising just under 3,000 laying hens for pasture-raised eggs that we'll sell into the Portland metropolitan area. And we've got pigs coming in a couple of weeks. And we're planning on doing pasture-raised meat birds as well. YDSTIE: Simonson and his partner started this farm with the assistance of a group called Friends of Family Farmers. They helped him locate this property. But there was another development that prompted this young entrepreneur to take the leap and start a new business. SIMONSON: One of the biggest factors was the Affordable Care Act and that our family would be able to be covered by health care, starting the beginning of 2014. YDSTIE: That convinced Simonson he could quit his job at a Portland-area grocery store, New Seasons Market, which he says provided excellent health care for him and his family. He was reluctant to give that up, especially since he has a pre-existing condition that's prevented him from getting insurance in the private market. SIMONSON: I was ineligible for any health care. I'd been denied by five different companies because I have back problems. I'd broken some vertebrae in my back, and nobody wanted to cover me because of that. YDSTIE: What Simonson is describing is his escape from what economists call job lock, or entrepreneur lock. DANE STANGLER: Entrepreneur lock has proven to be a significant barrier to potential entrepreneurs. YDSTIE: Dane Stangler is vice president of research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurship. STANGLER: To the extent the Affordable Care Act unlocks that job lock or that entrepreneur lock, one effect is to provide a boost to entrepreneurship overall.

I'm Michel Martin. 2014 marks the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty. So all this year we've been talking about what poverty looks like in America now, who is poor, the struggles they face and the different ideas about the best with help them and eventually eradicate poverty in this country. Today, more than 4 million American families who are living under the poverty line are headed by a single mother, somebody like Katrina Gilbert. She's a certified nursing assistant in Tennessee. To support her three children, she sometimes works seven days a week in a nursing home. But at $10 an hour, her paycheck doesn't go very far. HBO followed her for a year of her life for their upcoming documentary \"Paycheck to Paycheck: The Life and Times of Katrina Gilbert. \" It was coproduced by The Shriver Report, a nonprofit that supports projects that examine women's lives in the U. S. And here's a short clip. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF KATRINA GILBERT\")KATRINA GILBERT: Late at night, Saturday morning, started early in the day, and I went and paid rent. Then I'll have to pay Medicare, the storage, the car insurance, the phone and the loan. It's gone, except for gas. Check was $730. It's gone. That's for two weeks pay. MARTIN: \"Paycheck to Paycheck\" airs this Monday on HBO and online, and Katrina Gilbert is with us now. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. GILBERT: Hello. MARTIN: I was wondering how you felt about my introduction. You know, we're talking about poverty, and kind of by definition we are saying that you're poor. How does that feel to you? GILBERT: It kind of - it touches me. It might, you know, just. . . MARTIN: Does it hurt? GILBERT: Yeah, to be on that line, the poverty, you know, line. I live under poverty level. MARTIN: Even though you work every day. GILBERT: Yeah, I work every day, five days a week, eight hours a day - sometimes more than that. The most I have worked is 16 days straight, a couple of 16 hour shifts in there. MARTIN: The film makes the point - you make the point in the film that you didn't start out and you certainly weren't planning to be a single mom. He's in the film, too. Your former husband is in the film. . . GILBERT: He is. MARTIN: . . . Too, and trying to stay a part of your kids lives. And you talk about - very frankly about how hard that is sometimes to maintain. I mean, there are times when, you know, he doesn't have gas money to even visit. So I know you said in the film - I remember it very clearly - where you said that this was kind of my worst fear. Did you have a sense of how hard it was going to be, even recognizing you felt you were making the best decision for yourself and the kids, given that your husband was struggling with an addiction? GILBERT: I didn't think it was going to be this hard, but every challenge and trial, tribulation, I've pulled through. It's just made me a stronger woman. I'm a hard-working strong woman. MARTIN: The film makes it clear, I mean, just kind of the day-to-day decisions that you have to make. And I remember one scene - I think any parent who doesn't have a sitter, like, on 24/7 can relate to is when you were taking your kids to get your taxes done - you know, critical. And you get that return - at least you're looking for getting a return - and you're trying to make some decisions about, you know, what to do and it's - the choices even there were tough. Do you mind talking about that? GILBERT: Yeah, those choices were tough of what to do. Like, I got the tax return back, so I know I'm going to pay my car off. So that's a bill gone. So that's a must. So pay my car off, you know, get the kids something for them because, you know, I wasn't even able to give them a birthday party or a birthday present or anything. So I spent some money on them. But it was mostly just paying off bills. MARTIN: But then there was the whole question of medical insurance, too. And one of the points is that you've got insurance for the kids, but you didn't have it for yourself. And I just want to play a short clip from the film of where you are visiting the doctor's office trying to get yourself together since you hadn't had a chance to do that. And here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF KATRINA GILBERT\")GILBERT: I had a headache straight for three months. The panic attacks were getting a lot worse. I mean, it was getting to the point where I couldn't even work. My panic attacks were just, like, hitting me that hard while I was at work. I don't know what's causing my headaches. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I want to make sure we're not missing anything, so the MRI will help. If your insurance will let me, I'll do an MRI. That looks for things like. . . GILBERT: I don't have insurance. MARTIN: How do you go about it? Can you even describe for people who have not had to think about finances as carefully as you have how you go about deciding what to do in it a situation like that? GILBERT: Well, when you have a headache for that long, you think something is wrong and it needs to be looked at. In the past, we had a CT scan done of my brain, and it was a possible brain aneurysm. From there, the migraines just continued. And so we did a MRI, and the MRI was clear of no brain aneurysm, no tumors. They can't find anything that's causing the headaches. And then it was - it came down to me possibly having glaucoma or developing glaucoma. And that. . . MARTIN: Well, you go in for one thing, and then you come out with four prescriptions. GILBERT: Yeah. MARTIN: I mean. . . GILBERT: I was thinking. . . MARTIN: . . . How do you even handle that? GILBERT: You have to pick and choose. That's all you can do is pick and choose because you only have this amount of money. So I know I'm going to need my antibiotic because I have a sinus infection. I know that I'm going to need my thyroid medicine because I have thyroid disease. So I have to have that. That's a very serious thing for me to have. Me having the headaches, the migraines, the migraine pills were just going to have to wait 'cause they cost way too much. MARTIN: What's the hardest decision you've had to make since you've been taking care of the kids on your own? Is it the big things or the little things - worrying that your car will go out? Or is it, like, I can't give the kids a birthday party? What's the hardest thing? GILBERT: The worrying about the car going out, that scares me to death because if you don't have the money in the bank to fix it if something does happen to it. But you have to have your car because you have to get back and forth to work. You have to take them back and forth to school and daycare. And so that's a real scary thing. And then the day-to-day like the kids want a candy bar or, mommy, I want a toy, I can't - I just tell them I don't have the money for that. I can't do that right now. So it's hard, and they get upset. But hopefully, they understand. And then, like, it's really hard when Lydia was at school, and she's sick. And she was really sick with a fever. I think she had strep throat. And Lydia told the nurse that - not to call her mommy because she knows that mommy has to work. She didn't want me to leave work 'cause that's missed money, missed pay, and she didn't want me to stress. But she's only 6 years old. So that just - it tore me up. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, I'm speaking with Katrina Gilbert. She's the subject of the new HBO documentary \"Paycheck to Paycheck. \" It premieres on HBO as well as online next week. Do you feel like you see a future - like, any light at the end of the tunnel? GILBERT: I do. MARTIN: Yeah. What would make - what's making a difference? GILBERT: Well, just looking at the children, you know, that gives me light at the end of the tunnel every day. You know, I'm really pushing to get back into school, get back into college. MARTIN: Can I play a short clip from - another clip from the film? This is where - you're not just kind of saying this as kind of a wild dream, you actually have taken steps. And I just want to play a short clip from the documentary of it. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF KATRINA GILBERT\")GILBERT: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You're welcome. Congratulations. GILBERT: Thank you. I can do what I want to do now. I can go to college. Start back towards my degree that I want. I don't want to be a CNA for the rest of my life. MARTIN: But what happened with that? GILBERT: Well, the financial aid - it's in bad standing right now because of the past when I was in nursing school. That's when they thought I had the brain aneurysm. And I was in and out of the hospital doing tests and everything so I was missing school. Well, when you're in nursing school, you can only miss 10 days. So I got kicked out because of my medical condition, like, they weren't excused, it's not excused. When you're in a nursing program they're very strict. And so I have to go through a whole appeal process, and so that's what's being done. And if it's going to get appealed - I don't know. MARTIN: What made you want to participate in this documentary? It can't have been easy - I don't know what it was like, having the cameras around a lot - I don't know if they were there 24/7, but they sure seemed like it? GILBERT: Well, getting involved in the film - I really wanted to do it to inspire other single mothers, other single parents, other people out there that are living and struggling like I am. To inspire them, show them that they can do it - you can be strong, you can be independent, hard-working, you can get through it. It's just your storm. You may be going through a storm right now, but you'll get out of it, just have a little bit of faith. You'll get out of it. MARTIN: But are you out of it? GILBERT: It's getting there. It's getting better. It's getting better. I still have my faith, it's getting better. I think watching the film - when I actually sat down and I watched the film and I was just like, wow, that's my life. Like, I'm a single mom and I would sit back and I would think am I doing this right, am I being a good mother, am I making the right decisions? And then after watching the film and seeing everything that we went through, I can sit there and I can say now, I can say I'm a good mother, my children are proud of me, my children love me. And I'm hoping one day, when they grow up, they can be like - I'm so proud of my mom, look what she did. MARTIN: That was Katrina Gilbert. She's the subject of the new documentary \"Paycheck to Paycheck: The Life and Times of Katrina Gilbert. \" It premieres on HBO next week. And she was kind enough to join us here in Washington, D. C. on a brief visit. Katrina, thanks so much for speaking with us. Good luck to you and your family. GILBERT: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

S. government embarked on an ambitious social experiment to try to help people get out of poverty. The Moving to Opportunity Program gave housing vouchers to single mothers so they could raise their kids in areas with better job prospects and better schools. The hope was the families would thrive. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Now, a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that boys from these families did not thrive. They found that the move took a toll on their emotional well-being, a toll not experienced by girls. Ronald Kessler is a professor of health care policy at the Harvard Medical School, and a lead author of the study. Professor Kessler, welcome to the program. Thanks for coming on. RONALD KESSLER: My pleasure. GREENE: So can you start by telling me about the children who were part of this study? KESSLER: Well, they originally lived in innercity public housing, in very high poverty areas. The kids who were studied in this report were no older than 8 when the intervention started, but the average age was 3. GREENE: And was the expectation that these families, and these kids, would do better in more affluent areas? KESSLER: Well, the hope was, originally, that the educational opportunities for the kids would increase because of better schools; that the opportunities for the parents finding jobs would increase because they moved to places where there were higher employment rates so that in the long run, the kids - as they moved out - would have better socioeconomic achievement than they would have otherwise. GREENE: But you found these problems, as years passed. Describe to me what, exactly, you found. KESSLER: Well, we found something that we hadn't expected; which was the effect of the intervention was quite positive for girls, but boys had the opposite effect. Boys were more depressed. They were more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder, they were more likely to have conduct problems, if they were in families that were offered vouchers than in the control group that wasn't involved in any kind of move. GREENE: What could explain that young men who made this move to a more affluent neighborhood tended to be more depressed and had more mental health problems, compared to kids who stayed behind in poverty-stricken areas? KESSLER: Well, it's important to say at the onset that the experiment's job was to see would there be effects, does neighborhood make a difference? And we showed experimentally that it clearly does. Why the effect exists is not something the experiment was designed to give us definitive evidence for. However, we were fortunate that we had field workers go into neighborhoods, observe what was going on; and they have some insights into why they think these differences exist. And their thought is that little girls were embraced by the neighborhoods and seemed to have better interpersonal skills, whereas the boys somehow were thought to be a threat by the community, so they were pushed away and in fact in some cases, had worse things happen to them. So they had more exposure to fights and so forth than they might have had otherwise. GREENE: And do you see that in general, in other ways, that boys are less able to adjust happily to sort of new environments, compared to girls? KESSLER: Well, the kinds of qualitative evidence that our research team came up with certainly seem to suggest that that's the case, at least in this population. Now, that doesn't mean that if a different intervention were developed, if there were some supports given to these boys - preparation, or some kind of counseling programs - that they couldn't make a really good adjustment. We just don't know because it wasn't one of the things we had prepared ourselves for at the beginning. GREENE: It sounds like what you're suggesting is not to look at this as a failed policy when it comes to these boys, but to really learn from it and look - you know, look ahead to how best the government should be spending money and doing housing programs. KESSLER: It seems clear that with the kind of money that we're talking about that the government spends on this - $37 billion a year is invested in public housing in America - we've got to do a better job than we're doing now of  not just using that money to put a roof over somebody's head, but to figure out how to maximize the benefit. And that has to mean developing programs that help these new families integrate optimally into better neighborhoods. GREENE: Professor Kessler, thanks very much for taking the time to talk to us. We appreciate it. KESSLER: My pleasure. Thanks very much. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  In the 1990s, the U. S. government embarked on an ambitious social experiment to try to help people get out of poverty. The Moving to Opportunity Program gave housing vouchers to single mothers so they could raise their kids in areas with better job prospects and better schools. The hope was the families would thrive. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Now, a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that boys from these families did not thrive. They found that the move took a toll on their emotional well-being, a toll not experienced by girls. Ronald Kessler is a professor of health care policy at the Harvard Medical School, and a lead author of the study. Professor Kessler, welcome to the program. Thanks for coming on. RONALD KESSLER: My pleasure. GREENE: So can you start by telling me about the children who were part of this study? KESSLER: Well, they originally lived in innercity public housing, in very high poverty areas. The kids who were studied in this report were no older than 8 when the intervention started, but the average age was 3. GREENE: And was the expectation that these families, and these kids, would do better in more affluent areas? KESSLER: Well, the hope was, originally, that the educational opportunities for the kids would increase because of better schools; that the opportunities for the parents finding jobs would increase because they moved to places where there were higher employment rates so that in the long run, the kids - as they moved out - would have better socioeconomic achievement than they would have otherwise. GREENE: But you found these problems, as years passed. Describe to me what, exactly, you found. KESSLER: Well, we found something that we hadn't expected; which was the effect of the intervention was quite positive for girls, but boys had the opposite effect. Boys were more depressed. They were more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder, they were more likely to have conduct problems, if they were in families that were offered vouchers than in the control group that wasn't involved in any kind of move. GREENE: What could explain that young men who made this move to a more affluent neighborhood tended to be more depressed and had more mental health problems, compared to kids who stayed behind in poverty-stricken areas? KESSLER: Well, it's important to say at the onset that the experiment's job was to see would there be effects, does neighborhood make a difference? And we showed experimentally that it clearly does. Why the effect exists is not something the experiment was designed to give us definitive evidence for. However, we were fortunate that we had field workers go into neighborhoods, observe what was going on; and they have some insights into why they think these differences exist. And their thought is that little girls were embraced by the neighborhoods and seemed to have better interpersonal skills, whereas the boys somehow were thought to be a threat by the community, so they were pushed away and in fact in some cases, had worse things happen to them. So they had more exposure to fights and so forth than they might have had otherwise. GREENE: And do you see that in general, in other ways, that boys are less able to adjust happily to sort of new environments, compared to girls?

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. The retail giant Target is still reeling from a massive breach of its payment systems during last year's holiday shopping season. Hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card numbers, and tens of millions of other pieces of personal information - addresses, phone numbers and more. The company faces more than 90 lawsuits and has already spent tens of millions of dollars dealing with the fallout from the breach. And now, a Bloomberg Businessweek story, out today, contends that Target itself could have prevented the attack. Mike Riley is co-author of that story, and he joins me here in our studios. Welcome to the program. MIKE RILEY: Thanks very much. BLOCK: And let's go back and explain. You found out that six months prior to the attack, Target had installed a very sophisticated malware detection system called FireEye, which actually worked exactly as it was intended to work. Tell us a bit about the system and what happened with it. RILEY: Yeah. Security systems are changing, and this is one of the sort of cutting-edge, really, sort of behavior-based ones. The interesting thing about it, it was initially funded by the CIA. What it does is, it essentially sets up a series of virtual computers. Anything that's coming in Target's network, in terms of data, goes through these virtual computers, which are - configure exactly like Target's own computers. So essentially, what does is, it tricks the hackers into believing that they are in Target's networks. It also has this nice trick where it can advance the clock of a computer. So when malware comes into a network, it can actually see what happens to the malware - over a period of days, weeks or even years - in a split second. Once that starts to happen, it sends out an alert that says hey, there's a piece of hacking malware in your system; you should go fix it. BLOCK: And that's what happened here. This detection system did exactly that - right? - told Target, something bad is going on here. RILEY: That's right. That part of the function worked. So on Nov. 30th - and keep in mind, this is before any of the data leaves Target's network - the alerts begin to go off. And for some reason that's not clear, Target didn't act on it in time. BLOCK: So these malware detection alerts are coming in Nov. 30th, Dec. 2nd. Target says they weren't alerted about the breach until Dec. 12th, by federal authorities. They don't tell consumers until Dec. 19th. Why the delay? RILEY: That's right. Well, whatever was going on inside Target's security team, they didn't recognize this as a serious breach. There was no serious investigation that went on. They didn't go to the server itself to figure out what the malware was doing. What they've said publicly is that they didn't know anything about the hack until the U. S. attorney and the Secret Service knocked on their door on Dec. 12th and said, you've got a problem. And it takes them about three days to figure out that all this malware is not just on that one server but on every single - or many, many POS systems through the entire store network in the United States. BLOCK: You write in your story, Mike, Target stood by as 40 million credit card numbers gushed out of its mainframes. You asked them for a response to your story. What did they tell you? RILEY: You know, the response was pretty minimal. They pointed out that they are doing a complete review of the security systems that they have in place, and that they are trying to figure out how to improve those systems. At this point, it's really - the lawyers have sort of taken control of what their response can or should be. BLOCK: It does seem that - I mean, if Target was aware of a massive breach like this, with these huge implications for them, they would have done something about it. I mean, they would have acted if they had known the seriousness of the problem. RILEY: Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right. I don't think they knew exactly what was going on. It's one thing to sort of get an alert from a system that says you may have malware on your server. It's entirely different thing to know that 40 million credit cards are leaving your network. It's not that they sat by while they watched 40 million credit cards go out. No responsible company is going to do that. But they had all the pieces of the puzzle. If they'd simply put them together, they could have stopped this. BLOCK: We've been focusing on the hack itself. But let's talk also about the hackers. . . RILEY: Sure. BLOCK: . . . because you do a lot of reporting on who they are. Your research led to Ukraine and Russia, to cybergangs notorious for their successes in just these kinds of breaches. Who are these people, and why can't the U. S. go after them? RILEY: It's a very boisterous, very well-oiled machine. And there are literally, millions and millions of credit cards that are stolen around the world every day. They have a very good system for distributing, selling, repackaging. One of the ways that it works is once the credit cards are stolen, they get posted on quarter websites. These are websites that really look like Amazon. com. They'll run anywhere from 8- to $50, depending on the quality of the cards, things like the credit limit. And then you'll pop them into an electronic basket, just like Amazon, and check out. It's a fascinating world to look in. It's just fascinating to see how efficient this is. On some level, these guys have found the perfect crime. You can sit and hack a major Fortune 500 company from your couch in Ukraine. You can steal data that has value. You can sell that value on an automated website. You can make money from it. And you're really not at much risk. BLOCK: Mike Riley, reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek, thanks for coming in. RILEY: You're welcome. BLOCK: Mike is the co-author of the cover story \"Easy Target. \" It's online today and hits newsstands tomorrow. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel.

If I say I want to talk about gentrification, what comes to mind? Do you think new businesses and services revitalizing tired rundown neighborhoods or do you think higher taxes and snobby people with too much money and too few manners pushing out your grandma? And be honest, is the real picture in your mind whites with money and blacks or Latinos or Asians without bumping up against each other? Well, wherever you see yourself in this story, you probably know there is a story. Filmmaker Spike Lee recently made a splash when he offered this comment at a Black History Month speaking event. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)SPIKE LEE: You can\u2019t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you\u2019re mother [bleep] Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. You can't do that. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. MARTIN: Well, New York - where Spike Lee lives - isn't the only place where tensions have erupted. Washington, D. C. , Portland and Philadelphia have also seen these kinds of confrontations as established residents feel like new investors and new homeowners are leaving them out or, in some cases, pushing them out of an improving economic picture. We wanted to talk about this so we've called three people who have been thinking about or who have been affected by this issue. Lisa Sturtevan is vice president for research at the National Housing Conference. Also with us, John Murph. He lives in Washington, D. C. He's a music and arts journalist. And Jacy Webster, who lives in Philadelphia where he owns a Philadelphia Record Exchange. Welcome to you all. Thank you all so much for joining us. LISA STURTEVAN: Thank you. JOHN MURPH: Thank you. JACY WEBSTER: Thanks. MARTIN: Lisa, I'm going to ask you to give us the big picture. What types of neighborhoods tend to undergo gentrification or become subjects of urban renewal plans? And what does that process look like? STURTEVAN: Yeah. So I think you described it really well when you talked about neighborhoods where higher income folks come in a lower income folks tend to be displaced. And these are generally cities where there's been fast employment growth, where they've been attracting higher income residents because of jobs. And Washington, D. C. is a classic example where job growth here in the district was much faster than anywhere else. And so those are the places where residents and investors are really looking to move and where this gentrification tends to happen. MARTIN: Is gentrification a neutral word or is it a word that people tend to not like? STURTEVAN: Yeah. No, I think. . . MARTIN: Does it have politics behind it? STURTEVAN: I think gentrification has politics behind it. I don't think it's necessarily a word everybody knows either. But I think it's one of those things where you know it when you see it, right - when you walk through the neighborhood, when you talk to people about their experience, that there's common threads in what gentrification means to people. MARTIN: And what does it mean to people? STURTEVAN: I think it means that there's this group of people who are losing power to another group of people. I think it really comes down - when we talk about incomes and higher rents and higher prices - I think what we're really talking about is power. MARTIN: Not necessarily race? STURTEVAN: And I - well, I think that you can't talk about this without talking about race, but I don't want to suggest that in every case gentrification is a white moving minorities out. There are cases of places that are gentrified by minority higher income folks moving lower income folks out. Income is the real driver of gentrification. MARTIN: Well, let me turn to Jacy and John because one of the reasons we were happy that both of you could join us is that in each in your both way you've flipped the script on this narrative that a lot of people have. So, John, I'll start you. Your situation is - what? Tell us. I mean, and just for those who don't now know, you are African-American and in 2002 you moved into a predominantly black neighborhood in D. C. that was undergoing some changes. And tell us your experience. MURPH: Well, like you said before, I moved around 2002 to 14th and V, which is very close to the vibrant U Street district. And. . . MARTIN: U Street used to be known as Black Broadway back in the day. MURPH: Exactly. MARTIN: A lot of black businesses there, theatres and so forth. MURPH: And at that time, it was even more transitional than what it is now. And it was affordable. I was a journalist and I found a great place in which I could afford, nice apartment. And I was close to a lot of cultural places that I loved. Within that - within two years, I started noticing the change.  Then Busboys and Poets, a lot of condos moved in and. . . MARTIN: Busboys and Poets, just for those who don't know, it's a local change of restaurants and kind of gathering places. The owner is kind of a man about town - it's a gathering spotMURPH: Exactly. With those changes I also notice an escalating of turf wars. There was some pushbacks and a lot of escalating, kind of minor, but rising. MARTIN: Like what? You didn't feel well-received. Let me just. . . MURPH: Not feel well-received. . . MARTIN: Even though you're African-American, you felt like you were viewed as the enemy. MURPH: Exactly. And it wasn't just my experience, it was some of the white people who were moving in, you know, rocks were thrown at them, some of the Asians and Latinos as well. MARTIN: Like, what crystallized for you the fact that you didn't feel welcomed there? MURPH: I think when - I started feeling this way when people started noticing I was going to Busboys and Poets and some of the more, quote-unquote, more gentrified areas across the street. And when they saw that some of my friends were some of those white people who were possibly moving into some of the new condos, you know, then I got lumped in with them. MARTIN: How do you know that? What did people say to you? MURPH: It's a vibe. Sometimes people are not going to come and tell you, OK, you're part of this group now so therefore you can't play in the reindeer games. But it's a very gnawing attitude that you receive - it's hard to articulate. But you know when you get it, it's almost like they - when you talk about gentrification - you know it when you see it. MARTIN: Jacy, what you? Let's turn to you. You've got a different story. You're a long-term resident of your neighborhood. Who was living there when you first bought your house there in 1991? WEBSTER: Well. . . MARTIN: And who's living there now? What have you seen? WEBSTER: Well, it was an old Italian neighborhood - South Philly, well-known as being, you know, very Italian. And I moved in as a poor musician-type into my neighborhood. And, you know, I was accepted pretty well and it was cheap. It was nice to live, it was OK - it was a little rough. But it was fine, I loved it. And everything was good for quite a while. And then - I guess it was maybe 10 years ago, but really five years ago, it really took off - it was like a lot of people started coming in with money and the prices of houses went way up. And I just couldn't believe it. And I didn't know what was going on, but I thought - at first I thought it was great because, you know, there were new restaurants and, you know, all kinds of businesses were opening up. And there was a whole new vitality going on. You know, a lot of young wealthier kids, which I didn't understand, like, you know, raising families, like, who are these people? And they have a lot of money. And then all of a sudden I realized, oh, my God, the city is telling me my house is not worth 45,000, it's worth 280,000 and I have to pay taxes on that. And I was like, how did this happen? You know, that's kind like - was very shocking. MARTIN: And do you mind if I point out you're white. And so for you is this - is it a racial thing or not? I mean - or do. . . WEBSTER: No. MARTIN: And do you feel kind of like the other or do you feel invisible? WEBSTER: Yeah, I'm starting to feel that way. You know, it seems like my neighborhood is moving to a place that I don't belong in. And I'm sure all the old people that live around me that have been there - their families have been there forever - feel the same way. So I'm kind of in their boat. And. . . MARTIN: Why do you say that? WEBSTER: It just feels like. . . MARTIN: I mean, do people not speak to you on the street or they park there $700 strollers on your lawn? Or - what is it that makes you feel that way? WEBSTER: There's a bit of that. Yeah they're not like, you know, people that - like the old people would come up and say, hey, how you doing? You know, I made you lasagna. You know, it was awesome. But now it's like they just don't say anything at all, they just disappear down the street and they, you know, get into their cars and disappear. Yeah, they don't talk. It's not like a neighborhood like it was. It has a totally different feel. MARTIN: Are you worried you won't be able to afford your house anymore? WEBSTER: Yeah. MARTIN: Because the - what - the property values have escalated to the point where the taxes are beyond your budget? WEBSTER: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about gentrification. We are speaking with record store owner Jacy Webster and journalist John Murph. Both have had a personal experience with neighborhoods in transition. Also with us is Lisa Sturtevan of the National Housing Conference. So, Lisa, you know, we flipped the script here, but - and I'm wondering whether that's unusual, what we're describing. Is this mainly an income issue, is it mainly a racial issue, or is race sometimes a proxy for income? STURTEVAN: Well, so you're talking here about flipping the script and I would argue that in most places, though, that income and the race issues go together. And so what you're seeing in the two cases we're hearing about today may be exceptions to a more general role where race and income tend to go in the same direction. MARTIN: Well, you know, sometimes they don't. As we mentioned, we ask NPR's Facebook followers what they thought about this issue. And I have a clip here from Kevin Archer (ph) of Denver, Colorado. He wrote in to tell us about his experience. KEVIN ARCHER: My great-grandfather was a Danish immigrant who built a house in northeast Denver in 1919. He sold that house in the early 1950s and retired to a farm outside of town. The neighborhood became increasingly populated by African-Americans due to postwar migrations from the South, redlining, etc. In 2012, my wife and I purchased a home about one mile from my family's original home in Denver. How can I be a bad gentrifier when I'm literally using the grocery store that my grandmother used. I'm going to the theater that my, you know, grandfather took my grandmother to their first date on. MARTIN: So, Lisa, tell me about that. STURTEVAN: Yeah so it sounds like in his case his family chose to leave the city and move out. And I think that that's the difference here - is when you have higher income folks moving into a place where they then put upward pressure on rent and home prices. It's not a choice for lower income people about whether they want to stay or leave that neighborhood. In many cases it's a forcing out. And I think that that's an important difference to understand. Now if that's the kind of. . . MARTIN: It's like you got mad at us and went to the suburbs, now you're back. STURTEVAN: Well, and now you're - I would argue if that's the kind of city that a city wants to be, a kind of community that a city wants - that's a decision to be made. But I think this idea of how much choice one has in the matter differentiates those two examples. MARTIN: John, I think - you kind of had a similar feeling, did you not? I mean, you felt that as a person of color, you're in a neighborhood that has been historically important to people of color - how can I be the bad guy? So. . . MURPH: Go ahead, finish your question. MARTIN: No, that was my question. MURPH: OK. MARTIN: I understand that it's actually even more significant than you are kind of letting us on. For some reason, I think you're not really telling us that you had some expenses that were really unpleasant. Like, for example, somebody spat on you at one point, which cannot have been a good feeling to come home to right? MURPH: Yeah. It was weird for me because, like you said before, as an African-American I naively thought that I was kind of, like, safe from being lumped in a gentrifier. Also I didn't have the income to support the whole gentrification - like, I couldn't move into Langston Loft, I was in the more lower income, mixed apartment. Probably my frustration, I guess, was not knowing who my allies were, if that makes any sense. When I was trying to get more protection in the area from the police, you know, I felt like me looking like I am, they think pretty safe versus if someone like Lisa came in. And this is an adult thinking maybe police protection would be even stronger. MARTIN: Jacy, what do you think about this? What would make things better for you? I mean, is this a question of personal manners or do you think this is in part - people just being more polite to each other and taking me - having better relationships? Is this a matter of policy? Is there something that the city you think should do to kind of help people like you who are long-term stakeholder stay where they are? I mean, because on the one hand, I said I hear you saying you see some benefits from these people. They're - you know, some of the political invisibility you felt is no more - on the other hand, you don't think it's as friendly. What would make things better for you in your opinion? WEBSTER: Well, I would really like the city to, you know, help people who've lived there for a long time stay there without, you know, forcing them out by, you know, increasing the tax - you know, the property tax. That would be one way to do itMARTIN: Can ask you a hard question? Why should they? Why is that a good - why do you think they should. WEBSTER: They don't have to. MARTIN: No, I know they don't have to, but you would like him to. I mean, I'm asking you for your opinion about why you think that's in kind of everybody's interest that that happened 'cause some people would argue that's just the way it is. WEBSTER: Yeah. MARTIN: That there's a reason that Harlem is a Dutch word, right, is that the Dutch were there first and then they left and now there's - you know, some people argue that that's just the way it is. What do you say? WEBSTER: Yeah. Well, I think it will be. It will be just the way it will be, you know. I know that I'll have to move and I'll have to grin and bear it, you know. MARTIN: But why would you like it to be otherwise? Just tell me your thoughts about this. You feel it would be better. . . WEBSTER: I'd like to stay there, you know. I like the - you know, my neighborhood is now safer than it had been, I like that idea. It's very convenient, there are things all around me now that weren't there before. I enjoy all that. But, you know, the comradery of the neighborhood is completely different and I'm not so sure I, you know, directly belong in that world. But I'll grin and bear that if I can stay there and not have to move to a place that might be, you know, like on the other side of the city that's more dangerous and, you know, like, less convenient. MARTIN: John, what are your thoughts about this? I mean, there's the balance between the dynamism that I think people enjoy and the sense of loss that people have when they feel the places that are their home are lost to them. How would you balance that? MURPH: That's an interesting question. I think some of the frustration that you mentioned in terms of loss and some of the things that she mentioned earlier is the whole power of mobility. Like, I can move from point A to point B or what have you. I think some of the frustration not only comes now in terms of race, but in terms of culture - meaning that I get a sense of some of the longer time residents feeling like the new incoming people are colonizing the neighborhood as opposed to wanting to be a part of the neighborhood. And that's a different - it's a different perspective - meaning that, like you said before, coming in and not speaking to the other people, coming in and replacing the mom and pop record store with a tanning booth that's obviously not geared towards African-American people. You know, that's huge. You know, that's a very obvious - OK, we do not want you here. And we're seeing certain things like that happen. MARTIN: Lisa, can I give you a final word here? What do you think would address some of these issues? I mean, is this a matter of policy? Is this a matter of manners? It's a matter of - what do you think would make a difference? STURTEVAN: I think. . . MARTIN: And why should - do you have an opinion about whether cities should work to maintain stability for people like long-term stakeholders like Jacy - or not? STURTEVAN: I think there is a benefit to cities to actively trying to encourage long-term residents to stay. Cities do better when there's a diversity of family types, cities do better when there's a diversity of incomes. If you want a thriving economy, you need folks of all income levels to work in those jobs. If you want a thriving community you need folks who invest in schools and have children as well as the folks who are singles. So it is in the cities' best interest as well. MARTIN: Are any cities moving to move in that direction? Could you briefly just tell us about that? STURTEVAN: Well, both here in D. C. and Philly there's been examples of tax abatements to help people remain in the city. And that's one small step but that's one of the examples we're seeing spreading a bit. MARTIN: Lisa Sturtevan is the vice president for research at the National Housing Conference. John Murph is a music and arts journalist. He was kind enough to join us - they were both kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. studios. With us from Philadelphia, Jacy Webster - he's the owner of Philadelphia Record Exchange. Thank you all so much for joining us. MURPH: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. If I say I want to talk about gentrification, what comes to mind? Do you think new businesses and services revitalizing tired rundown neighborhoods or do you think higher taxes and snobby people with too much money and too few manners pushing out your grandma? And be honest, is the real picture in your mind whites with money and blacks or Latinos or Asians without bumping up against each other? Well, wherever you see yourself in this story, you probably know there is a story. Filmmaker Spike Lee recently made a splash when he offered this comment at a Black History Month speaking event. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SPIKE LEE: You can\u2019t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you\u2019re mother [bleep] Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. You can't do that. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. MARTIN: Well, New York - where Spike Lee lives - isn't the only place where tensions have erupted. Washington, D. C. , Portland and Philadelphia have also seen these kinds of confrontations as established residents feel like new investors and new homeowners are leaving them out or, in some cases, pushing them out of an improving economic picture. We wanted to talk about this so we've called three people who have been thinking about or who have been affected by this issue. Lisa Sturtevan is vice president for research at the National Housing Conference. Also with us, John Murph. He lives in Washington, D. C. He's a music and arts journalist. And Jacy Webster, who lives in Philadelphia where he owns a Philadelphia Record Exchange. Welcome to you all. Thank you all so much for joining us. LISA STURTEVAN: Thank you. JOHN MURPH: Thank you. JACY WEBSTER: Thanks. MARTIN: Lisa, I'm going to ask you to give us the big picture. What types of neighborhoods tend to undergo gentrification or become subjects of urban renewal plans? And what does that process look like? STURTEVAN: Yeah. So I think you described it really well when you talked about neighborhoods where higher income folks come in a lower income folks tend to be displaced. And these are generally cities where there's been fast employment growth, where they've been attracting higher income residents because of jobs. And Washington, D. C. is a classic example where job growth here in the district was much faster than anywhere else. And so those are the places where residents and investors are really looking to move and where this gentrification tends to happen. MARTIN: Is gentrification a neutral word or is it a word that people tend to not like? STURTEVAN: Yeah. No, I think. . . MARTIN: Does it have politics behind it? STURTEVAN: I think gentrification has politics behind it. I don't think it's necessarily a word everybody knows either. But I think it's one of those things where you know it when you see it, right - when you walk through the neighborhood, when you talk to people about their experience, that there's common threads in what gentrification means to people. MARTIN: And what does it mean to people? STURTEVAN: I think it means that there's this group of people who are losing power to another group of people. I think it really comes down - when we talk about incomes and higher rents and higher prices - I think what we're really talking about is power. MARTIN: Not necessarily race? STURTEVAN: And I - well, I think that you can't talk about this without talking about race, but I don't want to suggest that in every case gentrification is a white moving minorities out. There are cases of places that are gentrified by minority higher income folks moving lower income folks out. Income is the real driver of gentrification. MARTIN: Well, let me turn to Jacy and John because one of the reasons we were happy that both of you could join us is that in each in your both way you've flipped the script on this narrative that a lot of people have. So, John, I'll start you. Your situation is - what? Tell us. I mean, and just for those who don't now know, you are African-American and in 2002 you moved into a predominantly black neighborhood in D. C. that was undergoing some changes. And tell us your experience. MURPH: Well, like you said before, I moved around 2002 to 14th and V, which is very close to the vibrant U Street district. And. . . MARTIN: U Street used to be known as Black Broadway back in the day. MURPH: Exactly. MARTIN: A lot of black businesses there, theatres and so forth. MURPH: And at that time, it was even more transitional than what it is now. And it was affordable. I was a journalist and I found a great place in which I could afford, nice apartment. And I was close to a lot of cultural places that I loved. Within that - within two years, I started noticing the change.  Then Busboys and Poets, a lot of condos moved in and. . . MARTIN: Busboys and Poets, just for those who don't know, it's a local change of restaurants and kind of gathering places. The owner is kind of a man about town - it's a gathering spot MURPH: Exactly. With those changes I also notice an escalating of turf wars. There was some pushbacks and a lot of escalating, kind of minor, but rising. MARTIN: Like what? You didn't feel well-received. Let me just. . . MURPH: Not feel well-received. . . MARTIN: Even though you're African-American, you felt like you were viewed as the enemy. MURPH: Exactly. And it wasn't just my experience, it was some of the white people who were moving in, you know, rocks were thrown at them, some of the Asians and Latinos as well. MARTIN: Like, what crystallized for you the fact that you didn't feel welcomed there? MURPH: I think when - I started feeling this way when people started noticing I was going to Busboys and Poets and some of the more, quote-unquote, more gentrified areas across the street. And when they saw that some of my friends were some of those white people who were possibly moving into some of the new condos, you know, then I got lumped in with them. MARTIN: How do you know that? What did people say to you? MURPH: It's a vibe. Sometimes people are not going to come and tell you, OK, you're part of this group now so therefore you can't play in the reindeer games. But it's a very gnawing attitude that you receive - it's hard to articulate. But you know when you get it, it's almost like they - when you talk about gentrification - you know it when you see it. MARTIN: Jacy, what you? Let's turn to you. You've got a different story. You're a long-term resident of your neighborhood. Who was living there when you first bought your house there in 1991? WEBSTER: Well. . . MARTIN: And who's living there now? What have you seen? WEBSTER: Well, it was an old Italian neighborhood - South Philly, well-known as being, you know, very Italian. And I moved in as a poor musician-type into my neighborhood. And, you know, I was accepted pretty well and it was cheap. It was nice to live, it was OK - it was a little rough. But it was fine, I loved it. And everything was good for quite a while. And then - I guess it was maybe 10 years ago, but really five years ago, it really took off - it was like a lot of people started coming in with money and the prices of houses went way up. And I just couldn't believe it. And I didn't know what was going on, but I thought - at first I thought it was great because, you know, there were new restaurants and, you know, all kinds of businesses were opening up. And there was a whole new vitality going on. You know, a lot of young wealthier kids, which I didn't understand, like, you know, raising families, like, who are these people? And they have a lot of money. And then all of a sudden I realized, oh, my God, the city is telling me my house is not worth 45,000, it's worth 280,000 and I have to pay taxes on that. And I was like, how did this happen? You know, that's kind like - was very shocking. MARTIN: And do you mind if I point out you're white. And so for you is this - is it a racial thing or not? I mean - or do. . . WEBSTER: No. MARTIN: And do you feel kind of like the other or do you feel invisible? WEBSTER: Yeah, I'm starting to feel that way. You know, it seems like my neighborhood is moving to a place that I don't belong in. And I'm sure all the old people that live around me that have been there - their families have been there forever - feel the same way. So I'm kind of in their boat. And. . . MARTIN: Why do you say that? WEBSTER: It just feels like. . . MARTIN: I mean, do people not speak to you on the street or they park there $700 strollers on your lawn? Or - what is it that makes you feel that way? WEBSTER: There's a bit of that. Yeah they're not like, you know, people that - like the old people would come up and say, hey, how you doing? You know, I made you lasagna. You know, it was awesome. But now it's like they just don't say anything at all, they just disappear down the street and they, you know, get into their cars and disappear. Yeah, they don't talk. It's not like a neighborhood like it was. It has a totally different feel. MARTIN: Are you worried you won't be able to afford your house anymore? WEBSTER: Yeah. MARTIN: Because the - what - the property values have escalated to the point where the taxes are beyond your budget? WEBSTER: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about gentrification. We are speaking with record store owner Jacy Webster and journalist John Murph. Both have had a personal experience with neighborhoods in transition. Also with us is Lisa Sturtevan of the National Housing Conference. So, Lisa, you know, we flipped the script here, but - and I'm wondering whether that's unusual, what we're describing. Is this mainly an income issue, is it mainly a racial issue, or is race sometimes a proxy for income? STURTEVAN: Well, so you're talking here about flipping the script and I would argue that in most places, though, that income and the race issues go together. And so what you're seeing in the two cases we're hearing about today may be exceptions to a more general role where race and income tend to go in the same direction. MARTIN: Well, you know, sometimes they don't. As we mentioned, we ask NPR's Facebook followers what they thought about this issue. And I have a clip here from Kevin Archer (ph) of Denver, Colorado. He wrote in to tell us about his experience. KEVIN ARCHER: My great-grandfather was a Danish immigrant who built a house in northeast Denver in 1919. He sold that house in the early 1950s and retired to a farm outside of town. The neighborhood became increasingly populated by African-Americans due to postwar migrations from the South, redlining, etc. In 2012, my wife and I purchased a home about one mile from my family's original home in Denver. How can I be a bad gentrifier when I'm literally using the grocery store that my grandmother used. I'm going to the theater that my, you know, grandfather took my grandmother to their first date on. MARTIN: So, Lisa, tell me about that. STURTEVAN: Yeah so it sounds like in his case his family chose to leave the city and move out. And I think that that's the difference here - is when you have higher income folks moving into a place where they then put upward pressure on rent and home prices. It's not a choice for lower income people about whether they want to stay or leave that neighborhood. In many cases it's a forcing out. And I think that that's an important difference to understand. Now if that's the kind of. . . MARTIN: It's like you got mad at us and went to the suburbs, now you're back. STURTEVAN: Well, and now you're - I would argue if that's the kind of city that a city wants to be, a kind of community that a city wants - that's a decision to be made. But I think this idea of how much choice one has in the matter differentiates those two examples. MARTIN: John, I think - you kind of had a similar feeling, did you not? I mean, you felt that as a person of color, you're in a neighborhood that has been historically important to people of color - how can I be the bad guy? So. . . MURPH: Go ahead, finish your question. MARTIN: No, that was my question. MURPH: OK. MARTIN: I understand that it's actually even more significant than you are kind of letting us on. For some reason, I think you're not really telling us that you had some expenses that were really unpleasant. Like, for example, somebody spat on you at one point, which cannot have been a good feeling to come home to right? MURPH: Yeah. It was weird for me because, like you said before, as an African-American I naively thought that I was kind of, like, safe from being lumped in a gentrifier. Also I didn't have the income to support the whole gentrification - like, I couldn't move into Langston Loft, I was in the more lower income, mixed apartment. Probably my frustration, I guess, was not knowing who my allies were, if that makes any sense. When I was trying to get more protection in the area from the police, you know, I felt like me looking like I am, they think pretty safe versus if someone like Lisa came in. And this is an adult thinking maybe police protection would be even stronger. MARTIN: Jacy, what do you think about this? What would make things better for you? I mean, is this a question of personal manners or do you think this is in part - people just being more polite to each other and taking me - having better relationships? Is this a matter of policy? Is there something that the city you think should do to kind of help people like you who are long-term stakeholder stay where they are? I mean, because on the one hand, I said I hear you saying you see some benefits from these people. They're - you know, some of the political invisibility you felt is no more - on the other hand, you don't think it's as friendly. What would make things better for you in your opinion? WEBSTER: Well, I would really like the city to, you know, help people who've lived there for a long time stay there without, you know, forcing them out by, you know, increasing the tax - you know, the property tax. That would be one way to do it MARTIN: Can ask you a hard question? Why should they? Why is that a good - why do you think they should. WEBSTER: They don't have to.

I mean, I'm asking you for your opinion about why you think that's in kind of everybody's interest that that happened 'cause some people would argue that's just the way it is. WEBSTER: Yeah.

What do you say? WEBSTER: Yeah. Well, I think it will be. It will be just the way it will be, you know. I know that I'll have to move and I'll have to grin and bear it, you know.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Maybe, just maybe spring is finally on its way after a bruising winter for much of the country. Even in parts of North Dakota today the temperature got close to 50 degrees. Still there is this remnant of winter: high energy bills. And for lower-income residents, a hefty heating bill can be an especially big burden. NPR's Andrea Hsu went to Knoxville, Tennessee, to hear how that city is trying to help those most vulnerable. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Think about cold weather states and Tennessee is probably not one that comes to mind. But spend a few minutes in the customer call center of the Knoxville Utilities Board and you get a sense of what kind of winter it's been. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So would you be able to pay that by 5:00 p. m. tomorrow or did you need a further extension? HSU: The utility has been urging people: if you think you cannot pay your bill, call us. We'll see what we can do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So the amount to avoid the service interruption right now, let me get that for you here. It'll take me just a moment. HSU: It was the coldest January Knoxville has seen since 1985. On average gas bills were up nearly 30 percent from a year ago. But that's an average. For the poor it's been even worse. Jeanie Fox is a customer counselor. JEANIE FOX: It's mostly the old homes, people that rent, folks that are on fixed income and lower income, their housing stock is not as good. They're the ones that have suffered. HSU: Most low-income housing here is energy inefficient. We're talking drafty windows and doors, old heating systems, little or no insulation and monstrous bills. And so every year social workers at the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee field thousands of requests for help. All day long they meet people like Bridget Caldwell. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Hi, how may I help you? BRIDGET CALDWELL: I'm a caregiver for someone who's in a wheelchair and he called. . . HSU: Caldwell has come to apply for energy assistance on behalf of the man she works for. CALDWELL: . . . and I was wanting to get an application for myself as well. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK. Why don't we start with you? CALDWELL: OK. HSU: They've both received final notices, meaning they've got to pay something or their utilities will be cut off. They both usually pay on time but this winter has set them back. Caldwell, a single mom, owes $260, more than a quarter of her monthly income. The man she looks after owes almost $450, well over half his Social Security check. CECELIA WATERS: These are current charges and this is kind of what we're seeing. HSU: Cecelia Waters, director of energy and community services here, has processed these requests year after year for more than a decade. They come from the elderly, the disabled and families with children. WATERS: It's a teeter-totter. You sometimes have to make choices between utilities and rent. HSU: This year the federal government is spending more than $3 billion on energy assistance for the poor. Knoxville and Knox County expect to get around $3 million of that. And the average grant is a one-time payment of $381. It goes directly to the utility. The program is a Band-Aid of sorts but Waters says one that works. WATERS: It's here and it keeps a lot of families stable. HSU: The waiting list for energy assistance is now more than 3,000 families long. Waters is anticipating another chunk of federal funds soon. For the most pressing cases, she's turning to churches and other nonprofits, even the Knoxville Utilities Board, for help. Still since the middle of December, the utility has disconnected more than 3,400 customers. Everyone here recognizes this is a perennial problem. Jake Tisinger is with the city's Office of Sustainability. JAKE TISINGER: I don't think anybody wants to - you know, no churches out there want to keep donating just to pay utility bills. They want to solve a problem and they want to make sure families are staying in their homes and being able to live a normal life. HSU: And the city believes the key to doing that is weatherization. The idea of weather-proofing low-income housing has been around for decades. The Recovery Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus bill, allocated record amounts of money for weatherization, $5 billion to be used over three years. Knoxville got $6 million, a windfall. Jason Estes who's in charge of Knoxville's weatherization program says it allowed them to work on some 1,500 homes, including one belonging to a former coal miner and his wife. In the winter, their utility bill would soar to $800 a month. JASON ESTES: They wore two layers of clothes and socks. He actually wore a hat to bed. Where he laid his head there was air coming through the window. He joked about it and said he kind of looked pretty funny he guessed, but you have to do what you have to do. And they were always glad when the spring came. HSU: Estes, who's a general contractor by training, ticked through all the improvements that weatherization funds paid for. ESTES: We put a new heat and air system in. We wrapped the water heater. We fixed the broken windows and we calked all the doors and windows, replaced lighting. . . HSU: When all was done the couple's energy use was cut in half. But here's the rub. Weatherization is expensive, as much as $6,500 a house. Estes says typically you'll get 20 percent energy savings, so it could be 15 to 20 years before the work pays for itself. But Estes says the payoff for those in need is immediate. ESTES: Somebody that's getting $800 to $1,000 a month to live on and they have to make those choices between do I pay my utility bill, do I buy my medicine, do I buy food, well that $25, $75 a month that they might save is huge. HSU: Lately Jason Estes has been trying to figure out new strategies. He's working on a database to show which pockets of the city have the highest energy bills, who's getting the most energy assistance and how folks in weatherized homes are doing. If someone's still asking for help, he wants to know why. ESTES: Maybe they're not changing their behavior. Maybe they're letting more people move in or maybe something has happened and we need to identify what's changed for that weatherization not to be saving them money. HSU: Estes would love to weatherize much more of the city's affordable housing but right now that's a pipe dream. Since the Recovery Act, support for weatherization has plummeted. Department of Energy audits in other parts of the country, even elsewhere in Tennessee, found widespread waste and fraud and egregious examples of shoddy work. ESTES: That is very frustrating, and it's a battle that we have to continue to contain and deal with, because it affects funding. Currently we have 789 people on the waiting list for weatherization, and I have zero funding. HSU: So for now, the yearly ritual of stopgap utility payments will go on as imperfect as it is. Andrea Hsu, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  And I'm Melissa Block. Maybe, just maybe spring is finally on its way after a bruising winter for much of the country. Even in parts of North Dakota today the temperature got close to 50 degrees. Still there is this remnant of winter: high energy bills. And for lower-income residents, a hefty heating bill can be an especially big burden. NPR's Andrea Hsu went to Knoxville, Tennessee, to hear how that city is trying to help those most vulnerable. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Think about cold weather states and Tennessee is probably not one that comes to mind. But spend a few minutes in the customer call center of the Knoxville Utilities Board and you get a sense of what kind of winter it's been. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So would you be able to pay that by 5:00 p. m. tomorrow or did you need a further extension? HSU: The utility has been urging people: if you think you cannot pay your bill, call us. We'll see what we can do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So the amount to avoid the service interruption right now, let me get that for you here. It'll take me just a moment. HSU: It was the coldest January Knoxville has seen since 1985. On average gas bills were up nearly 30 percent from a year ago. But that's an average. For the poor it's been even worse. Jeanie Fox is a customer counselor. JEANIE FOX: It's mostly the old homes, people that rent, folks that are on fixed income and lower income, their housing stock is not as good. They're the ones that have suffered. HSU: Most low-income housing here is energy inefficient. We're talking drafty windows and doors, old heating systems, little or no insulation and monstrous bills. And so every year social workers at the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee field thousands of requests for help. All day long they meet people like Bridget Caldwell. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Hi, how may I help you? BRIDGET CALDWELL: I'm a caregiver for someone who's in a wheelchair and he called. . . HSU: Caldwell has come to apply for energy assistance on behalf of the man she works for. CALDWELL: . . . and I was wanting to get an application for myself as well. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK. Why don't we start with you? CALDWELL: OK. HSU: They've both received final notices, meaning they've got to pay something or their utilities will be cut off. They both usually pay on time but this winter has set them back. Caldwell, a single mom, owes $260, more than a quarter of her monthly income. The man she looks after owes almost $450, well over half his Social Security check. CECELIA WATERS: These are current charges and this is kind of what we're seeing. HSU: Cecelia Waters, director of energy and community services here, has processed these requests year after year for more than a decade. They come from the elderly, the disabled and families with children. WATERS: It's a teeter-totter. You sometimes have to make choices between utilities and rent. HSU: This year the federal government is spending more than $3 billion on energy assistance for the poor. Knoxville and Knox County expect to get around $3 million of that. And the average grant is a one-time payment of $381. It goes directly to the utility. The program is a Band-Aid of sorts but Waters says one that works. WATERS: It's here and it keeps a lot of families stable. HSU: The waiting list for energy assistance is now more than 3,000 families long. Waters is anticipating another chunk of federal funds soon. For the most pressing cases, she's turning to churches and other nonprofits, even the Knoxville Utilities Board, for help. Still since the middle of December, the utility has disconnected more than 3,400 customers. Everyone here recognizes this is a perennial problem. Jake Tisinger is with the city's Office of Sustainability. JAKE TISINGER: I don't think anybody wants to - you know, no churches out there want to keep donating just to pay utility bills. They want to solve a problem and they want to make sure families are staying in their homes and being able to live a normal life. HSU: And the city believes the key to doing that is weatherization. The idea of weather-proofing low-income housing has been around for decades. The Recovery Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus bill, allocated record amounts of money for weatherization, $5 billion to be used over three years. Knoxville got $6 million, a windfall. Jason Estes who's in charge of Knoxville's weatherization program says it allowed them to work on some 1,500 homes, including one belonging to a former coal miner and his wife. In the winter, their utility bill would soar to $800 a month. JASON ESTES: They wore two layers of clothes and socks. He actually wore a hat to bed. Where he laid his head there was air coming through the window. He joked about it and said he kind of looked pretty funny he guessed, but you have to do what you have to do. And they were always glad when the spring came. HSU: Estes, who's a general contractor by training, ticked through all the improvements that weatherization funds paid for. ESTES: We put a new heat and air system in. We wrapped the water heater. We fixed the broken windows and we calked all the doors and windows, replaced lighting. . . HSU: When all was done the couple's energy use was cut in half. But here's the rub. Weatherization is expensive, as much as $6,500 a house. Estes says typically you'll get 20 percent energy savings, so it could be 15 to 20 years before the work pays for itself. But Estes says the payoff for those in need is immediate. ESTES: Somebody that's getting $800 to $1,000 a month to live on and they have to make those choices between do I pay my utility bill, do I buy my medicine, do I buy food, well that $25, $75 a month that they might save is huge. HSU: Lately Jason Estes has been trying to figure out new strategies. He's working on a database to show which pockets of the city have the highest energy bills, who's getting the most energy assistance and how folks in weatherized homes are doing. If someone's still asking for help, he wants to know why. ESTES: Maybe they're not changing their behavior. Maybe they're letting more people move in or maybe something has happened and we need to identify what's changed for that weatherization not to be saving them money. HSU: Estes would love to weatherize much more of the city's affordable housing but right now that's a pipe dream. Since the Recovery Act, support for weatherization has plummeted. Department of Energy audits in other parts of the country, even elsewhere in Tennessee, found widespread waste and fraud and egregious examples of shoddy work.

AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: The extension would apply retroactively to capture people who've been without long-term unemployment benefits since last December.

Sure, and if that's all we could get was five months, well, I mean, fine, but we can't just let them drop off the edge of the earth at that time either. You know, we still have too high of an unemployment rate in this country. CHANG: The bill is paid for by new fees on goods that come through U. S. Customs and by something called pension smoothing. That's a way to allow employers to reduce their payments to employee pensions, which results in more taxable income. Still, the chances that the bill as structured will pass the House are slim.

It has now surpassed a trillion dollars, higher than America's collective credit card debt. As part of our month-long look at how Americans are paying for college, NPR's Claudio Sanchez examines how soaring college costs have forced families to put a much larger share of their income towards higher education. CLAUDIO SANCHEZ, BYLINE: If you want to get an earful about paying for college, listen to parents from states where tuition and fees have skyrocketed in the last five years. In Arizona, for example, parents have seen a 77 percent increase. Why? GRACE LAMOUREAUX: I think that's the question most parents ask themselves. SANCHEZ: Grace LaMoureaux of Sun City, Arizona says her son couldn't afford to stay in college. She worries her granddaughter won't either so she's trying to help her with tuition. LAMOUREAUX: How much is going to come out of my pocket and where am I going to get that money? SANCHEZ: Parents in Georgia have seen tuition go up 75 percent, Washington State 70 percent. Even in Oklahoma, where tuition increases have been among the lowest in the nation, parents are dismayed. Jeffery Corbett is from Stillwater, Oklahoma. His daughter is attending community college. Corbett, a fundraiser for a nonprofit, says a high school diploma just won't get you very far. He knows. He doesn't have a college degree. JEFFREY CORBETT: Oh, I think about it all the time because I realize what it has limited me by not having that piece of paper. SANCHEZ: And that, experts say, is the source of parents' frustration. Today a college education seems unaffordable at the worst possible time. SANDY BAUM: College prices are going up so fast when people are really struggling. The unemployment rate is high. Nobody's wages have gone up in recent years. SANCHEZ: Sandy Baum, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, has spent much of her career studying trends in college costs. BAUM: Increases in college tuition at public colleges, particularly in recent years, have really been unacceptable. And there's no question that that is a much higher percentage of median incomes than it used to be. SANCHEZ: And yet, says Baum. . . BAUM: Somehow people are paying for it. And the reason people are paying for it is because the return to the investment is so high. SANCHEZ: No matter what you pay for higher education, most Americans think it will be worth it, says Baum. But it was a different story 70 years ago, when most Americans thought college was only for the wealthy, the elite. That changed after World War II with the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI Bill of Rights. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THELIN: The GI Bill made college affordable for an entire group of veterans who never would have thought of going beyond high school. SANCHEZ: John Thelin is a professor at the University of Kentucky. THELIN: And I am the author of \"A History of American Higher Education. \"SANCHEZ: Thelin says the GI Bill was an unexpected success, enrolling just under eight million veterans, 10 times the number the authors of the bill had predicted. This sudden, enormous demand, says Thelin, could have pushed college costs higher, but it didn't because states embraced the idea. The booming postwar economy allowed them to spend unprecedented sums of money to expand higher education. THELIN: The biggest problem that was facing governors and legislators was, could we build campuses fast enough? SANCHEZ: While states were investing, the federal government was carving out a huge new role for itself: helping families pay for college. It spawned the National Defense Student Loan program, which later became the Perkins Loan program. It did for civilians what the GI Bill had done for veterans, opening college gates even wider. Then, with the civil rights movement as the backdrop, the landmark 1965 Higher Education Act pushed for greater college access for women and minorities. Again, John Thelin. THELIN: And also what's important to note is in that same period, 1965 to 1972, colleges and universities dug very deep into their own pockets to provide grants and other forms of student financial aid in partnership with the new federal programs. SANCHEZ: Americans flocked to campuses with the expectation that the government was going to foot part of the cost. For many more Americans, says Thelin, college became affordable. THELIN: I think the turning point was around 1970. SANCHEZ: Double-digit inflation, an oil embargo, a sputtering economy - a perfect storm began to build. College tuition and fees climbed as much or more than the inflation rate. Private loans, heavily subsidized by the federal government, gradually replaced federal grants as the main source of money for both poor and middle-class college students. As family income fell, borrowing to pay for college took off, while public investment in higher education dropped. Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute says that drop has been the single biggest reason for the increase in college costs. BAUM: So it's not that colleges are spending more money to educate students. It's that they have to get that money from someplace to replace their lost state funding, and that's from tuition and fees from students and families. SANCHEZ: While most institutions tried to keep costs down, Baum says some took advantage of the public perception that a high tuition means a quality education. BAUM: There's certainly evidence that people don't know how to measure the quality of a college education. They think that if it's expensive it must be better. I don't think colleges want to have high prices, but I do think they see strategic reasons why it may be in their interest to have high prices. SANCHEZ: For the average family, though, the pricing of a college education has become a shell game. As colleges love to point out, there's the sticker price and there's the real price, which is great for the few who can navigate the labyrinth of financial aid sources and discounts institutions say they offer. Which brings us back to those bewildered, if not wary, parents who see no end to the rise in college costs. Parents like Heather Gillette, a mother of two from suburban Seattle. Her daughter attends Washington State University, where she's studying to be a veterinarian. HEATHER GILLETTE: It was never a question that my kids were going to go to college. It was always a discussion from the time that they were babies that that's what they were going to do. But it does come down to the parent making the decision about what they can afford.

Although, the Fed tinkered with the wording of its end-of-meeting statement, she said Fed policy was basically unchanged. Financial markets thought otherwise and gave her the thumbs down. To help us understand why, we turn now to David Wessel. He's with the Brookings Institution and a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. And David, start by telling us what exactly the Fed did yesterday. DAVID WESSEL: It said it would continue to scale back its purchases of long-term bonds because the economy is gradually healing. It said that it still intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero - where they've been since 2008 - for a long while, provided the economy behaves as the Fed currently forecasts. A big if. And Ms. Yellen emphasized that once the Fed does start raising interest rates, it plans to do so very gradually and keep them lower than normal even after inflation and unemployment return to normal. MONTAGNE: And why the negative reaction in the financial markets? WESSEL: Financial markets are. . . MONTAGNE: That's pretty straightforward. WESSEL: To you. (LAUGHTER)WESSEL: Financial markets are fixated on what is going to trigger a Fed rate increase and when that's likely to happen. And they react - maybe overreact - to any hints the Fed gives. And some analysts say, saw signs in the new Fed forecast released yesterday, that some officials are preparing to raise rates earlier in 2015 than had previously anticipated. And Jenny Yellen reinforced that view by fumbling the answer to one question. But I actually don't think that was her intent. MONTAGNE: To fumble the answer. . . DAVID GREENE, HOST: She didn't mean to provoke expectations that rates were coming earlier. Look, the Fed has been trying all sorts of ways to persuade people that it really isn't going to rush to raise rates. Earlier, it done that by saying, we're going to keep interest rates near zero, well past that unemployment close to six and a half percent. Well, unemployment is close to that, so they had to change their formula - their message - and they came up with one that's very vague. It discards any reference to a single number. It says they're going to look at a wide range of indicators, so the market is looking for little clues here. She said, explicitly, that the new words weren't meant to convey any change in the Fed thinking. She is trying to say the Fed is not going to tap the brakes until the job market gets a whole lot better and the Fed is confident that inflation has moved up towards its two percent target. MONTAGNE: But David, isn't a falling unemployment rate a sign that the job market is getting better? WESSEL: It certainly is. But as she pointed out, it's down, in part, because so many people have dropped out of the job market and they're not looking for work so they don't show up as unemployed in the official tally. So she said the Fed is looking at all sorts of other indicators that suggest the labor market is weak. For instance, she mentioned that an unusually large number of workers - five percent of the labor force - is working part-time but wants work full-time. And she dismissed all the speculation that's in the press and among some analysts that wages are starting to go up. That's another sign of a weak labor market. MONTAGNE: So, overall, with her first press conference - her debut -what do you give her, a thumbs up or a thumbs down? WESSEL: I give her a thumbs up. Except for that one stumble on the timing of rate increases, it did shake up the market, she did pretty well. She fielded questions with what seemed to me, composure and confidence. She appeared to be candid. She said at one point that the Fed had been too optimistic about the economy in January. Now she was a little wordy and that disappointed the press, 'cause she didn't have a lot of pithy soundbites and she answered fewer questions - 15 - than Ben Bernanke did at his last press conference - 21, but frankly, that might have been her intent. MONTAGNE: David, always a pleasure. WESSEL: You're welcome. MONTAGNE: David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution.

Last year, public transit ridership jumped to the highest level in more than 50 years. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: May I have your attention, Metra Stop West service customers for your 8:35 to Portland. . . CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: During the morning rush at Chicago's Union Station, commuter trains pull in, the doors open and a crush of people, newspapers and coffee cups in hand, pour off like a flood. Financial analyst Nader Kouklan says he makes the trip from the suburbs to Chicago's downtown every day. NADER KOUKLAN: It's easier and just a faster way to get to work, rather than having to deal with the traffic of the morning commute. CORLEY: Law student Amalia Romano rides Chicago's Metra line too. AMALIA ROMANO: I take it because I don't want to pay $16 to park every day. CORLEY: Or, she says, pay high gasoline prices if she drives. Metra spokesman Michael Gillis says on a typical workday the number of rides people take on Metra is about 300,000. And the total for last year was 82 million trips - a 1 percent increase in ridership over 2012. MICHAEL GILLIS: Employment had a lot to do with it, just the gradual gains in employment in the region. Downtown office occupancy ticked up a little bit, so that helped. CORLEY: And there was one other big reason: sports. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Would you like to say hello to the Chicago Blackhawks hockey players who just won the 2013 Stanley Cup? (APPLAUSE)CORLEY: When the Chicago Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup championship last year, 425,000 people rode Metra that day, many coming into town to join about two million fans at the huge Blackhawks rally held downtown. GILLIS: So, that was probably one of the busiest days in Metra history. CORLEY: Throughout the entire country, though, just about every public transportation system so hikes in ridership. That's according to a recent study by the American Public Transportation Association. President Michael Melaniphy says Americans took 10. 7 billion trips on public transportation last year. MICHAEL MELANIPHY: That's huge. This is the highest ridership number we've had in public transportation in 57 years. CORLEY: No blip, says Melaniphy, just a steady public transit climb. Nationally, bus ridership was flat in 2013, due in part to horrible winter weather. However, the numbers for subways, elevated trains, street cars and trolleys were up. Again, Michael Melaniphy. MELANIPHY: Cities under 100,000 have had ridership increases on average of 3. 83 percent. We've seen ridership increases in big cities as we and New York, had a ridership increase. CORLEY: Public transit agencies in Ann Arbor, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Flagstaff and Denver were among those reporting record ridership levels. And in Utah, which added several new transit lines around Salt Lake City, the number of people traveling by commuter rail went up a whopping. . . REMI BARRON: A hundred and three percent over the years before. CORLEY: Utah Transportation Authority, or UTA, spokesman Remi Barron says Utah's been on a public transit building boom. A new commuter line runs between Salt Lake City and Provo, and there are new light rail lines. BARRON: Our airport line's been particular popular, especially with skiers and visitors because now people can get right off the plane, they can hop onto the light rail train and they can be downtown in 15 minutes. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN BELL RINGING)CORLEY: The UTA's commuter line is called the Frontrunner. It's a train Spencer Saddler, a college student, takes about three times a week. He says when he used to drive, he'd get stuck in traffic a lot. SPENCER SADDLER: It was just really annoying. And you look over and you see Frontrunner just racing down the tracks, like, I could be sitting in there right now taking a nap or doing homework. CORLEY: UTA is one of many transit systems that expects ridership to continue to grow this year. The Public Transit Association says it's because there is a fundamental change in how people move about their communities. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN BELL RINGING)CORLEY: Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Chicago.

It's just a matter of how much. Seventy percent of today's graduates leave school owing money, on average, close to $30,000. And this is a change from the past. Two decades ago, fewer half of all students needed loans for college. Their average debt after four years was $9,000. Another challenge today is that the federal government often concludes that families need less financial aid than the families themselves think they do. NPR has been looking at how Americans are paying for college. NPR's Eric Westervelt has this morning's story. ALYSSA TUCKER: I honestly have no idea how I'm going to pay for school. I'm the first one in my family to go to college. THAO LE: I think we all have our fingers crossed for a full ride, and, like, it's really scary to me. ERIC WESTERVELT, BYLINE: Alyssa Tucker and Thao Le sit on a metal table in a sunny courtyard of Irvington, a large public high school in Fremont, California, southeast of San Francisco. Both come from families with modest incomes, are 17 and are facing college this fall with anxious excitement. They put in years of hard work, lots of late nights and weekends studying. They've excelled academically, and they're confident they can shine in college, too. But there's that big price tag, and it's not just tuition. There's also housing, medical, food, transportation, books, supplies and other fees. Le's father lost his engineering job during the Great Recession. Her mom works as a quality control technician. They tell their daughter not to stress: They'll do what it takes to pay for school. LE: My dad even said I'll even sell our house if you really need to go to a school. And I just - I don't want that to happen. You know, I know education is important, but I don't want to put everything that my parents make on the line. WESTERVELT: Putting everything on the line: It's a worry shared by tens of thousands of students and their families wondering how they'll pay for higher education in an era when family and state budgets are clawing their way back from recession-induced hits. Le has applied to top schools, including USC, Dartmouth and Stanford. But, she says, I'm ready to go to a community college to save up and transfer when I can afford to. Alyssa Tucker nods. My mom's super supportive, she says, adding: She knows I've worked so hard for so long to get to a good college. But financially, she adds, there are big limits on what she can contribute. TUCKER: I come from a pretty difficult family situation. My family, they just can't afford anything else. So I'm just on my own, pretty much, hoping that I don't have to take out too much in loans. WESTERVELT: U. S. Department of Education data show that three-quarters of American undergrads have some amount of unmet financial need they have to cover with loans, a job while in college, or both. Take Pell Grants, the largest federal aid program aimed mainly at low-income students. Even after taking into account federal loans and work-study, the data show that about 86 percent of Pell recipients had nearly $9,000 in unmet need, on average, per year. Seventeen-year-old Thao Le says grasping how the payment puzzle will all fit together is tough. LE: A lot of kids, like, their parents don't really tell them about the whole financial situation. Or even if they did, it's kind of hard to understand at this age, because we're just, like, overloaded with everything else. We don't even know how taxes even work. WESTERVELT: Recent efforts to simplify and clarify the aid process include making a family's federal tax data easier to access and requiring net price calculators on all college websites. But critics say those changes don't go nearly far enough. The daunting, complex aid process can be even more so for low-income and first-generation-to-college families, says Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Navigating that tangled aid forest, she says, takes effort, time and savvy that some families may not have. SANDY BAUM: It is a huge problem that it is so hard to get the information that you need. The information is there. It's just too complicated, and people need personal help. So, if you're lucky, you have a good high school guidance counselor. There are many websites out there that can be helpful. So it's not so much that we need more information. We need better information, and we need to get that information to people. WESTERVELT: To apply for federal financial aid, families have to embrace the dreaded FAFSA: the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Families have to enter income, asset, tax and other information. Anyone who's ever filled one out knows the FAFSA is about as much fun as doing your taxes. But it's the key form: In addition to federal assistance, many state and college aid programs use it. That FAFSA information is then filtered through one of eight formulas that look at income and several other factors. The formula then spits out a number: the expected family contribution, EFC, or as one commentator called it, exasperated financial confusion. LAUREN ASHER: Very few people will look at that number and feel like, oh, no problem. I can just whip out my checkbook. WESTERVELT: Lauren Asher is president of the Institute for College Access and Success, a research and advocacy group. She notes one study shows that the complexity and relative confusion surrounding the application process for Pell Grants may discourage those who need it most from even applying for aid: lower-income students who may be wavering about college because of cost worries. ASHER: The formula that the federal aid system uses to determine your estimated family contribution is not perfect. Some would like to see it greatly simplified. It's a common public misperception that the lowest-income students are getting their financial aid needs met when they go to college, and that's simply not true. They are much more likely to have loans and to owe more than all other students. WESTERVELT: Colleges have been asking students and families to cover more and more of the cost, Asher says, which are rising faster than family income or available grant aid. So, more students - undergraduate and graduate - are borrowing ever more amounts to fill the gap. TRACY BUTLER: My name is Tracy Butler. I'm 24 years old, and I live in Columbus, Ohio. I am finishing up a doctorate in physical therapy, and then my fiance is finishing up his medical degree. WESTERVELT: Butler and her fiance are likely to earn good salaries in their respective medical fields, but their combined - mostly federal - debt load by the time they finish school later this year: at least $350,000. BUTLER: We're definitely planning to live minimally, you know, not take lots of vacations or live in a fancy apartment and delay buying a house, which is unfortunate. WESTERVELT: So, what's part of the solution to all this? Tracy and her fiance are heartened about a relatively new federal income-based repayment program. It ties the loan repayment amount to how much you earn and family size. And, after 20 years, if they still owe money, the remainder is forgiven. Lauren Asher with the Institute for College Access and Success pushed for that plan. She says while it doesn't solve the problem of rising cost and debt, income-based repayment is a big step forward. ASHER: That's a light at the end of a tunnel. The forgiveness in the income-driven plans is the assurance that your payments will not last forever. They won't follow you to the grave. WESTERVELT: Now, few can predict their income five years down the line, let alone 20. But Tracy Butler says the program offers solace that the debt burden might be manageable, and may allow her and her fiance to start saving for kids, a mortgage or retirement a lot sooner.

ASHER: The formula that the federal aid system uses to determine your estimated family contribution is not perfect. Some would like to see it greatly simplified. It's a common public misperception that the lowest-income students are getting their financial aid needs met when they go to college, and that's simply not true. They are much more likely to have loans and to owe more than all other students. WESTERVELT: Colleges have been asking students and families to cover more and more of the cost, Asher says, which are rising faster than family income or available grant aid. So, more students - undergraduate and graduate - are borrowing ever more amounts to fill the gap. TRACY BUTLER: My name is Tracy Butler. I'm 24 years old, and I live in Columbus, Ohio. I am finishing up a doctorate in physical therapy, and then my fiance is finishing up his medical degree. WESTERVELT: Butler and her fiance are likely to earn good salaries in their respective medical fields, but their combined - mostly federal - debt load by the time they finish school later this year: at least $350,000. BUTLER: We're definitely planning to live minimally, you know, not take lots of vacations or live in a fancy apartment and delay buying a house, which is unfortunate. WESTERVELT: So, what's part of the solution to all this? Tracy and her fiance are heartened about a relatively new federal income-based repayment program. It ties the loan repayment amount to how much you earn and family size. And, after 20 years, if they still owe money, the remainder is forgiven. Lauren Asher with the Institute for College Access and Success pushed for that plan. She says while it doesn't solve the problem of rising cost and debt, income-based repayment is a big step forward. ASHER: That's a light at the end of a tunnel. The forgiveness in the income-driven plans is the assurance that your payments will not last forever. They won't follow you to the grave. WESTERVELT: Now, few can predict their income five years down the line, let alone 20. But Tracy Butler says the program offers solace that the debt burden might be manageable, and may allow her and her fiance to start saving for kids, a mortgage or retirement a lot sooner.

Back then the focus was Alaska and Prince William Sound. The Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran into a reef and began spilling millions of gallons of crude oil. Today, tanker technology has improved, but as NPR's Jeff Brady reports, companies also are drilling in much riskier environments. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Just about all the oil that's easy to drill for is gone. Or it's controlled by state-owned companies in places like Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. That leaves private corporations with the oil in hard-to-reach places: on the ocean floor or locked in shale a mile underground. RICHARD KEIL: The days of being able to easily access resources are largely behind us. BRADY: ExxonMobil spokesman Richard Keil says his company takes these more challenging environments very seriously. In 2006, ExxonMobil had spent $187 million drilling a deep water well. It looked like a rich find with lots of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. But there were indications that continuing to drill the well might not be safe. KEIL: So, in spite of having spent nearly $200 million on this project, it was one we turned our back on and walked away from. We took a lot of heat from our shareholders at the time, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. BRADY: That approach is difficult to maintain, especially if it's been a long time since a company last had an accident. NANCY KINNER: Sometimes we get a little cocky about how good things are going and then think, oh no, we don't have to worry, we've got this one nailed. And then sometimes we don't. BRADY: That's Nancy Kinner, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire. She says the oil industry has improved safety and spill clean-up response. But there's also a lot more drilling going on now. KINNER: On the one hand, we now have better technology to minimize the risk, but we have more activity occurring. BRADY: Kinner says riskier work combined with more drilling increases the risk of accidents. That's one reason the industry is spending more than a billion dollars on the Marine Well Containment Company. It's meant to respond quickly to well blowouts. CEO Marty Massey showed off some of its equipment outside Houston a few years back. MARTY MASSEY: Well, it's a big hunk of iron, as you can see. BRADY: He's describing a hundred-ton capping stack that's placed over an out-of-control well and diverts the leaking oil to tankers above. It's similar to the device that brought BP's gusher in the Gulf of Mexico under control in 2010. That one had to be built from scratch while the well was still leaking. But this one is ready to deploy, says Brian Salerno, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. BRIAN SALERNO: That technology existed prior to the Gulf oil spill but it was never really a requirement for deep water operations. It is now. BRADY: Salerno has another plan to improve safety. He's taking cues from airlines, which have improved their record dramatically in recent decades. He wants to collect data about near-misses, the accidents that almost happened.

I'm Michel Martin. The minimum wage debate is in the news again. President Obama and other Democrats have been pushing for an increase as part of a broader conversation about economic fairness. But if you've ever been a caddy on the golf course, a server at a restaurant or anybody else who's depending on tips, then you know that sometimes the minimum wage isn't really the minimum at all, especially if you run into customers like this. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"RESERVOIR DOGS\")CHRIS PENN: (As Nice Guy Eddie) Come on, throw in a buck. STEVE BUSCEMI: (As Mr. Pink) Uh-uh, I don't tip. PENN: (As Nice Guy Eddie) You don't tip? BUSCEMI: (As Mr. Pink) No, I don't believe in it. PENN: (As Nice Guy Eddie) You don't believe in tipping? EDWARD BUNKER: (As Mr. Blue) You know what these chicks make? BUSCEMI: (As Mr. Pink) Don't give me that. If she don't make enough money she can quit. MARTIN: Yes, that was the opening scene from the film \"Reservoir Dogs. \" But the unfortunate reality for many tipped workers is that a few stingy customers can leave them short. The federal minimum wage for these employees is just $2. 13 an hour. The Obama administration says it's time to get serious about those wages in a report released this week, it called for an increase in the minimum wage for tipped workers. But there is, as you might imagine, another side to this issue. So we've called two people to learn more about this. We've called on Michael Tanner. He's a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. That's a research institution that advocates for a limited government and free markets. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again. MICHAEL TANNER: Pleasure to be with you. MARTIN: Also back with us, Ross Eisenbrey. He is vice president of the Economic Policy Institute. That's a think tank that advocates for low and middle-income workers. Welcome back to you as well. Thank you for joining us. ROSS EISENBREY: It's a pleasure to be here. MARTIN: So could you just help me understand why there's this difference between the minimum wage for tipped workers and for other workers? And I'm sure it's more complicated than a simple answer, but if you could try to make it as simple as you can. EISENBREY: I'm going to make it simple and complicated. The federal government, when it covered workers like restaurant workers, right from the beginning said that the employer only had to pay directly half of the minimum wage and could rely on tips for the other half. And so that's the simple question. Over time, it's no longer half - it's only $2. 13 for a $7. 25 minimum wage. MARTIN: But what's the logic of that? I mean, what's the logic of why they're set at different levels to begin with? EISENBREY: Well, there's a political logic, which is the restaurant industry, you know, lobbied hard for it and it's a powerful lobby in Washington. And so they got that passed. And then there's a feeling that, well, the workers will get enough in tips and the employer is required to make up if - let's say the person only gets - the waiter only gets $3 an hour in tips, the employer would have to make up the other $2. So effectively, in the law, it is a full minimum wage, the employer just isn't required to pay it directly. It can rely on tips. MARTIN: So what's your perspective on this question of raising the tipped minimum wage - on paper minimum wage? EISENBREY: OK. So it's important to know that. . . MARTIN: Because if some people would argue that if it's really just kind of a fictional number anyway and that the employer makes it up anyway, what's the difference? EISENBREY: Well, there are eight states where the full minimum wage is required, where the employer has to pay the full minimum, which in several of the states is higher than the federal minimum wage. And in those states we find that the workers are of course better paid and the poverty rate for servers and tip workers is lower than it is in states where the $2. 13 minimum one is allowed. So it's clearly a better thing for workers. It's a better thing for those workers' families. And, you know, these are women by and large, and women are underpaid all throughout the economy - they get 77 percent of men's wages overall. And this is a way to help women. And two-thirds of these servers have children and, you know - so this is a way to help families. It's a way to improve the life for people who are right at the bottom of our economy. MARTIN: Michael Tanner, certainly I want to hear from you. Just one more question to you, Mr. Eisenbrey. How do you make sure that employers pay the difference? EISENBREY: That's a. . . MARTIN: How is that enforced? EISENBREY: It's a very difficult thing to enforce. The Wage and Hour Division - the Labor Department division that enforces the minimum wage - did 9,000 investigations between 2010 and 2012 of restaurants that are full-service restaurants that have tipped workers and found that 83 percent of them had violations. So there's sort of a rampant widespread violation of the law. It's a very hard thing to police. It would be much easier if the employer were just required to pay right upfront the entire weight. MARTIN: Michael Tanner, what's your perspective on this? I take it your organization is against raising the tipped minimum wage, as well as the minimum wage overall. TANNER: Well, that's right. I think you have to look at the other side of this equation as well, which is the restaurant involved. You know, the average full-service restaurant has a profit margin of just 2 percent. These are not big businesses raking in huge amount of bucks. In fact, 60 percent of restaurants go out of business within the first 5 years. They have a very small margin for profit. So if you're going to dramatically increase the amount that they have to pay in wages - and don't forget we're dealing with an environment in which other wage increase equivalents, such as the health care laws and other things are also increasing the cost of labor - you're going to make it more difficult for these people to hire people or else they're going to bring down cost in some other ways. MARTIN: Just on a gut level, though, $2 an hour seems hardly worth getting out of bed in the morning. . . TANNER: Well, they're not making $2 an hour. MARTIN: I mean, honestly, for an adult - for an adult. I mean, I'm just saying that the argument that I think most free-market advocates make or at least people who have. . . TANNER: Sure. MARTIN: . . . Take issue with the social safety net is that you really need to value work over aid and that if the value of work is so low, what's the incentive? So. . . TANNER: Well, sure. MARTIN: . . . What's your. . . TANNER: Sure - two parts to that. First of all, they're not making $2 an hour. They're making at least the minimum wage. In fact, even the bottom 10 percent of people in the tipped industry make more than the minimum wage. MARTIN: And how do we know this? TANNER: Well, that's according to figures that are reported, you know, the Census Bureau figures and so on and - in terms of what they make. And they probably underreport since most tipped people try to avoid some of the taxes and underreport their tips. Or at least, I remember when I was a waiter making tips, that that's what a lot of people I knew did. Beyond that, however, you also to consider whether this is the most effective and efficient way of raising the value of work. The earned income tax credit, for example, is a much better targeted approach to dealing with low-income people, not second earners in many cases, from other families and so on, you know, or young people trying to get their first job and all of that. MARTIN: Mr. Eisenbrey, what about that? I mean, what about that? This is, on its face, not a terribly efficient way to go about this, that you're actually kind of privatizing a public concern. If your overall public concern is offering sort of a minimal standard of living, there are better ways to do that. And also the Democratic proposal is to double it, but that's still $4 an hour - just a little over $4 an hour. EISENBREY: It's to make the tip credit 70 percent of what will be a $10. 10 minimum wage, so it would be $7. . . MARTIN: $7. EISENBREY: . . . Which is more than three times higher. MARTIN: OK. EISENBREY: But I think it's important to remember that there are these eight states that require that employers pay the full minimum wage and not rely on tips. And is restaurant implement better or worse in those states? It's better. The National Restaurant Association itself has a 2014 growth forecast, and it projects a higher growth rate in the states that don't have any tip credit than in the ones that allow $2. 13 cents to be paid. So I think that just, you know, obliterates the argument that this is going to have some bad effect on restaurant employment. MARTIN: Michael Tanner? TANNER: Well, I think, first of all, you have to look at the overall economic conditions in those states. Those are, by and large, generally states that have lower unemployment levels to begin with. And there's other factors involved. You can't simply pull out the minimum wage and look at that. And in fact, if you look at minimum wage studies, generally across the board, survey - the literature suggests about 85 percent of those studies suggest that there's some loss of employment that goes on with minimum wage. If not, look - if the cost of labor has no impact on employment, let's have a $100 minimum wage - woah - and be done with it. The fact is - everyone can see - is that that would cost jobs. So if you're going to concede that, then you have to concede that there's going to be some marginal loss of employment if you increase or double or triple the minimum wage for restaurant workers. MARTIN: I just want to mention that Mr. Tanner just happened to hit his mic a little bit. I don't want people to think we're beating him here. It's not that kind of conversation. We're not having that kind of situation here. TANNER: No violence. MARTIN: No violence here in this conversation. So, Mr. Eisenbrey, you know, why - you know, in a number of European countries, people who have gone overseas, everybody pays, like, a service fee. I mean, and in some of the restaurants when you have a party of a certain size, everybody automatically gets 20 percent attached to the bill as part of the way to ensure that people don't get stiffed, as it were. EISENBREY: Well, they. . . MARTIN: And I'm just wondering. . . EISENBREY: Well, that's because. . . MARTIN: Or value-added tax or something like that. Has that kind of conversation ever been had in this country? And I'm just wondering, why not? EISENBREY: Well, in those countries, the employer does pay the full minimum wage. They don't rely on tips. And when you go to a restaurant in Europe, you're not expected to pay 20 percent or 15 percent. You know, if you give a little tip, it's something really extra. So the service - if there is a service fee, it goes to the restaurant. And then the restaurant pays the wage. MARTIN: And I was just wondering if there has ever been that kind of conversation about adopting that system here to sort of regularize it. And I'm just wonder - 'cause that doesn't seem to be part of our conversation. I just wondered why. EISENBREY: No, it's interesting. In California, in Montana, Washington state, Oregon, Minnesota, where they don't have the tip credit, people still do give tips. And so wages just are higher for the servers. MARTIN: Mr. Tanner? TANNER: Well, I think people aren't aware necessarily of the difference in the tip credit. I think they're not make their tip-based decisions on that. There has been some discussion about the whole idea of, should we do away with tipping and simply have a wage for waiters and so on. The idea of tipping of course is to ensure better quality service, and there's debate about whether or not it actually achieves that or not. MARTIN: I guess what I'm just wondering is this a cultural. . . TANNER: Sure. MARTIN: . . . Practice that's just kind of ingrained in our culture. . . TANNER: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Or is this an economic practice? TANNER: No, it's much more - I mean, Europe is beginning increasingly to move towards tips. In countries that didn't used to tip for anything, tipping is becoming more and more prevalent. I would also mention that minimum wage is not universal in Europe. Germany, for example, and some other countries don't have minimum wages. And it's interesting that in countries that had minimum wages, youth unemployment is much higher than in countries that don't. MARTIN: Can I get a - we only have about 30 seconds left. Mr. Eisenbrey, I just wanted to ask, can I persuade you to predict? This seems to be a popular - these are popular proposals right now. The polling indicates that most people in the public generally think it's a good idea. Do you hazard a guess about where this proposal is going? EISENBREY: Well, eventually, the minimum wage will be increased. It's only a question of how long it will be. It's being increased in states one after another, and I think that the federal government will get there if not this year, then next year. MARTIN: We will see. Ross Eisenbrey is vice president of the Economic Policy Institute. Michael Tanner is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. They were both kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. studios. Gentlemen, thank you both so much for joining us. TANNER: It was a lot of fun. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin.

In fact, even the bottom 10 percent of people in the tipped industry make more than the minimum wage. MARTIN: And how do we know this? TANNER: Well, that's according to figures that are reported, you know, the Census Bureau figures and so on and - in terms of what they make. And they probably underreport since most tipped people try to avoid some of the taxes and underreport their tips. Or at least, I remember when I was a waiter making tips, that that's what a lot of people I knew did. Beyond that, however, you also to consider whether this is the most effective and efficient way of raising the value of work. The earned income tax credit, for example, is a much better targeted approach to dealing with low-income people, not second earners in many cases, from other families and so on, you know, or young people trying to get their first job and all of that. MARTIN: Mr. Eisenbrey, what about that? I mean, what about that? This is, on its face, not a terribly efficient way to go about this, that you're actually kind of privatizing a public concern. If your overall public concern is offering sort of a minimal standard of living, there are better ways to do that. And also the Democratic proposal is to double it, but that's still $4 an hour - just a little over $4 an hour. EISENBREY: It's to make the tip credit 70 percent of what will be a $10. 10 minimum wage, so it would be $7. . . MARTIN: $7. EISENBREY: . . . Which is more than three times higher. MARTIN: OK. EISENBREY: But I think it's important to remember that there are these eight states that require that employers pay the full minimum wage and not rely on tips. And is restaurant implement better or worse in those states? It's better. The National Restaurant Association itself has a 2014 growth forecast, and it projects a higher growth rate in the states that don't have any tip credit than in the ones that allow $2. 13 cents to be paid. So I think that just, you know, obliterates the argument that this is going to have some bad effect on restaurant employment. MARTIN: Michael Tanner? TANNER: Well, I think, first of all, you have to look at the overall economic conditions in those states. Those are, by and large, generally states that have lower unemployment levels to begin with. And there's other factors involved. You can't simply pull out the minimum wage and look at that. And in fact, if you look at minimum wage studies, generally across the board, survey - the literature suggests about 85 percent of those studies suggest that there's some loss of employment that goes on with minimum wage. If not, look - if the cost of labor has no impact on employment, let's have a $100 minimum wage - woah - and be done with it. The fact is - everyone can see - is that that would cost jobs. So if you're going to concede that, then you have to concede that there's going to be some marginal loss of employment if you increase or double or triple the minimum wage for restaurant workers. MARTIN: I just want to mention that Mr. Tanner just happened to hit his mic a little bit. I don't want people to think we're beating him here. It's not that kind of conversation. We're not having that kind of situation here. TANNER: No violence. MARTIN: No violence here in this conversation. So, Mr. Eisenbrey, you know, why - you know, in a number of European countries, people who have gone overseas, everybody pays, like, a service fee. I mean, and in some of the restaurants when you have a party of a certain size, everybody automatically gets 20 percent attached to the bill as part of the way to ensure that people don't get stiffed, as it were. EISENBREY: Well, they. . . MARTIN: And I'm just wondering. . . EISENBREY: Well, that's because. . . MARTIN: Or value-added tax or something like that. Has that kind of conversation ever been had in this country? And I'm just wondering, why not? EISENBREY: Well, in those countries, the employer does pay the full minimum wage. They don't rely on tips. And when you go to a restaurant in Europe, you're not expected to pay 20 percent or 15 percent. You know, if you give a little tip, it's something really extra. So the service - if there is a service fee, it goes to the restaurant. And then the restaurant pays the wage. MARTIN: And I was just wondering if there has ever been that kind of conversation about adopting that system here to sort of regularize it. And I'm just wonder - 'cause that doesn't seem to be part of our conversation. I just wondered why. EISENBREY: No, it's interesting. In California, in Montana, Washington state, Oregon, Minnesota, where they don't have the tip credit, people still do give tips. And so wages just are higher for the servers. MARTIN: Mr. Tanner? TANNER: Well, I think people aren't aware necessarily of the difference in the tip credit. I think they're not make their tip-based decisions on that. There has been some discussion about the whole idea of, should we do away with tipping and simply have a wage for waiters and so on. The idea of tipping of course is to ensure better quality service, and there's debate about whether or not it actually achieves that or not. MARTIN: I guess what I'm just wondering is this a cultural. . . TANNER: Sure. MARTIN: . . . Practice that's just kind of ingrained in our culture. . . TANNER: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Or is this an economic practice? TANNER: No, it's much more - I mean, Europe is beginning increasingly to move towards tips. In countries that didn't used to tip for anything, tipping is becoming more and more prevalent. I would also mention that minimum wage is not universal in Europe. Germany, for example, and some other countries don't have minimum wages. And it's interesting that in countries that had minimum wages, youth unemployment is much higher than in countries that don't. MARTIN: Can I get a - we only have about 30 seconds left. Mr. Eisenbrey, I just wanted to ask, can I persuade you to predict? This seems to be a popular - these are popular proposals right now. The polling indicates that most people in the public generally think it's a good idea. Do you hazard a guess about where this proposal is going? EISENBREY: Well, eventually, the minimum wage will be increased. It's only a question of how long it will be. It's being increased in states one after another, and I think that the federal government will get there if not this year, then next year. MARTIN: We will see. Ross Eisenbrey is vice president of the Economic Policy Institute. Michael Tanner is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. They were both kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. studios.

It's part of an ongoing focus on how women's lives are changing in this century. One person who is keenly invested in moving women up the economic ladder is Christine Lagarde. She is head of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF. The IMF promotes the stability of the global economy through lending, forecasting and technical assistance. Lagarde has been using her position in the last two and a half years to challenge global leaders to focus specifically on women's economic empowerment as a way to bring about growth generally. She joined us from her office at the IMF in Washington, D. C. Good morning. CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now, under your leadership, the IMF commissioned a major study on women in the workforce. It finds that more inclusiveness would bring about greater economic growth. And the reverse of that, you might say, is that those countries that don't make use of their potential female workforce, that they're really missing out economically. LAGARDE: Um-hum. We found some really interesting numbers. If female were working in the same proportion as men do, the level of GDP would be up 27 percent in a country like India, but also up 9 percent in Japan and up 5 percent in the United States of America. It's not just a moral issue, not just a philosophical issue. It just makes economic sense. You know, I was going to say it's a no-brainer. MONTAGNE: It would seem so when it's laid out like that, but do you imagine that people think of it ever economically or is it mostly always thought of as just a good thing? LAGARDE: You know, if it was just a good thing to do, it wouldn't go very far. And I'll give you two examples, the example of Japan and the example of Korea. In both those countries the policymakers have decided to put women at the center of their budget, at the center of their policies going forward. For instance, Prime Minister Abe. He's identified a big-budget item that will go to build child care centers in Japan, which is obviously one of the ways to lower the burden on women and facilitate their access to the job market. MONTAGNE: Well, part of the issue here about bringing women to the workforce is not so much just bringing them to the workforce because, as your study notes, women are in lots of jobs that are low paid and have very little power. When you talk about management, one thing that's been noted since you were named the head of the IMF is that it itself has a stunningly low number of women in management, high management positions - only about 20 percent there. LAGARDE: Correct. MONTAGNE: What made it so hard for the IMF to get women in these higher positions? LAGARDE: One of the reasons has to do with the population from which management are drawn. Most of them are economists. All of them in those positions are generally Ph. Ds. And when you look for the population of female Ph. Ds. from which you can draw those management skills, there are not that many of them. So, when you start with a relatively small pool, it's probably a little bit harder and it requires much more of an effort. But we do have targets. And we are certainly going to continue to be focused on those. MONTAGNE: Well, you know, something that just struck me when you said that. In a way, we could be saying that there are just not enough women who have the qualifications for being in management. If a man said that, would he get in trouble? LAGARDE: If a man said that to me, I think he might get in trouble, yes. There are now more and more young, talented female economists. So, if any head of department tells me, no, I'm terribly sorry, I can't hire a woman because I can't find any talented or competent women, I would say rubbish. In the 2013 Economists Program, we hired 51 percent women, 49 percent men. And the reason for that is that we have a draft from all over the world and we've hired, for instance, in that group a good number of Chinese economists - highly qualified, all Ph. Ds. from the best universities of the world. And guess what? They're all women. MONTAGNE: Well, you yourself must have a great deal of experience with being the only woman in the room. And I gather that was even true when you were being interviewed to take over at the IMF. LAGARDE: Well, yeah, that is true because the IMF has an executive board, which includes 24 members. And of the 24 people in the room, there were 24 men because the only female executive director was actually away on the very technical work that we do. And I can't do anything about it except talk about it and complain about it when I talk about it because those people are actually appointed by the various countries around the world that comprise the membership of the IMF. MONTAGNE: You are so confident, that's quite clear. So, did you not run into discrimination. . . LAGARDE: Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course. Yeah. When I started my life as a baby lawyer, I was interviewing with all the best firms then at the time, and one of them was, you know, probably the most reputable in France, and told me you can join us tomorrow and be an associate, be given great tasks and great files and great clients to work on, but don't ever expect to make partnership. And I said, you know, why would that be? And they said because you're a woman. And I said really? Well, you won't have me as an associate. And I went to another firm which was great and which was based on respect and on equal opportunity for those who delivered. MONTAGNE: You were quoted once as saying that the financial mess would not have been such a mess if it had been Lehman Sisters instead of Lehman Brothers. What exactly did you mean? And does that apply - what you were saying apply, generally? LAGARDE: I would repeat that. And I do believe women have different ways of taking risks, of ruminating a bit more before they jump to conclusions. And I think that as a result, particularly on the, on, you know, on the trading floor, in the financial markets in general, the approach would be different. You know, I'm not suggesting that all key functions and roles should be held by women. But if you look at the studies - and there were quite a few that were done by the Financial Times, by the Economist, by various financial observers of the market - it's apparently very clear now that those companies that have several female directors on their board and female in their top management actually do better, are more profitable, and give a better return to their shareholders. MONTAGNE: Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Thank you so much for joining us. LAGARDE: Thank you.

I'm Robert Siegel in Washington. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block in Dallas. An international panel of scientists is predicting a long list of dire consequences of climate change over the next century - spreading disease, coastal floods, suffering crops. And they say it's too late to stop at least some warming. This is the consensus of hundreds of scientists. But one of them refused to put his name on the final summary. He felt it was too much doom and gloom, and he said it failed to account for human innovation. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports on the disagreement over the report's message. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a grim accounting of our future on a warmer planet. Heat-related diseases are likely to rise. Crops will be harder to grow. Disputes over dwindling resources, like fresh water, might even lead to war. To climate economist Richard Tol, the report sounds pretty depressing. RICHARD TOL: It's risk, risk, risk, risk, risk, risk, risk. And climate change is dangerous and we're all going to die and we're all going to starve. BRUMFIEL: Tol is at the University of Sussex in the U. K. and helped to write the new report. He co-authored a chapter on the economic impact. But he took his name off the final summary of the report because he felt it didn't accurately account for human ingenuity. Take, for example, crop yields. The report says climate change will cause them to fall by a few percent per decade. But, Tol says, technological innovation will likely raise crop yields by 10 percent or more. TOL: So it's not that crop yields are going to fall, but they're going to rise more slowly because of climate change. And then, of course, it doesn't sound as alarming. BRUMFIEL: Now to be clear, Tol still believes in climate change and he still thinks it's a really serious problem. In fact, that's why he's speaking out. He thinks this report will work people up. Just when there needs to be a consensus on how to keep the world from getting even warmer, this report will move believers and deniers further apart. TOL: I think there is a real risk of this draft further polarizing the climate debate rather than calming things down and moving us forward. CHRIS FIELD: Richard's a great guy. I love him. But he's not in the center of the scientific community. BRUMFIEL: That's Chris Field, who co-chaired the entire report. He says Tol is just one of over 300 lead authors. FIELD: I don't ask them to all agree. What I ask them is to work together in a way that tells the world community what the position of the scientific community on this issue is. BRUMFIEL: Field thinks the report appropriately cautions about some very real risks. But he does acknowledge that predicting exactly what will happen is difficult because people aren't like melting glaciers. They don't just sit there, they adapt. FIELD: People have a tendency of changing what they do when they realize they have a problem. That's the core essence of adaptation. BRUMFIEL: A big part of this new report is encouraging people to respond. It's clear that the temperature will rise by at least four degrees Fahrenheit this century. Field thinks improved transportation infrastructure, better disaster response and healthcare could all help lessen the impact. But he also thinks too much faith in technology is itself risky. FIELD: One of the things that can create vulnerability is actually hubris, thinking that you're protected or that you're too rich or you're too smart to need protection. BRUMFIEL: In the end, these two researchers are arguing about wording, not facts. Both agree that climate change is happening, that humans aren't helpless, that we can adapt, and that unless we make changes to avoid even more warming, things will get a lot worse.

Now, we don't mean wealthy women, we mean how women work toward financial security and how it brings up very different considerations for women than it does for men. As part of our series, NPR's Jennifer Ludden has been speaking with women to see how their attitudes and fears shape how they think about their finances over the long haul. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: There's a truism in the industry. Women need to get more out of their money than men. They live longer and make less, especially if they take time out to care for children or aging parents. But when it comes to investing, they lack confidence. That was clear one recent evening. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So who are we missing? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Maya. LUDDEN: A small room at the Women's Center in Vienna, Virginia, a handful of middle-aged women here for a workshop on Investing 101. TIA MARSILI: I wish that I had known more about our finances. I wish I would've been more involved. M FITZGERALD: I am not getting any younger and I am starting to go, yeah, so what's going to happen in 10 years or 20 years when I can't. . . . CHRISTIANE GEIDT: I really don't know where to start. And I mean, it's very confusing and it's pretty much complex. LUDDEN: That was Tia Marsili, M(ph) Fitzgerald and Christiane Geidt - divorcing, single, married. Geidt says she's actually accumulated a nice chunk, but common for women, it's sitting in her savings account. She's nervous about investing because of the risk of losing it, unlike her husband. GEIDT: I think with men, it's just like they enjoy it more. If things don't work out and you lose money here and there and he just easier takes it - it's their adrenaline, maybe, that kicks in more, I don't know. LUDDEN: Actually, it's testosterone, at least that's what research suggests makes men more open to such risk. There is something else women have that men don't. CINDY HOUNSELL: Study after study shows the same thing. LUDDEN: Cindy Hounsell heads the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement. HOUNSELL: Women are terrified of retirement. They're terrified of running out of money. They're terrified of becoming bag women, you know, and women just have always had that fear. LUDDEN: It's an age-old image that's still around. Take Cate Blanchett's Oscar-winning role in last year's hit \"Blue Jasmine. \"(SOUNDBITE FROM FILM \"BLUE JASMINE\")CATE BLANCHETT: (As Jasmine)  I never pay attention to Hal's business affairs. I have no head for that sort of thing. LUDDEN: This wealthy New York socialite has it all, loses it all, and ends up delusional on a park bench. (SOUNDBITE FROM FILM \"BLUE JASMINE\")BLANCHETT: (As Jasmine) \"Blue Moon,\" I used to know the words. LUDDEN: Cindy Hounsell points out most women don't have as much to lose; the median annual income of those working full time in 2012 was less than $38,000 - all the more reason, she says, for women to plan ahead and make their money grow.  But too often, she says, when women do seek out financial advice, they're turned off. HOUNSELL: We don't want wealth management gobbledygook that we can't understand. A lot of the studies show that women, they want somebody that they can talk to who will say how old is your mother and who is caring for her and all those things. LUDDEN: But financial planners, she says, haven't been trained like that. They've been steeped in industry jargon and they're overwhelmingly older white men. Still, Hounsell senses a shift. She says the big firms now have webinars, websites, entire studies devoted to women. HOUNSELL: I was on a panel where I almost like fell off my chair because someone was sitting there with a slide from a big consulting firm saying that people want simple straightforward information that helps them make changes in their life. And I feel like I've waited 25 years to hear that. WENDY WEAVER: Hi. LUDDEN: Hi. Nice to see you. At FBB Capital Partners in Bethesda, Maryland, Wendy Weaver gives that straight, simple talk. WEAVER: So Doris, congratulations. I think you did a really good job. . . LUDDEN: She manages money for plenty of successful professional women, like this client who's about to retire in comfort. Compared to a generation ago, women today are more likely to be single and more likely to make just as much, if not more, than their husbands. So are more stepping up to manage their money? WEAVER: In the GenX generation I definitely see a bigger mix of who is in charge, but the millennials seem to be trending back towards relinquishing control, whether that be my spouse will take care of it, or even I'm still at home so my dad takes care of it. LUDDEN: Weaver even sees breadwinner wives who still let their spouse handle the finances. She worries they're letting emotion get in the way. WEAVER: And you have to disengage that emotional piece that if I ask to be involved, my husband's going to think I don't trust him or I should be doing this but it's too scary so I won't. That emotion has to be removed and just look at money as a tool and a means to an end. LUDDEN: Weaver points out that back in the Greatest Generation, women handled the home finances. Sure, most back then didn't have to figure out 401(k)s or stocks and bonds. But here's the irony: When women today do invest, they get even better returns than men. WEAVER: Men feel like they always have to fix things and trade, whether it needs to be fixed or not. LUDDEN: One expert calls it the remote control factor. Women, Weaver says, like to think long term, do the research, ask questions. Of course people need money to invest, and this is a tough time. But Weaver is hopeful that for young women at least, the recent recession may have a silver lining. SARAH AMEIGH: Oh, yes, it definitely put fear in the heart. LUDDEN: In Maryland, 27-year-old Sarah Ameigh is grateful for her marketing job, but she's not taking anything for granted. AMEIGH: I graduated in 2009, right in the midst of everything. So there was a mood, I would say, amongst all my friends and I just kind of worried. Worried would be the best word to describe it. We all did OK in terms of getting jobs, but there's always that little voice in your head that says, ugh, you just don't know what's possible. LUDDEN: So Ameigh has already started a 401(k) after consulting with her parents, and she is calculating how much more she can save. A little worry, she says, might turn out to be a good thing. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News. GREENE: Okay, tomorrow in our series we're going to meet some Latina women who are growing their wealth through savings circles. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was funny because we were (unintelligible) people and the girl was like, all you're doing is like giving money to other people but not collecting interest on it. And there's a risk. But all of us didn't see it that way. GREENE: And as part of this series, we've been asking some influential women to share their money lessons. Here's U. S. Senator Amy Klobuchar. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: My grandma and grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to college. It was down in the basement. And they were able to send him to a community college and then he got a journalism degree at the University of Minnesota and went on to interview everyone from Ronald Reagan to Mike Ditka to Ginger Rogers. Growing up in hardscrabble mining town and it was all because they were willing to save money. GREENE: All began with a coffee can. That's great. A money lesson from Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota Democrat is chair of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. You can see lessons from other interesting women at our Tumblr. Just search for SheWorksTumblr. We hope you'll share a lesson that you've learned, good or bad, about managing money. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  In the days before April 15, tax day, MORNING EDITION will be reporting on women and wealth. Now, we don't mean wealthy women, we mean how women work toward financial security and how it brings up very different considerations for women than it does for men. As part of our series, NPR's Jennifer Ludden has been speaking with women to see how their attitudes and fears shape how they think about their finances over the long haul. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: There's a truism in the industry. Women need to get more out of their money than men. They live longer and make less, especially if they take time out to care for children or aging parents. But when it comes to investing, they lack confidence. That was clear one recent evening.

I'm Terry Gross. The stock market is rigged, according to my guest Michael Lewis. His new book, \"Flash Boys,\" explains why. It's about the form of computerized transactions known as high-frequency trading, in which the fastest computers with the most high-speed connections get the information first and make the trade before anyone else can. A couple of nanoseconds can make all the difference between how much money is made or lost on any transaction. You'd be surprised to hear what investment banks do to get that nanosecond edge and how they often use it in ways Lewis describes as predatory. The victims range from some investment houses to individual investors. In fact, some high-frequency traders may be preying on your retirement accounts. The FBI, Wall Street regulators and New York's attorney general are investigating high-frequency trading and whether it's created an uneven playing field. Michael Lewis is the author of several books about the stock market, including \"Liar's Poker\" and \"The Big Short. \" He also wrote the bestseller \"Moneyball,\" about how computer analytics is changing baseball. Michael Lewis, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So you say the image of the stock exchange, with traders hollering on the floor, that really hasn't existed in reality in several years. The markets, you say, trade inside black boxes in heavily guarded buildings in New Jersey and Chicago. What are those black boxes? What are those buildings? MICHAEL LEWIS: Well, the most sensational building is the New York Stock Exchange building in Mahwah, New Jersey, which it's a fort. To get to it, you go through, you know, guards and German shepherds, and it feels guarded. And inside the building is the matching engine, the place where buyers and sellers meet on the New York Stock Exchange, not on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. There are no human beings - it's just signals going into a box, computer signals. The building is enormous, and the question is sort of why is so big if the exchange is now just a box instead of thousands of people shouting at each other. And it's enormous to house the equipment of all the high-frequency traders who want to be near the exchange so they can get information from the exchange more quickly than you or me. GROSS: OK, when you say more quickly than you and me, it sounds like there's a messenger running from the exchange to the office of the broker, which is exactly not what's happening. How do you get the edge in terms of time, of getting it a nanosecond before the other people do? LEWIS: It's a couple of millisecond edge they're usually looking at, and the way you do it is just - is to minimize the physical distance between you and the actual exchange so that the cord that connects your box, that is making your trading decisions, you the high-frequency trader, that leads to the actual exchanges is just shorter than everybody else's cord. So you get closer. And high-frequency traders pay the exchanges vast sums of money to be close to the exchange so they can get the signals from the exchange before everybody else, so they can find out what prices are, where they've moved before everybody else. GROSS: And these signals are traveling on fiber-optic lines. LEWIS: Correct, so it's - you know, it's a matter of physics. I mean, there's - light traveling over distance still takes time. It's time that's kind of incomprehensible to the human mind, but to a trader in the stock market now, the difference between getting the information in three milliseconds as opposed to four milliseconds is the difference between knowing the prices before everybody else and not. GROSS: And why does that give you the edge? LEWIS: Well, if I get price changes before everybody else, if I know a stock price is going up or going down before you do, I can act on it. If you're coming in to buy, you know, the shares in Proctor & Gamble, and you think the price is 80, and you're saying I'm going to buy Proctor & Gamble for $80 a share, and I'm sitting there are a high-frequency trader, and I know that the price of Proctor & Gamble is actually lower, it's gone down, it's 79, I can buy it a 79 and sell it you at 80. So it's a bit like knowing the result of the horse race before it's run or getting advance word on where the ball is going to land in the roulette wheel. And it's hard to get your mind around because the amount of time, the time advantage of a high-frequency trader, is so small. It's literally a millisecond or two. It takes 100 milliseconds to blink your eye, so it's a fraction of a blink of an eye. But that for a computer is plenty of time. GROSS: Right, because we're talking about computer time, not human time here. LEWIS: I think that was one of the big things about this story that made it so mind-bending and, you know, in some ways difficult to tell, is that to understand the stock market, in fact all the financial markets these days, you have to stop thinking, kind of seeing the world through the eyes of a human being and try to see it through the eyes of a computer and see - and think about how a computer thinks about time. I mean for a computer, a millisecond is a lot of time. For a human being it's imperceptible. A computer can make hundreds of trades in a millisecond. A human being can't do anything. So yes, it's the markets are now in a funny way perceived through the minds of computers. GROSS: A lot of people in our audience are probably thinking I don't really understand high-frequency trading on Wall Street, there's a lot about the stock market I don't understand. Will I be able to follow this story even though it's real important? And so I just want to say that you have created this narrative that is really interesting with different characters who are insiders on Wall Street, and there's points at which they have no idea what's happening. But that's how kind of covert a lot of this stuff is and how complicated. So let's try to sort through it because the bottom line is, you know, the system's kind of rigged. LEWIS: The stock market is rigged. It's rigged for the benefit of really a handful of insiders. It's rigged to sort of maximize the take of Wall Street, of banks, the exchanges and the high-frequency traders at the expense of ordinary investors. And what struck me, I mean what I found so fascinating about this story, if all I knew was that the stock market was rigged, I wouldn't have written a book about it. Maybe I'd have written an essay about it. GROSS: Why? You would've thought, like, so? (LAUGHTER)LEWIS: I'd have thought, well, so Wall Street's done something bad again. The stock market's rigged. It is amazing that the stock market's rigged, but what I found even more amazing was that there was this collection of characters on Wall Street who have to kind of figure out that it's rigged and how it's rigged and prove it's rigged and then go explain it to investors, big investors, sophisticated investors, none of whom understand how it's rigged, just know that something's funny. And it was really that story, a story of discovery by people who, you know, kind of thought they knew how the stock market operated but found out that in fact they knew - really didn't know at all. And so they have to learn from the ground up in a way that, you know, a common reader might have to learn from the ground up, the way my mother would have to learn from the ground up. So my mother can follow them on the journey. That's sort of what engaged me with the story. GROSS: So the central figure in your book is Brad Katsuyama, who was working with the Royal Bank of Canada when he became the head of electronic trading. And once he gets into electronic trading, things start happening that he just doesn't understand. LEWIS: So let me - can I back you up? GROSS: Yes, please. LEWIS: All right. So Brad Katsuyama is the head of just stock trading at the World Bank of Canada in New York. He has 25 traders working for him. He deals in hundreds of millions of dollars of shares every day, he takes risk in the market, and it's in early 2008 he senses something's wrong. And what he senses is, when he looks at his trading screens, which has the prices of stocks in the market, and the stock market's no longer in one place, they have 13 different public exchange that trade, say, the stock of Microsoft or the stock of Apple Computer - so he's got, you know - he's got - his screens will tell him, say, that there are 10,000 shares of Microsoft offered at $30 a share if he wanted to buy them. And normally, up to this point in his life, if he hit his button on it and said buy, he'd get the 10,000 shares for $30 a share. But all of a sudden when he hits the button on his computer terminal, the shares disappear. It's like someone knows he's trying to buy Microsoft, and the price of Microsoft goes up before he can get it. And he doesn't understand why this is happening, and that's the beginning of the story. It's sort of like all of a sudden the market he sees on his screens, which is the market every, you know, professional trader and even someone who's sitting at a Schwab terminal or an E-Trade terminal would see on their screens, becomes this kind of illusion. GROSS: So why are the shares that he's trying to buy disappearing as soon as he hits buy? LEWIS: You ask that question so facilely. It takes him 18 months to get to the bottom of it. (LAUGHTER)LEWIS: Eighteen months with some of the most sophisticated minds on Wall Street working with him to answer that simple question: Why are the shares disappearing? Why does someone seem to know what I want to do before I do it? And it may only cost me a few pennies a share each time this happens, but over - spread over the billions of shares that are traded every day on the stock market, it adds up. So he goes looking. And he started to sort of like test the market with funny kinds of experiments. The short answer is what turns out is happening is he's sitting physically in Lower Manhattan when he makes his trades. When he pushes the buy button, the signal from his computer travels up the fiber-optics along the West Side Highway of Manhattan and through the Lincoln Tunnel. On the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel is one of the 13 stock exchanges, called the BATS Exchange, founded by high-frequency traders. They're sitting there, and they get the signal that he wants to buy first. They're sitting there offering a few shares of Microsoft so that they can see what he wants to do. They discern his desire to buy Microsoft, and they have faster connections to the 12 other exchanges that are scattered across New Jersey, and they race him to the other exchanges, buy all the Microsoft in front of him and sell it back to him at a higher price. So what was happening is he was physically being raced by high-frequency traders who had faster and more direct fiber-optic lines from the first exchange to all the other exchanges. But it takes him literally 18 months to figure this out, and he has to assemble people who, you know, have been essentially in manholes in New Jersey laying fiber-optic cable to figure out how all this works. GROSS: So say the bank and investment company that he was with represented my retirement fund. What would that mean for me? LEWIS: It would mean for you that every time your retirement fund trades in the market, some high-frequency trader is skimming pennies from each trade, and it adds up to who knows, 10, 20 - no one quite knows, many billions of dollars a year. It's essentially a tax on your investment dollars. So you're essentially being legally robbed from by the system. And - but that's just really the beginning of the problem. I mean, the beginning of the problem is you're paying this unnecessary tax to Wall Street to make trades in the marketplace. The bigger problem is that the system in order to accommodate high-frequency trading has become ever more complicated. In fact, it's almost designed so you can't understand it, so you don't ask questions about it. But the complexity brings with it instability, in that making these systems that run the stock exchanges ever more complicated and ever faster for the benefit of high-frequency traders creates a kind of volatility to them. So you have flash crashes. You have outages of stock exchanges. You have stocks doing very strange things. So the bigger problem in addition to the skimming that's going on of your savings, is that there's a decline of trust in the marketplace because it's not as trustworthy, and if it's not as trustworthy, then the whole economy suffers. I mean trust is the whole - is sort of the grease that keeps the system working. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Lewis, and we're talking about his new book \"Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. \" And it's about how Wall Street has changed because of high-frequency trading. Let's take a break, and then we'll talk some more about this new kind of drama on Wall Street. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Lewis, who's best known for books like \"Moneyball,\" \"The Big Short,\" \"Liar's Poker. \" His new book, \"Flash Boys,\" is about high-frequency trading on Wall Street, where like a nanosecond makes a really big difference in whether you're making money or losing money. And it's a complicated story, but he's an incredible storyteller. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: So how are the stock market exchanges benefiting from high-frequency traders? Like what's the relationship that they have that works for them but shuts out a lot of investors? LEWIS: So places like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ and a lot of lesser known exchanges - there are 13 of these public exchanges now - all make vast sums of money by selling access to their buildings, to their physical premises, to high-frequency traders so that the high-frequency traders can be closer to the black box that is the exchange so that the high-frequency traders can get information about price changes faster than everybody else, so they know the market before everybody else. That's one way they, the exchanges, make money from high-frequency traders. Then what they do is once they've got all the high-frequency traders in the building, unlike - you and I aren't in the building, you and aren't represented in the building. The high-frequency traders have their computer terminals next to their servers, right next to the exchange computer, and they then compete amongst themselves to be closer and closer, faster and faster in relation to each other. And this is sort of like, I don't know, it's sort of like a bunch of predators competing to be fastest to get to the prey. You and I are the prey, they are the predators. So the exchange sells small increments of speed to the predators. They'll upgrade their technology so all of a sudden everybody can be two microseconds faster, but they have to pay for that. That's the business model for these exchanges now. It's to find ways to enable the high-frequency traders to get ever faster and sell them the technology to do so, so that they can be the first to get to us. GROSS: So it's almost like a pay-to-play system. LEWIS: It's totally a pay-to-play system. That is what it is, and it's pay a lot to play. I mean, to set up a high-frequency trading sort of system in all the exchanges, you're talking about millions of dollars a year. It's not something that everybody can do. But it is something that a big Wall Street bank can do. A big Wall Street bank might be in the high-frequency trading game. But it's absolutely. And it is - what it does is it neatly divides the market into predator and prey. It creates this relationship between people who are there to actually invest in companies and these artificial middlemen who have been unnecessarily inserted in between buyers and sellers of stock. GROSS: So let's get back to Brad Katsuyama, and he's again the central figure of your book, who is at the Royal Bank of Canada when he figures out that something's going on that he doesn't comprehend. He assembles a team of experts from all over who have dealt with high-frequency trading and together they figure out what's going on. And then they to circumvent it. And they create something called Thor. What is Thor? LEWIS: So Thor is a stock market order router. It sends the orders out in the market, to the 13 different exchanges from Brad's computer terminal. So the problem he was having was that when he hit his button and sent his buy order or his sell order into the market, it arrived at different exchanges at different times because the exchanges were physically located at different distances from his desk, and it takes time for a signal to travel through fiber-optics. So it would get to an exchange on the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel first, and then it would get to the other exchanges later. With Thor, what they did is they organize the 13 different signals that went to the 13 different exchanges so they all arrived at exactly the same time. So they weren't vulnerable to a high-frequency trader seeing it arrive to buy at one exchange and racing them to all the other exchanges. And the minute they were able to perfect this, and it was not a simple matter, designing it so that it arrived at the same time at all these exchanges, and it was not even intuitively obvious to them it was a solution to the problem. They were guessing. They'd been experimenting in the markets, and this was just one of their experiments. But when they hit the button, and all their buy orders arrived at exactly the same, you know, microsecond at all 13 exchanges, the market became the market again. No longer were - was the high-frequency trader able to identify what they were doing at the first exchange they arrived at and exploit them on all the other exchanges. So this was a revelation. This was - in a way it's the beginning of their story because it's the first time they see, oh my God, now we know how we're being exploited. We've being exploited because the first exchange we arrive at there are our predators waiting who identify what we're doing and then prey on us at all the other exchanges. And they take this, the - I think this is like - there's several moments where there are these moral choices that my main character, that Brad, has to make. And the minute he realizes this, he realizes - he sees what the game is being played, he has a choice. He can play the game with everybody else, and he could probably make a lot of money as a high-frequency trader. But instead he decides to go on an educational campaign and go talk to investors about what he's just discovered. GROSS: And of course a lot of them don't understand what's going on yet either. LEWIS: But you know, this is a big, big point. So there is this perception that Wall Street insiders understand how Wall Street works. And it's false. And it's especially false right now, that here you have this young man, this kid at the Royal Bank of Canada who's engaged in this kind of science experiment in the market. He figures out at least one angle the predators are taking, and he goes and talks to not just ordinary investors, he's talking to Bill Ackman, David Einhorn, Dan Loeb, Fidelity, Vanguard, Capital Group, the biggest investors, the smartest investors in the world, and their jaws are on the floor. Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager who often, you know, takes big stakes in companies, he's told me, he said, you know, until Brad Katsuyama walked into my office, I thought I had an insider trading problem. I thought people were figuring out what companies I wanted to buy and jumping in front of me in the market before I bought them. And it was a different kind of insider trading problem than I thought I had, basically, is what he said. So these - even these people have no idea what's going on in the market and are being educated by this Canadian who's basically just arrived on the scene and has decided to make understanding his business. GROSS: Michael Lewis will be back in the second half of the show. His new book about high-frequency trading is called \"Flash Boys. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Michael Lewis. His new book \"Flash Boys\" is about how the stock market has become a rigged game as a result of the computerized transactions known as high-frequency trading, in which the fastest computers but the most high-speed connections compete against each other to get information first and make a trade before anyone else can. A fraction of a second can make all the difference in how much money is made or lost in one of these transactions. Lewis says some high-speed traders are predatory, and their prey may include your retirement account. So when we left off, you're talking about how Brad Katsuyama, who is the central figure in your book, had figured out how high-frequency trading was kind of becoming predatory and explaining his trade, so that he ended up having to buy at higher prices than he thought he was buying. And he brings a team of people together around the country who really understand insider-trading and they tried to figure out a way of circumventing it. They come up with a program that levels the playing field. And then they figure out what they really need to do is create their own stock exchange. Why would they need to do that? LEWIS: Well, because what they realized is the American stock exchange has completely fallen down and responsibility to create a fair environment for investors. That they were prejudicing the market in favor of high-frequency traders because the high-frequency traders pay them to do it. And that was in fact, kind of the business model of the new - and the American Stock Exchange, was to create opportunities for strength fast traders to exploit you and me and every other investor. And so long as the exchanges were bent on doing this, no matter how cleverly they routed their stock market orders into the market that they figured the predator would find a way to get them. And so the solution to the problem they thought was well, let's create an actual fair stock exchange. Let's take on the responsibility of essentially, restoring trust to the stock market of creating an environment where every dollar stands the same chance. I mean who would've thought this would be such a radical act, but it is. And so they design in exchange on which high-frequency traders can operate but they don't have any speed advantage anymore. They make everybody essentially the same speed on this exchange, so you're no longer at risk of being preyed upon. The problem once they create this exchange is that they have to persuade brokers and banks to send stock market orders onto it. That's the war that they create when they do this. I mean the banks and brokers are also paid a cut of what the high-frequency traders are taking out of investor's, so they don't want to send their orders onto this fair exchange because there's not lots of money to be made on this fair exchange for them. So how does Katsuyama go about trying to persuade them that they do want to trade on this exchange? He's created this war. And the war he's created is between people who have savings investments to make, to manage - money managers, individual investors, hedge funds managers, so on and so forth. And on the other hand, the people who have been mishandling those funds, big Wall Street banks and brokerage houses. And when he does is he tours the world and educates investors about what's happening with their stock market orders. And he tries to persuade the biggest investors to start to pressure the banks to behave more honestly with them. And that is what has happened. I mean if you call up Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan were any of the big banks today, they'll tell you they're being hounded by some of the world's biggest investors to route their stock market orders onto Brad Katsuyama's exchange because it's the only exchange they trust. GROSS: So a fundamental question I have about these exchanges is why are there so many of them? Why isn't there just one or maybe two exchanges? LEWIS: Well, it's a really good question. And it's a really good question because not all trading is computerized. And we could all meet in a single black box without a lot of human beings in between us; that's probably what should happen, that all buyers and sellers should just agree to meet in a single place. It would simplify the market, make it more transparent, so on and so forth. The answer that a Wall Street person would give you is that exchanges are businesses, that they benefit from having to compete with each other, that they provide services. And if there are more than one, they're kind of forced to be on their game all the time. The problem is that their customers, the people they're trying to please, are not doing me. They're not investors. They are banks and brokers that send them stock market orders and high-frequency traders who buy special access inside them. So they're competing with each other basically to please the predator at the expense of the prey. GROSS: Because that's where the profits are for them? LEWIS: Because that's where the profits are. And the reason it doesn't consolidate, the market doesn't consolidate is the more fragmented it is the easier it is for high-frequency traders to explain investors. They can erase them from one exchange or another. The physical distance between exchanges creates opportunity for high-frequency traders. GROSS: So this new exchange that was started by the central figure in your book, Brad Katsuyama, how has it performed so far? LEWIS: It was initially named the Investors Exchange, and then they went to go get a Web address and they realized that it was www. investors. sex change. com. (LAUGHTER)LEWIS: So they had to - so really, they bothered them - right from the beginning - they had to introduce another acronym to Wall Street, IEX, and it bothered them to no end. But IEX was opened for business in late October of 2013 and has done extremely well, as new exchanges go. Normally, new exchanges take a while to gain traction. They're already profitable. I mean they're trading, I don't know, 30, 40 million shares a day - which is still, it's small, but it's sustainable. The volume of stock market trading their doing though, is really a very poor indication of their effect on the universe because their effect has been profound. The New York Stock Exchange for the last three months has been trying to buy them. And I think there's a chance the New York Stock Exchange will buy them and try to make them the New York Stock Exchange. What they are is, they're radically disrupting the environment because investors are increasingly learning that it's the one fair exchange, the one place where they won't be exploited. And the pressure that investors put some banks and brokers to send their stock market orders to this exchange is increasing. At some point, it's a bit like, I don't know, it's a bit like a river changing its course. I think you can kind of think of Brad Katsuyama and IEX a sort of stretching on the side of a river that they want to jump its bank at that particular day bank. That at some point the whole market could job onto this exchange, that there is a kind of network effects that the bigger they get the bigger they get. And it's all been good. I mean they've gotten, they've doubled in size every month since they started and I suspect that they're going to continue to do so for a while. GROSS: So this high-frequency trading that has created the unequal playing field that you write about, this all happened after the financial collapse of 2007, right? LEWIS: Yes. And that is an incredible footnote to the story, the idea that essentially, the stock market got raised since the financial crisis. You would've thought that here you got the world's most watch, most supposedly democratized, politicized financial market at a time when everybody is skeptical about Wall Street, you would've thought that that would be the least likely time for the sort of shenanigans to happen. But, in fact, no. In fact, there's been a dramatic rise in predatory activity since the financial crisis in the stock market. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Lewis and he's the author of many books about Wall Street, including \"Liar's Poker\" and \"The Big Short. \" His book \"Money Ball\" was about how algorithms are being used in baseball now. His new book is called \"Flash Boys\" and it's all about high-frequency trading on Wall Street and how it's created an incredibly uneven playing field - or as he puts it - the system is rigged. So let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH Air. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis. He's written extensively about Wall Street and about the use of computer algorithms to do crazy things. So he's the author of \"Money Ball,\" \"Liar's Poker,\" \"The Big Short. \" His new book is called \"Flash Boys\" and it's about how high-frequency trading has transformed Wall Street in ways that most people - even a lot of traders - don't know about them don't understand. so high-frequency trading is dependent on fiber optic lines that can carry information incredibly quickly, that can transmit information incredibly quickly. And earlier in your book, you describe the one of these lines was built in 2010, kind of secretly to connect a Chicago data center with a stock exchange located in Northern Jersey. Was that the New York Stock Exchange? LEWIS: Well, it was the NASDAQ stock exchange where the line ended, but then it fanned out to all the other stock exchanges. GROSS: Got it. LEWIS: The business was called Spread Networks. It was a breathtaking story. There was a former trader on Chicago futures exchanges who saw how much money high-frequency traders were making. And he realized that they needed the fastest possible line between Chicago and New Jersey. And the reason they needed was that in the stock market, stock futures trading in Chicago and the actual stocks trade in New Jersey. And price movements in the market, in the overall market goes up or down tend to register first in Chicago in the futures market. So if you want to know if you're making markets and all the stocks in New Jersey and you want to know what the overall market is going to so you can get out, you know, if the market is going to fall you don't want to be buying, you need to know that first or else you're in trouble. Or else other people who know it first are going to sell stock to you when the market's falling. So this, his name is Dan Spivey, this trader. He essentially dug a tunnel between Chicago and New Jersey as straight as possible. He laid a string across a map and said how straight can I make this line? Because the straight year it is, the shorter it is, the faster it is. And he was trying to be the fastest line that was out there, which was owned by Verizon Wireless and they didn't know it was the fastest line. They didn't even know what they had. But Verizon Wireless could get a signal from Chicago to New Jersey like 17 milliseconds. And he spends - Spivey spends - $300 million, $400 million digging this tunnel incomplete secrecy - no one has any idea why he's doing it or what he's doing - and laying this line that enables him to get a signal back and forth in about 12 and one half milliseconds. And then is able to go out and demand from high-frequency traders $10 million a pop just to be on the line because they can't afford not to be on the low. GROSS: And this amazes me that one firm, one investment company that he was dealing with, they wanted it to double the price so that competitors couldn't afford to the underlying. LEWIS: Yes. Well, so this is, I mean it's a great business school case study. So you have come he sort of is like creating scarcity. He digs this line that the high-frequency traders already have the fastest line between Chicago and New Jersey. It's irritating to them that someone has gone and done the faster one because now they have to have it and they have to pay for it. They were getting the fastest line previously or not very much money. He walks into their offices and their series with him, basically. How dare you do this? How dare you demand we paid $10 million just to get on your line? But then they realize they can't not be on it. And it is one of the great moments, he thought, was when one of the high-frequency trading firms, after being angry with him said, you know, let us cool down and let us think about this for a minute. And then they come back in the room and they say, can you double the price? Because the more expensive it is they figured that you were people would be on it anymore and the more of an advantage they would have over the rest of the stock market. GROSS: You know, it was algorithms and things invisible to the public into most traders that created the financial collapse of 2007 - or at least partly created it. Our experts expecting that they're going to be more flash crashes in the near future because of how complicated and also convert so much of high-frequency trading is now? LEWIS: The answer to that is yes. You look around, there's a flash crash - there are flash crashes in stocks every day, individual stocks. There are outages at the exchanges. There's technical glitch after technical glitch. This is all symptomatic of a system that's out of control, too complicated, nobody completely understands. It's unstable. And Goldman Sachs in just the last few weeks has essentially thrown its support behind Brad Katsuyama's exchange because they think that what is needed is simplicity and transparency. And they're starting to route all their customer's orders onto that exchange for that reason. And the head of Goldman Sachs' stock market division said to me, he said if we don't change the system there's going to be a flash crash times 10. There's going to be some extremely unpleasant crisis in the stock market. So I think it's becoming conventional wisdom that the system itself is a problem. And that's a problem for all of us because of the system is unstable, if the house is built on sand, it does not engender trust. And there's no trust in the market, it costs companies more to raise money in the market. And it could cost companies more to raise money in the market, they don't supply as many jobs to the economy, they don't innovate in the way they might innovate, they don't invest in the way they might invest. And it's a problem. It gets to the very root of the American economy. GROSS: Part of the reason why you're so good at reporting on Wall Street as that used to work there, so you are an insider for a while. And this was in the mid-1980s when you worked. . . LEWIS: A long time ago. Yeah. GROSS: Yes. And it's changed a lot since then. But still, you grasp it. So this was in the mid-80s. You market Salomon Brothers. You were the. . . . . . '80s when you were. . . LEWIS: A long time ago. Yeah. GROSS: Yes. And it's changed a lot since then but still, you grasp it. So this was in the mid-'80s. You worked at Salomon Brothers. You were there during the crash of October '87. You say Wall Street firms have grown more concerned than they were in the late '80s with what journalists might say about them. Why do you think that is? And how did that affect your reporting of this high frequency trading story? LEWIS: It's interesting because if you think back what I did with \"Liar's Poker,\" I walked out of a job at Salomon Brothers, told my bosses I was going to write a book about Wall Street and they kind of smiled and said go do it if you want to, you're crazy because you could make a lot more money here. But you know, do your best kind of thing. If you tried to do that now, well, for a start, the version of me on Wall Street would've signed all kinds of non-disclosure agreements when he came into the firm. And you would've been hounded by lawyers on your way out the door. The firms have become so concerned about their public faces and so reluctant to share what's going on inside of them. Now, why has that happened? I think it's because Wall Street, to some extent, depends for its profits on people not understanding what's going on in Wall Street. The firms generate complicated situations, complicated securities, precisely so that other people don't understand them, creating an advantage for the Wall Street firms. I think that technology has naturally rendered a lot of what Wall Street's formerly useful function was moot, that you don't need a human being in between buyers and sellers of stock anymore. It could all be done electronically without Wall Street in between the buyers and the sellers. So Wall Street has been put in a position of having to scramble to find sources of revenues that are just less justified, that are more kind of manufactured. Subprime mortgage CDOs are one example. The incredibly complicated things they did in the subprime mortgage market were not actually economically useful. They were damaging but they generate a lot of profits for Wall Street. This breathtakingly complicated stock market that's been constructed is not actually socially or economically useful but it generates a lot of money for Wall Street. So when you are running one of these firms and you sense that a lot of what you do is not socially or economically useful, it's just enabling a kind of skim, the last thing you want is transparency or people from the inside talking about what's going on in the inside. You want to hide what you're doing. I mean I think they're naturally kind of more frightened of having the public genuinely understand what their businesses are. And it's not that all of the business on Wall Street is bad or not useful, but it's just an increasing chunk of Wall Street is essentially predatory. So I think that's what's going on. And I think that the sort of technology has caused a crisis in the financial services industry and the financial services industry has responded by, you know, trying to defend its profitability and it's been very good at doing it. But it requires this kind of opacity. GROSS: So one final question for you. The central characters in your book are people who walked away from their jobs at various banks and brokerage houses to create this new exchange that they thought would be an even playing field without giving high frequency traders the edge. So what was in it for them? Because they gave up a lot of money at the jobs that they were for an uncertain future. LEWIS: This is what intrigued me about these characters, that they are all people who are making, in some cases, several million dollars a year in very safe jobs and they were successful, beloved by their firms, etc. , etc. And there are two things about them that are striking. One is it's amazing how many of them are immigrants, how few of them are actually Americans. They're Canadian, they're Irish, they're Chinese, they're Russian. And I don't know what that means, but they came to this country and they had some view about the way the system worked. They were disturbed by what they found and they wanted to make the system work the way they imagined it. The other thing is they are all, in one way or another, people who are living their lives as they want to look back on them, rather than like thinking about the next quarter's bonus. And they were kicked into that state of mind by various events in their lives. There's a peculiar moral quality about all of them that I found just really interesting. GROSS: Michael Lewis, it's been great to have you back on the show. LEWIS: Thank you. GROSS: Thank you for explaining stuff that's really complicated and doing such a good job with it. Michael Lewis's new book is called \"Flash Boys. \" High frequency trading is currently being investigated by the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and New York's attorney general. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The stock market is rigged, according to my guest Michael Lewis. His new book, \"Flash Boys,\" explains why. It's about the form of computerized transactions known as high-frequency trading, in which the fastest computers with the most high-speed connections get the information first and make the trade before anyone else can. A couple of nanoseconds can make all the difference between how much money is made or lost on any transaction. You'd be surprised to hear what investment banks do to get that nanosecond edge and how they often use it in ways Lewis describes as predatory. The victims range from some investment houses to individual investors. In fact, some high-frequency traders may be preying on your retirement accounts. The FBI, Wall Street regulators and New York's attorney general are investigating high-frequency trading and whether it's created an uneven playing field. Michael Lewis is the author of several books about the stock market, including \"Liar's Poker\" and \"The Big Short. \" He also wrote the bestseller \"Moneyball,\" about how computer analytics is changing baseball. Michael Lewis, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So you say the image of the stock exchange, with traders hollering on the floor, that really hasn't existed in reality in several years. The markets, you say, trade inside black boxes in heavily guarded buildings in New Jersey and Chicago. What are those black boxes? What are those buildings? MICHAEL LEWIS: Well, the most sensational building is the New York Stock Exchange building in Mahwah, New Jersey, which it's a fort. To get to it, you go through, you know, guards and German shepherds, and it feels guarded. And inside the building is the matching engine, the place where buyers and sellers meet on the New York Stock Exchange, not on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. There are no human beings - it's just signals going into a box, computer signals. The building is enormous, and the question is sort of why is so big if the exchange is now just a box instead of thousands of people shouting at each other. And it's enormous to house the equipment of all the high-frequency traders who want to be near the exchange so they can get information from the exchange more quickly than you or me. GROSS: OK, when you say more quickly than you and me, it sounds like there's a messenger running from the exchange to the office of the broker, which is exactly not what's happening. How do you get the edge in terms of time, of getting it a nanosecond before the other people do? LEWIS: It's a couple of millisecond edge they're usually looking at, and the way you do it is just - is to minimize the physical distance between you and the actual exchange so that the cord that connects your box, that is making your trading decisions, you the high-frequency trader, that leads to the actual exchanges is just shorter than everybody else's cord. So you get closer. And high-frequency traders pay the exchanges vast sums of money to be close to the exchange so they can get the signals from the exchange before everybody else, so they can find out what prices are, where they've moved before everybody else. GROSS: And these signals are traveling on fiber-optic lines. LEWIS: Correct, so it's - you know, it's a matter of physics. I mean, there's - light traveling over distance still takes time. It's time that's kind of incomprehensible to the human mind, but to a trader in the stock market now, the difference between getting the information in three milliseconds as opposed to four milliseconds is the difference between knowing the prices before everybody else and not. GROSS: And why does that give you the edge? LEWIS: Well, if I get price changes before everybody else, if I know a stock price is going up or going down before you do, I can act on it. If you're coming in to buy, you know, the shares in Proctor & Gamble, and you think the price is 80, and you're saying I'm going to buy Proctor & Gamble for $80 a share, and I'm sitting there are a high-frequency trader, and I know that the price of Proctor & Gamble is actually lower, it's gone down, it's 79, I can buy it a 79 and sell it you at 80. So it's a bit like knowing the result of the horse race before it's run or getting advance word on where the ball is going to land in the roulette wheel. And it's hard to get your mind around because the amount of time, the time advantage of a high-frequency trader, is so small. It's literally a millisecond or two. It takes 100 milliseconds to blink your eye, so it's a fraction of a blink of an eye. But that for a computer is plenty of time. GROSS: Right, because we're talking about computer time, not human time here. LEWIS: I think that was one of the big things about this story that made it so mind-bending and, you know, in some ways difficult to tell, is that to understand the stock market, in fact all the financial markets these days, you have to stop thinking, kind of seeing the world through the eyes of a human being and try to see it through the eyes of a computer and see - and think about how a computer thinks about time. I mean for a computer, a millisecond is a lot of time. For a human being it's imperceptible. A computer can make hundreds of trades in a millisecond. A human being can't do anything. So yes, it's the markets are now in a funny way perceived through the minds of computers. GROSS: A lot of people in our audience are probably thinking I don't really understand high-frequency trading on Wall Street, there's a lot about the stock market I don't understand. Will I be able to follow this story even though it's real important? And so I just want to say that you have created this narrative that is really interesting with different characters who are insiders on Wall Street, and there's points at which they have no idea what's happening. But that's how kind of covert a lot of this stuff is and how complicated. So let's try to sort through it because the bottom line is, you know, the system's kind of rigged. LEWIS: The stock market is rigged. It's rigged for the benefit of really a handful of insiders. It's rigged to sort of maximize the take of Wall Street, of banks, the exchanges and the high-frequency traders at the expense of ordinary investors. And what struck me, I mean what I found so fascinating about this story, if all I knew was that the stock market was rigged, I wouldn't have written a book about it. Maybe I'd have written an essay about it. GROSS: Why? You would've thought, like, so? (LAUGHTER) LEWIS: I'd have thought, well, so Wall Street's done something bad again. The stock market's rigged. It is amazing that the stock market's rigged, but what I found even more amazing was that there was this collection of characters on Wall Street who have to kind of figure out that it's rigged and how it's rigged and prove it's rigged and then go explain it to investors, big investors, sophisticated investors, none of whom understand how it's rigged, just know that something's funny. And it was really that story, a story of discovery by people who, you know, kind of thought they knew how the stock market operated but found out that in fact they knew - really didn't know at all. And so they have to learn from the ground up in a way that, you know, a common reader might have to learn from the ground up, the way my mother would have to learn from the ground up. So my mother can follow them on the journey. That's sort of what engaged me with the story. GROSS: So the central figure in your book is Brad Katsuyama, who was working with the Royal Bank of Canada when he became the head of electronic trading. And once he gets into electronic trading, things start happening that he just doesn't understand. LEWIS: So let me - can I back you up? GROSS: Yes, please. LEWIS: All right. So Brad Katsuyama is the head of just stock trading at the World Bank of Canada in New York. He has 25 traders working for him. He deals in hundreds of millions of dollars of shares every day, he takes risk in the market, and it's in early 2008 he senses something's wrong. And what he senses is, when he looks at his trading screens, which has the prices of stocks in the market, and the stock market's no longer in one place, they have 13 different public exchange that trade, say, the stock of Microsoft or the stock of Apple Computer - so he's got, you know - he's got - his screens will tell him, say, that there are 10,000 shares of Microsoft offered at $30 a share if he wanted to buy them. And normally, up to this point in his life, if he hit his button on it and said buy, he'd get the 10,000 shares for $30 a share. But all of a sudden when he hits the button on his computer terminal, the shares disappear. It's like someone knows he's trying to buy Microsoft, and the price of Microsoft goes up before he can get it. And he doesn't understand why this is happening, and that's the beginning of the story. It's sort of like all of a sudden the market he sees on his screens, which is the market every, you know, professional trader and even someone who's sitting at a Schwab terminal or an E-Trade terminal would see on their screens, becomes this kind of illusion. GROSS: So why are the shares that he's trying to buy disappearing as soon as he hits buy? LEWIS: You ask that question so facilely. It takes him 18 months to get to the bottom of it. (LAUGHTER) LEWIS: Eighteen months with some of the most sophisticated minds on Wall Street working with him to answer that simple question: Why are the shares disappearing? Why does someone seem to know what I want to do before I do it? And it may only cost me a few pennies a share each time this happens, but over - spread over the billions of shares that are traded every day on the stock market, it adds up. So he goes looking. And he started to sort of like test the market with funny kinds of experiments. The short answer is what turns out is happening is he's sitting physically in Lower Manhattan when he makes his trades. When he pushes the buy button, the signal from his computer travels up the fiber-optics along the West Side Highway of Manhattan and through the Lincoln Tunnel. On the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel is one of the 13 stock exchanges, called the BATS Exchange, founded by high-frequency traders. They're sitting there, and they get the signal that he wants to buy first. They're sitting there offering a few shares of Microsoft so that they can see what he wants to do. They discern his desire to buy Microsoft, and they have faster connections to the 12 other exchanges that are scattered across New Jersey, and they race him to the other exchanges, buy all the Microsoft in front of him and sell it back to him at a higher price. So what was happening is he was physically being raced by high-frequency traders who had faster and more direct fiber-optic lines from the first exchange to all the other exchanges. But it takes him literally 18 months to figure this out, and he has to assemble people who, you know, have been essentially in manholes in New Jersey laying fiber-optic cable to figure out how all this works. GROSS: So say the bank and investment company that he was with represented my retirement fund. What would that mean for me? LEWIS: It would mean for you that every time your retirement fund trades in the market, some high-frequency trader is skimming pennies from each trade, and it adds up to who knows, 10, 20 - no one quite knows, many billions of dollars a year. It's essentially a tax on your investment dollars. So you're essentially being legally robbed from by the system. And - but that's just really the beginning of the problem. I mean, the beginning of the problem is you're paying this unnecessary tax to Wall Street to make trades in the marketplace. The bigger problem is that the system in order to accommodate high-frequency trading has become ever more complicated. In fact, it's almost designed so you can't understand it, so you don't ask questions about it. But the complexity brings with it instability, in that making these systems that run the stock exchanges ever more complicated and ever faster for the benefit of high-frequency traders creates a kind of volatility to them. So you have flash crashes. You have outages of stock exchanges. You have stocks doing very strange things. So the bigger problem in addition to the skimming that's going on of your savings, is that there's a decline of trust in the marketplace because it's not as trustworthy, and if it's not as trustworthy, then the whole economy suffers. I mean trust is the whole - is sort of the grease that keeps the system working. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Lewis, and we're talking about his new book \"Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. \" And it's about how Wall Street has changed because of high-frequency trading. Let's take a break, and then we'll talk some more about this new kind of drama on Wall Street. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Lewis, who's best known for books like \"Moneyball,\" \"The Big Short,\" \"Liar's Poker. \" His new book, \"Flash Boys,\" is about high-frequency trading on Wall Street, where like a nanosecond makes a really big difference in whether you're making money or losing money. And it's a complicated story, but he's an incredible storyteller. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So how are the stock market exchanges benefiting from high-frequency traders? Like what's the relationship that they have that works for them but shuts out a lot of investors? LEWIS: So places like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ and a lot of lesser known exchanges - there are 13 of these public exchanges now - all make vast sums of money by selling access to their buildings, to their physical premises, to high-frequency traders so that the high-frequency traders can be closer to the black box that is the exchange so that the high-frequency traders can get information about price changes faster than everybody else, so they know the market before everybody else. That's one way they, the exchanges, make money from high-frequency traders. Then what they do is once they've got all the high-frequency traders in the building, unlike - you and I aren't in the building, you and aren't represented in the building. The high-frequency traders have their computer terminals next to their servers, right next to the exchange computer, and they then compete amongst themselves to be closer and closer, faster and faster in relation to each other. And this is sort of like, I don't know, it's sort of like a bunch of predators competing to be fastest to get to the prey. You and I are the prey, they are the predators. So the exchange sells small increments of speed to the predators. They'll upgrade their technology so all of a sudden everybody can be two microseconds faster, but they have to pay for that. That's the business model for these exchanges now. It's to find ways to enable the high-frequency traders to get ever faster and sell them the technology to do so, so that they can be the first to get to us. GROSS: So it's almost like a pay-to-play system. LEWIS: It's totally a pay-to-play system. That is what it is, and it's pay a lot to play. I mean, to set up a high-frequency trading sort of system in all the exchanges, you're talking about millions of dollars a year. It's not something that everybody can do. But it is something that a big Wall Street bank can do. A big Wall Street bank might be in the high-frequency trading game. But it's absolutely. And it is - what it does is it neatly divides the market into predator and prey. It creates this relationship between people who are there to actually invest in companies and these artificial middlemen who have been unnecessarily inserted in between buyers and sellers of stock. GROSS: So let's get back to Brad Katsuyama, and he's again the central figure of your book, who is at the Royal Bank of Canada when he figures out that something's going on that he doesn't comprehend. He assembles a team of experts from all over who have dealt with high-frequency trading and together they figure out what's going on. And then they to circumvent it. And they create something called Thor. What is Thor? LEWIS: So Thor is a stock market order router. It sends the orders out in the market, to the 13 different exchanges from Brad's computer terminal. So the problem he was having was that when he hit his button and sent his buy order or his sell order into the market, it arrived at different exchanges at different times because the exchanges were physically located at different distances from his desk, and it takes time for a signal to travel through fiber-optics. So it would get to an exchange on the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel first, and then it would get to the other exchanges later. With Thor, what they did is they organize the 13 different signals that went to the 13 different exchanges so they all arrived at exactly the same time. So they weren't vulnerable to a high-frequency trader seeing it arrive to buy at one exchange and racing them to all the other exchanges. And the minute they were able to perfect this, and it was not a simple matter, designing it so that it arrived at the same time at all these exchanges, and it was not even intuitively obvious to them it was a solution to the problem. They were guessing. They'd been experimenting in the markets, and this was just one of their experiments. But when they hit the button, and all their buy orders arrived at exactly the same, you know, microsecond at all 13 exchanges, the market became the market again. No longer were - was the high-frequency trader able to identify what they were doing at the first exchange they arrived at and exploit them on all the other exchanges. So this was a revelation. This was - in a way it's the beginning of their story because it's the first time they see, oh my God, now we know how we're being exploited. We've being exploited because the first exchange we arrive at there are our predators waiting who identify what we're doing and then prey on us at all the other exchanges. And they take this, the - I think this is like - there's several moments where there are these moral choices that my main character, that Brad, has to make. And the minute he realizes this, he realizes - he sees what the game is being played, he has a choice. He can play the game with everybody else, and he could probably make a lot of money as a high-frequency trader. But instead he decides to go on an educational campaign and go talk to investors about what he's just discovered. GROSS: And of course a lot of them don't understand what's going on yet either. LEWIS: But you know, this is a big, big point. So there is this perception that Wall Street insiders understand how Wall Street works. And it's false. And it's especially false right now, that here you have this young man, this kid at the Royal Bank of Canada who's engaged in this kind of science experiment in the market. He figures out at least one angle the predators are taking, and he goes and talks to not just ordinary investors, he's talking to Bill Ackman, David Einhorn, Dan Loeb, Fidelity, Vanguard, Capital Group, the biggest investors, the smartest investors in the world, and their jaws are on the floor. Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager who often, you know, takes big stakes in companies, he's told me, he said, you know, until Brad Katsuyama walked into my office, I thought I had an insider trading problem. I thought people were figuring out what companies I wanted to buy and jumping in front of me in the market before I bought them. And it was a different kind of insider trading problem than I thought I had, basically, is what he said. So these - even these people have no idea what's going on in the market and are being educated by this Canadian who's basically just arrived on the scene and has decided to make understanding his business. GROSS: Michael Lewis will be back in the second half of the show. His new book about high-frequency trading is called \"Flash Boys. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Michael Lewis. His new book \"Flash Boys\" is about how the stock market has become a rigged game as a result of the computerized transactions known as high-frequency trading, in which the fastest computers but the most high-speed connections compete against each other to get information first and make a trade before anyone else can. A fraction of a second can make all the difference in how much money is made or lost in one of these transactions. Lewis says some high-speed traders are predatory, and their prey may include your retirement account. So when we left off, you're talking about how Brad Katsuyama, who is the central figure in your book, had figured out how high-frequency trading was kind of becoming predatory and explaining his trade, so that he ended up having to buy at higher prices than he thought he was buying. And he brings a team of people together around the country who really understand insider-trading and they tried to figure out a way of circumventing it. They come up with a program that levels the playing field. And then they figure out what they really need to do is create their own stock exchange. Why would they need to do that? LEWIS: Well, because what they realized is the American stock exchange has completely fallen down and responsibility to create a fair environment for investors. That they were prejudicing the market in favor of high-frequency traders because the high-frequency traders pay them to do it. And that was in fact, kind of the business model of the new - and the American Stock Exchange, was to create opportunities for strength fast traders to exploit you and me and every other investor. And so long as the exchanges were bent on doing this, no matter how cleverly they routed their stock market orders into the market that they figured the predator would find a way to get them. And so the solution to the problem they thought was well, let's create an actual fair stock exchange. Let's take on the responsibility of essentially, restoring trust to the stock market of creating an environment where every dollar stands the same chance. I mean who would've thought this would be such a radical act, but it is. And so they design in exchange on which high-frequency traders can operate but they don't have any speed advantage anymore. They make everybody essentially the same speed on this exchange, so you're no longer at risk of being preyed upon. The problem once they create this exchange is that they have to persuade brokers and banks to send stock market orders onto it. That's the war that they create when they do this. I mean the banks and brokers are also paid a cut of what the high-frequency traders are taking out of investor's, so they don't want to send their orders onto this fair exchange because there's not lots of money to be made on this fair exchange for them. So how does Katsuyama go about trying to persuade them that they do want to trade on this exchange? He's created this war. And the war he's created is between people who have savings investments to make, to manage - money managers, individual investors, hedge funds managers, so on and so forth. And on the other hand, the people who have been mishandling those funds, big Wall Street banks and brokerage houses. And when he does is he tours the world and educates investors about what's happening with their stock market orders. And he tries to persuade the biggest investors to start to pressure the banks to behave more honestly with them. And that is what has happened. I mean if you call up Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan were any of the big banks today, they'll tell you they're being hounded by some of the world's biggest investors to route their stock market orders onto Brad Katsuyama's exchange because it's the only exchange they trust. GROSS: So a fundamental question I have about these exchanges is why are there so many of them? Why isn't there just one or maybe two exchanges? LEWIS: Well, it's a really good question. And it's a really good question because not all trading is computerized. And we could all meet in a single black box without a lot of human beings in between us; that's probably what should happen, that all buyers and sellers should just agree to meet in a single place. It would simplify the market, make it more transparent, so on and so forth. The answer that a Wall Street person would give you is that exchanges are businesses, that they benefit from having to compete with each other, that they provide services. And if there are more than one, they're kind of forced to be on their game all the time. The problem is that their customers, the people they're trying to please, are not doing me. They're not investors. They are banks and brokers that send them stock market orders and high-frequency traders who buy special access inside them. So they're competing with each other basically to please the predator at the expense of the prey. GROSS: Because that's where the profits are for them? LEWIS: Because that's where the profits are. And the reason it doesn't consolidate, the market doesn't consolidate is the more fragmented it is the easier it is for high-frequency traders to explain investors. They can erase them from one exchange or another. The physical distance between exchanges creates opportunity for high-frequency traders. GROSS: So this new exchange that was started by the central figure in your book, Brad Katsuyama, how has it performed so far? LEWIS: It was initially named the Investors Exchange, and then they went to go get a Web address and they realized that it was www. investors. sex change. com. (LAUGHTER) LEWIS: So they had to - so really, they bothered them - right from the beginning - they had to introduce another acronym to Wall Street, IEX, and it bothered them to no end. But IEX was opened for business in late October of 2013 and has done extremely well, as new exchanges go. Normally, new exchanges take a while to gain traction. They're already profitable. I mean they're trading, I don't know, 30, 40 million shares a day - which is still, it's small, but it's sustainable. The volume of stock market trading their doing though, is really a very poor indication of their effect on the universe because their effect has been profound. The New York Stock Exchange for the last three months has been trying to buy them. And I think there's a chance the New York Stock Exchange will buy them and try to make them the New York Stock Exchange. What they are is, they're radically disrupting the environment because investors are increasingly learning that it's the one fair exchange, the one place where they won't be exploited. And the pressure that investors put some banks and brokers to send their stock market orders to this exchange is increasing. At some point, it's a bit like, I don't know, it's a bit like a river changing its course. I think you can kind of think of Brad Katsuyama and IEX a sort of stretching on the side of a river that they want to jump its bank at that particular day bank. That at some point the whole market could job onto this exchange, that there is a kind of network effects that the bigger they get the bigger they get. And it's all been good. I mean they've gotten, they've doubled in size every month since they started and I suspect that they're going to continue to do so for a while. GROSS: So this high-frequency trading that has created the unequal playing field that you write about, this all happened after the financial collapse of 2007, right? LEWIS: Yes. And that is an incredible footnote to the story, the idea that essentially, the stock market got raised since the financial crisis. You would've thought that here you got the world's most watch, most supposedly democratized, politicized financial market at a time when everybody is skeptical about Wall Street, you would've thought that that would be the least likely time for the sort of shenanigans to happen. But, in fact, no. In fact, there's been a dramatic rise in predatory activity since the financial crisis in the stock market. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Lewis and he's the author of many books about Wall Street, including \"Liar's Poker\" and \"The Big Short. \" His book \"Money Ball\" was about how algorithms are being used in baseball now. His new book is called \"Flash Boys\" and it's all about high-frequency trading on Wall Street and how it's created an incredibly uneven playing field - or as he puts it - the system is rigged. So let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH Air. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis. He's written extensively about Wall Street and about the use of computer algorithms to do crazy things. So he's the author of \"Money Ball,\" \"Liar's Poker,\" \"The Big Short. \" His new book is called \"Flash Boys\" and it's about how high-frequency trading has transformed Wall Street in ways that most people - even a lot of traders - don't know about them don't understand. so high-frequency trading is dependent on fiber optic lines that can carry information incredibly quickly, that can transmit information incredibly quickly. And earlier in your book, you describe the one of these lines was built in 2010, kind of secretly to connect a Chicago data center with a stock exchange located in Northern Jersey. Was that the New York Stock Exchange? LEWIS: Well, it was the NASDAQ stock exchange where the line ended, but then it fanned out to all the other stock exchanges. GROSS: Got it. LEWIS: The business was called Spread Networks. It was a breathtaking story. There was a former trader on Chicago futures exchanges who saw how much money high-frequency traders were making. And he realized that they needed the fastest possible line between Chicago and New Jersey. And the reason they needed was that in the stock market, stock futures trading in Chicago and the actual stocks trade in New Jersey. And price movements in the market, in the overall market goes up or down tend to register first in Chicago in the futures market. So if you want to know if you're making markets and all the stocks in New Jersey and you want to know what the overall market is going to so you can get out, you know, if the market is going to fall you don't want to be buying, you need to know that first or else you're in trouble. Or else other people who know it first are going to sell stock to you when the market's falling. So this, his name is Dan Spivey, this trader. He essentially dug a tunnel between Chicago and New Jersey as straight as possible. He laid a string across a map and said how straight can I make this line? Because the straight year it is, the shorter it is, the faster it is. And he was trying to be the fastest line that was out there, which was owned by Verizon Wireless and they didn't know it was the fastest line. They didn't even know what they had. But Verizon Wireless could get a signal from Chicago to New Jersey like 17 milliseconds. And he spends - Spivey spends - $300 million, $400 million digging this tunnel incomplete secrecy - no one has any idea why he's doing it or what he's doing - and laying this line that enables him to get a signal back and forth in about 12 and one half milliseconds. And then is able to go out and demand from high-frequency traders $10 million a pop just to be on the line because they can't afford not to be on the low. GROSS: And this amazes me that one firm, one investment company that he was dealing with, they wanted it to double the price so that competitors couldn't afford to the underlying. LEWIS: Yes. Well, so this is, I mean it's a great business school case study. So you have come he sort of is like creating scarcity. He digs this line that the high-frequency traders already have the fastest line between Chicago and New Jersey. It's irritating to them that someone has gone and done the faster one because now they have to have it and they have to pay for it. They were getting the fastest line previously or not very much money. He walks into their offices and their series with him, basically. How dare you do this? How dare you demand we paid $10 million just to get on your line? But then they realize they can't not be on it. And it is one of the great moments, he thought, was when one of the high-frequency trading firms, after being angry with him said, you know, let us cool down and let us think about this for a minute. And then they come back in the room and they say, can you double the price? Because the more expensive it is they figured that you were people would be on it anymore and the more of an advantage they would have over the rest of the stock market. GROSS: You know, it was algorithms and things invisible to the public into most traders that created the financial collapse of 2007 - or at least partly created it. Our experts expecting that they're going to be more flash crashes in the near future because of how complicated and also convert so much of high-frequency trading is now? LEWIS: The answer to that is yes. You look around, there's a flash crash - there are flash crashes in stocks every day, individual stocks. There are outages at the exchanges. There's technical glitch after technical glitch. This is all symptomatic of a system that's out of control, too complicated, nobody completely understands. It's unstable. And Goldman Sachs in just the last few weeks has essentially thrown its support behind Brad Katsuyama's exchange because they think that what is needed is simplicity and transparency. And they're starting to route all their customer's orders onto that exchange for that reason. And the head of Goldman Sachs' stock market division said to me, he said if we don't change the system there's going to be a flash crash times 10. There's going to be some extremely unpleasant crisis in the stock market. So I think it's becoming conventional wisdom that the system itself is a problem. And that's a problem for all of us because of the system is unstable, if the house is built on sand, it does not engender trust. And there's no trust in the market, it costs companies more to raise money in the market. And it could cost companies more to raise money in the market, they don't supply as many jobs to the economy, they don't innovate in the way they might innovate, they don't invest in the way they might invest. And it's a problem. It gets to the very root of the American economy. GROSS: Part of the reason why you're so good at reporting on Wall Street as that used to work there, so you are an insider for a while. And this was in the mid-1980s when you worked. . . LEWIS: A long time ago. Yeah. GROSS: Yes. And it's changed a lot since then. But still, you grasp it. So this was in the mid-80s. You market Salomon Brothers. You were the. . . . . . '80s when you were. . . LEWIS: A long time ago. Yeah. GROSS: Yes. And it's changed a lot since then but still, you grasp it. So this was in the mid-'80s. You worked at Salomon Brothers. You were there during the crash of October '87. You say Wall Street firms have grown more concerned than they were in the late '80s with what journalists might say about them. Why do you think that is? And how did that affect your reporting of this high frequency trading story? LEWIS: It's interesting because if you think back what I did with \"Liar's Poker,\" I walked out of a job at Salomon Brothers, told my bosses I was going to write a book about Wall Street and they kind of smiled and said go do it if you want to, you're crazy because you could make a lot more money here. But you know, do your best kind of thing. If you tried to do that now, well, for a start, the version of me on Wall Street would've signed all kinds of non-disclosure agreements when he came into the firm. And you would've been hounded by lawyers on your way out the door. The firms have become so concerned about their public faces and so reluctant to share what's going on inside of them. Now, why has that happened? I think it's because Wall Street, to some extent, depends for its profits on people not understanding what's going on in Wall Street. The firms generate complicated situations, complicated securities, precisely so that other people don't understand them, creating an advantage for the Wall Street firms. I think that technology has naturally rendered a lot of what Wall Street's formerly useful function was moot, that you don't need a human being in between buyers and sellers of stock anymore. It could all be done electronically without Wall Street in between the buyers and the sellers. So Wall Street has been put in a position of having to scramble to find sources of revenues that are just less justified, that are more kind of manufactured. Subprime mortgage CDOs are one example. The incredibly complicated things they did in the subprime mortgage market were not actually economically useful. They were damaging but they generate a lot of profits for Wall Street. This breathtakingly complicated stock market that's been constructed is not actually socially or economically useful but it generates a lot of money for Wall Street. So when you are running one of these firms and you sense that a lot of what you do is not socially or economically useful, it's just enabling a kind of skim, the last thing you want is transparency or people from the inside talking about what's going on in the inside. You want to hide what you're doing. I mean I think they're naturally kind of more frightened of having the public genuinely understand what their businesses are. And it's not that all of the business on Wall Street is bad or not useful, but it's just an increasing chunk of Wall Street is essentially predatory. So I think that's what's going on. And I think that the sort of technology has caused a crisis in the financial services industry and the financial services industry has responded by, you know, trying to defend its profitability and it's been very good at doing it. But it requires this kind of opacity. GROSS: So one final question for you. The central characters in your book are people who walked away from their jobs at various banks and brokerage houses to create this new exchange that they thought would be an even playing field without giving high frequency traders the edge. So what was in it for them? Because they gave up a lot of money at the jobs that they were for an uncertain future. LEWIS: This is what intrigued me about these characters, that they are all people who are making, in some cases, several million dollars a year in very safe jobs and they were successful, beloved by their firms, etc. , etc. And there are two things about them that are striking. One is it's amazing how many of them are immigrants, how few of them are actually Americans. They're Canadian, they're Irish, they're Chinese, they're Russian. And I don't know what that means, but they came to this country and they had some view about the way the system worked. They were disturbed by what they found and they wanted to make the system work the way they imagined it. The other thing is they are all, in one way or another, people who are living their lives as they want to look back on them, rather than like thinking about the next quarter's bonus. And they were kicked into that state of mind by various events in their lives. There's a peculiar moral quality about all of them that I found just really interesting. GROSS: Michael Lewis, it's been great to have you back on the show. LEWIS: Thank you. GROSS: Thank you for explaining stuff that's really complicated and doing such a good job with it.

Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Here in the basement of the Red Cross in Washington, D. C. , the job of making sure the response trucks are properly stocked often falls to Renee Killian. (SOUNDBITE OF CLANKING)RENEE KILLIAN: This is a cage where we keep all of our items. NOGUCHI: Blankets, water bottles and cleaning kits are kept in the event of a fire or disaster. Killian is an intern during the day, and a volunteer who's on call many nights. And she's not earning a dime. KILLIAN: And right now, you know, I go out and I'm not being paid for anything, but I do get paid in hugs. And so that's a big thing for me. NOGUCHI: But it's a line of work this 47-year-old adores. Killian is a former police officer and after losing her job managing a marina, she opted to intern alongside George Washington University students less than half her age. KILLIAN: We have GW student who are in here who are like, teeny bopping around. They do look to me for support and, you know, and I assist them in every way. NOGUCHI: Killian's boss, Lisa McGee, a disaster program manager, is supportive. LISA MCGEE: I came in as an older intern myself. NOGUCHI: How old were you when you did that internship? MCGEE: Oh, well, 40-something - about 43. (Laughter)(LAUGHTER)NOGUCHI: McGee says older interns often have more empathy, life experience, and commitment to the job. And it's a commitment Renee Killian wears on her sleeve, literally. In lieu of wedding rings, she and her late husband got matching Red Cross tattoos on their wrists. Do you always wear Red Cross earrings? KILLIAN: I wear Red Cross something, so there's something on me that's Red Cross every day. NOGUCHI: Killian believes the internship will help her get a paying job. She's currently interviewing. KILLIAN: They were amazed when I told them. I says yeah, I'm a 47-year-old intern, and a volunteer, at Red Cross. And they're, like, really? And I'm, like, yeah. And they respect that. NOGUCHI: Are you nervous? KILLIAN: Nope. Nope. I'm 47 years old. I'm not nervous. NOGUCHI: The great recession and its long-term unemployment legacy have put the spotlight on older interns, including in the movies. \"The Internship\" features two middle-aged interns at Google. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"THE INTERNSHIP\")CAROL COHEN: I loved the movie, and I thought there were moments there that reflected the real world. NOGUCHI: Carol Cohen is co-founder of iRelaunch, a firm matching companies with people wanting to return to work. She wrote a review of the movie for the Harvard Business Review. COHEN: Your boss may be a lot younger than you are. That happened to me. My boss was younger than me when I returned, at age 42. NOGUCHI: Cohen says more than 11,000 people ranging in age from 30 to their late 50s have sought to find work through iRelaunch since it started in 2007. And, she says, it's coinciding with new interests from some big banks and insurance firms that are looking for older interns. COHEN: There's been an explosion of formal employer return-to-work programs that involve an internship. NOGUCHI: Danielle Probst is 50. She has a master's in fine arts, but her career in film and marketing faltered during the recession. Now, she's working part-time in the cafeteria at NPR's headquarters. DANIELLE PROBST: And how many of these sandwiches do I have to make again? NOGUCHI: Probst says one of her internships did not work out. A little over a year ago, she joined a social media marketing company. PROBST: The people that I worked with were all young enough to be my kids, which was kind of bizarre for me. That was the first time I was really in a situation like that. NOGUCHI: Her younger boss didn't take kindly to Probst's mentoring other interns. Ultimately, she was offered a job that paid $10 an hour, not enough to live on. Now, Probst is still casting around for another career steppingstone, but she's less sure of herself these days and not sure where to look. PROBST: I just never expected to have to redesign my career over and over and over again. NOGUCHI: Now, she says, it's just a crunch between trying to pay the bills and trying to lay the groundwork for a more stable career. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Some other news: As the job market improves, people in their 40s or older are trying to restart their careers with internships. Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Here in the basement of the Red Cross in Washington, D. C. , the job of making sure the response trucks are properly stocked often falls to Renee Killian. (SOUNDBITE OF CLANKING) RENEE KILLIAN: This is a cage where we keep all of our items. NOGUCHI: Blankets, water bottles and cleaning kits are kept in the event of a fire or disaster. Killian is an intern during the day, and a volunteer who's on call many nights. And she's not earning a dime. KILLIAN: And right now, you know, I go out and I'm not being paid for anything, but I do get paid in hugs. And so that's a big thing for me. NOGUCHI: But it's a line of work this 47-year-old adores. Killian is a former police officer and after losing her job managing a marina, she opted to intern alongside George Washington University students less than half her age. KILLIAN: We have GW student who are in here who are like, teeny bopping around. They do look to me for support and, you know, and I assist them in every way. NOGUCHI: Killian's boss, Lisa McGee, a disaster program manager, is supportive. LISA MCGEE: I came in as an older intern myself. NOGUCHI: How old were you when you did that internship? MCGEE: Oh, well, 40-something - about 43. (Laughter) (LAUGHTER) NOGUCHI: McGee says older interns often have more empathy, life experience, and commitment to the job. And it's a commitment Renee Killian wears on her sleeve, literally. In lieu of wedding rings, she and her late husband got matching Red Cross tattoos on their wrists. Do you always wear Red Cross earrings? KILLIAN: I wear Red Cross something, so there's something on me that's Red Cross every day. NOGUCHI: Killian believes the internship will help her get a paying job. She's currently interviewing. KILLIAN: They were amazed when I told them. I says yeah, I'm a 47-year-old intern, and a volunteer, at Red Cross. And they're, like, really? And I'm, like, yeah. And they respect that. NOGUCHI: Are you nervous? KILLIAN: Nope. Nope. I'm 47 years old. I'm not nervous. NOGUCHI: The great recession and its long-term unemployment legacy have put the spotlight on older interns, including in the movies. \"The Internship\" features two middle-aged interns at Google. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"THE INTERNSHIP\") CAROL COHEN: I loved the movie, and I thought there were moments there that reflected the real world. NOGUCHI: Carol Cohen is co-founder of iRelaunch, a firm matching companies with people wanting to return to work. She wrote a review of the movie for the Harvard Business Review. COHEN: Your boss may be a lot younger than you are. That happened to me. My boss was younger than me when I returned, at age 42. NOGUCHI: Cohen says more than 11,000 people ranging in age from 30 to their late 50s have sought to find work through iRelaunch since it started in 2007. And, she says, it's coinciding with new interests from some big banks and insurance firms that are looking for older interns. COHEN: There's been an explosion of formal employer return-to-work programs that involve an internship. NOGUCHI: Danielle Probst is 50. She has a master's in fine arts, but her career in film and marketing faltered during the recession. Now, she's working part-time in the cafeteria at NPR's headquarters. DANIELLE PROBST: And how many of these sandwiches do I have to make again? NOGUCHI: Probst says one of her internships did not work out. A little over a year ago, she joined a social media marketing company. PROBST: The people that I worked with were all young enough to be my kids, which was kind of bizarre for me. That was the first time I was really in a situation like that. NOGUCHI: Her younger boss didn't take kindly to Probst's mentoring other interns. Ultimately, she was offered a job that paid $10 an hour, not enough to live on. Now, Probst is still casting around for another career steppingstone, but she's less sure of herself these days and not sure where to look. PROBST: I just never expected to have to redesign my career over and over and over again. NOGUCHI: Now, she says, it's just a crunch between trying to pay the bills and trying to lay the groundwork for a more stable career.

I'm Robert Siegel in Washington. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block broadcasting this week from member station KERA in Dallas. For years, cyclists have faced long odds here in Texas where city roads are clogged with trucks and cars. In fact, Dallas was ranked the worst city for bicycling in the country for several years in a row. But, as NPR's Elise Hu reports from the capital city of Austin, there are signs of hope for those who prefer transportation on two or even three wheels. ELISE HU, BYLINE: We're traveling by pedicab in Austin, Texas, which is a pretty popular way to get around. AUSTIN MATHERNE: There's a lot of us out here and, I mean, you watch us go by every 30 seconds, you know. HU: That's pedicab driver Austin Matherne. Yes, somehow I wound up taking a pedicab in downtown Austin from a guy named Austin. MATHERNE: Would you like (unintelligible) go on, go on, man. HU: If you're not familiar with pedicabs, they are bicycle rickshaw combos. Some are covered, most are open-air rides. In this Texas city where the disgraced Lance Armstrong still lives has long been a progressive cycling-friendly place. MATHERNE: It works here. Also, the way the downtown is set up, all the entertainment districts are so close together that it really is a very viable transportation option for us. HU: Bicycles as a transportation option is becoming a bigger conversation across the state as traffic snarls grow worse. Austin ranks high among the most congested mid-sized cities in America. So besides its burgeoning pedicab businesses, bike sharing has also gotten going here. Earlier this year, the capital city became the fourth in Texas to start a bike-sharing program. Anyone with at least $8 to spend can rent a bike, ride it around and drop it off at any of the city's 40 bike-share sites. Despite having a bike of his own, Sean Ironmonger rents one to go out. SEAN IRONMONGER: It's nice when I don't know where I'm gonna be meeting people or if I'm going out for happy hour and then I want to, like, hop a ride to the next spot or whatever. HU: That the blue city in a red state is friendly towards cycling isn't that newsy, but these days, the state's other major cities, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, where oil and gas companies dominate the economy, are actually leading several pro-cycling policy changes. ROBIN STALLINGS: At the city level, it's absolutely amazing. It's on fire. HU: Robin Stallings heads Bike Texas, the statewide advocacy group that pushes for bike-friendly policies. STALLINGS: Not everybody has room for their truck if everybody's in a truck. So we need to at least get some people out of their trucks to make room for the rest of us. HU: To get there, Houston passed more than $100 million in bonds for bike trails. San Antonio plans to triple bikeable streets by 2020. Dallas unveiled plans to lay out a new network of 1,100 miles of bike lanes over the next decade. And all of this is rooted in a very Texas kind of reason: City leaders realize bike lanes are good for business. Robin Stallings. STALLINGS: Companies like Samsung and Google are looking at the bicycle facility infrastructure before they decide what city they're going to locate in. So this is really being driven by economics in Texas. It's not all about people seeing themselves on a bicycle, but seeing what it does for the quality of life in a city. HU: But for cycling culture to catch up to car culture, a long road lies ahead. Census numbers show in Dallas, only 1 in 1,000 people cycles for transportation. The average for the country's largest cities is 16 times higher. And some of the state's biggest barriers to cycling are practical, not political. Commutes are long and summer temperatures fall somewhere between hot and hellish. Sean Ironmonger thinks there is such a thing as too hot for cycling. IRONMONGER: Once it gets to where I need a real good shower once I get somewhere, I can't really do it, for commuting. HU: And attitudes aren't quite there yet. Matherne, the pedicabbie, says the car-only cohort still isn't so willing to share the roads. MATHERNE: I wish there was a way to change people's view of that. Maybe, maybe it will slowly start happening. HU: Making Texas more cycling friendly is an uphill climb, but money motivations are moving it forward. Elise Hu, NPR News.

I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. It is no coincidence that President Obama is pushing for a higher minimum wage during a congressional election year. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is not just good policy. It also happens to be good politics. GREENE: The White House says a higher minimum wage would put more money into the pockets of some 28 million workers. The demand for a higher wage might help Democrats across the country; from Michigan, where the president speaks today, to Arkansas. INSKEEP: That's where Senator Mark Pryor is hoping the president is right about the politics. The Democrat is trying to hold his seat and he may get a boost, if proponents are able to get a minimum wage increase on the ballot in November. Arkansas does have some of the lowest wages in the nation. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: It's just about supper-time and Taylor Dilday is going door to door in Little Rock, Arkansas. He carries a clipboard and wears a bright green T-shirt that spells out his mission: Raise the minimum wage. TAYLOR DILDAY: Hi. ELIZABETH DANLEY: Hi. DILDAY: I'm Taylor and I'm with Give Arkansas a Raise Now. HORSLEY: Elizabeth Danley doesn't need much convincing. She grabs a pen and eagerly signs Dilday's petition. DANLEY: This is the hope for Arkansas. We need to be paying ourselves, besides the people who are up there in that one percent. The rest of us need to be part of that. HORSLEY: The national minimum wage hasn't budged in almost five years. And it buys less today than it did in the late 1960s. Working his way along streets decorated with Arkansas Razorbacks flags, Dilday gets a mixed reaction. At the Phillips household, the whole family takes a break from cooking dumplings to add their names to his petition. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hey, David, you need to come sign this. Raise the minimum wage. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Terrific. All right. I'm so down with that. . . HORSLEY: Other residents close the door on Dilday before he can even get a word out. DILDAY: Hi. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Nope. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOSING DOOR)DILDAY: It's hit or miss with every neighborhood. It's just that generally the further you go the more backlash we get. But you know, the further inner-city we are, we have a lot of supporters. HORSLEY: And that support could have an important spillover effect for Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor. He's in a tough spot this year, running for re-election as a Democrat in a deeply red state, especially since turnout among Democratic voters typically suffers in non-presidential years. Political scientist Jay Barth, of Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, says putting a minimum wage increase on the ballot could give Democrats more of a reason to show up on Election Day. JAY BARTH: For Mark Pryor to win, this has to be an election that's not about the president but really about bread and butter economic issues. And if there's a lot of conversation about the minimum wage, that is perhaps the most popular economic issue that the Democrats have going for them. HORSLEY: Pryor has tried to put some distance between himself and Obama, who's particularly unpopular in Arkansas. Barth notes the senator has opposed the president's push for a national minimum wage of $10. 10 an hour, while embracing the Arkansas campaign to boost the state's minimum to 8. 50. BARTH: He's all in on the state minimum wage, while he's able to kind of say: I'm not for Obama's minimum wage. HORSLEY: Eleanor Wheeler, of the group Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, says even the more modest state increase could make a big difference in Arkansas, where the average wage is the third lowest in the country - behind only Mississippi and West Virginia. More than one out of 10 Arkansas children has a parent who makes minimum wage. ELEANOR WHEELER: When parents struggle, their kids struggle too. And there are a lot of kids out there with parents who are working minimum wage. And we want to make sure their parents can provide for everybody. HORSLEY: But Little Rock businessman Roger Lacy warns boosting the minimum wage could backfire. ROGER LACY: I think it should stay where it is. HORSLEY: Lacy owns a janitorial company. Most of his 225 employees make minimum wage: 7. 25 an hour. If that goes up, Lacy says, it won't come out of his pocket. He'll simply pass the additional cost on to the people whose offices his company cleans. LACY: If times are good, people just kind of accept it and roll with it. If you're in a recession, like we've been, you're going to get people saying: No, I'm hurting, I can't do that. Then you're going to have to adjust to that. HORSLEY: Lacy argues some workers might have their hours cut back. Others might not be hired at all. Economists disagree about the severity of job cuts when the minimum wage goes up. While the majority of workers stand to benefit from bigger paychecks, Lacy says it's the young and unskilled who suffer most. LACY: It really impacts those people. They never get a chance to advance. And they don't get the work skills to even get out and get a job somewhere else. HORSLEY: Lacy adds even workers who do get a raise will see part of the increase eaten up by higher prices. That was enough to give Elizabeth Dober pause, when Taylor Dilday came knocking on her door with his petition. ELIZABETH DOVER: I'm not sure how I feel about that so I'm not sure I want to sign that quite yet. HORSLEY: Dover worries if Arkansas' minimum wage climbs to $8. 50 an hour, people who are making that much now will soon want a raise as well. DOVER: So it's just a big huge effect all the way up the line, and as you get older, you think about what things used to cost. And I'm old. HORSLEY: After a moment's hesitation, though, Dover agrees to sign the petition and put the question on the November ballot. She says I guess voters should have the right to decide those things.

I'm Robert Siegel. Saving for retirement is a challenge most Americans face and research shows that challenge is complicated by basic human impulses. We know we should be saving, but we don't. We consistently make bad financial decisions. NPR's Chris Arnold reports on how emotions get in the way. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: To understand one reason why we have such a hard time saving for retirement, I'm going to tell you a story. It's a story about my new car. Actually, it's a story about my old horrible car, but I just bought it three months ago. OK. So I'm getting into my new old Jeep here and I'm going to go see my mechanic or my body shop guy. OK. Here's what happened. I had this old Jeep Cherokee. It was the first new car I ever bought back 15 years ago. I loved that car. But then, this jerk rear-ended me when I was stopped at a traffic light and the car got completely totaled. Insurance only gave me $3,000, but still, impulsively, I ran out with that money and bought the first car that I could find that looked like my old one to replace it. The problem is what I got for that was a beat-up, cheap, old rusty used Jeep and now, I am, as you might imagine, having some regrets. So I can't believe this car is as rusted out as it is. And listen to that rattle. I mean, what is that? This car is like a loose, rusty, bag of bolts. I take the car over to Elite Bodyworks in Boston. The owner, a guy named Ken Lucas, unfortunately agrees with me. How bad is the rust under the back end? KEN LUCAS: It's extremely bad. It's probably not a very safe vehicle to drive. And I wouldn't recommend you drive it. ARNOLD: Now, I cover financial stuff as a reporter and I've always saved a lot for retirement. But when I lost this car that I loved, it's like my primitive brain just took over. And it turns out the reason I probably made such a rash and bad decision is a reason lots of Americans make all kinds of bad financial decisions constantly. BRIGITTE MADRIAN: You were trying to eliminate the loss. ARNOLD: Professor Brigitte Madrian teaches behavioral economics at Harvard. MADRIAN: You know, you experienced this loss of your car, and you wanted to make the loss go away. ARNOLD: And it turns out, this human instinct to avoid loss, Madrian calls it loss aversion, it's very powerful. In fact, once we have something, like my Jeep, we hate losing it even more than we enjoyed getting it in the first place. MADRIAN: It hurts twice as bad. The literature suggests that people are twice as sensitive to losses as they are to gains. ARNOLD: Which brings us back to retirement. We know we should save, but most people hate writing a check to squirrel money away for the future. That feels like a loss from our checking account. So. . . MADRIAN: The best advice by far is to take advantage of things like payroll deduction. ARNOLD: That is, having your employer put part of your pay into a retirement account before it ever shows up in your checking account. That sort of tricks you into feeling like you never had the money in the first place. And that saves us from ourselves. MADRIAN: The money you don't see is the money you don't miss. ARNOLD: But the financial services industry has figured this out, too. Mutual funds and advisors, they say, hey, forget it. Don't write us a check or anything. We'll just take a percentage out of the money we're holding and investing for you. That's often very expensive over time. But people agree to it. MADRIAN: The loss you don't see is the loss you don't feel. You know, if the return on your investment is 8 percent this year instead of 10 percent this year, you might feel perfectly happy because the investment still went up.

MADRIAN: Going to add up to a substantial reduction in what you could've saved over time. ARNOLD: You're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. MADRIAN: Yeah, potentially. ARNOLD: As for me, my Jeep will no longer start and I'm trying to get the guy who sold it to me to buy it back. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. Saving for retirement is a challenge most Americans face and research shows that challenge is complicated by basic human impulses. We know we should be saving, but we don't. We consistently make bad financial decisions. NPR's Chris Arnold reports on how emotions get in the way. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: To understand one reason why we have such a hard time saving for retirement, I'm going to tell you a story. It's a story about my new car. Actually, it's a story about my old horrible car, but I just bought it three months ago. OK. So I'm getting into my new old Jeep here and I'm going to go see my mechanic or my body shop guy. OK. Here's what happened. I had this old Jeep Cherokee. It was the first new car I ever bought back 15 years ago. I loved that car. But then, this jerk rear-ended me when I was stopped at a traffic light and the car got completely totaled. Insurance only gave me $3,000, but still, impulsively, I ran out with that money and bought the first car that I could find that looked like my old one to replace it. The problem is what I got for that was a beat-up, cheap, old rusty used Jeep and now, I am, as you might imagine, having some regrets. So I can't believe this car is as rusted out as it is. And listen to that rattle. I mean, what is that? This car is like a loose, rusty, bag of bolts. I take the car over to Elite Bodyworks in Boston. The owner, a guy named Ken Lucas, unfortunately agrees with me. How bad is the rust under the back end? KEN LUCAS: It's extremely bad. It's probably not a very safe vehicle to drive. And I wouldn't recommend you drive it. ARNOLD: Now, I cover financial stuff as a reporter and I've always saved a lot for retirement. But when I lost this car that I loved, it's like my primitive brain just took over. And it turns out the reason I probably made such a rash and bad decision is a reason lots of Americans make all kinds of bad financial decisions constantly. BRIGITTE MADRIAN: You were trying to eliminate the loss. ARNOLD: Professor Brigitte Madrian teaches behavioral economics at Harvard. MADRIAN: You know, you experienced this loss of your car, and you wanted to make the loss go away. ARNOLD: And it turns out, this human instinct to avoid loss, Madrian calls it loss aversion, it's very powerful. In fact, once we have something, like my Jeep, we hate losing it even more than we enjoyed getting it in the first place. MADRIAN: It hurts twice as bad. The literature suggests that people are twice as sensitive to losses as they are to gains. ARNOLD: Which brings us back to retirement. We know we should save, but most people hate writing a check to squirrel money away for the future. That feels like a loss from our checking account. So. . . MADRIAN: The best advice by far is to take advantage of things like payroll deduction. ARNOLD: That is, having your employer put part of your pay into a retirement account before it ever shows up in your checking account. That sort of tricks you into feeling like you never had the money in the first place. And that saves us from ourselves. MADRIAN: The money you don't see is the money you don't miss. ARNOLD: But the financial services industry has figured this out, too. Mutual funds and advisors, they say, hey, forget it. Don't write us a check or anything. We'll just take a percentage out of the money we're holding and investing for you. That's often very expensive over time. But people agree to it. MADRIAN: The loss you don't see is the loss you don't feel. You know, if the return on your investment is 8 percent this year instead of 10 percent this year, you might feel perfectly happy because the investment still went up. ARNOLD: But Madrian says, over time, if you're paying 1 or 2 percent in fees that come out of your retirement account each year over, say, 30 years, that's going to. . . MADRIAN: Going to add up to a substantial reduction in what you could've saved over time. ARNOLD: You're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. MADRIAN: Yeah, potentially. ARNOLD: As for me, my Jeep will no longer start and I'm trying to get the guy who sold it to me to buy it back.

That came as a shock to many economists who originally thought inequality tended to go down over time. They wondered how inequality could rise in so many different places at once. Well, now a new book by one of the world's leading experts on the topic suggests an answer to that mystery. Jacob Goldstein, of our Planet Money team, reports. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: The book is called \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century. \" Here's the author. THOMAS PIKETTY: My name is Thomas Piketty. I teach at the Paris School of Economics. GOLDSTEIN: Piketty's book is big in every sense of the word. It's almost 700 pages long. It makes big, sweeping claims about history and the nature of capitalism. Basically, it's the \"it\" book that every economist is taking to the beach this summer. Here's Steven Durlauf, of the University of Wisconsin. STEVEN DURLAUF: The aspect that I think is extraordinary is the fact that it developed a vision that is this big, in terms of thinking about how societies evolve. GOLDSTEIN: To get to this big vision about how societies evolved to solve the mystery of rising inequality, Piketty started out by reading a bunch of old novels: Jane Austen, Henry James and especially, Balzac. He was not in it for the love stories. PIKETTY: All of Balzac's novels are a lot about money. And in fact, all of, you know, 19th century novels are a lot about money. GOLDSTEIN: Piketty got obsessed with the way inequality was portrayed in this one Balzac story. A young, penniless nobleman moves to Paris to study law, and he meets an ex-con. The ex-con sits him down and basically says, look, work is for suckers. And the ex-con actually goes through all the math. He says, say you become a judge. This is how much you'll make. If you make all the right connections and get really lucky, maybe you'll get to be a prosecutor general. Then you'll make this much. But no matter how lucky you get, the ex-con tells the nobleman, you are not going to get rich by working. You want to get rich? Marry that heiress who lives down the hall. PIKETTY: And, you know, for a long time I was wondering, is it only because Balzac was personally obsessed with money, or was he really describing something real? GOLDSTEIN: Piketty dives into the numbers. He figures out what lawyers made back then, goes through tax receipts, looks at inheritances; and he realizes the ex-con was right. It was almost impossible to get rich by working, in Balzac's world. It was a world where to get rich, you basically had to inherit money or marry someone who did. Then Piketty digs through numbers for more countries - the U. S. , England, Germany, Japan - not just in the 19th century but the 20th and the 21st. And he comes up with this grand theory, his theory of everything. Piketty says, take any society and look at how much money people are making on their investments. When they buy stock or bonds or rent out land, how do they do? If those investments are growing faster than the rest of the economy, you're likely to have a society where inequality is increasing - where wealth is piling up in fewer hands. This is what was happening in the Balzac world. It's also what's been happening in the U. S. and other developed countries for the past several decades. But sometimes, the opposite is true. In fact, a lot of the economists working today grew up at a time when inequality was falling. In the 1950s and '60s, the economy was growing really fast. Investments were not growing so fast. So many economists came to believe this was just the normal state of affairs. In modern economies, they thought, inequality just tends to fall. BRANKO MILANOVIC: And we've had big problem explaining why inequality then picked up again in the 1970s, in the 1980s and 1990s, and now. GOLDSTEIN: This is Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York. He says Piketty looks at the big sweep of history, and figures a big chunk of the 20th century was a really unusual economic period. You had a world war, a depression, another world war, and then a massive post-war boom. MILANOVIC: Piketty would say that was not a normal world. That was really an exceptional world. And you know, that is where, actually, this perception that Piketty brings in is so dramatically different. GOLDSTEIN: The normal world, according to Piketty, is the world we're in now - the world where inequality is increasing. Now, that does not mean we're back to that Balzac world. For one thing, today there is a middle class with some wealth; people who own their homes, who have some money saved for retirement. But Piketty says that may not be true in the long run. PIKETTY: The key question is, is that going to last? So are we going to have an expanding middle class, in terms of wealth, or are we going to have a shrinking middle class? GOLDSTEIN: Piketty argues that unless there are some big policy changes, wealth is likely to become more and more concentrated among the very rich. Inheritance will become a bigger deal. And it'll be harder to get ahead by working. Jacob Goldstein, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  A few decades ago, inequality started rising in countries around the world.

I'm Robert Siegel in Washington. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block at member station KERA in Dallas. It looks like the U. S. job market has shaken off its winter chill. According to the government's monthly jobs report, employers added 192,000 jobs to their payrolls in March. That's just above the average for the past 12 month. NPR's John Ydstie has more. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There had been some concern that the weakness in the U. S. economy during the winter might be more than a weather-related swoon, but Jim O'Sullivan, chief U. S. economist at High Frequency Economics, says this report should ease those concerns. JIM O'SULLIVAN: From a growth perspective, it was a pretty positive report. I mean, I think when you look at the average for payrolls for the first quarter, 178,000 per month including the revisions to January and February, I mean, those are pretty good gains. YDSTIE: Despite the relatively strong job growth in March, the unemployment rate remained at 6. 7 percent. That's partly because the number of workers in the labor force jumped by half a million last month. That's a positive sign, says chief White House economist Jason Fuhrman. JASON FUHRMAN: That's part of a general pattern that as the economy strengthens, you'll see some people coming back looking for jobs and that's a good thing. YDSTIE: The U. S. job market also passed an important milestone in March: the total number of workers on private employer payrolls passed 116 million. That exceeds the previous record set before the great recession, says former Federal Reserve governor Randall Kroszner. RANDALL KROSZNER: After five long years, we've finally gotten back to where we were five or six years ago. That suggests that we have made progress, but this has been very slow and painful progress. YDSTIE: Kroszner, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, says it's taken so long partly because of the extraordinary depth of the recession, the budget cuts and tax hikes that Washington imposed on the economy, and uncertainty among employers surrounding the Affordable Care Act. One measure of the continued stress in the labor market is the number of people working part time who want a full time job. That number increased by 225,000 in March. Kroszner points out that Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that situation justifies continued Fed support for the economy. KROSZNER: The data in this report on part time employees would suggest that it's going to be a long time before we see the Fed raise interest rates. YDSTIE: John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

S. economist at High Frequency Economics, says from a growth perspective, it was a pretty good report. JIM O'SULLIVAN: When you look at the average for payrolls for the first quarter - 178,000 per month, including the revisions to January to February - I mean, those are pretty good gains. YDSTIE: O'Sullivan says the  unemployment rate did not tick down - as expected - because the labor force increased by half a million people. That suggests discouraged workers returning to the workforce because they see better prospects for getting a job. But O'Sullivan believes the unemployment rate will continue to decline steadily this year, as growth improves. One reason for that improvement, he says, is less drag from policies coming out of Washington. O'SULLIVAN: I think the biggest change, compared with a year ago, is the fading of fiscal drag. Certainly in early 2013, you had a tax hike and of course, with the sequester as well so certainly, fiscal policy was quite negative for growth. YDSTIE: O'Sullivan also thinks the consumer will play a more positive role this year. Although the average hourly wage slipped a penny in March, O'Sullivan says real income has been growing moderately. In addition, consumers are feeling wealthier because of rising home prices and a big run-up in the stock market. He says that should boost consumer spending, and support an increase in overall economic growth to around 3 percent this year. O'Sullivan says today's report is also a win-win report from the perspective of the financial markets. O'SULLIVAN: In the sense that it's actually a pretty good growth signal from the report but at the same time, it's not very threatening from an inflation perspective. So it kind of keeps the fed at bay. YDSTIE: O'Sullivan expects the Fed to continue dialing back its bond-buying stimulus program, but to keep its benchmark interest rate low into next year. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And we have some new jobs numbers this morning. The U. S. economy, we're told, added 192,000 jobs in March. That's according to the federal government, which also says the unemployment rate held steady - 6. 7 percent.

I'm Kelly McEvers. Yesterday, I did what a lot of people here in Southern California do every day: I got in my car and hit the freeway. So here we are. We are about to cross the county line from Los Angeles County into San Bernardino County. The reason we're doing this drive is it's a well-worn path. More people moved from L. A. County to San Bernardino County over the last decade than any other county-to-county pair in the whole country - tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands. It's something that's happening all over the country. In the places with the most economic opportunity, housing prices are too high. So now, instead of moving toward the good jobs, sometimes people have to move away from them. It's our cover story today: Americans on the move in the wrong direction. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MCEVERS: When we finally get to San Bernardino, we drive to a complex of two-story apartment buildings built in the '60s or '70s, peeling yellow paint surrounded by a 10-foot high security gate with spikes on top. Jamika takes us up to her balcony. So cool. So how long have you been in this place (unintelligible)? JAMIKA: I've been here - it's going on a year now. MCEVERS: Jamika is 28. She says she doesn't want to use her full name, doesn't want too many people to know about her situation. She says she grew up in a rented house in South Central L. A. The house was foreclosed on, and she and her siblings had to move out. Money was tight, so Jamika moved here to the inland empire. People call it the IE. JAMIKA: So my older sister was already out here. Then me and my other sister came out here. My brother slowly came out here. And then my other brother came out here, but he went straight to a house, because that's what he can afford. He can do all that stuff. And then my other sister, she's the only one who stays out in Los Angeles still, in her home that she has. So. . . MCEVERS: So out of how many siblings, one stayed? JAMIKA: Out of - yes. Five that's all in the IE, and one is still out there. MCEVERS: Jamika says she probably won't go back to L. A. JAMIKA: Yeah, I missed it when I was younger. But right now, I'm on my grown woman status - job, car, house, well, apartment. So I'm good. MCEVERS: Jamika works in food service at a nearby hospital. She doesn't want to say how much she pays in rent. She does say it's public housing. Neighbors make about $700 a month and pay one to $200 in rent. Jamika says here, she actually can save some money. No way she could do that in L. A. JAMIKA: Yeah. I have another friend here who lived in Los Angeles who moved out here. I don't know if you'd want to talk to her. MCEVERS: Sure. JAMIKA: Tamia. MCEVERS: Inside Jamika's apartment, her friend Tamia says she also moved to San Bernardino from L. A. So do two other ladies we meet outside. Census data suggests tens of thousands of people have made this move. IRS returns say it could be hundreds of thousands. To know how cheap San Bernardino is, look on Craigslist. Two bedroom apartments here are as cheap as 700 bucks a month. And to buy a house, the median home price in San Berdoo is just $173,000. In L. A. , it's nearly three times that. So it makes sense that people would move here to save money on housing. But what does the city have to offer? JIM MULVIHILL: You know, San Bernardino's bankrupt. The city's bankrupt. MCEVERS: Standing out in front of city hall, city councilman Jim Mulvihill tells me San Bernardino's not in the best shape right now. MULVIHILL: Because of that, we've cut back. We had 340 on our police force. Now, we're down about 240. And given all that, we've got a high crime rate, had lot of shootings. So people are concerned. MCEVERS: Jim used to be a professor of urban planning at Cal State San Bernardino. He says there are two kinds of people who move here from L. A. County. The first because. . . MULVIHILL: They've got a job. They work in L. A. , or they work in Los Angeles. But the point is they want to buy a house, and, you know, they're not quite up to the income level. And so, you know, the realtors always talking about you drive until you qualify. MCEVERS: One to two hours each way, and that's if you have a job when you leave L. A. County. For people who come here without a job, Jim says the options are not good. MULVIHILL: And you're going to make a - up to the light, you'll make a right. MCEVERS: Driving around town, Jim says like so many American cities, San Bernardino used to be a place for middle-class jobs. A big steel plant employed tens of thousands of people until it closed in the '80s. And then. . . MULVIHILL: Norton Air Force Base closed up in the early '90s. And at Norton, there was about 10,000 civilian jobs and about 6,000 military people. And so the city lost all those. MCEVERS: Jim Mulvihill says the jobs that are available are low-wage jobs. The local casino, food service jobs like the one Jamika has, and one of San Bernardino's biggest industries. . . MULVIHILL: A lot of warehouses. MCEVERS: . . . for retailers like Amazon. So even though people are saving money on housing here, they're making less money than they might in L. A. , where there are more and better paying jobs. It's a phenomenon we're seeing across the U. S. , says writer Timothy Noah, and not just in the expensive places we all know, like San Francisco, New York and Boston. TIMOTHY NOAH: Maryland is not a place where you'll find many millionaires or billionaires, but it is a place where you'll find an awful lot of highly paid lawyers. So it has the highest median income in the country, and yet for most of the last 20 years, more people who've moved out of Maryland than into it. MCEVERS: Because, you know, you would think that these boom towns - San Francisco, Boston - I mean, the idea is that if you build a tech company, there's got to be somebody to build the building, to clean the building, I mean, that it creates jobs. Is it that the jobs are there, but people can't afford to stay and do the jobs? NOAH: Yeah. I mean, it's unbelievable. The local business press in San Francisco quoted a guy named David Hayes, who's the CEO of Skyline Construction. And he said his biggest challenge was recruiting. And he said: We started relocating candidates from Southern California and recruiting out-of-state candidates. He said that they've even started asking retired workers to re-enter the workforce. It's a vicious circle. People can't afford to move to these places, and then you can't find or you struggle to find people to build what housing does get constructed. MCEVERS: I want to go back to our example, the example of moving from L. A. to San Bernardino. What could be done to fix that problem? I mean, you're saying that it's a housing issue, right? NOAH: It's one of two ways. You have to tackle the housing problem, but you also have to tackle the inequality problem. There are a lot of people who think they don't need to worry about income inequality. But to the extent that it is choking the avenue towards economic growth and towards economic opportunity, they do need to worry about it. And this seems to me a good example where it is blocking a pathway to opportunity. All economies rely on migration as a way to grow. People need to be able to pick up and go to where the jobs are. Jobs don't stay in one place forever. To the extent that that isn't happening, the economy is going to stagnate. And, gee, guess what, our economy is stagnating right now. MCEVERS: Timothy Noah is a writer. His most recent book covers income inequality. It's called \"The Great Divergence. \" KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West.

What's called high frequency trading has been getting renewed attention thanks to \"Flash Boys,\" the latest book from Michael Lewis. In that book, he argues the changes have created a lot of new problems. We're going to take a look now at why. The surge in high frequency trading has its roots in regulation passed in 2005. NPR's Jim Zarroli says the changes were supposed to benefit investors, but they've had some unintended consequences. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The changes approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission nine years ago were aimed at promoting competition in the stock market and in the process dragging it into the electronic age. Here was SEC commissioner Harvey Goldschmid. HARVEY GOLDSCHMID: The packet of proposals before us today can accurately be described as the most significant modernization of the national market system since the original rules were adopted by this commission in 1975. ZARROLI: At the time, stock trading was still dominated by the NYSC and NASDAQ, but new electronic exchanges were starting up. Those new exchanges could often give investors a better price. The new SEC regulations said that when a stock exchange got an order, it had to find the best possible price for the investor. Chester Spatt is a former SEC economist now at Carnegie Melon University. CHESTER SPATT: You have to basically go around and look and see is anybody bettering the price that I'm prepared to offer. And only once I do that can I then execute the rest of the customer's order. ZARROLI: Under the new electronic trading systems, orders could be processed in a flash, and Spatt says that put a big premium on speed. SPATT: You had to basically be certified as fast if you were going to have access to all of this and if you were going to be a serious player, you had to be fast. And this really forced the NYSC to change the way it did business. ZARROLI: Soon new exchanges were sprouting up everywhere. Today, when an investor places an order, it may get rooted through dozens of exchanges, trading platforms and private markets called dark pools and over time, traders have been able to exploit the links among the exchanges. They've figured out ways to peer into the other exchanges, see what trades are coming up and then take advantage of them using ultra fast computer networks. Eric Hunsader is the founder of Nanex. ERIC HUNSADER: And that's where the speed advantages come into play because the high frequency traders are able to detect part of that order, execute it on one exchange and before that smart order router can get the bulk to the rest of those orders to the other exchanges, they've already adjust their prices. ZARROLI: Critics say these changes have ended up costing investors money and increasing volatility in the market. High frequency trading firms dispute that, but even within the industry, there's a sense it might be time to pause for a breath. Peter Nabicht is with the Modern Markets Initiative, an industry group. PETER NABICHT: We've got the data. I think we need to take a very good look at what's worked and what hasn't. ZARROLI: In fact, the SEC has begun a review of stock market structure to better understand the changes taking place. It's looking into something called regulation NMS, the 40-year-old set of rules that government market structure. Eric Hunsader, a long-time critic of high frequency trading, says the SEC doesn't need new regulations. It just needs to better enforce the ones it has. HUNSADER: If we had followed that, things would be a lot better than they are today. We haven't really had a chance to see reg NMS in action because the regulators not doing their job.

If we look at the securities and investment banking industries, fewer than 1 in 5 executive officers or managers is a woman. At Fortune 500 companies, women hold just 17 percent of the seats on boards. And of those 500 companies, only 23 have a female CEO. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: So the odds can be against women, but Sallie Krawcheck bucked the odds. She was president of global wealth and investment management for Bank of America, overseeing trillions of dollars in assets. Before that, she had a similar role at what was then Smith Barney. But corporate turnovers and personnel changes got her unceremoniously pushed out of both positions. So Wall Street lost one of its few women at the top. GREENE: As part of our series on women and wealth, we wanted to learn what this former CEO observed about gender and money on Wall Street. Krawcheck told us that she often turns to research, which suggests that a diverse group tends to make different decisions than, for instance, a group of male, Ivy League-educated quantitative analysts - or quants. SALLIE KRAWCHECK: Those are smart people. But adding one more Ivy League-educated math quant into a room, will that help a team be more efficient, be more productive, be more successful? And the answer's no. And so there is something inherent in diversity of thinking, of experience and of background and indeed, of skin color and of gender. There is something about that diversity that leads to innovation, better returns, lower risk. And for women in particular, a recent piece of research showed on average, when men enter a negotiation, they're focused on coming out the other side winning. And when women enter a negotiation, they're more focused on coming out the other side with the relationship intact. GREENE: Well, take me into a specific case. KRAWCHECK: I will tell you my own story. Going into and during the downturn, I ran Smith Barney. We had, as an institution, sold our clients investment products that we firmly believed were low-risk. Well, it turned out they weren't, and that when the market cracked and crashed, these products - which were supposed to, in theory, go down a few cents on the dollar - went down most of their cents on the dollars. I took the stance, for which I lost my job, that we should partially reimburse our clients, and had a fight within the organization for it. We eventually did partially reimburse our clients, but I was stripped of my responsibility. If you had asked me at that point in time: Sallie, did you get fired because you're a woman? I would have said, what? what? Are you kidding me? Absolutely not. And as I've started to say, my thinking in reviewing the research now is, well, maybe. You know, the research tells me these are characteristics and qualities that a woman exhibits, and I was fired for it. So look - what I can tell you is that that debate that we had within that company was a very healthy debate. We may or may not have come out to the right or wrong place, but having that clash of ideas where I had a perspective, other folks had a perspective, I think we all want that in business, and we particularly want that on Wall Street. GREENE: Has there ever been a really big, important financial deal that was brought together by two women? KRAWCHECK: I'm pausing. I cannot. Well, you know, look. We just haven't had enough women in senior roles on Wall Street overall; fewer women in the investment banking function overall as well. GREENE: Sallie Krawcheck is trying to get more women into senior roles on Wall Street and in other industries. She's invested in a networking enterprise bringing together high-profile women in business. It's called 85 Broads. The name refers to the address of Goldman Sachs - 85 Broad Street in Manhattan. That's where the women who started the group worked in the late 1990s. Eighty-five Broads is considering a name change now that it has some 30,000 members in industries ranging from investment banking to marketing and law. We asked Sallie Krawcheck why women need this professional group. KRAWCHECK: These women come together because they have intuitively recognized the research that says the No. 1 unwritten rule of success in business is networking - not the schmoozing networking but the having information, knowing people. And I sort of think about it as stuff I want to know that can help me in business and life, that my company isn't providing for me. So we do online education seminars on things like, how do you ask for a raise; how do you get on a board; how do you pivot into public service. And what is really interesting, and what really spoke to me about the network, is that the women who have joined our network have lower attrition rates from the work force than the average for the professional woman. So there's something that's happening in the network by bringing together these like-minded individuals, that's helping these women in their careers. GREENE: You wrote, recently, that the best investment a woman can make is to ask for a raise. KRAWCHECK: I did. GREENE: And you sort of offered a case study about what happens when they don't make that investment. Walk me through that, if you can. KRAWCHECK: I've managed many people in my career. I've managed very diverse teams. And it's interesting because what I've found over time is that when it would come to bonus time or raise time, I would hear from the gentlemen, I want to make X. I don't think I ever heard from a woman who worked for me, I want to make X. GREENE: Ever? KRAWCHECK: Ever. Ever. GREENE: That's pretty stunning. KRAWCHECK: It is. It is. And research shows men ask, and women don't. So, we've got two employees. Let's call them Joe and Joanne, right? And Joe and Joanne are both set to make $5 in a bonus, let's say. GREENE: OK. KRAWCHECK: Now, Joe comes into my office, and Joe says, hey Sallie - you know - I really think I've had a great year, I'd like to make 10 this year. After Joe leaves, I call my head of HR and we sort of say, can you believe this? Joe wants to make 10; he's in for 5; ha, ha, ha. Well, time goes by. It's time to put those numbers on a piece of paper. And we start to look and say, look, we don't want to lose him. Let's put him in for 7. Right? OK. So, we've done that. Now, what does Joanne make? GREENE: She gets the 5. KRAWCHECK: Wrong. She gets 3 - because the bonus pool doesn't go up. Bonus pool is 10 - 5 and 5. She didn't ask for anything. So, they're both in for 5, he asks for 10; we give him 7. GREENE: She sees her bonus actually reduced. KRAWCHECK: That's exactly right. GREENE: And what does this create over time if this goes on, and women don't start asking for raises more often? KRAWCHECK: Forget about over time, 'cause it's happening right now. What you hear and what the research shows is that gentlemen negotiate for their first job. Women do not negotiate from their first job and on. And I tell women, there is no HR fairy godmother. There might be, but you better not count on it. And so you need to be very fact-based, very clear - just as the gentlemen are - what you're delivering, and what your expectations are. If you're not, you're losing. GREENE: Sallie Krawcheck is the head of soon-to-be-renamed 85 Broads, a global professional women's network. This has been a real pleasure. Thanks for talking to us. KRAWCHECK: Oh, I've loved doing it. Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: Now, we also asked Sallie Krawcheck to share a lesson that she's learned about money, and you can read her advice on NPR's She Works Tumblr. More from our series tomorrow. NPR's Planet Money takes a deeper look at how women fare when they negotiate for higher pay. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: This is NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  America's financial sector is dominated by men. If we look at the securities and investment banking industries, fewer than 1 in 5 executive officers or managers is a woman. At Fortune 500 companies, women hold just 17 percent of the seats on boards. And of those 500 companies, only 23 have a female CEO. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  So the odds can be against women, but Sallie Krawcheck bucked the odds. She was president of global wealth and investment management for Bank of America, overseeing trillions of dollars in assets. Before that, she had a similar role at what was then Smith Barney. But corporate turnovers and personnel changes got her unceremoniously pushed out of both positions. So Wall Street lost one of its few women at the top. GREENE: As part of our series on women and wealth, we wanted to learn what this former CEO observed about gender and money on Wall Street. Krawcheck told us that she often turns to research, which suggests that a diverse group tends to make different decisions than, for instance, a group of male, Ivy League-educated quantitative analysts - or quants. SALLIE KRAWCHECK: Those are smart people. But adding one more Ivy League-educated math quant into a room, will that help a team be more efficient, be more productive, be more successful? And the answer's no. And so there is something inherent in diversity of thinking, of experience and of background and indeed, of skin color and of gender. There is something about that diversity that leads to innovation, better returns, lower risk. And for women in particular, a recent piece of research showed on average, when men enter a negotiation, they're focused on coming out the other side winning.

I'm Michel Martin.  We'd like to start the program today by talking about an issue that's been a hot topic on Capitol Hill lately. That issue is pay equity. The Democrats have been trying to push legislation through Congress to address what they say is a gender wage gap where women earn less than men for the same work. Yesterday, President Obama signed two orders aimed at closing that gap. One will require federal contractors to disclose information about employee compensation to the Labor Department in broad categories by race and sex. Another will allow employees to discuss compensation with coworkers without retaliation. Here's a clip of the president's remarks. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Today, the average full-time working woman earns just 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. For African-American women, Latinas - it's even less. And in 2014, that's an embarrassment. It is wrong. And this is not just an issue of fairness, it's also a family issue and an economic issue because women make up about half of our work force. MARTIN: Here to tell us more about what these orders could mean going forward is Joe Davidson. He writes the Federal Diaries column for the Washington Post. He's with us from his newsroom. Joe, thanks for joining us once again. JOE DAVIDSON: Thank you. MARTIN: Also joining us is Romina Boccia. She looks at federal budgetary affairs for the Heritage Foundation. That's a conservative research and policy organization. She's also with us from the studios at her office. Romina, thank you for joining us as well. ROMINA BOCCIA: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So just - Joe, let's just start with you. This does not affect the entire work force in the country, correct? This is only federal contractors. DAVIDSON: That's correct. There's legislation on the hill that would do what these - what this executive order and these presidential memorandums seek to do for companies and other organizations. But what the president did yesterday applies only to federal contractors, however that's not necessarily a small group. The reach of federal contractors really extends throughout the economy. And so it is not insignificant. MARTIN: Why does the president say this is necessary? Is there some data to show that women even doing the same work in the same job categories are being paid less than men? DAVIDSON: Yes, there is data on that. The figure that the White House uses - that women make 77 cents for every dollar that men make - the Department of Labor uses the figure 81 cents, but those figures are in dispute. They are aggregate figures and they don't look at really occupation by occupation, which I think is really the point. But if you do look at the Labor Department data, they have a report out called \"Highlights of Women's Earnings. \" The last one was in 2012. And they do break it down by education. So for example, management professional and related occupations, that's the first line in this report, that indicates that women's earning are 71. 6 percent of men's earnings. And so when you break it down like that, I think you get a more accurate picture than what either the 77 percent figure or the 81 percent figure provides. MARTIN: Why is the president taking this route? I understand that, as we mentioned earlier, the Democrats are pushing a Paycheck Fairness Act which you said would be more broadly applied. So why is the president taking this course of action now? DAVIDSON: Well, he has the ability to do this for federal contractors by executive action. But it takes legislative action to do it across-the-board - excuse me - and that legislation has been stalled on the Hill. The Republicans don't like it, as the Republicans - as the president pointed out yesterday. He cited them - the Republican party specifically. And so it's stalled. And so this is his quote, year of action, and when he finds that he can't get things through Congress that he wants to do, he will do them by executive action to the extent that he's able. MARTIN: Joe, I'm going to ask you to standby because we're not asking you here to defend the president's conduct or his actions or his point of view here, just to explain it to us. But there is another point of view on this, and Republicans have been very vocal in opposing this particular direction. So I'm going to bring in Romina and ask you - you say these orders do more harm than good. Explain that point of view. BOCCIA: So first of all, it's important to recognize there's two orders. The first one actually doesn't do anything new. It's more of the political messaging device because workers actually already have the right to discuss their own salaries and benefits with their coworkers. But workers are protected from having other coworkers disclose their salaries in a public fashion that they might not agree with, like posting it on Facebook if they don't want that. So that executive order doesn't do a whole lot. It's more messaging than anything. The other one, however, is a bit more troubling. Now what it would do is it would require that federal contractors supply the Labor Department with more information on their employees, including by sex and race. Now that, on the face of it, doesn't sound like it could be too harmful. But I think what the White House also learned the hard way is that these summary statistics can be very misleading. And they can imply discrimination where none exists, like the White House found that it's now being accused of paying its women 88 cents on the dollar for men. Once again, looking at this very misleading aggregate statistic and not accounting for important factors like. . . MARTIN: But what the Heritage Foundation - excuse me. Can I just ask you, Romina? The Heritage Foundation is one of the groups that distributed that information. So if you felt that it was misleading, why do it? BOCCIA: So the information actually came from the American Enterprise Institute and what it looks at is it does the same analysis as the 70 cent to the dollar statistic does. It just takes the median woman, compares it to the median man and doesn't account for any of the important factors that go into to what people earn, including what occupation they choose, how much education they have, how many hours they spent on the job, how much time they spent in the work force. And I think one of the great studies that the Labor Department did on this looked at 50 period reviewed academic studies and they concluded that the differences in the compensation in men and women are pretty much the result of many different factors. And discrimination, if anything, plays a very, very small role. MARTIN: Well, let me ask you this, Romina, then. Wouldn't that be an argument for more reporting, not less so that you could determine those questions at a more granular level? BOCCIA: So there is reporting out there. The risk with these new requirement that the Labor Department would impose for now just on federal workers but which the Paycheck Fairness Act would extend to all employers is that when businesses have Uncle Sam scouring over their employee composition, looking at things like race and gender, and trying to draw conclusions from that that may not necessarily have anything to do with discrimination but other factors, what it does is it encourages employers to adopt more rigid pay structures. And that can mean less flexible working conditions, which will particularly hurt parents and working moms. It also can mean fewer - less performance-based pay, fewer bonuses or raises for performance. Because if you pay everyone the same, and you don't pay them based on performance or try to encourage them with a spot bonus, for example, or give them specific conditions that they appreciate, like being able to leave at 4 o'clock to see their son's soccer game, you can more easily justify paying everyone the same. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about two executive orders signed by President Obama yesterday that address issues of unequal pay for federal contract workers. We're talking about this with Romina Boccia of the Heritage Foundation. That's a conservative research and a policy organization that is critical of this effort. And Joe Davidson of the Washington Post, who's been reporting on this, is also with us to explain more. So, Joe, let me go back to you on that. I mean, presumably, the White House has heard these arguments. And what has their response been to that? DAVIDSON: Well, they say that these two executive actions are necessary in order to promote equal pay for equal work. I think they're well aware that they will take fire and have been taking fire from the right on this. And some of that is due to these aggregate stats that they're using, like the 77 percent, which is certainly, I think, open to criticism. I also think, however, that those on the right, Republicans who attack this, need to tread very carefully because it's difficult for them if they're going to sound like they are against equal pay for equal work. And of course they say they are not. But in this political climate, the Republicans have made a point to try to improve their image, if you will, in a number of ways. And certainly among the female voters is one of those ways. And so to the extent they come out vigorously against this, I think they risk hurting themselves politically. MARTIN: Joe, I have one more question for you. But I want to back to Romina on this just for one more question. Is there a better idea? Do conservatives have a better idea about encouraging federal contractors or other employers, for that matter, to offer competitive pay, but also ensure that women and other groups are treated fairly? BOCCIA: So there are protections in place. They have been for the past 50 years. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 is a great example of this. But I think what is most empowering to women and men in the workforce is to have more opportunities, greater opportunities. So the first thing is that Washington should do no more harm and not discourage employers - accommodating, for example, their female employees who may desire more flexible working conditions or more benefits and then make these trade-offs. The risk that we face now is that Washington is overshooting. I think it's very important to recognize equal pay for equal work and to make sure that women are respected in the workforce. And I think they are, and we've made great strides. And now, I'm actually more afraid that we're going to do more harm by reducing opportunities. MARTIN: OK. BOCCIA: And I think the best leverage a woman can have to negotiate for higher pay is to have another job opportunity. MARTIN: OK. Let me just go give Joe Davidson one more question. This is something that you wrote about, that the president has, to this point, been asked to sign a similar order banning discrimination against gays and lesbians in the federal workforce. DAVIDSON: Right. MARTIN: He has declined to do that. Why is that? DAVIDSON: You know, that's a mystery because - it's a mystery because he's done - he's really had a very good record when it comes to gays and lesbians and public policy. He was against DOMA, which prohibited recognition on the federal level of gays' and lesbians' marriages. So he's taken a much more controversial stance on behalf of public policies that would benefit gays and lesbians. So why he is hesitant about issuing an executive order that would prohibit discrimination by contractors against gays and lesbians and bisexuals and transgenders, it's a mystery to everyone I've talked to. And when I talk with the White House about it, press them on it, they really don't offer any explanation that's concrete. So the answer to your question is, it's a mystery. MARTIN: Joe Davidson writes the Federal Diaries column for the Washington Post. He was kind enough to join us from the studios there. Romina Boccia is a fellow with the Heritage Foundation. She focuses on federal budgetary matters. She joined us from the studios at the Heritage Foundation. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. DAVIDSON: Thank you. BOCCIA: Thank you.

And discrimination, if anything, plays a very, very small role. MARTIN: Well, let me ask you this, Romina, then. Wouldn't that be an argument for more reporting, not less so that you could determine those questions at a more granular level? BOCCIA: So there is reporting out there. The risk with these new requirement that the Labor Department would impose for now just on federal workers but which the Paycheck Fairness Act would extend to all employers is that when businesses have Uncle Sam scouring over their employee composition, looking at things like race and gender, and trying to draw conclusions from that that may not necessarily have anything to do with discrimination but other factors, what it does is it encourages employers to adopt more rigid pay structures. And that can mean less flexible working conditions, which will particularly hurt parents and working moms. It also can mean fewer - less performance-based pay, fewer bonuses or raises for performance. Because if you pay everyone the same, and you don't pay them based on performance or try to encourage them with a spot bonus, for example, or give them specific conditions that they appreciate, like being able to leave at 4 o'clock to see their son's soccer game, you can more easily justify paying everyone the same. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about two executive orders signed by President Obama yesterday that address issues of unequal pay for federal contract workers. We're talking about this with Romina Boccia of the Heritage Foundation. That's a conservative research and a policy organization that is critical of this effort. And Joe Davidson of the Washington Post, who's been reporting on this, is also with us to explain more. So, Joe, let me go back to you on that. I mean, presumably, the White House has heard these arguments. And what has their response been to that? DAVIDSON: Well, they say that these two executive actions are necessary in order to promote equal pay for equal work. I think they're well aware that they will take fire and have been taking fire from the right on this. And some of that is due to these aggregate stats that they're using, like the 77 percent, which is certainly, I think, open to criticism. I also think, however, that those on the right, Republicans who attack this, need to tread very carefully because it's difficult for them if they're going to sound like they are against equal pay for equal work. And of course they say they are not. But in this political climate, the Republicans have made a point to try to improve their image, if you will, in a number of ways. And certainly among the female voters is one of those ways. And so to the extent they come out vigorously against this, I think they risk hurting themselves politically. MARTIN: Joe, I have one more question for you. But I want to back to Romina on this just for one more question. Is there a better idea? Do conservatives have a better idea about encouraging federal contractors or other employers, for that matter, to offer competitive pay, but also ensure that women and other groups are treated fairly? BOCCIA: So there are protections in place. They have been for the past 50 years. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 is a great example of this. But I think what is most empowering to women and men in the workforce is to have more opportunities, greater opportunities. So the first thing is that Washington should do no more harm and not discourage employers - accommodating, for example, their female employees who may desire more flexible working conditions or more benefits and then make these trade-offs. The risk that we face now is that Washington is overshooting. I think it's very important to recognize equal pay for equal work and to make sure that women are respected in the workforce. And I think they are, and we've made great strides. And now, I'm actually more afraid that we're going to do more harm by reducing opportunities. MARTIN: OK. BOCCIA: And I think the best leverage a woman can have to negotiate for higher pay is to have another job opportunity. MARTIN: OK. Let me just go give Joe Davidson one more question. This is something that you wrote about, that the president has, to this point, been asked to sign a similar order banning discrimination against gays and lesbians in the federal workforce. DAVIDSON: Right. MARTIN: He has declined to do that. Why is that? DAVIDSON: You know, that's a mystery because - it's a mystery because he's done - he's really had a very good record when it comes to gays and lesbians and public policy. He was against DOMA, which prohibited recognition on the federal level of gays' and lesbians' marriages. So he's taken a much more controversial stance on behalf of public policies that would benefit gays and lesbians. So why he is hesitant about issuing an executive order that would prohibit discrimination by contractors against gays and lesbians and bisexuals and transgenders, it's a mystery to everyone I've talked to. And when I talk with the White House about it, press them on it, they really don't offer any explanation that's concrete. So the answer to your question is, it's a mystery. MARTIN: Joe Davidson writes the Federal Diaries column for the Washington Post. He was kind enough to join us from the studios there. Romina Boccia is a fellow with the Heritage Foundation. She focuses on federal budgetary matters. She joined us from the studios at the Heritage Foundation. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. DAVIDSON: Thank you.

For the first time since it was bailed out four years ago, Greece is dipping its toe back into the global capital market place. Greece today began selling long-term bonds to raise money from investors, and the government says there were more buyers than bonds. Greece has suffered terribly during its economic collapse, and early this morning, a car bomb went off in Athens outside of Bank of Greece Building. No injuries and no claim of responsibility, so far. But for more about today's bond sale and what it means for Greece, we've reached Nick Malkoutzis in Athens. He's the editor of Macropolis, a Greek economic and political website. Nick, good morning. NICK MALKOUTZIS: Good morning to you. GREENE: So explain to me what this milestone actually means - that the government is able to sell bonds to investors? MALKOUTZIS: Well, I think it's exactly what you mentioned, it's a milestone. It's almost four years to the day since Greece was shut out of international capital markets because interest rates on its bonds just shot up incredibly because people no longer had confidence in Greece being able to repay its debt. And that's how this whole story began, the bailout, the economic crisis and this is, if you like, a steppingstone towards Greece exiting these terrible four, five years that's its gone through. It's by no means the end of it, but it's certainly an important point along the way. It's going to be borrowing from international markets as soon as there's some more confidence in the Greek economy and that it can move on from this point. GREENE: Well, what happens next? Once this debt, these bonds, are sold, where does the money the government will get from the sale actually go? MALKOUTZIS: Well, that's a good question because the peculiar thing in this case, is even by the admission of the Greek finance minister, that Greece doesn't actually need to borrow this money. It has a primary surplus, which means that it's earning more in revenue than it's paying out. It's repaying its debt towards the E. U. and the IMF. But what the government wants to do at this point is show that it's regained the confidence of international investors. There is also a technical aspect to this, in that it believes by reentering the bond markets, it can help bring down the yield, the interest rate on its shorter term borrowing, on its T bills(ph). And the government believes that this will save several hundred million euros a year. The counter argument, of course, to that is that by borrowing probably at an interest rate of around five percent, which is still very high for euros' own standards, although, much much lower than where Greek interest rates were below, it's going to be adding about 500 million euros of debt to its already huge debt pile over the next five years. GREENE: The debt pile, I mean, just one of the many problems the country's facing, there have been strikes in the country, anti-austerity strikes, unemployment is still really high. I mean, can you talk in general about the position of Greece today? Is it in a better economic position than four years ago? MALKOUTZIS: Yeah. You know, this is why it is important to put this return to bond market thing in context. By all means, it's a significant moment in this progression over the last few years, but by no means the end of the story. We're still in recession. We probably won't see the first signs of growth until later this year. Unemployment is around 28 percent. There's still a huge problem with the lack of liquidity in Greece businesses suffering, consumption is down, so there's still a lot of problems. And on a social level as well, around a third of Greek families are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is the highest in the E. U. So there's still a long way to go in the Greek story. And, you know, from the viewpoint of the man or woman on the street, this won't mean a great deal of difference to their daily lives. They'll be looking for job creation. They'll be looking for the tax breaks. They'll be looking for an increase in their incomes before they can really say yes, we're now seeing the actual signs of coming out of the crisis.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Volatile, that's the kind of week the stock market had. Investors sold off high-flying technology and biotech stocks. Weak bank earnings also added to the sour mix. The NASDAQ is down 8 percent from its peak this year. The S&P 500, it's off 4 percent. But as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, the sell-off hasn't triggered alarm and indicators for the broader economy are mostly positive. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Technology stocks started falling late last week. Then they rose back, only to crash again. Yesterday, the NASDAQ plunged more than 3 percent. That's its biggest one-day loss in more than two years. The strange thing is, though, that most of the economic news has been good, so what's with the falling stock prices? JULI NEIMANN: Well, we're into another period of time here where everybody's going to leave the trading day scratching their heads, wondering what in the heck happened here. ARNOLD: Juli Neimann is an analyst with Smith Moore and Company in St. Louis, Missouri. She says U. S. stock indexes rose 30 percent last year, and they can't keep rising like that, so. . . NEIMANN: Swings in volatility in the stock market typically are not present when the market's rising, which it has been, of course, since the fall of 2009. But now since 2014, it's been very choppy. ARNOLD: It's hard to know just what triggered this latest round of selling. It could be investors who are just taking some profits by selling stocks after a good run. David Kotak is chief economist at Cumberland Advisors. He says he's not seeing any signs of panic out there, and he's not worried. DAVID KOTAK: Markets can correct in an ongoing bull trend 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 percent at any time, for any reason, or no apparent reason. Markets do not move up in straight lines. ARNOLD: Kotak agrees that we're not going to see anywhere near the stock gains we saw last year, but he thinks the overall trend will still be slowly up for some time to come. That's because he says the economy is continuing to slowly recover, even though he says people tend to hear about the couple of days where stocks see much more dramatic swings. KOTAK: The turtle never gets a lot of attention in a footrace. It's the rabbit that gets the attention. ARNOLD: To go with that analogy, the rabbit would be the leaping up and down movement of the stock market day to day, but the turtle is the trend line, and that's kind of where we're headed, is slowly up. KOTAK: Right, and that is what's going on in the United States in this gradual recovery. ARNOLD: And Kotak says given how bad the financial crisis was, the U. S. economy is actually in pretty good shape. KOTAK: Low interest rates, low inflation, gradual recovery, neutral central bank. It doesn't get better. ARNOLD: Still, everybody wishes the economy was recovering faster. Job growth especially has been painfully slow for the millions of Americans who are still out of work, and wages have been flat or worse for years. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

And yesterday, we heard some scary stuff from a few college graduates talking about their debt. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: About $92,000. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: My loans are about 35,000. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: It was well over $120,000. GREENE: They expect to spend years, even decades, paying back tens of thousands of dollars in student loans and it's keeping them from making some major life decisions. AMBER MICHAEL: Like getting married, having kids - those things would be great, but I'd like to be in a better financial position before we take those on. GREENE: That's Amber Michael. Like many graduates, Amber was a teenager when she went into debt. Today, high school seniors are facing that prospect. They need to let colleges know by May 1st whether they'll attend. And most of them will decide to take on student loans. The graduates we spoke all said that looking back they didn't know enough as teenagers to make such a big financial decision. Here's Jen McGarvey. JEN MCGARVEY: Had I had a little bit of counseling or somebody to really hone in on the magnitude on the amount of debt that I was tying myself to, I probably would have made some different decisions. GREENE: As we're about to learn, these graduates we interviewed are not alone. Many people faced with loan payments are feeling the impact today and making different life decisions because of it. And even if you don't have student loan debt, chances are you'll feel the effect of it in the broader U. S. economy. William Elliott directs the Assets and Education Initiative at the University of Kansas, and he believes the current college funding system depends far too much on loans taken out by students. WILLIAM ELLIOTT: Student loans are different than any kind of debt. While you're in college, you don't have to pay back the loans, right? In that sense, you don't feel them right away, you don't understand their magnitude and what they're going to cause.  You don't know what kind of job you're going to have afterwards. All these things can't be understood at the time of taking on the loans. And so it's not that student loans can't play a role, but right now they're making up too much of the financial aid package and they're too big of a part of how we finance college. GREENE: Several of these students said that they're at least thinking about the possibility of paying off these loans for 30, maybe even 40 years. How typical is that for this generation? ELLIOTT: It's extremely typical. I mean, that is pretty much the standard nowadays, is at the minimum 10 years, but really most people are looking at 20 to 30 years to pay off their student loan debt. 'Cause most people are facing, you know, 30,000 or more in student debt. So, it takes a while to pay that off. GREENE: To what extent do these loans haunt former students for many years or for the rest of their lives? ELLIOTT: Well, I think it's something, as far as research, is we're just starting to look at. And what our research has shown is people with outstanding student debt who've graduated from a four-year college have about 60 percent less net worth. They have about 40 percent less equity in their homes and they have about 52 percent less in retirement savings. They're better off than if they didn't go to college, but they're not doing nearly as well as they could be, and as their peers are doing, if they have no debt. GREENE: Is that in a way creating almost a new kind of have and have-not for this generation - young people who have student debt and those who don't have the debt to deal with? ELLIOTT: From my perception, certainly. Robert Hiltonsmith did a study on and he found that while students with college debt and without college debt start off at similar levels of income, by the time they're 40 they have less income if they have student debt. And what we've seen is that really that has to do with the fact that these people aren't investing in the kinds of assets that also produce income in the long run. So, they're not buying real estate, they're not buying stocks, they're not buying bonds. And so you have this large divide now between those who have debt and those who don't have debt. GREENE: What about the possible effect on the U. S. economy? I mean, I'm imagining a generation of people with more debt not spending money. I mean, and for many decades. And less money being spent in the economy can be a problem. ELLIOTT: I think it has a huge effect, potentially a huge effect, on the economy. If we know that people aren't accumulating assets and that the wealth gap is growing, partially because of student loans, that's going to have an effect on the overall economy. We need people to invest, we need people to have money, to be saving money. To build their assets so they can partake in the housing market, in other types of markets, to buy stocks, bonds. And so I think yes. I think it can potentially have a long-term effect. GREENE: Well, the president and many members of Congress have expressed a lot of concern about this. Are there changes in policy, ideas that you think might help sort of, you know, reduce the debt and give people these other options? ELLIOTT: Well, I think there's a number of options available to us. We can help children open up savings accounts and potentially match those accounts with a one-to-one match or higher - start thinking about savings, and for college, early on. Thinking about things like the Pell Grant. Why not make that an early investment in, say, fifth graders, so putting some percentage of the Pell Grant in their accounts so they can leverage that money? So, I think we need a long-term strategy, and saving would be one way of doing that. I also think that we need short-term strategies. One possibility is, right now when you're in school, it's not counted against your credit when you have student loans - but when you get out, it does. So, we're thinking about housing. Most people buy their housing around the age of 30. So, maybe we extend the range at which student loans aren't penalized against your credit report, and so you can have access to build some of these early assets. GREENE: Do colleges have a responsibility to get more information to students? I mean, to stress to them that they will have to pay this back at some point? ELLIOTT: I think colleges do. I think colleges have a responsibility to try to drive down costs as much as states do. And they have the responsibility to providing information. But I just think about my own situation. I still have lots of debt, but it doesn't matter how much information you give me about debt; given the options on the table, I was going to take on that debt because I'm still better off, I think, with the debt than without the debt. The question is about equity. Why should one person go to college, take on all kinds of amounts of debt, and still not be able to earn as much as other people earn? We need to create a system in which people can achieve similar types of outcomes if they have similar types of effort and ability. That's what makes our system work and what motivates people, is that belief that if they work hard and they have the ability - and one of the main paths is through education - they should be able to achieve similar outcomes as even those who are more advantaged. GREENE: Professor Elliott, it's really been a pleasure talking to you. Thanks for this. ELLIOTT: Thank you for having me. GREENE: William Elliott is an associate professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of Kansas. Now, for students picking a college this month, here's a little more advice. Scott Judith, a financial aid officer at Wellesley College, says don't just look at which aid offer is the biggest. For one thing, financial aid packages can be a mix of loans and also grants, which don't need to be paid back. SCOTT JUDITH: Some will be heavier in loans. Some will have no loans. And also the price of each institution is different. So, if you're looking at just the grant amount, at the final tally, the grant may not make the difference. It's the actual final cost. GREENE: Judith was talking to our college Michelle Martin on NPR's TELL ME MORE, which has also been taking a close look at how Americans pay for college. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: This is NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  We've been spending time, on the program, looking at how Americans are paying for college.

Here's Jen McGarvey. JEN MCGARVEY: Had I had a little bit of counseling or somebody to really hone in on the magnitude on the amount of debt that I was tying myself to, I probably would have made some different decisions. GREENE: As we're about to learn, these graduates we interviewed are not alone. Many people faced with loan payments are feeling the impact today and making different life decisions because of it. And even if you don't have student loan debt, chances are you'll feel the effect of it in the broader U. S. economy. William Elliott directs the Assets and Education Initiative at the University of Kansas, and he believes the current college funding system depends far too much on loans taken out by students. WILLIAM ELLIOTT: Student loans are different than any kind of debt. While you're in college, you don't have to pay back the loans, right? In that sense, you don't feel them right away, you don't understand their magnitude and what they're going to cause.  You don't know what kind of job you're going to have afterwards. All these things can't be understood at the time of taking on the loans. And so it's not that student loans can't play a role, but right now they're making up too much of the financial aid package and they're too big of a part of how we finance college. GREENE: Several of these students said that they're at least thinking about the possibility of paying off these loans for 30, maybe even 40 years. How typical is that for this generation? ELLIOTT: It's extremely typical. I mean, that is pretty much the standard nowadays, is at the minimum 10 years, but really most people are looking at 20 to 30 years to pay off their student loan debt. 'Cause most people are facing, you know, 30,000 or more in student debt. So, it takes a while to pay that off. GREENE: To what extent do these loans haunt former students for many years or for the rest of their lives? ELLIOTT: Well, I think it's something, as far as research, is we're just starting to look at. And what our research has shown is people with outstanding student debt who've graduated from a four-year college have about 60 percent less net worth. They have about 40 percent less equity in their homes and they have about 52 percent less in retirement savings. They're better off than if they didn't go to college, but they're not doing nearly as well as they could be, and as their peers are doing, if they have no debt. GREENE: Is that in a way creating almost a new kind of have and have-not for this generation - young people who have student debt and those who don't have the debt to deal with? ELLIOTT: From my perception, certainly. Robert Hiltonsmith did a study on and he found that while students with college debt and without college debt start off at similar levels of income, by the time they're 40 they have less income if they have student debt. And what we've seen is that really that has to do with the fact that these people aren't investing in the kinds of assets that also produce income in the long run. So, they're not buying real estate, they're not buying stocks, they're not buying bonds. And so you have this large divide now between those who have debt and those who don't have debt. GREENE: What about the possible effect on the U. S. economy? I mean, I'm imagining a generation of people with more debt not spending money. I mean, and for many decades. And less money being spent in the economy can be a problem. ELLIOTT: I think it has a huge effect, potentially a huge effect, on the economy. If we know that people aren't accumulating assets and that the wealth gap is growing, partially because of student loans, that's going to have an effect on the overall economy. We need people to invest, we need people to have money, to be saving money. To build their assets so they can partake in the housing market, in other types of markets, to buy stocks, bonds. And so I think yes. I think it can potentially have a long-term effect. GREENE: Well, the president and many members of Congress have expressed a lot of concern about this. Are there changes in policy, ideas that you think might help sort of, you know, reduce the debt and give people these other options? ELLIOTT: Well, I think there's a number of options available to us. We can help children open up savings accounts and potentially match those accounts with a one-to-one match or higher - start thinking about savings, and for college, early on. Thinking about things like the Pell Grant. Why not make that an early investment in, say, fifth graders, so putting some percentage of the Pell Grant in their accounts so they can leverage that money? So, I think we need a long-term strategy, and saving would be one way of doing that. I also think that we need short-term strategies. One possibility is, right now when you're in school, it's not counted against your credit when you have student loans - but when you get out, it does. So, we're thinking about housing. Most people buy their housing around the age of 30. So, maybe we extend the range at which student loans aren't penalized against your credit report, and so you can have access to build some of these early assets. GREENE: Do colleges have a responsibility to get more information to students? I mean, to stress to them that they will have to pay this back at some point? ELLIOTT: I think colleges do. I think colleges have a responsibility to try to drive down costs as much as states do. And they have the responsibility to providing information. But I just think about my own situation. I still have lots of debt, but it doesn't matter how much information you give me about debt; given the options on the table, I was going to take on that debt because I'm still better off, I think, with the debt than without the debt. The question is about equity. Why should one person go to college, take on all kinds of amounts of debt, and still not be able to earn as much as other people earn? We need to create a system in which people can achieve similar types of outcomes if they have similar types of effort and ability. That's what makes our system work and what motivates people, is that belief that if they work hard and they have the ability - and one of the main paths is through education - they should be able to achieve similar outcomes as even those who are more advantaged. GREENE: Professor Elliott, it's really been a pleasure talking to you. Thanks for this. ELLIOTT: Thank you for having me. GREENE: William Elliott is an associate professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of Kansas. Now, for students picking a college this month, here's a little more advice. Scott Judith, a financial aid officer at Wellesley College, says don't just look at which aid offer is the biggest. For one thing, financial aid packages can be a mix of loans and also grants, which don't need to be paid back. SCOTT JUDITH: Some will be heavier in loans. Some will have no loans. And also the price of each institution is different. So, if you're looking at just the grant amount, at the final tally, the grant may not make the difference. It's the actual final cost. GREENE: Judith was talking to our college Michelle Martin on NPR's TELL ME MORE, which has also been taking a close look at how Americans pay for college.

Now, for years, Britain has had controversial austerity measures in place. Olivier Blanchard, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist, likened them to playing with fire. This past week, the IMF published its World Economic Forecast and concluded the fastest-growing economy of any rich country in the world is Britain's. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, led the U. K. 's austerity measures. He didn't tell the IMF meeting in Washington, D. C. this week, I told you so, but he did say that the government's plan succeeded despite warnings from some. We're joined by Simon Johnson. He's a former IMF chief economist. Thanks so much for being with us. SIMON JOHNSON: My pleasure. SIMON: Did the IMF get it wrong? What do you make of these figures? JOHNSON: Well, certainly, on the narrow, specific and fair criteria of the forecast for growth of this year, the IMF has changed its mind. They've revised up the growth. They haven't completely thrown in the towel. Their forecast for the fourth quarter, on fourth quarter growth for next year is still quite low - only 1. 8 percent. But there's no question they've conceded that this year that they were wrong and the chancellor was right. SIMON: Help us understand those austerity measures because of course, we've seen segments of the Parliamentary debate here. And I'll encapsulate it in the simplest way. You have people in the Labour Party saying these cuts are draconian. They're ruining the vitality of our nation. And you have people in the Tory-Liberal coalition who are saying they're necessary and wise. JOHNSON: Well, that has been the debate. I think they - the cuts have been a little exaggerated in terms of their immediate impact. And I would also stress that the other half of macroeconomic policy, which is monetary policy, which is what the central bank does, the Bank of England, in that case, has been quite different from austerity. They've got their foot on the gas. So in this monetary policy versus fiscal policy, the easy credit is what has prevailed. The budget tightening, not so much. SIMON: So let's understand. There's the budget tightenings in the government budget, but on the other hand, access to capital has been freer? JOHNSON: Access to credit. . . SIMON: Yeah. JOHNSON: . . . So the interest rates, your ability to borrow. And the chancellor has put a lot of emphasis on providing credit to new home buyers. House prices are up quite steeply in some parts of the U. K. , which gives everyone a short-term feeling of prosperity, and maybe it encourages them to spend. Where that leads to five years down the road is another question. SIMON: What do you think politicians are going to make of this? And I mean in the U. S. as much as the U. K. JOHNSON: Well, it's interesting. A couple of years ago, the U. K. debate about austerity was quite relevant to the United States. Now I think it seems very distant. We've somewhat put our budget woes behind us. Now, I understand that there's no perfect long-term budget deal. SIMON: Yeah. JOHNSON: I don't think you get that in American politics. But the moment. . . SIMON: But the sequester has become a way of life, as opposed to something that we'll have to get rid of it as soon as we can get an agreement. JOHNSON: That's right. We have a very messy, you might even say disorganized, approach to fiscal policy in this country, no question. But the idea of massive additional budget cuts being needed or on anyone's immediate agenda, I think that has completely faded. Our economy is recovering. Our tax revenues are up. The budget spending has been tilted a little bit in terms of its future projections. So I think the U. K. debate will not resonate at this moment in the United States. SIMON: Well, what about in Europe, though? JOHNSON: Well, Europe has some other problems, very big problems, recovering from their own sovereign debt crisis. The growth forecast in Europe is still very weak. That's the IMF forecast and the European's own forecast. And now we have this new shadow of potential disruptions to gas supplies from Russia because of the Russia-Ukraine relationship. That's the new wildcard. And if the relationship with Russia gets worse and you get into any kind of tit-for-tat sanctions, it's the Europeans who are vulnerable to some sort of negative impact on their economy much more than, say, the United States. SIMON: How does the growth rate in Britain compare to that of the U. S. right now? JOHNSON: Well, the forecast for this year in the U. K. is higher than for the United States. But looking next year, looking to 2015, the IMF and other people are forecasting that the U. S. will pull ahead. So this moment of British leadership on the growth may be quite transitory.

I'm Audie Cornish. With tax day upon us once again, we're going to spend a few minutes talking about tax evasion. The United States and other countries are banding together to fight the use of illegal tax havens in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. It's harder now to avoid paying taxes but it's still happening. A study in the Journal of Finance looks at one particular kind of tax evasion called round-tripping. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, researchers believe it could be robbing the U. S. Treasury of billions of dollars in revenue. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The business of tax evasion is murky and hard to penetrate. There is of huge global industry of lawyers and accountants who help people pay taxes and it works in secret. Recently, MIT professor Michelle Hanlon and two colleagues set out to find out all they could about round-tripping. MICHELLE HANLON: Oh, I think it's a big problem in the U. S. tax system that individuals can evade taxes and that they try to do so offshore. So we just felt like it was a big policy issue actually to try to get a handle on how much this occurs, and whether we could track this down with data. ZARROLI: Round-tripping occurs when American citizens open bank accounts in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. They funnel money into the accounts and then use it to buy stocks and bonds back in the U. S. , which is why it's called round-tripping. HANLON: A U. S. individual would pretend essentially to be a foreign investor. So they would set up, say, a bank account or a shell corporation offshore and from that offshore location they would invest back in the U. S. ZARROLI: Normally, Hanlon says, American citizens are supposed to pay taxes on any profits they make. HANLON: But if they pretend they're foreign and don't report that they're U. S. , and don't report that income, then it's very hard for the tax authorities to catch that. ZARROLI: For a long time it's been nearly impossible to quantify round-tripping. E. J. Fagan, of Global Financial Integrity, says a lot of countries a refuse to tell the IRS anything about their U. S. customers. E. J. FAGAN: Very often a lot of these jurisdictions, places like, for example, Mauritius or the British Virgin Islands, they make the Cayman Islands look open and transparent. So very often it's hard to know where the assets are. ZARROLI: But Hanlon and her co-authors, Edward Maydew of the University of North Carolina and Jacob Thornock of the University of Washington, took a look at how much money has come into the country from places such as the Cayman Islands since 1984. The flow of money into the U. S. has from other countries has always been erratic and can be affected by a lot of different factors. But the researchers decided to look at what happened to the flow of money when the U. S. tax rate went up. HANLON: So when the U. S. tax rate goes up, we would expect that there'd be more tax evasion because the benefits to evading tax are greater. ZARROLI: At the same time the researchers looked at what happened to the flow of money in periods when the U. S. government was especially aggressive about catching tax evaders. HANLON: And we tested those two types of variables and we find pretty much exactly what you'd expect, that part of this data is due to tax evasion. ZARROLI: When U. S. taxes go up by one percent, the amount of money flowing into the U. S. from foreign tax havens increases by as much as 2. 8 percent, and the flow of money into the U. S. slows down when the IRS cracks down on tax cheats, like it's doing now. Tax attorney Jeff Kolodny of Cozen O'Connor says that isn't surprising. JEFF KOLODNY: It would make sense, I think, that as tax rates go up people are trying to find ways to shelter their income and maybe they're doing it in illegal ways. ZARROLI: The study's authors say it's pretty hard to calculate how much this is costing the Treasury. But they say if their numbers are right, the U. S. has lost as much as $27 billion in tax revenue since 2008. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. With tax day upon us once again, we're going to spend a few minutes talking about tax evasion. The United States and other countries are banding together to fight the use of illegal tax havens in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. It's harder now to avoid paying taxes but it's still happening. A study in the Journal of Finance looks at one particular kind of tax evasion called round-tripping. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, researchers believe it could be robbing the U. S. Treasury of billions of dollars in revenue. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The business of tax evasion is murky and hard to penetrate. There is of huge global industry of lawyers and accountants who help people pay taxes and it works in secret. Recently, MIT professor Michelle Hanlon and two colleagues set out to find out all they could about round-tripping. MICHELLE HANLON: Oh, I think it's a big problem in the U. S. tax system that individuals can evade taxes and that they try to do so offshore. So we just felt like it was a big policy issue actually to try to get a handle on how much this occurs, and whether we could track this down with data. ZARROLI: Round-tripping occurs when American citizens open bank accounts in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. They funnel money into the accounts and then use it to buy stocks and bonds back in the U. S. , which is why it's called round-tripping. HANLON: A U. S. individual would pretend essentially to be a foreign investor. So they would set up, say, a bank account or a shell corporation offshore and from that offshore location they would invest back in the U. S. ZARROLI: Normally, Hanlon says, American citizens are supposed to pay taxes on any profits they make. HANLON: But if they pretend they're foreign and don't report that they're U. S. , and don't report that income, then it's very hard for the tax authorities to catch that. ZARROLI: For a long time it's been nearly impossible to quantify round-tripping. E. J. Fagan, of Global Financial Integrity, says a lot of countries a refuse to tell the IRS anything about their U. S. customers. E. J. FAGAN: Very often a lot of these jurisdictions, places like, for example, Mauritius or the British Virgin Islands, they make the Cayman Islands look open and transparent. So very often it's hard to know where the assets are. ZARROLI: But Hanlon and her co-authors, Edward Maydew of the University of North Carolina and Jacob Thornock of the University of Washington, took a look at how much money has come into the country from places such as the Cayman Islands since 1984.

And, on this Tax Day, we thought what better person to ask about that than someone who pays out some of the taxes we pay in. Carolyn Colvin is the acting commissioner of Social Security Administration. She joins us this morning from her office in Baltimore. Good morning. CAROLYN COLVIN: Good morning. MCEVERS: A lot of people might think of Social Security as a kind of safety net for when they get older and they stop working. But, in fact, it's not something that really goes that far. And we're seeing there's huge differences in how Social Security plays out for women. First off, about 60 percent of the people who get Social Security are women. Is that right? COLVIN: That's correct. We found now that more women work. They pay Social Security taxes. They earn credit toward monthly retirement income at this time than at any other time in our nation's history. And, of course, we found that women, due to a number of factors, seem to benefit more from this program than men. MCEVERS: Yet what older women collect is considerably lower than what men collect. So I was wondering if you would help me out, here. Let's take an average 65-year-old woman and a man of the same age, both of them are retired. What's the amount, on average, that they're receiving in 2014? COLVIN: Well, the average amount would be a little over 17,000 per year for men, and a little over 13,000 per year for women. One of the reasons that women are likely to have lower lifetime benefit is because they often have a lower lifetime earnings than men. They're more likely than men to take time out of the workforce to care for family members. And, of course, we still have the issue of gender inequality. MCEVERS: But yet we know that women live longer than men. And so they're going to have to live longer on less, right? COLVIN: Well, that's one of our challenges. Social Security was never intended to be the primary source of retirement. It was to be one of three legs on a stool, we always say. And so, we were looking at Social Security being the basic foundation and then, of course, private pension and savings. And we know now that many of the private pensions have been reduced, some women working jobs where they really don't have a private pension. And, of course, many women - particularly low-income wage earners - find themselves just not saving as much as they should, in order to ensure that they are able to have a decent income during retirement. MCEVERS: When Social Security was first created back after the Depression, the idea was to keep people out of poverty. But now it seems like it's still doing that. Some studies show that three in 10 women, Social Security is like 90 percent of their entire income. Is that what Social Security should be right now? I mean should we still be at a place where we're barely keeping women out of poverty? COLVIN: Well, I think it does keep women out of poverty. And one of the things we stress again, it was never intended to be the sole source. One of the things we try to focus on is encouraging women, even at very young ages, to begin to say there has to be personal responsibility of saving. Many women will say they don't have the ability to save, and what I say is they cannot afford not to save, that they need to save some portion of their income and put aside for retirement. MCEVERS: So, I think going forward, women will still have different working circumstances. You know, we're still likely to interrupt our work to take care of children or elderly family members. Do you have any real like sort of practical day-to-day advice for young working women now? COLVIN: Well, for me, I had to find a way of saving where I would not in fact use that money later. And so I found, for me, real estate was the key. I also found that it did not make sense to leave money on the table, so for every job I've worked where there has been an opportunity for the employer match, I've maximized that. And over years that compounds in interest. And the most important thing is you need to spend below your means. One of the things I tell the young people, just put in a small amount. Maybe it's giving up a soda or giving up cigarettes, which they shouldn't be doing anyway. And then each time they get a raise, don't take that raise. Put it into a 401(k). They haven't gotten used to spending it. It's there. And it will grow. And so I think that there are little tricks that you can do to be able to increase some security for your future. MCEVERS: But it's not an easy message, is it? I mean it's hard to say that when there is nothing tangible that you can sort of point to on how this is going to benefit you in 50, 60, 70 years. COLVIN: Well, it's hard when you have a low wage and you're just trying to make ends meet. But the reality is that the life expectancy has substantially increased. You can go to a life expectancy calculator on our website. Now I've done that. I have a life expectancy of 17 more years, of course, I'm counting on that being wrong; I want to live a little longer. (LAUGHTER)COLVIN: So 71 for me, I'm 71 years old, 17 years would make me 88. I really want to live to be 100. MCEVERS: I don't think I want to do the life expectancy. Maybe I don't want to know. (LAUGHTER)COLVIN: Well, I want to know. And I think that remember, it has a lot to do with a number of things that you can't control, you know, hereditary issues, etc. But it just gives you a sense of the fact that you could outlive your money and you need to plan to live a little bit longer. When I started planning I thought, you know, 67, 70, because that's what we had on my father's side. Now I say 90, because my mom lived to be 89. We know that people are going to live longer and so if they want some quality of life, there's going to have to be some focus on saving for the future. MCEVERS: That's Carolyn Colvin, she's acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Thank you so much. COLVIN: Thank you very much.

And you can see how they apply the lessons learned at the Fort Irwin National Training Center in Southern California. The military still holds old-style war games there, with tanks and planes. But the war scenarios also reflect the recent challenges faced in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Like counterinsurgency operations, where the enemy doesn't wear a uniform, and looks exactly like the civilians the military is supposed to protect. Arun Rath, the weekend host of NPR's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, recently spent some time with soldiers going through the intensive training at Fort Irwin. He joins me now. Hi, Arun. ARUN RATH, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So paint a picture for me. What is this place, Fort Irwin? What's it look like and what did you see? RATH: Well, the idea here is total authenticity. Fort Irwin itself, it's like a mini-Afghanistan. I lost count of the number of soldiers who said that in terms of terrain to deal with, they practically couldn't tell the difference between eastern Afghanistan and this place. It's an enormous swath of desert; it's about halfway between Los Angeles and Los Vegas. Very rugged plateau, and they have these fake Middle Eastern villages in the middle of the desert which are - they're weird. They're very close to reality in some ways, like, you know, the shops look real but the meat, and the fruit, and bread in the markets is made out of plastic. GREENE: Well, once you get to the details you can see that it's not exactly real. RATH: Yeah. GREENE: Well, how has the training changed at this place over the last decade, over these 10 years of war? RATH: Well, in the years after 9/11, the focus of the training shifted from what we might consider traditional warfare, you know, tanks, guns, uniformed armies, towards counterinsurgency - learning how to interact with locals, understanding culture as well as actual fighting. The training extends from ways to distinguish civilians from combatants, which sometimes can be almost impossible, to learning to use new armored vehicles, to even sitting in  - they have village meetings with people playing the roles of local elders that they have to interact with. GREENE: So these are actors, actually, people playing Afghans who these military people in training have to chat with. RATH: Right. They have it as an actual functioning village there. Most of soldiers we talked to there have been on multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and they were impressed by the level of authenticity, and they said it's kind of perfect training for those places and those kinds of situations. GREENE: Well, if this place is so authentic, based on Afghanistan, you know, the United States is now withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, what happens to this place now that that's happening? RATH: Yeah. And that was our main question going in. You would assume that with the end of the war, at least for the U. S. , that would mean the end of these fake Afghan villages in the middle of the Mojave Desert. But when we spoke with Major General Ted Martin - he's the commanding general there at Fort Irwin - this is what he told us. MAJOR GENERAL TED MARTIN: We're not going to lose these cities. We're not going to give it up. You know, these kind of happen to look like a little like Middle Eastern cities. It doesn't really matter; we can change the name of the cities. In the old Iraqi days they had a particular name and now they have an Afghan name. And in the future, we'll move to probably change them to another name. Just to keep people thinking. RATH: He sounded pretty certain that nothing is going to change there in terms of that training, but people who scrutinize the Pentagon budget paint a much more uncertain picture of what's going to happen and that's really the focus of our story. GREENE: All right. And Arun, people will hear much from you and much more about this fake Afhan villiage tomorrow on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. RATH: That's right. GREENE: NPR's Arun Rath. Arun, thanks.

I'm Arun Rath. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE DOOR CHIME)RATH: A few weeks ago, I road shotgun in Cannon Michael's pickup truck. His family has been farming for six generations. CANNON MICHAEL: Yeah, my great-great-great-grandfather came over from Germany in the 1850s. RATH: Michael now runs an 11,000-acre farm in California Central Valley. It's a multi-million dollar operation where you can find a lot of your grocery store basics - tomatoes, onions, melons. But today he's pretty pessimistic about his work. MICHAEL: It is going to be a year that's, you know, probably at best maybe break even, you know, or maybe lose some money. RATH: Michael tells me about one-fifth of the land will lie fallow this year, unfarmed. So come harvest season he won't be able to hire as many people to work the fields. MICHAEL: This year maybe a third of the guys we'll have laid off. Probably 20 guys maybe we won't bring in. RATH: The reason that Michael and farmers all around the valley are cutting back? California's severe ongoing drought. MICHAEL: Without surface water it's a big strain and the people are finding whatever means they can to survive. RATH: That's our cover story today. When a region lives on water, what do people do when the land dries up? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Chances are, you eat food grown in California. Nearly half of the country's fruits, nuts and vegetables come from here, a state that's dried up. According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, the entire State of California is considered abnormally dry. Two-thirds of California are in extreme to exceptional drought conditions. Producer Tom Dreisbach and I drive from Los Angeles to the Central Valley. And the change in terrain is dramatic. We go abruptly from mountains to the flat farm land. All of a sudden it's like we're in Nebraska. Earlier this year, many farmers here found out they would get no irrigation water from state and federal water projects. Recent rains have helped a little. On Friday, government officials said there was enough water to give a little more to some of the region's farmers, 5 percent of the annual allocation instead of what they were getting, zero. Cannon Michael tells us his farm has been a little bit luckier. Because of their long history here, his family has what are called senior water rights and a stronger guarantee to the region's water. (SOUNDBITE OF IRRIGATION SPRINKLERS)RATH: Those rights mean they're getting 40 percent of the normal water allocation and sprinklers are still spraying water across some of the soil. But the farm has still had to cut back. We can see many fields that are laying fallow or growing a placeholder crop to keep the soil from eroding. Thanks to the drought, much of his wheat crop is not suitable for human use, so it's already been cut to make hay for livestock. And as a consequence of all this, Cannon tells me they're buying less equipment like big tractors. MICHAEL: We had ordered one last year in October in anticipation of using it this spring. And they called me a couples weeks ago and said that it was here and I said, you know, just based on the outlook for this year, you know, we just can't take it. RATH: And we're talking a tractor with a serious price tag. MICHAEL: About $400,000, $350,000. RATH: Stories like his are playing out throughout the Central Valley. With less water, farmers are making fewer big purchases. They're fallowing hundreds of thousands of acres and hiring fewer farm laborers, putting less money into the local economy. Economists say it's too early to accurately predict the drought's affect on jobs, but it's likely several thousand will be lost, maybe as many as 20,000. That might not sound like a lot but many of those workers are already living paycheck to paycheck and live in communities that depend on that work. We stopped for lunch at Cecilia's, a small Mexican restaurant in the farming town of Mendota. About 11,000 people live here, not far down the road from Fresno. There's a sweet small-town feel to the place. Everyone seems to know each other. The majority of the people here work in agriculture. Sara Morales' family owns Cecilia's Restaurant. She tells us the drought has brought hard times. SARAH MORALES: Right now, there's days where it's 12 o'clock and it's dead. And there's some really good days but there's no tally right now. RATH: It was pretty quiet when we visited. But David Barajas was there eating lunch. He works for Mendota's water department. He tells us he's had to turn off people's water more and more lately, not because of the shortage but because people can't afford to pay their bills. DAVID BARAJAS: We get a lot of shutoffs right now, yeah. RATH: From people not paying? BARAJAS: Oh yeah, not paying, yeah. RATH: How long do they get to go before you have to shut it off? BARAJAS: Two months, about two months. MAYOR ROBERT SILVA: The ordinary citizen here is going to be facing some of the most drastic situations that I've seen. RATH: Robert Silva is the town's mayor. He tells us Mendota struggles even in wet years. Nearly half of the people here live below the poverty line. Unemployment often hovers around 30 percent. They've been through bad droughts before. The last hit in 2009, brutally coinciding with the nation's foreclosure crisis. Mayor Silva's been thinking a lot about that year recently. SILVA: We know exactly more or less what's going to happen because we saw what happened. We experienced these bad problems. Crime went up. There was a lot of spousal abuse. There was a lot of expulsions in the school system; result of those people not working. RATH: Silva tells me it's been especially hard for men and women used to working hard in food production to turn around and stand in food lines for handouts. Most hiring happens during the harvest season closer to the summer. So people here say the worst is yet to come. (SOUNDBITE OF RESTAURANT STAFF)RATH: A few blocks from Mayor Silva's office, Wanda Leung is taking orders at Lucky Chinese restaurant. More than three decades ago, Long left China and came to the U. S. She ended up settling in Mendota and she and her husband started the restaurant with high hopes. WANDA LEUNG: Make a living, better life. That's out dream, why I come from China, you know. RATH: Long has seen hard times before but she tells us this year is different. People here don't have a lot of money to begin with and now they're too scared to spend it. LEUNG: It's 31 years already. It's the worse year, I tell you. Even people come, you know, they tell me, no money, Wanda. I ask them, you want something to eat? He said, oh no, just a cup of coffee. And he says, no hay dinero. No trabaja, no agua. RATH: How long can you manage like this? LEUNG: I don't have no idea, that's what I told my customer. Sometimes I can't even cover all the expenses. And I don't know how long we could, you know, manage the situation like that actually, you know. RATH: As we drive along Interstate 5 it's impossible to miss the drought. Dead almond trees, unattended fields. There are also signs everywhere along the road expressing anger about what people here call the water wars. Signs in Spanish and English say things like: No Water Equals No Jobs, Pray For Rain and Congress-Created Dust Bowl. Both the federal and state government have promised to help. President Obama has promised $183 million in federal funds for drought relief. California State government has put forward nearly $700 million on top of that. But farmers and local officials insist that more is needed. And one area that has officials worried is education. (SOUNDBITE OF CHILDREN PLAYING)RATH: It's noon recess at Lorena Falasco Elementary School in Los Banos. Kids play tag and kick soccer balls around the playground. (SOUNDBITE OF KICKING OF SOCCER BALL)JANE BRITTELL: Oh, my. Danger zone. RATH: That is Jane Brittell, the school's principal. We dodge balls to make our way to her office. She tells us she's worried the drought will force families to leave and pull their kids out of school. BRITTELL: We have, you know, an agricultural community, and even if the students' parents aren't involved in the agricultural field, the community is. So when that starts to dry up and there's not the, you know, money generated for the businesses, employment starts to dwindle and then parents have to move for better jobs, more jobs. RATH: And it happens when it happens. You don't have tons of notice when a family has to leave, right. BRITTELL: It makes it very difficult. Our enrollment can drop. We can have what we call a revolving door, where students will disenroll and then, you know, new families will enroll and maybe stay for a few weeks. Parents might be trying to find employment and can't and then they move on. And that's very difficult for the education of the children. RATH: And obviously when a student has to leave, when their family has to leave the community, that's the last part of the process. But getting up to that stage, there have to be a lot of stresses on the family and on the students. How do you see that with the kids in the school? BRITTELL: It's hard on kids. When we had the economic recession several years ago, I had kids whose parents couldn't afford the gas to come back to Los Banos because they were commuting over to San Jose to work. Some families were living in their cars and we really reach out to those families and try to help. But it's very, very hard on the students and very stressful. RATH: The superintendent of Los Banos Unified School District is a guy named Steve Tietjen. STEVE TIETJEN: We could lose up to 5 percent of our students, which for a 10,000 student school district, which is what we are, you know, we're talking about 500 kids. RATH: California distributes education funding in part based on attendance, so losing students means losing dollars after years of cutbacks. TIETJEN: We're still deficit spending this year, so if we were to lose 500 kids, 500 students, that's somewhere around $3 million that we would be out. And that's another way to look at, you know, how many teachers we would have to cut to save $3 million. That's another part of the equation we have to look at. RATH: Tietjen says that would mean laying off as many as 20 teachers in the district. At least this year he won't have to make that decision. The California Department of Education says it's going to work with schools hit hardest by the drought to make sure they don't lose funding. Back on the streets of Mendota, Sergio Valdez shows us around town. SERGIO VALDEZ: This is our center right here, the library. RATH: Valdez works part time for the city council and manages local youth programs. He grew up here. He's proud of his town. While there's talk of people leaving to find jobs elsewhere, he tells us he's staying. VALDEZ: It's a little town. It's home. It's home for us. RATH: Valdez's parents left Mexico to work in the fields here and he worries that the new group of people moving to the Central Valley won't have the same chance to succeed. VALDEZ: People are coming in but are they going to make it? And that's the key. You have to have people working. RATH: Still there's a reason he's staying. He believes in Mendota. VALDEZ: They say, oh, we're going to become a ghost town, we're going to dry - no, Mendota will continue to live. I mean, it's not going be as big and prosperous as everybody wants. We'll be like the little train that said, I think I can, I think I can, woowoo, you know. (LAUGHTER)RATH: He says every town has its problems and right now in Mendota they're waiting to find out just how bad the drought will get. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: This is NPR News. ARUN RATH, HOST:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE DOOR CHIME) RATH: A few weeks ago, I road shotgun in Cannon Michael's pickup truck. His family has been farming for six generations. CANNON MICHAEL: Yeah, my great-great-great-grandfather came over from Germany in the 1850s. RATH: Michael now runs an 11,000-acre farm in California Central Valley. It's a multi-million dollar operation where you can find a lot of your grocery store basics - tomatoes, onions, melons. But today he's pretty pessimistic about his work. MICHAEL: It is going to be a year that's, you know, probably at best maybe break even, you know, or maybe lose some money. RATH: Michael tells me about one-fifth of the land will lie fallow this year, unfarmed. So come harvest season he won't be able to hire as many people to work the fields. MICHAEL: This year maybe a third of the guys we'll have laid off. Probably 20 guys maybe we won't bring in. RATH: The reason that Michael and farmers all around the valley are cutting back? California's severe ongoing drought. MICHAEL: Without surface water it's a big strain and the people are finding whatever means they can to survive. RATH: That's our cover story today. When a region lives on water, what do people do when the land dries up? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: Chances are, you eat food grown in California. Nearly half of the country's fruits, nuts and vegetables come from here, a state that's dried up. According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, the entire State of California is considered abnormally dry. Two-thirds of California are in extreme to exceptional drought conditions. Producer Tom Dreisbach and I drive from Los Angeles to the Central Valley. And the change in terrain is dramatic. We go abruptly from mountains to the flat farm land. All of a sudden it's like we're in Nebraska. Earlier this year, many farmers here found out they would get no irrigation water from state and federal water projects. Recent rains have helped a little. On Friday, government officials said there was enough water to give a little more to some of the region's farmers, 5 percent of the annual allocation instead of what they were getting, zero. Cannon Michael tells us his farm has been a little bit luckier. Because of their long history here, his family has what are called senior water rights and a stronger guarantee to the region's water. (SOUNDBITE OF IRRIGATION SPRINKLERS) RATH: Those rights mean they're getting 40 percent of the normal water allocation and sprinklers are still spraying water across some of the soil.

Michel Martin is away. President Obama heads overseas this week to Asia. He hopes to strengthen U. S. economic ties with that region. Part of his agenda is a new trade agreement. It's called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and it involves the U. S. and 11 other countries, notably, not China. We're joined now by two experts to tell us what this means for American interests and American workers. Our guests are Sudeep Reddy, economics editor at the Wall Street Journal, and Roben Farzad host of the forthcoming business podcast \"Full Disclosure. \" Welcome, both of you. SUDEEP REDDY: Hi, Celeste. ROBEN FARZAD: Thank you. HEADLEE: Sudeep, first, give us the basics. What are the basics of this particular trade deal? REDDY: For several years, the Obama administration has been working with these countries that border the Pacific in trying to create greater trade ties. A dozen countries - Australia, Singapore, the United States, Chile, Japan - the goal is to create links between these countries to bring down tariffs, to bring down what it costs to get products into some of these countries and to forge stronger trade ties. So products are moving back and forth in a freer fashion. And as you noted, one of the big goals in this is to create ties in a place where there is already a big powerhouse. China is the second-largest economy in the world after the United States, and it is showing its might in a lots of ways. And a lot of smaller countries in the - around Asia are concerned about China's strength. And this is one way, by creating economic ties between the United States and some of these countries, to serve as a counterweight to China's big force in that region. HEADLEE: So, Roben, who are the fors and againsts? Oftentimes, in trade deals, we see big business pitted against workers and labor unions, right? Is that the case in the Trans-Pacific Partnership? FARZAD: No, in this case, these are really de minimis agreements in the grand scheme of things. As Sudeep said, the big player there is China. . . HEADLEE: Did you say de minimist (ph)? FARZAD: De minimis - I always wanted to use that term on public radio, too. I mean. . . HEADLEE: Well, you just did. FARZAD: Thank you. Thank you for the privilege. HEADLEE: Bucket list, OK. FARZAD: Yeah, it's on my bucket list. You're talking about Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Philippines, and they're by no means monolithic. But again, what is in common here is the way they're looking at China, especially in the lens of what's gone on recently with Russia and the Ukraine. And the U. S. - the White House - is hard-pressed to transmit to effect the fact that it's still strong and important, regionally. So it's looking around the world and saying, well, we're not being looked at as being very efficacious now in Europe, so let's go to Asia, especially where there's this possibility that China might be emboldened to rough up the likes of South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines, and reassert the fact that we are preeminently important to these countries in terms of the economic ties. So it's a delicate balancing act for our trade representatives and for the White House. At the same time, they kind of thumb our noses at China and reassert our kind of geostrategic and trade importance to these smaller countries. HEADLEE: Well, you are efficacious at using sophisticated words like de minimis there, Roben. FARZAD: I'm still - look, I'm still bitter over the SAT verbal. And I remember the six words that I missed. So of course I'm going - I haven't gotten over it. HEADLEE: He's trying to get them all in in this segment. FARZAD: Yes. HEADLEE: So, Sudeep, if I'm an average auto parts manufacturer or line worker, right, do I have something to fear from this Trans-Pacific Partnership? Is it going to cost the United States jobs? REDDY: We don't even know how this agreement is going to end up, and that's one of the concerns that's coming up among workers, among businesses, among lawmakers in all of this. The goal in this kind of a trade agreement is to create more open trade so that an auto worker here can get his or her parts to be sold all over the world and maybe free that up a little bit. But anyone who has watched the last two decades of global trade since NAFTA in the early 1990s, it's obviously been a big political issue. But you can see the benefits and the drawbacks of all of these trade agreements. And they are going to be benefits and drawbacks on both of them where, in some cases, you've seen a lot of the benefits accrue to regular people being able to access products that are cheaper, access services that are cheaper. It's a much different world than it was two decades ago in terms of technology and communications. All of that is changing, and we have a system right now that is stuck in a different era. And that's what people are looking at and wondering if we go forward with this, is it going to be lost to - a loss to me and my company and my neighborhood, or is it going to be some kind of a benefit in ways that I'm not imagining right now? HEADLEE: If you're just joining us, we're talking about the economic agenda of President Obama's trip to Asia. And our guests are Sudeep Reddy, who you just heard, of the Wall Street Journal and business journalist Roben Farzad. A few Democrats are opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this trade agreement. Take a listen to Rep. Rosa DeLauro last week. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW)REPRESENTATIVE ROSA DELAURO: It threatens to roll back financial regulations, environmental standards and U. S. laws that protect the safety of drugs and food and the toys that we give to our kids. HEADLEE: Roben, what do we know about things that she just mentioned, whether or not it holds nations that are in this trade agreement to certain economic standards, financial standards, environmental standards? FARZAD: These are evergreen concerns. You had them with NAFTA. You had them with China over its ascension to the WTO, for example. Colombia's Free Trade Agreement with the United States ran afoul of labor unions here. There are always things that you could bring up. In this case, this is much more to my mind about the signaling of what this sends to China really at the nexus of national security and economic relations than it is about the fine details of, well, what are tariffs X, Y and Z. I mean, the press really isn't even focusing on that. In each case here, each of these countries - Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea - each has a dispute with China over at least one island. And the Chinese Coast Guard recently harassed Filipino ships. And the idea here is that if China is emboldened by the state of affairs from the Kremlin vis-a-vis the Ukraine, that it can get more aggressive with these countries. And they just want to be assured. It's more about photo op diplomacy and Obama going there and shaking hands, that they have a foil to China, that Washington and Wall Street and the United States has their back if China were to get more aggressive. REDDY: There are some real concerns here about the underlying provisions, the regulations that lawmakers are talking about. And these come up in. . . HEADLEE: Especially considering some of the product problems and recalls that we've had, and safety concerns. REDDY: Exactly. And you've seen these in markets all over the world. And if these trade deals end up being lowest common denominator approaches, you might end up reducing some of the requirements that you have for American products - that's the fear. The goal of a trade deal is to bring up all these other countries and force them. . . HEADLEE: Right. REDDY: . . . To use higher environmental regulations, better labor standards, better product standards. . . FARZAD: Sure. REDDY: . . . For food, for prescriptions, for all these things. And that's the goal of the negotiation. But other countries, particularly these countries, aren't there yet in terms of their own markets. And so they don't want to lose out by coming together in this way. And that's the tension you have here. It's the tension you have in any trade agreement around the world - is who's going to come up and who's going to come down in their standards and in their requirements, and are they going to lose out on some of what they have right now in terms of product services? FARZAD: I'm just convinced that the ancillary goals here are actually very important, especially in the context of - and I don't want to beat on the Ukraine drum too much - but it's really what everybody is talking about here. And each of these countries has their peculiar concerns, peculiar vested interest with the United States and individual details to hammer out. Japan and South Korea, for example, are not considered emerging markets. South Korea has ascended - I mean, it's totally turned its act around in the past 17 years. Malaysia and the Philippines are kind of more on the frontier. Malaysia has issues with democracy. There are people here in the United States that are saying we should not legitimize the regime so much by having Obama be the first president in decades to visit over there. So there are all sorts of things. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. FARZAD: . . . That are going into this. HEADLEE: That's Roben Farzad there. Sudeep, you mentioned NAFTA earlier and certainly - that was the trade deal signed under the Clinton administration - and there were many things unintended, unforeseen things, that sort of trickled down from that trade agreement. What do you think we've learned from NAFTA and is any of that going to translate into this trade deal? REDDY: We've certainly learned that people generally are not in love with trade deals. When you talk to Americans, they understand a lot of the benefits that you get from trade deals because you can see people down the street, you can see your coworkers, you can see your neighbors, people in your communities going and selling their products to other countries and that can be a benefit. But you also see the famous Ross Perot suck - giant sucking sound, jobs leaving the country. You have to question, though, in this era of technology, a lot of these jobs would have left anyway. There are always opportunities for companies around the world. HEADLEE: Right, but would we have lost the manufacturing sector to the extent that we did? REDDY: Would we have lost it at the pace we lost it. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. REDDY: . . . And the way we did exactly is the question. But we are always going to be dealing with that, particularly when we're getting better and better products being built and we demand, as consumers, we demand that they're cheaper products whenever possible. And so there's a tension here in what Americans want from their products and what they want in terms of prices and when you go to the store you're typically going for the cheaper priced products. HEADLEE: Yeah. REDDY: But you also want the jobs. And the administration - every administration - wants to figure out how to not only preserve jobs, but more importantly, figure out what the next set of jobs will be. And that's what the goal of these trade agreements really is, is to expand the opportunity for businesses because if you look at figures right now - about 1 percent of American companies actually export anything. And there's a huge gap between what the American economy gets from exports and what our big competitors like China and Germany get from exports. HEADLEE: So, Roben, NAFTA obviously took a very, very long time to be finalized. What about this particular trade pact? What's the chances it'll actually go through and what's our timeline? FARZAD: The administration doesn't have many friends who are in control of Congress right now, but it has people who want to be friends with it. You know, friends in need in a moment of potential China being able to puff its chest more. So this could theoretically be fast tracked. Japan and South Korea are most critical here in terms of key exports that come to the United States. If you think about all the products that you have - Samsung TVs, LG phones. . . HEADLEE: Right. REDDY: . . . From South Korea - it's really arrived as a major economic powerhouse. So if this is focused - if he could get some unanimity among these very different economies, than it doesn't have to take that long. But I question this idea that this would really accelerate these countries espousing full democracy through free trade, especially in the case of Malaysia. If you look at China since the WTO in 2001, 2002 it has not been the case. HEADLEE: OK, that's Roben Farzad. Sorry, I have to leave that debate for another time. He's host of the upcoming business podcast \"Full Disclosure,\" joined us from Richmond, Virginia. And Sudeep Reddy is an economics editor at the Wall Street Journal. He was here with me in our Washington, D. C. studio. Thanks guys. REDDY: Thanks, Celeste. FARZAD: Thank you. CELESTE HEADLEE, HOST:  I'm Celeste Headlee and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Michel Martin is away. President Obama heads overseas this week to Asia. He hopes to strengthen U. S. economic ties with that region. Part of his agenda is a new trade agreement. It's called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and it involves the U. S. and 11 other countries, notably, not China. We're joined now by two experts to tell us what this means for American interests and American workers. Our guests are Sudeep Reddy, economics editor at the Wall Street Journal, and Roben Farzad host of the forthcoming business podcast \"Full Disclosure. \" Welcome, both of you. SUDEEP REDDY: Hi, Celeste. ROBEN FARZAD: Thank you. HEADLEE: Sudeep, first, give us the basics. What are the basics of this particular trade deal? REDDY: For several years, the Obama administration has been working with these countries that border the Pacific in trying to create greater trade ties. A dozen countries - Australia, Singapore, the United States, Chile, Japan - the goal is to create links between these countries to bring down tariffs, to bring down what it costs to get products into some of these countries and to forge stronger trade ties. So products are moving back and forth in a freer fashion. And as you noted, one of the big goals in this is to create ties in a place where there is already a big powerhouse. China is the second-largest economy in the world after the United States, and it is showing its might in a lots of ways. And a lot of smaller countries in the - around Asia are concerned about China's strength. And this is one way, by creating economic ties between the United States and some of these countries, to serve as a counterweight to China's big force in that region. HEADLEE: So, Roben, who are the fors and againsts? Oftentimes, in trade deals, we see big business pitted against workers and labor unions, right? Is that the case in the Trans-Pacific Partnership? FARZAD: No, in this case, these are really de minimis agreements in the grand scheme of things. As Sudeep said, the big player there is China. . . HEADLEE: Did you say de minimist (ph)? FARZAD: De minimis - I always wanted to use that term on public radio, too. I mean. . . HEADLEE: Well, you just did. FARZAD: Thank you. Thank you for the privilege. HEADLEE: Bucket list, OK. FARZAD: Yeah, it's on my bucket list. You're talking about Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Philippines, and they're by no means monolithic. But again, what is in common here is the way they're looking at China, especially in the lens of what's gone on recently with Russia and the Ukraine. And the U. S. - the White House - is hard-pressed to transmit to effect the fact that it's still strong and important, regionally. So it's looking around the world and saying, well, we're not being looked at as being very efficacious now in Europe, so let's go to Asia, especially where there's this possibility that China might be emboldened to rough up the likes of South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines, and reassert the fact that we are preeminently important to these countries in terms of the economic ties. So it's a delicate balancing act for our trade representatives and for the White House. At the same time, they kind of thumb our noses at China and reassert our kind of geostrategic and trade importance to these smaller countries. HEADLEE: Well, you are efficacious at using sophisticated words like de minimis there, Roben. FARZAD: I'm still - look, I'm still bitter over the SAT verbal. And I remember the six words that I missed. So of course I'm going - I haven't gotten over it. HEADLEE: He's trying to get them all in in this segment. FARZAD: Yes. HEADLEE: So, Sudeep, if I'm an average auto parts manufacturer or line worker, right, do I have something to fear from this Trans-Pacific Partnership? Is it going to cost the United States jobs? REDDY: We don't even know how this agreement is going to end up, and that's one of the concerns that's coming up among workers, among businesses, among lawmakers in all of this. The goal in this kind of a trade agreement is to create more open trade so that an auto worker here can get his or her parts to be sold all over the world and maybe free that up a little bit. But anyone who has watched the last two decades of global trade since NAFTA in the early 1990s, it's obviously been a big political issue. But you can see the benefits and the drawbacks of all of these trade agreements. And they are going to be benefits and drawbacks on both of them where, in some cases, you've seen a lot of the benefits accrue to regular people being able to access products that are cheaper, access services that are cheaper. It's a much different world than it was two decades ago in terms of technology and communications. All of that is changing, and we have a system right now that is stuck in a different era. And that's what people are looking at and wondering if we go forward with this, is it going to be lost to - a loss to me and my company and my neighborhood, or is it going to be some kind of a benefit in ways that I'm not imagining right now? HEADLEE: If you're just joining us, we're talking about the economic agenda of President Obama's trip to Asia. And our guests are Sudeep Reddy, who you just heard, of the Wall Street Journal and business journalist Roben Farzad. A few Democrats are opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this trade agreement. Take a listen to Rep. Rosa DeLauro last week. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW) REPRESENTATIVE ROSA DELAURO: It threatens to roll back financial regulations, environmental standards and U. S. laws that protect the safety of drugs and food and the toys that we give to our kids. HEADLEE: Roben, what do we know about things that she just mentioned, whether or not it holds nations that are in this trade agreement to certain economic standards, financial standards, environmental standards? FARZAD: These are evergreen concerns. You had them with NAFTA. You had them with China over its ascension to the WTO, for example. Colombia's Free Trade Agreement with the United States ran afoul of labor unions here. There are always things that you could bring up. In this case, this is much more to my mind about the signaling of what this sends to China really at the nexus of national security and economic relations than it is about the fine details of, well, what are tariffs X, Y and Z. I mean, the press really isn't even focusing on that. In each case here, each of these countries - Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea - each has a dispute with China over at least one island. And the Chinese Coast Guard recently harassed Filipino ships. And the idea here is that if China is emboldened by the state of affairs from the Kremlin vis-a-vis the Ukraine, that it can get more aggressive with these countries. And they just want to be assured. It's more about photo op diplomacy and Obama going there and shaking hands, that they have a foil to China, that Washington and Wall Street and the United States has their back if China were to get more aggressive. REDDY: There are some real concerns here about the underlying provisions, the regulations that lawmakers are talking about. And these come up in. . . HEADLEE: Especially considering some of the product problems and recalls that we've had, and safety concerns. REDDY: Exactly. And you've seen these in markets all over the world. And if these trade deals end up being lowest common denominator approaches, you might end up reducing some of the requirements that you have for American products - that's the fear. The goal of a trade deal is to bring up all these other countries and force them. . . HEADLEE: Right. REDDY: . . . To use higher environmental regulations, better labor standards, better product standards. . . FARZAD: Sure. REDDY: . . . For food, for prescriptions, for all these things. And that's the goal of the negotiation. But other countries, particularly these countries, aren't there yet in terms of their own markets. And so they don't want to lose out by coming together in this way. And that's the tension you have here. It's the tension you have in any trade agreement around the world - is who's going to come up and who's going to come down in their standards and in their requirements, and are they going to lose out on some of what they have right now in terms of product services? FARZAD: I'm just convinced that the ancillary goals here are actually very important, especially in the context of - and I don't want to beat on the Ukraine drum too much - but it's really what everybody is talking about here. And each of these countries has their peculiar concerns, peculiar vested interest with the United States and individual details to hammer out. Japan and South Korea, for example, are not considered emerging markets. South Korea has ascended - I mean, it's totally turned its act around in the past 17 years. Malaysia and the Philippines are kind of more on the frontier. Malaysia has issues with democracy. There are people here in the United States that are saying we should not legitimize the regime so much by having Obama be the first president in decades to visit over there. So there are all sorts of things. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. FARZAD: . . . That are going into this. HEADLEE: That's Roben Farzad there. Sudeep, you mentioned NAFTA earlier and certainly - that was the trade deal signed under the Clinton administration - and there were many things unintended, unforeseen things, that sort of trickled down from that trade agreement. What do you think we've learned from NAFTA and is any of that going to translate into this trade deal? REDDY: We've certainly learned that people generally are not in love with trade deals. When you talk to Americans, they understand a lot of the benefits that you get from trade deals because you can see people down the street, you can see your coworkers, you can see your neighbors, people in your communities going and selling their products to other countries and that can be a benefit. But you also see the famous Ross Perot suck - giant sucking sound, jobs leaving the country. You have to question, though, in this era of technology, a lot of these jobs would have left anyway. There are always opportunities for companies around the world. HEADLEE: Right, but would we have lost the manufacturing sector to the extent that we did? REDDY: Would we have lost it at the pace we lost it. . . HEADLEE: Yeah. REDDY: . . . And the way we did exactly is the question. But we are always going to be dealing with that, particularly when we're getting better and better products being built and we demand, as consumers, we demand that they're cheaper products whenever possible.

You know, friends in need in a moment of potential China being able to puff its chest more. So this could theoretically be fast tracked. Japan and South Korea are most critical here in terms of key exports that come to the United States. If you think about all the products that you have - Samsung TVs, LG phones. . . HEADLEE: Right.

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Spring is the time house hunters expect to see a slew of listings. But in many parts of the country, inventory is pretty low. When that happens, home prices go up. WSHU's Kaomi Goetz takes a look at the housing market. She checked out a listing that led to a history-making home sale in Connecticut. KAOMI GOETZ, BYLINE: Realtor David Ogilvy is talking about Copper Beach Farm in Greenwich, Connecticut, via YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)GOETZ: It's a 51-acre estate once owned by Carnegie Steel heiress Harriet Lauder Greenway. It just broke the record for the highest home sale price in American history, at a stunning $120 million. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)GOETZ: There's a stone and shingle mansion with two towers, 12 bedrooms and 10 fireplaces, sweeping views of Long Island Sound. But perhaps what drove the price is its potential. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)GOETZ: The buyer's identity isn't known, and it's not clear if the estate will get chopped up. But the 120 million mega-sale caps off a run on pricey homes here. Six homes have already sold in town for over $10 million each this year. Local Realtor Brad Hvolbeck says the long winter slog and the recession have created a frenzy of pent-up demand. BRAD HVOLBECK: I put a house on yesterday for 2. 4 million. I showed it twice today, and I have two more showings tomorrow. So you can see, the market has really jumped quite a bit. GOETZ: That demand is driving up home prices pretty much everywhere. On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said the price of a typical home rose nearly 8 percent compared with last year. One key factor is low inventory. Back in 2009, you could have your pick of places. The market was flooded with foreclosed homes; prices went into a free fall. But those homes have now been bought up or torn down. The recession also put a credit squeeze on builders; some even went bust. Patrick Newport is an economist with forecasting firm IHS. He says new housing starts are still about a third below where they should be because builders are still running into difficulties. PATRICK NEWPORT: These include things like higher labor costs, higher construction costs, difficulty getting credit. GOETZ: So this spring, new home prices are surging at a time when mortgage rates are also rising. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the price of newly built homes shot up, but sales dropped more than 14 percent last month. With fewer homes on the market, good deals are in short supply. That's what's frustrating new home buyers David Bleckley and his wife. They began shopping for their first home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this year. Michigan, remember, was one of the hardest-hit states in the foreclosure crisis. Bleckley was hoping to still find a bargain, maybe a fixer-upper. They're too late. DAVID BLECKLEY: Things have really bounced back lately. I think that 2013 would have been a much better time to buy a house, but we weren't here yet. GOETZ: Eventually, higher prices may encourage more homeowners to list. When that happens, buyers will have more choices and then the market can finally heal. For NPR News, I'm Kaomi Goetz.

Those workers can legally be paid just pennies per hour when they work at what are called sheltered workplaces. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  For some, sheltered workshops are a godsend, providing the disabled with opportunities that might not otherwise exist. For others, they're an example of good intentions gone wrong. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: It's not unusual these days to see a developmentally disabled worker at a grocery store or restaurant as more of the disabled get jobs in the community, but many thousands more work at sheltered workshops like this one. GUS VAN DEN BRINK: We'll walk around. You can see some of the jobs that we do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Hey, Gus. BRINK: Hi. How are you doing? CORLEY: Gus van den Brink heads the Sertoma Centre, an agency providing programs and training for the developmentally disabled. He greets workers here who are packaging bottles that will be shipped off to a microbrewery. BRINK: We do 100 percent quality control. The supervisor in the area is always checking the work when they're finished with it. CORLEY: Sertoma Centre, located in Chicago's south suburbs, started off as a sheltered workshop, providing employment opportunities to the disabled by getting subcontracting jobs. These days, about 250 people work here. Their pay is regulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The law was originally created to encourage hiring veterans with disabilities. It allows companies, including some federal contractors, to pay subminimum wages based on how productive a person with disabilities is compared to a non-disabled worker doing the same task. BRINK: So we might pay somebody just 25 cents an hour, all the way up to minimum wage. CORLEY: The concept has increasingly come under fire by disability advocacy groups. They say the workshops reinforce the life of poverty, leaving thousands isolated and exploited by their employers. Curtis Decker, who heads the National Disability Rights Network, says sheltered workshops may once have been a good idea. . . CURTIS DECKER: That this would be a place where people could get trained and be protected and learn some skills. CORLEY: But he says the concept is way out of date. DECKER: Forty, 50 years later, we have people in these segregated workshops not moving out, not getting into competitive employment and making well below the minimum wage. CORLEY: With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, there's been more emphasis on placing the disabled in the mainstream labor market. And Decker and others are calling for an end to sheltered employment. They have the support of the Justice Department. Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels recently announced a settlement with Rhode Island, calling for it to provide typical jobs in the community for disabled workers that pay the minimum wage, while phasing out many sheltered workshops. JOCELYN SAMUELS: It's the promise of the American with Disabilities Act to open the doors of the American workplace to people with disabilities and to abolish the low expectations that have kept people with disabilities shut out of their communities for decades. CORLEY: Gus van den Brink says the Sertoma Centre and other agencies do work to find jobs for the disabled in the community, but he adds the focus should not be on shutting down all sheltered workshops. He says it would be nearly impossible for some people with severe intellectual disabilities to get a job at all. It's sheltered workshops, he says, that give them a chance to work and earn a paycheck. BRINK: Some of the individuals may not even completely understand what the value of that paycheck is, but they know they're receiving a paycheck, so they're getting a lot of self-esteem. They're very proud of it.

Yesterday, we heard how hard it has become for low-income students to afford college. But for colleges, there's an important question of cost as well. In tight economic times, schools have to think about which students they can afford to admit. We spoke to two educators. Georgia Nugent is the former president of Kenyon College, and she's now a senior fellow at the Council of Independent Colleges. Maricela Oliva is a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Both were the first in their families to attend college. Dr. Oliva explained how she went from humble roots in the border region of Texas to Yale. MARICELA OLIVA: Certainly, my parents didn't know what college was because they hadn't been to college. They had been migrant workers. So purely by accident, I ended up going to Yale instead of UT-Austin. And I remember all of us sitting in the classrooms when the PA announcement comes over and says, you know, the Yale recruiter will be coming, or the Yale recruiter is here. Everybody rolled their eyes, like what the heck is Yale, and why should anyone want to talk to him? But out of embarrassment more than anything, the counselor at that time pulled people out and said, talk to him; it's embarrassing to have no one show up. GREENE: Tell me how Yale helped you and supported you. OLIVA: Well, one of the nice things about Yale and other Ivy League institutions at the time is that they had a need-blind admissions process. They still do. GREENE: And we should remind people: That means you don't look at someone's need and their economic situation when you decide whether or not to accept them. OLIVA: That's right. GREENE: Dr. Nugent, let me turn to you. You were recently president of Kenyon College, a very prestigious, well-respected liberal arts college. Is Kenyon offering need-blind admissions today? GEORGIA NUGENT: No, not entirely. There are only a very few number of colleges which have been truly need-blind. GREENE: Because it's expensive to be able to make a commitment that we will decide who we want to accept, and we will get those students there, no matter what it costs. NUGENT: Of course. And if you have limited resources, it's your responsibility, in many ways, to manage those resources effectively. Most colleges today are what is called need-sensitive. It means that many colleges who have some resources - not enormous resources, but are not impoverished - they do try to accept the class that they would like to have, not taking into consideration financial need. But then as you get toward completing the acceptance of a class and your dollars are running out, you have to begin to take into consideration need. So if I recall correctly, at Kenyon, about 10 percent of the class was admitted with, quote, \"needs sensitivity\" in mind. That is, there were some students we just could not afford. GREENE: Let me just make me sure I understand this: 10 percent of the class was admitted with needs sensitivity in mind. What, exactly, do you mean by that? NUGENT: That is, approximately 90 percent of the class - we really did try to meet their full financial need. In order to do that, there was some segment of class where we had to take into consideration: Do we have some students who can afford to pay? GREENE: The students who you have to admit because they have greater means - more affluent students - does that mean admitting some students who might not be as qualified, but they're getting in because of their ability to pay? NUGENT: In Kenyon's case, the answer to that was no. It was a question of just the absolute superstar kid you would like to have who has tremendous financial need, and maybe you just can't manage that. GREENE: But there's another superstar kid who has greater means and. . . NUGENT: Yeah. And I'm sure that's not true for all colleges. GREENE: You're saying some colleges have to accept less-qualified students, too. NUGENT: Probably some need to dig deeper. Yeah. GREENE: And I've read about a really competitive environment where colleges are often saying, you know what? We can't offer as many full-tuition scholarships because what we need to do is offer discounts in tuition. . . NUGENT: Right. GREENE: . . . to families that are actually more affluent, but to kind of persuade them to come to our college instead of another one. NUGENT: That's right. What I call so-called merit aid. And here's what it means - let's say that your full tuition at your college is $20,000. GREENE: OK. NUGENT: You could take $15,000 of your financial aid and offer that to one quite needy student. Or you could take your same amount of resources, and you could offer $5,000 in scholarship aid to three affluent students. So in terms of the college's revenue, offering the large package to the single student nets $5,000 for the college. Offering the small sweetener to the affluent student nets the college $45,000. GREENE: What is your reaction when colleges have to do that? I mean, is it defensible? Is it just the economic reality for some schools these days? NUGENT: In some ways, I think it's defensible. You've got institutions where their resource base is declining. They have to somehow find a way to pay their bills to offer the education they want to offer and consequently, they need to increase that net revenue. GREENE: Dr. Oliva, how are you reacting, hearing this? OLIVA: We've really moved from a position where people are interested in helping really capable students by supporting them through financial aid to a position that says if you want to go to college, it's a personal - as opposed to a societal - benefit, so you need to bear the cost yourself. It's a very different situation, but we've created it ourselves because we are disinvesting from higher education. And the other issue that I wanted to raise is that sometimes when you show the actual cost of a four-year institution, whether it's public or private - I mean, there's a kind of sticker shock that sometimes causes low-income students, even the very well-prepared students who are eligible for a selective institution, to choose to attend a less-costly, maybe a two-year institution. GREENE: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about this because this is a trend we're seeing. There are more and more low-income students who are deciding on colleges that might be a mismatch. OLIVA: Yes. And on the one hand you say, well, you're glad that they're starting it somewhere. But on the other hand, I'm anticipating that we will soon have a kind of transfer bubble, where a lot of the students who, because they're starting at a two-year, probably will not achieve that bachelor's outcome that they so want. GREENE: Are we seeing a time when students with more means are benefiting more and more when it comes to applying for college? NUGENT: Absolutely. Colleges are in much more competition with one another. There's a bidding war, essentially. Culturally, we need, as a society, to make a recommitment to education as a public good, and not just as the private good. And I feel pretty strongly that our colleges and universities also need to begin making more of a concerted effort toward this public good. GREENE: Professor Oliva and Dr. Nugent, thank you both for your time. It was really nice to talk to you both. NUGENT: Thank you. OLIVA: Thanks very much.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:  We've been focusing the past few weeks on paying for college. Yesterday, we heard how hard it has become for low-income students to afford college. But for colleges, there's an important question of cost as well. In tight economic times, schools have to think about which students they can afford to admit. We spoke to two educators. Georgia Nugent is the former president of Kenyon College, and she's now a senior fellow at the Council of Independent Colleges.

And one thing that will determine their actions is the employment situation in the country. Now, there's some disagreement among economists - both inside and outside the Fed - over how close the job market is to regaining its pre-recession strength. To find out more, we turn as we often do to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributor to the Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So let's look at one of the important numbers here. I mean the unemployment rate in the country peaked at 10 percent during the worst of the recession. It's been falling. It's down to 6. 7 percent and that sounds like a pretty good trend, right? WESSEL: It is a good trend. The unemployment rate has come down. The Fed expects it to keep falling. But the basic issue they're confronting is whether the unemployment rate has become what you might call a misleading indicator of how strong the job market is. . . GREENE: OK. WESSEL: . . . of how close we are to the point where the pool of unemployed workers has shrunk to the point where wages start rising too fast for the Fed's comfort. GREENE: So what wages going up sounds like a good thing, but they can go up to quickly, you're saying. WESSEL: That's right. The fed would like to see what wages going up, but if they rise too much then companies raise prices and inflation - it can rise above the 2 percent target that the Fed have set. So they'd like to see a little wage increase but they'd like to act to put the brakes on the economy before they see too much. Now, some of the people who are unemployed have been out of work for just a few weeks, but an unusually large fraction have been out of work for six months or more - nearly 40 percent at last count. And they're some economists - Alan Krueger at Princeton, Robert Gordon at Northwestern - who say that many of these long-term unemployed are going to be on the sidelines of the economy for basically forever. And they say so they're unemployed, these people aren't putting much downward pressure on wages and their advice to the Fed is, keep an eye on the shrinking number of people who've been out of work for only a few weeks or for less than six months. GREENE: All right, so some economists say you should keep an eye on other things, not necessarily just the unemployment rate. Do all economists agree that the unemployment number can be misleading? WESSEL: Well, all economists agree that it's too simple a measure. But what's interesting is that there are some economists - among them Michael Kiley, who works at the Fed, who challenge Krueger and Gordon and say that what matters is the overall unemployment rate, regardless of how long the people have been out of work. And they say look up, it's still high. It's more than a point above what the Fed says it should be, so the Fed should be very, very slow to take its foot off the monetary gas pedal. And then there are other people who say, look, the unemployment rate is distorted because so many people have stopped looking for work, they're not counted as officially unemployed and they would come back into the job market, they'd be working if only there were more jobs. So they say there still is, as economists put it, a lot of slack in the labor market, a lot of people would be working if the Fed could get the economy running faster. GREENE: Has the new Fed chair, Janet Yellen, weighed in on this? WESSEL: She has, and that's really interesting. She has really taken a side. She's firmly of the view that there are a lot of idle workers who'd be working if there were more jobs. She's dismissed the notion that we should just look at the short-term unemployed. And she says that other gauges show you how weak the labor market is; how many people are working part time, even though they'd prefer full-time jobs? How many people are reluctant to quit their jobs, the unusually low number - which is a sign that they're uneasy. And she's noted with displeasure that wages aren't going up very fast. GREENE: Now David, this is a particularly important time to diagnose the job market, it sounds like. Remind us why that is. WESSEL: Basically, the Fed is trying to figure out what is going on now and what - it doesn't want to act too soon because that would choke off the recovery, but it doesn't want to act too late, as it often does. And basically, there are some people who say this is like the 1970s, when the Fed waited too long, we got a lot of inflation. Others look at the same economy and say it's like 1937, when the Fed and Roosevelt misread the economy and hit the brakes prematurely. One of the keys to deciding what the right historical metaphor is, is how much slack there is in the labor market. GREENE: All right. David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome.

S. sanctions could affect Russia. President Obama yesterday announced the latest measures aimed at punishing Russia for its links to violence in Eastern Ukraine. Russia is accusing the U. S. and its allies in Europe and Japan of resorting to Cold War tactics. NPR's Corey Flintoff is covering this story from Moscow. Hi, Corey. COREY FLINTOFF, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So what will the latest sanctions do? FLINTOFF: Well, there hasn't been a huge effect so far. In fact, the main Russian stock markets opened higher this morning. Analysts say that's because investors were relieved that the sanctions didn't name any of the major Russian companies that are listed on those stock exchanges. They say the point seems to be that the sanctions are hitting President Putin's closest advisors. You know, take for example, Igor Sechin. He's the head of the world's biggest oil company, it's Rosneft. He's a former KGB agent, like Putin, and a former Soviet intelligence officer, said to be very close to Putin. Another reason sanctions against him might be a big deal is that it will be the first time that sanctions have hit this close to Russia's oil and gas business. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that. If you are targeting the head of this giant oil company, could that have some broader economic effect, even if there's not an immediate and affect on the stock market? FLINTOFF: Well, the company itself hasn't been sanctioned, it's just the chief. So it's not clear how much affect would be on Rosneft's partners. But those partners include Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell; all these big multinationals, and it should be enough to make them nervous. You know, BP, for example, owns nearly 20 percent of Rosneft. It's a holding that's thought to be worth more than $12 billion. Exxon has huge investments with Rosneft in the Russian Arctic. So they would be vulnerable if these sanctions spread any further. INSKEEP: How much effect might there be from sanctions targeting Russian banks which, as I understand it, will make it difficult if not impossible for credit card companies like MasterCard to do business with those banks? FLINTOFF: So far there are only two more Russian banks that have been added to the list, so they make up a small part of MasterCard and Visa's business in Russia. So that probably won't be a big effect. But now this makes four Russian banks whose cardholders won't get service from these major international credit card companies. And, you know, once again, the main effect of the sanctions seems to be that it creates uncertainty for people. You know, they have to wonder how many other banks might be affected if there were more sanctions added. President Putin is actually calling for an all-Russia payment system that would replace the international credit cards. At the moment, that seems to be a bit of pie in the sky. But the theory is that it would make Russians less vulnerable to interference from other countries. It would probably take a long time to setup and, even then, it would probably work only in Russia. INSKEEP: Although, I suppose the underlying message of Putin saying such a thing is that he doesn't intend to be deterred from his course in Ukraine. FLINTOFF: Exactly right. That seems to be the case. Some analysts have said that they think these sanctions may just cause Putin and his inner circle to step up the pressure against the government in Kiev. You know, the people on this list they're mostly longtime Putin friends and loyalists. They're among the hardest of the hardliners when it comes to dealing with Ukraine. And they're not all that vulnerable. Some of these people are billionaires and their wealth is diversified all over the world. So the main leverage that the West would seem to have now is the threat that the next round of sanctions would bite a lot harder. INSKEEP: Are people in Russia surprised the Unite States has not already imposed broader sanctions that would hit more people? FLINTOFF: It's hard to say. You know, I think in general terms business people have not expected that the sanctions would bite very hard because they're well aware that Europeans are going to be arguing against it. You know, Europe does something like $450 billion worth of business with Russia every year. And their companies and their governments are reluctant to put their economies in danger by doubling down on these sanctions. INSKEEP: NPR's Corey Flintoff is in Moscow. Corey, thanks very much. FLINTOFF: My pleasure, Steve. INSKEEP: This is NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Let's examine just how much U. S. sanctions could affect Russia.

INSKEEP: How much effect might there be from sanctions targeting Russian banks which, as I understand it, will make it difficult if not impossible for credit card companies like MasterCard to do business with those banks? FLINTOFF: So far there are only two more Russian banks that have been added to the list, so they make up a small part of MasterCard and Visa's business in Russia. So that probably won't be a big effect. But now this makes four Russian banks whose cardholders won't get service from these major international credit card companies. And, you know, once again, the main effect of the sanctions seems to be that it creates uncertainty for people. You know, they have to wonder how many other banks might be affected if there were more sanctions added. President Putin is actually calling for an all-Russia payment system that would replace the international credit cards. At the moment, that seems to be a bit of pie in the sky. But the theory is that it would make Russians less vulnerable to interference from other countries. It would probably take a long time to setup and, even then, it would probably work only in Russia. INSKEEP: Although, I suppose the underlying message of Putin saying such a thing is that he doesn't intend to be deterred from his course in Ukraine. FLINTOFF: Exactly right. That seems to be the case. Some analysts have said that they think these sanctions may just cause Putin and his inner circle to step up the pressure against the government in Kiev. You know, the people on this list they're mostly longtime Putin friends and loyalists. They're among the hardest of the hardliners when it comes to dealing with Ukraine. And they're not all that vulnerable. Some of these people are billionaires and their wealth is diversified all over the world. So the main leverage that the West would seem to have now is the threat that the next round of sanctions would bite a lot harder. INSKEEP: Are people in Russia surprised the Unite States has not already imposed broader sanctions that would hit more people? FLINTOFF: It's hard to say. You know, I think in general terms business people have not expected that the sanctions would bite very hard because they're well aware that Europeans are going to be arguing against it. You know, Europe does something like $450 billion worth of business with Russia every year. And their companies and their governments are reluctant to put their economies in danger by doubling down on these sanctions. INSKEEP: NPR's Corey Flintoff is in Moscow. Corey, thanks very much.

Whether people have finished the book or not, \"Capital in the Twenty-Century\" is being talked about and debated across the country - at think tanks, on editorial pages, and at universities. Piketty's most recent appearance was at the University of California, Berkeley, a place where he was pretty likely to find fans like seniors Christopher Hussy and Naomi Egel. NAOMI EGEL: I had two classes this semester where professors keep bringing him up. I figured if he's coming here it's a pretty cool opportunity. MCEVERS: Have you read it?

MCEVERS: Public policy grad student Kevin McNellis hasn't read the book yet, either. Still, he says the conversation about inequality is not just one for the ivory tower. KEVIN MCNELLIS: I was just at Easter with some family and they could not care less about politics but, you know, there was this general sense that, you know, the game is rigged and it's harder to find good-paying jobs and they're like this wasn't how it was when we were kids.

And then Thomas Piketty or Thomas Piketty, if you say it the right way, explains his 15 years of research, combing through tax records that span centuries. THOMAS PIKETTY: This is the largest historical database on income and wealth distribution available. But. . . MCEVERS: Piketty has found that over time, the rising tide has not lifted all boats. Rather, save for a few decades last century, wealth is fast accumulating in one small place - at the top. In 2012, 50 percent of the wealth was held by the top 10 percent of the people. PIKETTY: You have to ask yourself, where is it going to go? Is it gonna? Is it going to go to 60 percent 20 years from now, 70 percent? MCEVERS: So to slow this accumulation, Piketty proposes a progressive tax on net wealth. Basically, the bottom 90 percent would pay less tax, and the top 10 percent would pay more, needless to say, it's an idea that already has critics. Still, after the lecture and the Q and A, Piketty said he's surprised by how popular he and his book are. PIKETTY: Well, I mean this is certainly, you know, the maximum I could expect. MCEVERS: But he says maybe it makes sense for him to tell America's story. After all, he says, the U. S. invented the progressive tax in 1919, when class-based Europe was reluctant to do the same. PIKETTY: You know, sometimes it's easier to, you know, for outsiders to remind you about your own history. MCEVERS: After getting his book signed, Piketty fan Phillip Hoon says he's in the top 10 percent. That's why he came to see Piketty. PHILLIP HOON: The way he's presented it, there are risks that affect me and my family. MCEVERS: Risks? HOON: Risks. MCEVERS: Like what? Being taxed? HOON: Yes. (LAUGHTER)HOON: But the flip side, I've got children who aren't earning incomes and then I've got other family members who're barely making livings on subsidies and stuff like that. And so if you could find some mechanism to make things better for them, that's why it's really key to have this brought to people's attention. MCEVERS: When pollsters ask Americans about inequality, they by and large agree it exists. That's different from other big issues like climate change. The problem, says Carroll Doherty of the Pew Research Center, is when you start to drill down on inequality. CARROLL DOHERTY: We asked people, Okay the gap is increasing, you say the gap is increasing, and there seems to be pretty broad agreement about that. Why? And there's really no great consensus \tamong the public about why this is occurring. I think that multiple reasons were given. MCEVERS: Doherty says there's also disagreement over what to do about inequality. Republicans, of course, favor less government - Democrats more. Doherty found more people think government should intervene if you ask about something concrete, like poverty. The definition of inequality and whether Piketty's way of fixing it will work, that's something even people at Berkeley can't agree on. Kelly McEvers, NPR News.

Grant was president. That was in the 1870s. But a new World Bank report says by one measure that could change by the end of this year: China would take over the top spot this year. To explain what the new report means and what it doesn't, we turn to NPR's Frank Langfitt. He's on the line from Shanghai. Hi, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I should mention we said, by one measure, China could take over the top spot. What's that measure? LANGFITT: That measure is called purchasing power parity. And the idea is because prices vary so much from country to country, what they like to look at - economists like to look at is how far does money really go in an economy and how much purchasing power do people have. Now, there's this new analysis that just came out this week, and it found that money went out a lot farther in poor countries, like China, than economists had thought. And certainly this has been my experience, and I'm sure your experience, traveling around the world. Like, in the mornings, I go to my work in Shanghai. It costs me four bucks in a taxi cab. There's no way I can do that, say, in New York or Washington - it would be way too expensive. So based on the fact that things are a lot cheaper in a place like China, the World Bank decided that China's economy was actually rapidly closing in on U. S. INSKEEP: OK. So we're saying that the U. S. economy in strict terms is still larger. But China's parity - purchasing power parity - is getting to where it will pass the U. S. Is that the best way to measure the size an economy? LANGFITT: Well, for measuring people's well-being and sort of their living standards, it is a good measure. It shows how much people can afford. But when you're looking at actual global economic power - which is kind of what everybody is really interested in when they talk China and U. S. - a better ways is to look at market exchange rates. Because, of course, China and Chinese companies - if they're going to go buy things overseas - they've got to exchange their money for dollars or euros, to buy things on the global market. And by that measure, as of 2012 - again, according to World Bank - the U. S. economy was a little over $16 trillion. And China was about half that. INSKEEP: OK. So the U. S. economy, still by that measure, by far the largest in the world. What were some of the other findings in this World Bank report? LANGFITT: Well, it's not surprising but it's really good context, Steve. Even though the report said China was rapidly closing in gross economic terms, you know, the population here is more than four times that in the U. S. And so, on a per capita GDP basis, things here in China - income is still very, very really low; per capita around $10,000. And the last year they looked at was 2011. And based on those figures, China was actually 99th in the world per capita GDP. That's behind countries like Egypt. Now, I was talking to Nariman Behravesh. He's chief economist at IHS. It's an economic analysis firm. And here's how he put it. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: The typical Chinese person is still much, much poorer than the typical American person and has a lot of catching up to do. And that gap will not be closed for decades. INSKEEP: Well, Frank Langfitt, how did Chinese government react to this news? LANGFITT: This is my favorite part of the story: Silence. The state press was quiet today. And in report itself that came out from the World Bank, Chinese officials actually rejected the finding. The report said, quote, \"China does not endorse these results as official statistics. \"INSKEEP: Even though one of the big findings of this report is that China's economy here is getting stronger and stronger. LANGFITT: Exactly, and the reason is the government - in handling publicity around the economic growth here - it has to be careful. Domestically, they want to emphasize it, 'cause it's a source of their own legitimacy and takes credit - but not too much. There's a huge income gap here. And also, as China gets richer, other countries are going to make bigger demands on it - more pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions, make trade concessions. I remember back in the 1990s, when China was trying to get into WTO. Frankly, the government was always poor-mouthing, saying they shouldn't be held to the same standards as rich countries.

This story comes, of course, from our Planet Money team. David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein bring us the history of light and how the world came what it is today. DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Before you could get light at the flick of a switch, there were other options - none of them very good. Jane Brox wrote a book called \"Brilliant: The Evolution Of Artificial Light. \" In the tropics, she says, people would catch fireflies and make a sort of firefly lantern. And in Scotland, there was this bird called the storm petrel. JANE BROX: Which is a very oily seabird, which they'd catch and dry and thread a wick down its throat and then light it. And then that was a lamp. KESTENBAUM: Just carry around a dead bird? BROX: Well, it would be on a table. (LAUGHTER)KESTENBAUM: These ways of making light, they were all a real hassle. It took a lot of time, a lot of effort. In short, light was really expensive. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Bill Nordhaus is an economist at Yale. He became obsessed with figuring out how expensive light was thousands of years ago and how it changed over time. Because light - light is this thing society has needed forever. It was a way to track progress, not just in light, but in lots of things. KESTENBAUM: Nordhaus managed to track down some economic data from ancient Babylon. And to see how much light people were getting for their money, he set up a primitive oil lamp in his dining room and measured it with a light meter. BILL NORDHAUS: And I would just measure it and write it down, just the way you see in the old movies, some guy in his lab coat writing down his measurements. KESTENBAUM: Here's the answer he got. In Babylonian times, 4,000 years ago, a day's labor would buy very little light. You could buy enough light to illuminate a room but not for very long. NORDHAUS: Maybe 10 minutes. It was really expensive. KESTENBAUM: A day's wages got you 10 minutes of light. GOLDSTEIN: This was a world where, when the sun went down, almost everyone lived in the dark. This may sound sort of romantic but basically it was awful. The dark was something dangerous, something that trapped you. In Paris, at one point, there was actually a law that said every night, everybody has to give their keys to a magistrate, go home and lock themselves in the house. KESTENBAUM: Economists talk a lot about productivity, how much a person can produce with a day's labor. Back then, the answer was not much. Everything was just hard. Growing food was hard. You worked all day and you could buy almost nothing with what you earned. The way things get better - in light and in everything - the way an economy grows, is that someone comes up with a better way to do something. GOLDSTEIN: With light, for example, people start to use whale oil. This is very, very bad for whales. Economic growth was not all good. But whales have a lot of fat. They were these big swimming sources of fuel. KESTENBAUM: But for thousands of years, the advances in light and in everything, else are pretty minor - things don't change much. And light is still expensive until, Bill Nordhaus says, around 1800. NORDHAUS: You look at the picture of what happened here, it's economic history in a nutshell. From Babylonian times to around 1800, even though there were improvements, as best we can tell, they were very modest. And then around 1800 in the lighting - you can see it so clearly in lighting - just an enormous change in the pace of improvement. KESTENBAUM: In the 1800s, we start to have more scientists, people devoting themselves to methodical experimentation. And around 1850, a guy in Canada comes up with something that's not just a slightly better wick or a more efficient lamp. It's this magical liquid. With the right techniques, you can get it from coal or oil. GOLDSTEIN: This big breakthrough, kerosene. Again Jane Brox. BROX: When the first kerosene lamps came out, it was - as one historian said, it was the kind of oil people had dreamed about for centuries. GOLDSTEIN: Kerosene burned brighter. It was cleaner. And Bill Nordhaus says it was a lot cheaper. In Babylonian times, a day's labor got you 10 minutes of light. Now? NORDHAUS: Kerosene, you get about five hours. KESTENBAUM: Whoa. NORDHAUS: Kerosene lit the world and saved the whales. KESTENBAUM: In the 1800s, we finally get a little economic growth. People don't have to huddle in the dark at night anymore. Streetlights become more common. People start going out more at night. GOLDSTEIN: So we have kerosene. What's the next big advance after that? NORDHAUS: OK, next big advance after that is the electric lamp. GOLDSTEIN: The big one. NORDHAUS: Well, you might think so. KESTENBAUM: I thought I knew the story of Thomas Edison. You know, Edison trying out all these different filaments until he gets the one that will glow for hours. But this eureka light bulb moment, it alone is not enough to get you to the world of cheap light. Edison needed something else. He needed money - lots of money because you can't light a light bulb without electricity. He needed to build a power plant. GOLDSTEIN: And there's this historic moment in 1882. They're about to throw a switch to turn on the power plant and light up part of New York City. Where is Edison when they switch it on? He's not at the power plant. He's at a bank. PAUL ISRAEL: He was where he needed to be, with the people who had funded the whole thing. KESTENBAUM: This is Paul Israel, an Edison scholar. We met him outside what back then was the bank of one of the richest guys around, JP Morgan. Morgan and a bunch of investors put up the money for the power plant. Edison was with them. ISRAEL: So at 3 P. M on September 4th, Edison flicked on the switch here at JP Morgan's office. GOLDSTEIN: And what happened? ISRAEL: It went on. . . (LAUGHTER)ISRAEL: . . . and as did lights all over the district. About a square mile of Lower Manhattan suddenly was lit by electricity. GOLDSTEIN: To light a square mile of Lower Manhattan, Edison needed a whole financial system. He needed patents, a way to protect his ideas so no one would steal them. He needed a company, a way a bunch of different investors could come together and risk money - a lot of money - to build a power plant and lay wires so you could try this crazy thing, light without fire. Edison came along at a time when all this financial machinery - patents, corporations, banks - was in place. KESTENBAUM: So the Babylonians worked a day to get 10 minutes of light. GOLDSTEIN: Four thousand years later, in the 19th century with kerosene lamps, a day's labor got you five hours of light. KESTENBAUM: By the time Bill Nordhaus does his light study in the 1990s, if you work a day, how many hours of light do you get? NORDHAUS: Maybe 20,000. KESTENBAUM: Twenty thousand hours? (LAUGHTER)NORDHAUS: Twenty thousand hours, yeah. Not bad. (LAUGHTER)NORDHAUS: I mean, basically, you have your house lit up, you have your streets lit up - you're saturated with light. GOLDSTEIN: The story of light is the story of lots of things. It's why now with a day's wages, you can buy an evening's worth of light and dinner, and a beer. KESTENBAUM: And a book and a bus ticket. GOLDSTEIN: Maybe a piece of cake and a hat. I'm Jacob Goldstein. KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And now, 4,000 years of economic growth in seven minutes. This story comes, of course, from our Planet Money team. David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein bring us the history of light and how the world came what it is today. DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Before you could get light at the flick of a switch, there were other options - none of them very good. Jane Brox wrote a book called \"Brilliant: The Evolution Of Artificial Light. \" In the tropics, she says, people would catch fireflies and make a sort of firefly lantern. And in Scotland, there was this bird called the storm petrel. JANE BROX: Which is a very oily seabird, which they'd catch and dry and thread a wick down its throat and then light it. And then that was a lamp. KESTENBAUM: Just carry around a dead bird? BROX: Well, it would be on a table. (LAUGHTER) KESTENBAUM: These ways of making light, they were all a real hassle. It took a lot of time, a lot of effort. In short, light was really expensive. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Bill Nordhaus is an economist at Yale. He became obsessed with figuring out how expensive light was thousands of years ago and how it changed over time. Because light - light is this thing society has needed forever. It was a way to track progress, not just in light, but in lots of things. KESTENBAUM: Nordhaus managed to track down some economic data from ancient Babylon. And to see how much light people were getting for their money, he set up a primitive oil lamp in his dining room and measured it with a light meter. BILL NORDHAUS: And I would just measure it and write it down, just the way you see in the old movies, some guy in his lab coat writing down his measurements. KESTENBAUM: Here's the answer he got. In Babylonian times, 4,000 years ago, a day's labor would buy very little light. You could buy enough light to illuminate a room but not for very long. NORDHAUS: Maybe 10 minutes. It was really expensive. KESTENBAUM: A day's wages got you 10 minutes of light. GOLDSTEIN: This was a world where, when the sun went down, almost everyone lived in the dark. This may sound sort of romantic but basically it was awful. The dark was something dangerous, something that trapped you. In Paris, at one point, there was actually a law that said every night, everybody has to give their keys to a magistrate, go home and lock themselves in the house. KESTENBAUM: Economists talk a lot about productivity, how much a person can produce with a day's labor. Back then, the answer was not much. Everything was just hard. Growing food was hard. You worked all day and you could buy almost nothing with what you earned. The way things get better - in light and in everything - the way an economy grows, is that someone comes up with a better way to do something. GOLDSTEIN: With light, for example, people start to use whale oil. This is very, very bad for whales. Economic growth was not all good. But whales have a lot of fat. They were these big swimming sources of fuel. KESTENBAUM: But for thousands of years, the advances in light and in everything, else are pretty minor - things don't change much. And light is still expensive until, Bill Nordhaus says, around 1800. NORDHAUS: You look at the picture of what happened here, it's economic history in a nutshell. From Babylonian times to around 1800, even though there were improvements, as best we can tell, they were very modest. And then around 1800 in the lighting - you can see it so clearly in lighting - just an enormous change in the pace of improvement. KESTENBAUM: In the 1800s, we start to have more scientists, people devoting themselves to methodical experimentation. And around 1850, a guy in Canada comes up with something that's not just a slightly better wick or a more efficient lamp. It's this magical liquid. With the right techniques, you can get it from coal or oil. GOLDSTEIN: This big breakthrough, kerosene. Again Jane Brox. BROX: When the first kerosene lamps came out, it was - as one historian said, it was the kind of oil people had dreamed about for centuries. GOLDSTEIN: Kerosene burned brighter. It was cleaner. And Bill Nordhaus says it was a lot cheaper. In Babylonian times, a day's labor got you 10 minutes of light. Now? NORDHAUS: Kerosene, you get about five hours. KESTENBAUM: Whoa. NORDHAUS: Kerosene lit the world and saved the whales. KESTENBAUM: In the 1800s, we finally get a little economic growth. People don't have to huddle in the dark at night anymore. Streetlights become more common. People start going out more at night. GOLDSTEIN: So we have kerosene. What's the next big advance after that? NORDHAUS: OK, next big advance after that is the electric lamp. GOLDSTEIN: The big one. NORDHAUS: Well, you might think so. KESTENBAUM: I thought I knew the story of Thomas Edison. You know, Edison trying out all these different filaments until he gets the one that will glow for hours. But this eureka light bulb moment, it alone is not enough to get you to the world of cheap light. Edison needed something else. He needed money - lots of money because you can't light a light bulb without electricity. He needed to build a power plant. GOLDSTEIN: And there's this historic moment in 1882. They're about to throw a switch to turn on the power plant and light up part of New York City. Where is Edison when they switch it on? He's not at the power plant. He's at a bank. PAUL ISRAEL: He was where he needed to be, with the people who had funded the whole thing. KESTENBAUM: This is Paul Israel, an Edison scholar. We met him outside what back then was the bank of one of the richest guys around, JP Morgan. Morgan and a bunch of investors put up the money for the power plant. Edison was with them. ISRAEL: So at 3 P. M on September 4th, Edison flicked on the switch here at JP Morgan's office. GOLDSTEIN: And what happened? ISRAEL: It went on. . . (LAUGHTER) ISRAEL: . . . and as did lights all over the district. About a square mile of Lower Manhattan suddenly was lit by electricity. GOLDSTEIN: To light a square mile of Lower Manhattan, Edison needed a whole financial system. He needed patents, a way to protect his ideas so no one would steal them. He needed a company, a way a bunch of different investors could come together and risk money - a lot of money - to build a power plant and lay wires so you could try this crazy thing, light without fire. Edison came along at a time when all this financial machinery - patents, corporations, banks - was in place. KESTENBAUM: So the Babylonians worked a day to get 10 minutes of light. GOLDSTEIN: Four thousand years later, in the 19th century with kerosene lamps, a day's labor got you five hours of light. KESTENBAUM: By the time Bill Nordhaus does his light study in the 1990s, if you work a day, how many hours of light do you get? NORDHAUS: Maybe 20,000. KESTENBAUM: Twenty thousand hours? (LAUGHTER) NORDHAUS: Twenty thousand hours, yeah. Not bad. (LAUGHTER) NORDHAUS: I mean, basically, you have your house lit up, you have your streets lit up - you're saturated with light. GOLDSTEIN: The story of light is the story of lots of things. It's why now with a day's wages, you can buy an evening's worth of light and dinner, and a beer. KESTENBAUM: And a book and a bus ticket.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. U. S. employers were in a hiring mood in April. That's the takeaway from the government's monthly jobs report released today. It shows 288,000 jobs added to payrolls. That's the biggest monthly job growth in nearly two and a half years. NPR's John Ydstie has more on the report, which also included a big drop in the unemployment rate. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Today's jobs data show the weather concerns that plagued the economy this winter are behind us, says Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. CARL TANNENBAUM: Hiring momentum has clearly picked up. Since we had weather-related interruptions early this year, the payrolls have been growing more rapidly and there is beginning to be a rotation away from part-time hiring to full-time hiring. YDSTIE: That's a good sign. Another good sign is that hiring was solid across most sectors of the economy, from professional services to construction. However, the big drop in the unemployment rate to 6. 3 percent turns out to be not as positive as it first appears. Tannenbaum says that's because it was due largely to a decline in the number of people participating in the labor market, possibly because they still believe jobs are too hard to come by. TANNENBAUM: It was a little disappointing to see labor force participation decline after rising for four consecutive months. YDSTIE: But economists caution that changes in participation should be taken with a grain of salt because the survey that number comes from is quite small can be volatile. Another positive, says Tannenbaum, was a drop of 287,000 in the number of long-term unemployed. TANNENBAUM: But it remains at a very high percentage of the overall unemployed. It is likely that it will take more than Fed policy in order to get the transition to new opportunities complete for those people. YDSTIE: Tannenbaum suggests more job training and incentives for businesses to hire the long-term unemployed. He thinks today's jobs report is unlikely to prompt any changes in Fed policy.

One of them is Minnesota. Its unemployment rate is 4. 8 percent, well below the national average. NPR's Sonari Glinton went to Minnesota to find out why. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: One of the places that's seen growth in Minnesota is St. Cloud. Now, it's about 65 miles northwest of downtown Minneapolis. That's where I met up with Brian Schoenborn. He's a lawyer and he helped develop a part of the downtown area called Fifth Avenue Live. BRIAN SCHOENBORN: We'll go into what's called the Davidson Opera House. So, this was the original theater in St. Cloud. It's been renovated into co-working space. And so there's a company on the first floor called Live Edit that's just moving in right now. You'll see it as you go here through the left side. You can see here this is the original advertising for Battle Ax tobacco. So, it's an old tobacco company from the late 1800s. GLINTON: Schoenborn has lived in St. Cloud all his life - actually, his ancestors were among the first European settlers in the area. He says the city never got that big rainmaking company or supersized factory. SCHOENBORN: This is not a one-horse town. It's very diverse. There are some common themes, some common threads, like healthcare, like education. We don't have this one major business that dominates our community. And as a result, you either rise or fall based on that. We have a much more broad-based economic recovery happening here in central Minnesota. GLINTON: One of the things that sets St. Cloud apart and Minnesota as whole is healthcare and education. St. Cloud has St. Cloud State University and other colleges, plus a major hospital. Minnesota is a major center for education with a highly skilled populace, plus it's a center for healthcare - especially with the Mayo Clinic in the southern part of the state expanding. Then there is this other factor, the oil boom in neighboring North Dakota. For instance, Schoenborn needed some repair work done on his house and he called his contractor, Randy. SCHOENBORN: And talked to his wife. And his wife said, well, Randy's in North Dakota. You'll have to call him in about four months because he's just gone. And so, as a result, the people who are left here are busier because the normal people that you'd rely on are already out in North Dakota helping. And so they're relying on a lot of labor and business assistance from the state of Minnesota. LUKE GREINER: If I were to identify a single industry that is holding back as far as employment goes, I would probably identify manufacturing. GLINTON: Luke Greiner is with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. He researches the jobs picture in the region. Greiner says, as much growth as there's been in healthcare and education in the region, and the spillover from energy, the economy is still struggling to fill in the holes left by manufacturing. GREINER: Unfortunately, in industries such as manufacturing that employs so many people and is so important, can kind of hold back the overall employment picture. GLINTON: Another thing that may have hurt the employment picture is the terrible winter that ravaged Minnesota and the country. But King Banaian, an economist at St. Cloud State University, says when the weather slow growth it creates this pent-up demand that gets unleashed, especially here in Minnesota. It's called the catch-up effect. KING BANAIAN: And that catch-up effect, when it happens, typically is fairly quick. So, if you have a really bad quarter, like we just had in the first quarter with a very cold January and February, you'll see a turnaround. And in that second quarter is that demand that got delayed in the first quarter comes back to you in the second. GLINTON: Banaian says Minnesota and the U. S. are in a period of economic calm. BANAIAN: The zombies are overseas and maybe things like what happens if China does go into a deep recession and stops wanting U. S. crops? What happens if there is a conflagration in Europe? I think the threats to the Minnesota economy as well as the U. S. economy are external right now. GLINTON: Banaian he says we shouldn't be waiting around for the economic zombies to attack - not yet.

S. in the beginning of the year, according to the government. That slowdown was blamed largely on winter storms that clobbered much of the country last winter. Recent data suggests the economy has warmed up. There's hope that will be confirmed this morning when the monthly job numbers for April are released. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics has expectations for the April employment numbers, right in line with what lots of economists are projecting. IAN SHEPHERDSON: I'm pretty hopeful that when we get the payroll figures for April that we will be back to where we were before the weather started to effect the numbers and maybe even a bit better. YDSTIE: That would put job growth back above the 200,000 a month level. That's right where a survey done by the private payroll processing company, ADP, came in. Earlier this week, it reported that businesses added 220,000 jobs last month. A survey of economists by Dow Jones produced a number in the same ballpark with an expectation that it would move the unemployment rate down a tick to 6. 6 percent. And after its meeting this week, Fed policymakers released a statement saying they believe economic activity has picked up and the labor market will continue to improve gradually. But Paul Edelstein of IHS Economics says the housing sector is one potential hurdle for stronger employment growth that won't be solved simply by better weather. PAUL EDELSTEIN: The housing market has a lot of other problems. Affordability isn't as good as it was a couple of years ago 'cause prices are up and mortgage rates are up. Construction costs are up as well and that's hurting builder margins. And, of course, credit is still tight, not just for buyers, but for land developers. YDSTIE: Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, says there are other things he'll be focusing on in today's jobs report beyond the top-line job creation and unemployment rate numbers. CARL TANNENBAUM: Our prospect's improving enough so that people who have been laying low and maybe not actively looking for work will come back in and become more active. What is the fraction of part-time hiring, which remains at a record fraction of overall hiring? Will more people find full-time work as opposed to part-time? YDSTIE: In recent surveys, the number of part-time workers who want full-time employment has been abnormally high. The other area Tannenbaum says he'll look for is the level of long term unemployment. TANNENBAUM: There are an unusually high number of people who have been out of work for 26 weeks or longer. We always want to see that working its way down. YDSTIE: The longer people stay unemployed, the more difficult it is for them to find jobs, both because their skills atrophy and employers view them with suspicion. These underlying issues are just the ones the Federal Reserve has decided it should be focusing on as it decides how much support it should be providing for the economy.

I'm Arun Rath. The economy has been struggling for so long, the release of the government's monthly jobs report has turned into a somber ritual. But April's report which came out yesterday brought good news. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCASTS)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, breaking news. The jobs numbers are a big story this morning. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 288,000 jobs created. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: The unemployment rate drops down to 6. 3 percent. RATH: Now, if you look out your window, you're not likely to see people dancing in the streets. Unemployment fell so sharply in part because 800,000 people dropped out of the labor force. Employers say there are still some jobs out there and they're having a hard time filling them because the workers lack essential skills. And that's our cover story today - bridging the skills gap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Of course, behind all those government statistics there are real people, like Ricardo Corros. He's been a truck driver for years but for him the golden ticket would be working in an oil refinery. That shouldn't be a problem. There are seven oil refineries operating right here in the L. A. area,. But it's not so simple. RICARDO CORROS: I didn't know how to get into a refinery. I heard it takes three years to get into a refinery itself. I didn't know the first step. There's online applications you can do but out of all the emails I don't think people are going to call you back unless you know somebody; a cousin or uncle, and I don't. RATH: We'll get back to Ricardo in a bit but first, more on the skills gap and his potential employers. The easiest time to get hired at a refinery is during what's called a turnaround. That's when they have to shut down for routine maintenance. Now every second a refinery is shut down, money flies out the window. So companies want to do the turnaround as fast as possible. That requires hiring hundreds of people. But those workers require specific skills and need to hit the ground running. Here's Steve Martinez. He has to hire people to staff these turnarounds. STEVE MARTINEZ: They need to have specialized training, particularly in safety protocols. And in the course of a lot of general population particularly looking for blue-collar work are not going to have those requisite skills. RATH: Martinez is in charge of west coast hiring for a company called Veolia. Refineries hire his company to help with these turnarounds. He's mostly looking for what are called middle-skill positions, jobs like safety attendants, who watch to make sure everything is running smoothly and safely; hydro blasters, those are workers who clean out the inside of oil tanks. And special onsite truck drivers. All of these positions pay about $14 or $16 an hour and require special training and credentials. The jobs are grueling. And although Veolia has a good safety record, they're a lot more dangerous than working at Starbucks or a Target. But the economy has been so bad that every time companies in the region would post a job, they'd get hundreds, even a thousand applications. And even still they were having trouble. Here's Martinez again. : We have recruited in the past from all sectors of the job market. And we've seen a lot of candidates coming from different industries. But we still suffered with folks that were lacking some basic skills that we assumed, you know, the general population had a grasp on. We have found, you know, probably more cases than not that some of the employees that we've had lacked a certain level of computer skills. Reading skills were low and retention skills were low. RATH: That right there is the skills gap. The Workforce Investment Act and other government programs are supposed to fill in that gap by helping to train workers, but often they don't work. A report from the Government Accountability Office back in December found that a full 80 percent of job training centers reported employers approaching them for help filling positions but leaving empty handed. That's exactly what Steve Martinez was seeing for years. : Because we weren't finding the right candidates to fill these positions, we were importing them from other parts of the country, you know, from our other locations like in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Texas area. We'll import them, we'll house them. You know, we'll pay per diem for them. That gets expensive. RATH: The Chevron refinery in El Segundo has a big turnaround coming up, but now they're looking for workers closer to home. Just outside of L. A. , I joined a couple dozen people who were training to be safety attendants during that Chevron turnaround and others going on this year. It's a group of men mostly, although I do see one woman among the trainees. They gather in clusters around three hands-on stations. KEN ACKBAR: Give me the basic PPE to require to have on as a safety attendant, a hard hat. . . RATH: That's Ken Ackbar. He's drilling one of the trainees on the necessary PPE, that's personal protective equipment. TRAINER: OK. And a full gas meter? OK. And a reflective vest or a fluorescent vest because of high visibility, right? RATH: Ken Ackbar is pointing now to a row of fire extinguishers. And beyond that, a big dark platform that contains a pool of liquid with a metal structure in the center. TRAINER: What I want you to do is take that fire extinguisher and get over there. You're going to do a visual inspection of it and make sure your equipment is good. And then once you're comfortable that it is good, you're going to walk over and position yourself strategically where you think it is best where you need to be to put this fire out. And when you're ready, just say ready and then I'm going to light it for you. RATH: The instructor flips a switch and a fire flares out from the center of the platform. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Fire, fire. RATH: The trainee takes a confident stance near the fire, not too near, and douses it with the extinguisher. He has it put out in about 10 seconds. JASON VOGEL: Although it's entry level, it's a very important position. RATH: This is Jason Vogel. He's the architect of the safety attendant training program. VOGEL: Because if the safety attendant doesn't show up, well, then the craft workers can't work. So the welder, the carpenter, the pipefitter, all those guys can't go in unless the safety attendant is there. And they still get paid so. . . RATH: Vogel used to teach classes for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at a nearby university. A few years ago he heard about companies like Veolia, shipping and refinery workers from the Gulf Coast and thought he could do better. He partnered up with a group called the Occupational Safety Councils of America or OSCA, and asked the refineries directly what they were looking for. VOGEL: The program was built from industry. We didn't build it and hope it met their standards. We had them build it so we knew it met their standards. RATH: Here's the other key part of the OSCA training. The program is set up under the umbrella of a California community college district. That's crucial because the district is a government-approved training provider. In other words, they receive Workforce Investment Act dollars to train people looking for jobs so those people don't have to pay out of pocket for all those classes. The government is paying to give people the training and credentials they need to get jobs the employers are desperate to fill. They're just entry level jobs at first but those credentials and training stick with them. Again, Jason Vogel. VOGEL: We make sure they understand that if you take these courses it doesn't mean you're automatically going to become the safety manager at the jobsite. But what it does is it gives you the training and the background where if you do a good job and you put your, you know, years of experience in it, it opens up opportunities for you to have a safety career. RATH: Back at the training, it's that prospect of a career that has the trainees excited. One of them is Ricardo Corros. You remember him from earlier. CORROS: I didn't know how to get into a refinery. I didn't know the first step. RATH: Ricardo started working as a truck driver after leaving the Army in 2004. It's frustrating, he says, not much of a career ladder. It was when he was shuttling oil and waste between the refineries and the harbor that it struck him. The refinery workers had what he wanted. CORROS: A lot of them worked four on four off, 12 hours a day, hard work but good money. And it seemed like something I'd like to do for the rest of my life. RATH: So would you have had a shot, do you think, if not for this program, not for this. . . CORROS: Not really, with no experience. No, I don't think so. RATH: One of his classmates here today Soynika Brown-Johnson has already gone out and paid for one of those necessary credentials, but she still can't find steady work either. And she tells me she can't afford to pay for any additional training. SOYNIKA BROWN-JOHNSON: It costs. The classes that I have taken already, they've cost me out of my pocket, either traveling to another state to take the classes or either I had to - I went to Dominguez and I actually had to pay $750. So that's - this is a big difference when you can take the classes for free compared to coming out your pockets to pay for it. RATH: Brown-Johnson has been underemployed for years. Now she's said to make $14 or $16 an hour working 12-hour days every day until the turnaround is over in two or three months. And she's already dreaming of a promotion to a full-time refinery safety manager, aka a red hat. BROWN-JOHNSON: A red hat is like the ultimate, it's like a supervisor of all of the safety personnel. So you go and you do audits and you make sure everybody's following the rules of the refinery. It's a nice place to be, you know, financially and, you know, just to be up there to walk around with a red hat and to know what you're doing and, you know, you're very respected. RATH: Initially her work as a safety attendant will only line up with the refinery turnarounds. So she'll have to wait to take classes in the off-season. But unlike before, she won't have to pay out of pocket for additional training. And she's more confident there will actually be work on the other side. BROWN-JOHNSON: Actually, when I was standing in line on Monday to sign up, to check in, I was like, I'm excited. Like, my heart was beating. I was just excited because I haven't did it in a while, and I enjoy myself out there. Like, it's something different. RATH: After we first talked to her, we found out Soynika Brown-Johnson got a job with Irwin, a contractor similar to Veolia. And Ricardo Corros, the guy who couldn't find a way into the refinery industry, he got a job with Veolia. If things at the refinery go according to schedule, they'll both start working on Monday. These two people and most of the others in this program have found jobs that could turn into careers. But we're talking about a relatively small number of workers in one narrow slice of a big industry in one region of one state. A Government Accountability Office study in March reported that in 2011, hundreds of thousands of people used federal funds to pay for job training. But even the GAO has no idea how many of those people have landed jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: This is NPR News. ARUN RATH, HOST:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. The economy has been struggling for so long, the release of the government's monthly jobs report has turned into a somber ritual. But April's report which came out yesterday brought good news. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCASTS) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, breaking news. The jobs numbers are a big story this morning. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 288,000 jobs created. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: The unemployment rate drops down to 6. 3 percent. RATH: Now, if you look out your window, you're not likely to see people dancing in the streets. Unemployment fell so sharply in part because 800,000 people dropped out of the labor force. Employers say there are still some jobs out there and they're having a hard time filling them because the workers lack essential skills. And that's our cover story today - bridging the skills gap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RATH: Of course, behind all those government statistics there are real people, like Ricardo Corros. He's been a truck driver for years but for him the golden ticket would be working in an oil refinery. That shouldn't be a problem. There are seven oil refineries operating right here in the L. A. area,. But it's not so simple. RICARDO CORROS: I didn't know how to get into a refinery. I heard it takes three years to get into a refinery itself. I didn't know the first step. There's online applications you can do but out of all the emails I don't think people are going to call you back unless you know somebody; a cousin or uncle, and I don't. RATH: We'll get back to Ricardo in a bit but first, more on the skills gap and his potential employers. The easiest time to get hired at a refinery is during what's called a turnaround. That's when they have to shut down for routine maintenance. Now every second a refinery is shut down, money flies out the window. So companies want to do the turnaround as fast as possible. That requires hiring hundreds of people. But those workers require specific skills and need to hit the ground running. Here's Steve Martinez. He has to hire people to staff these turnarounds. STEVE MARTINEZ: They need to have specialized training, particularly in safety protocols. And in the course of a lot of general population particularly looking for blue-collar work are not going to have those requisite skills. RATH: Martinez is in charge of west coast hiring for a company called Veolia. Refineries hire his company to help with these turnarounds. He's mostly looking for what are called middle-skill positions, jobs like safety attendants, who watch to make sure everything is running smoothly and safely; hydro blasters, those are workers who clean out the inside of oil tanks.

I'm Scott Simon. And this week, the U. S. Commerce Department reported that economic growth had nearly flatlined for the first three months of 2014. So the initial reaction to yesterday's glowing April jobs report is pretty exuberant. Hiring picked up more than expected with an increase of 288,000 jobs. And there was a big drop in the unemployment rate to 6. 3 percent. But examining some of the details of the report caused some analysts to check their enthusiasm. Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: For the past three years, Heidi Shierholz has gotten used to saying pretty much the same thing about the Labor Department unemployment reports, except yesterday. HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: This was one of the stranger reports I've seen in a long time. NOGUCHI: Shierholz is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. SHIERHOLZ: At first blush, it looked great. The unemployment rate dropped substantially to 6. 3 percent. But you look one level deeper and you find that that drop in the unemployment rate was not for good reasons. NOGUCHI: The not good reason is that the labor force shrank. The labor force is not just made up of people who are working. It also includes people who are looking for work. The percentage of Americans in the workforce fell back to one of the lowest levels in decades. MICHAEL STRAIN: The labor force shrunk by 800,000 workers. That erases gains in the labor force from the last two months. NOGUCHI: Michael Strain is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He says the decline creates a kind of mathematical distortion. It makes the jobless rate seem healthier than it is, but only because fewer people are counted as unemployed because they simply aren't looking for work anymore. In a normal job recovery, you'd expect to see more people coming back into the workforce. STRAIN: So we want the unemployment rate to decline because people are coming into the labor force and firms are hiring them, not because people are leaving. NOGUCHI: Strain says one of the oddities of the report is the fact that hiring increased, but that didn't translate into greater motivation among prospective workers feeling more optimistic about their chances of finding a job. And Strain says that probably didn't happen because there still isn't enough momentum to motivate people off the sidelines. STRAIN: I'm left with roughly the same view of the recovery as I had before the report. NOGUCHI: The White House was quick to point out the good news, the big increase in the number of people on business payrolls. But Jason Furman, the chairman of president's Council of Economic Advisers, also said this. JASON FURMAN: We never try to get too excited when it's above expectations. We never try to get too down when it's below expectations. NOGUCHI: But Furman adds, this year is already looking better than last year and not just because of the pickup in hiring. Last year, the economy had to contend with the sequester, a government shutdown, and a debt ceiling debate. FURMAN: This year, we've had a budget agreement that bought back 60 percent of the sequester. We dealt with the debt limit without any drama. NOGUCHI: And that has the White House optimistic the job market will continue to improve. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.

Gary Becker was 83. He had taught at the University of Chicago since the late 1960s. In 1992, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his pioneering application of economic theory to social questions. NPR's John Ydstie has more on Gary Becker's legacy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Becker was a giant in the field of economics. One of his students and eventual colleagues, Steven Levitt, took a look at which economist in recent years had inspired the most research by other economists. Levitt, the co-author of the best-selling book \"Freakanomics,\" found that Becker was by far the most often cited. Part of the reason for his influence was that Becker pushed the use of economic theory into the social realm, studying marriage, drug addiction, crime and racial discrimination. In an interview on this program on the day he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992, he talked about the marriage market. GARY BECKER: It's not an organized market the way the stock market is or a bazaar is in the Middle East, but it's a market nevertheless with the property that there are different people in this who are looking to get married. Not everybody can marry the same wonderful man or woman, and they have to make choices. And they may have met somebody who they're pretty happy with. They wonder about whether if they'd waited they'd meet somebody better, and these are the kinds of choices one makes in other markets. So using market as a metaphor, but I think it's a very good metaphor for what goes on here. YDSTIE: Becker basically argued that people operate as rational agents in every aspect of life. That sparked controversy when he concluded that many people who choose a life of crime are making a rational choice based on opportunities, risks, and rewards. BECKER: You know, the man and woman on the street wouldn't find that very surprising at all. It's the intellectuals usually who are so surprised by that simple idea, that, yes, crime is, you know, a response to choice. YDSTIE: So he concluded, deterring crime requires increasing the cost or punishment. His own choice to park illegally when he was late for an appointment sparked Becker's research in this area. Becker was a student of the free market champion Milton Friedman, also a University of Chicago professor. Like Friedman, Becker was a skeptic of government interference in markets, including redistribution of incomes to reduce rising inequality in the U. S. Here he is in 2007. BECKER: I think inequality in earnings has been mainly the good kind. I strongly believe it's been mainly the good kind. YDSTIE: The view that inequality is good was partially based on Becker's research on human capital, and the need to incentivize investments in education. BECKER: If you're in an environment where knowledge counts for so much, then if you don't have much knowledge, you're going to be a loser. YDSTIE: Allowing more-educated workers to earn more and keep more of their incomes incentivizes others to get more education and adds to their human capital. That's better for them, and for the whole society Becker argued. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Becker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, by President George W. Bush. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

They wonder about whether if they'd waited they'd meet somebody better, and these are the kinds of choices one makes in other markets. So using market as a metaphor, but I think it's a very good metaphor for what goes on here. YDSTIE: Becker basically argued that people operate as rational agents in every aspect of life. That sparked controversy when he concluded that many people who choose a life of crime are making a rational choice based on opportunities, risks, and rewards. BECKER: You know, the man and woman on the street wouldn't find that very surprising at all. It's the intellectuals usually who are so surprised by that simple idea, that, yes, crime is, you know, a response to choice. YDSTIE: So he concluded, deterring crime requires increasing the cost or punishment. His own choice to park illegally when he was late for an appointment sparked Becker's research in this area. Becker was a student of the free market champion Milton Friedman, also a University of Chicago professor. Like Friedman, Becker was a skeptic of government interference in markets, including redistribution of incomes to reduce rising inequality in the U. S. Here he is in 2007. BECKER: I think inequality in earnings has been mainly the good kind. I strongly believe it's been mainly the good kind. YDSTIE: The view that inequality is good was partially based on Becker's research on human capital, and the need to incentivize investments in education. BECKER: If you're in an environment where knowledge counts for so much, then if you don't have much knowledge, you're going to be a loser. YDSTIE: Allowing more-educated workers to earn more and keep more of their incomes incentivizes others to get more education and adds to their human capital. That's better for them, and for the whole society Becker argued. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Becker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, by President George W. Bush.

It's a story of an effort to reshape the housing finance industry. The measure addresses the industry that it was at the heart of the financial crisis. It's also an industry at the heart of the American Dream and the bill before Congress may affect who can afford to buy a house. The Obama administration supports this bipartisan bill. Civil rights groups and housing advocates do not, because it would weaken rules pushing banks to lend to low-income homebuyers. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Since the housing crash, there's been a lot of talk about doing a really historic overhaul of the U. S. mortgage market. And this bipartisan bill could be the last best shot at doing that during the Obama presidency. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan is trying to help push it forward. SHAUN DONOVAN: This is the most important piece of repairing the damage from our financial crisis that remains. ARNOLD: The bill aims to protect taxpayers from having to bail out financial firms in another housing crash and Secretary Donovan says it would do a lot to promote affordable housing. DONOVAN: We would be able, under the current bill, to dedicate $5 billion a year to affordable housing. That's the largest new investment in affordable housing we've had in more than a generation. ARNOLD: But housing advocates and civil rights groups say that they're actually worried about this bill. That's in part because of a section in it entitled the repeal of mandatory housing goals. Mike Calhoun is the president of the Center For Responsible Lending. MIKE CALHOUN: The bill explicitly abolishes affording housing goals. ARNOLD: Calhoun says these goal had required that a certain percentage of loans be made to low and moderate income people, but the bill gets rid of these mandatory goals, making them voluntary with a set of financial incentives. That's because many conservatives blame the mandatory lending rules for causing the financial crisis and the bill needed support from Republicans. CALHOUN: Those who argue that the crisis was caused by over government regulation, encouraging banks to offer loans to low or moderate income families. ARNOLD: So the new bill softens those regulations. WADE HENDERSON: Many of us are skeptical. ARNOLD: Wade Henderson heads up the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which includes groups ranging from the NAACP to the AARP. He worries about losing those mandatory goals. HENDERSON: The new proposed system, that bill promised to deliver more in the way of actual dollars for affordable housing, has loopholes and it's not clear that that will be the case. ARNOLD: HUD Secretary Donovan, though, says that just look at the foreclosure crisis and that shows you that the current system is broken and it needs to be fixed. DONOVAN: African Americans lost half their wealth between 2005 and 2009 so anybody who tells you that the current system is serving those families well is missing the point. We need reform here to serve the very families that those groups advocate on behalf of. ARNOLD: But Henderson and Calhoun say one of the big reasons all those people got hurt so badly is that folks on Wall Street were making a lot of money packaging up risky home loans that people couldn't afford. The Justice Department is now winning billion-dollar settlements over that. And Calhoun says despite that, this bill gives Wall Street firms a freer hand to do what they want. CALHOUN: It turns over the home mortgage system to Wall Street and the bigger banks. ARNOLD: So we asked HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan about that. I've heard the criticism that the reform in this bill takes power from government and shifts it to Wall Street. Why is that a good idea? DONOVAN: Well, Chris, let me ask you a question on that. If that were true, why is Wall Street fighting so hard for the status quo? We see ads every day that are complete misinformation about this bill trying to undermine it because Wall Street is supporting the status quo. ARNOLD: Actually, Mike Calhoun says, most of that resistance is coming from just a tiny slice of Wall Street, a few hedge funds that made big stock bets on something. He says many more big banks and financial firms support the bill. In any case, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan says he believes that this would be a good thing for the country and he's hopeful that these concerns could be addressed so that it can gain more support. The bill could be voted on in a Senate committee later this week. Chris Arnold, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  This next story poses some fundamental questions.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty. The success or failure of that war has been debated ever since. As part of our anniversary coverage, NPR's Pam Fessler is reporting on the difficulties of living in poverty and on how hard it is to get out. Today, she brings us this story from Steuben County in western New York. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Desiree Metcalf's story is heartbreaking but not unique. There are many Desirees among the 46 million Americans who are poor today. This one is 24 years old, the mother of three little girls - six, four and two. They all have different fathers. DESIREE METCALF: That about sums me up, I think. FESSLER: Desiree is sitting on the floor of her two-bedroom apartment in Bath, New York. A fish tank gurgles in the background. A tiny kitten peeks out from under the furniture. Her youngest daughter is curled up under a blue blanket, head resting on her mother's lap. METCALF: Are you shy? No? OK. FESSLER: Desiree got married two years ago to a man who isn't the father of any of her children but he recently left her for someone else. METCALF: Oh, I just feel like I get one piece of good news that makes me, hey, life isn't going to be that bad and then here comes 30 things to basically push me right back down in this hole that I've been trying to dig myself out of for the last probably 15 years. FESSLER: Fifteen years. Desiree did not just become poor. A lot of bad things happened to get her here. Like others who are poor, she doesn't have just one or two problems, but a whole pile of them. METCALF: A long story. FESSLER: Desiree was raised by a single mother, also poor. Desiree says they didn't always get along. And things came to a head when she was 12. METCALF: My mom and I got in a fight and she told me she was going to kill me. And I wrapped a belt around my neck and told her I would do it for her. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital and from there I went to foster care. FESSLER: And from home to home to home. She attended 26 different schools. METCALF: Seems I'd just get my bags unpacked and it was time to move again, so. FESSLER: Desiree admits she was no saint. METCALF: I used to be an alcoholic. I used to self-harm. FESSLER: Which means she cut herself to feel the pain. Today, she has tattoos on her arms to cover the scars. METCALF: I smoked cigarettes like a chimney. MARIAN RECELMAN: I first knew Desiree when she was 15 and I was in a different agency working with her family with the goal of reunification. FESSLER: That's Marian Recelman, now with ProAction, a local non-profit agency, still trying to help. RECELMAN: She did come back and graduated from high school and was all set to go to college. FESSLER: In Florida, with a full scholarship. RECELMAN: And then turned up pregnant. FESSLER: Yup, another single teenage mom. But again, not that unusual. Half of all girls in foster care get pregnant by the time they're 19. Desiree knew that her life had taken a detour. METCALF: That was my ticket out of here, so to speak. So, here I am. Not in Florida. FESSLER: Like many before her, Desiree carried her poverty into adulthood, doing odd jobs with periods of homelessness and hunger. But here's what's even more disturbing: that poverty is now starting to take its toll on her children, especially her oldest daughter, who recently tried to run away from home in the middle of the night. METCALF: She's got some emotional issues. And, I mean, we went through everything from making ourselves puke after we eat to running away to wanting to kill themselves and she's six years old. FESSLER: Six years old. So, you might be asking yourself, isn't there some help this family can get? Well, yes, there's plenty. The government and charities have spent thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars, on Desiree and her family - on food stamps, health care, housing, Head Start - many of the programs that emerged from the war on poverty. But clearly they haven't done the trick, for many reasons. First, Desiree can't get a job, even though the government spent almost $3,000 to train her as a certified nursing assistant. METCALF: That's something I've always wanted to do. FESSLER: But her car was recently totaled by someone backing out of a driveway. METCALF: So, now my vehicle is gone and have no way to get back and forth to work reliably and, unfortunately, there's not much in this town as of work and. . . FESSLER: Mass transit is virtually nonexistent in this rural area. And with her husband gone, Desiree - like many low-income workers - has something else to worry about. METCALF: If you get a job and they take you off public assistance, then they don't pay for daycare. FESSLER: An expense that would likely eat up most of her earnings. And Desiree faces another Catch-22. She knows if she starts making money, other benefits, like food stamps, will be cut or eliminated. Just recently, her family's food stamp benefit dropped from $700 a month to $200 because her daughter started to get big Social Security checks to treat her emotional issues and her husband began working part-time at McDonalds. Of course, now he's gone. METCALF: I guess the system, to me, seems backward. I mean, they should be more for helping you, not kind of setting you up to fail, so to speak. FESSLER: And there's one more thing: you might notice that Desiree is sometimes difficult to understand. That's because most of this 24-year-old's top front teeth are missing. Gum disease. Medicaid paid $3,000 for a partial bridge, but now she can't use it because her other teeth are crumbling. METCALF: It doesn't bother me. I got summer teeth - some are here, some are gone, some are somewhere. FESSLER: But it's probably not helping much with her job search. Social worker Marian Recelman says Desiree could get more dental work using Medicaid, but. . . RECELMAN: There are very few providers who will accept it and none in this community. So, you have to find one and then travel to it. FESSLER: Again, Desiree has no transportation. It's seems there's a roadblock at every turn. RECELMAN: It's distressing because you have to be so motivated and capable to navigate those systems and come out ahead. FESSLER: It's a complaint that you hear again and again, not just from those who get government aid but also from providers. Kathryn Muller is the commissioner of social services for Steuben County. She says her office provides many services for struggling families. KATHRYN MULLER: Really, it's sometimes handholding. It's working with employers and putting case managers with individuals who are starting employment and helping them. FESSLER: But, she says, sometimes their hands are tied by state and federal law. One example: Welfare recipients can meet their work requirements by going to school but only for one year. MULLER: One year is great. It's better than what used to be, but you can't get an associate's degree in one year. FESSLER: Even though, she says, one of the main reasons people can't get work here is a lack of education. Muller says some of the limits are there to prevent people from abusing the system but there's also a misperception about the poor. MULLER: It's not a chosen lifestyle. Certainly there is abuse out there, there's abuse no matter what it is. But it's not a chosen lifestyle. FESSLER: Desiree could not agree more. She just wishes it wasn't such a struggle to get help. Amazingly, though, with all she's been through, she still hopes she'll someday get to college. METCALF: Someday. I haven't given up my dream yet. I just keep putting it on the back burner, until it ain't raining so hard, I guess. FESSLER: Pam Fessler, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.

S. census, 46 million Americans live in poverty. Millions more are close to that official definition of poverty. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's a reminder that not quite everything has changed since President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty began 50 years ago. INSKEEP: One thing that has changed is that the percentage of people in poverty went down. MONTAGNE: Here's another thing. Poverty looks different. Visit the homes of people living below the poverty line and you might find a flat screen TV, a computer, the latest sneakers. INSKEEP: That raises questions about what it means to be poor in America today. NPR's Pam Fessler reports. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: At first glance, Victoria Houser's life doesn't look all that bad.  She lives in a cozy two-bedroom apartment in Painted Post, a small town in Western New York. She has food, furniture and toys for her almost two-year-old son, Brayden. Right now he's playing a game called Fruit Ninja on her electronic tablet. VICTORIA HOUSER: He just likes touching it because he always sees me on my computer, my iPad, or something. FESSLER: Brayden's father is out of the picture, and Houser knows, as a 22-year-old single mother, she could be a lot worse off. At least she has a job, $10 an hour preparing food at a company cafeteria. Still, you don't have to look too far to see her life is teetering on the edge. This nice-looking apartment? HOUSER: It's kind of not a very safe place to live. There've been quite a few drug busts here. FESSLER: Not to mention a next-door neighbor arrested for allegedly murdering someone and stuffing the body in a cupboard. HOUSER: I don't even let him play outside because I'm scared of the people that are here. FESSLER: But this subsidized housing is all that Houser can afford. Most of her paycheck goes for things like food and diapers and gas. And she says what look like luxuries are mostly gifts from family or friends. And for her they're necessities - a car to get to work, a computer to take online college courses, a cell phone to check up on her son. HOUSER: What's a lion say? What's a doggie say? What's a doggie say? FESSLER: But there's one thing Houser doesn't have, and that's a lot of hope for the future. HOUSER: Basically, I'm stuck here. FESSLER: In what she sees as a never-ending cycle, with a constant fear that one emergency will send everything tumbling down. HOUSER: Poor to me is the fact that I'm working my butt off. I'm trying to go to school. I'm trying to take care of my son and that's just not enough. FESSLER: And it's this frustration and despair that those who work with struggling families say is the true face of poverty today, that it's not just a lack of material things. Kelly Wells says she sees it all the time. KELLY WELLS: It used to be that if you were poor, you just didn't have the basic things, like maybe you didn't have a washer and dryer and you were able to get by. FESSLER: She's with Pro Action, a local nonprofit that tries to help people like Victoria Houser. Wells says today things are very different. WELLS: Now what I see with families is if you're poor, you're poor in every avenue: emotionally, support-wise, family-wise. FESSLER: Another sign of poverty today? Many families ripped apart by drug abuse, domestic violence, mental illness. At the Family Resource Center in the town of Bath, a young mother plays with her giggling nine-month-old son. The mother is petite with long curly brown hair and a huge black eye. She gets to visit her son here once a week. She lost custody because of suspected drug abuse and violence in the home. The father is in jail. The father's stepmother now cares for the boy. She's just come here to pick him up. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: He was in a lot of danger remaining there and CPS basically told me either I take custody or he has to go to foster care, so and I wasn't going to let that happen, so. FESSLER: The stepmother says that she and her husband now care for three of their grandchildren. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You know, we want them to have a good work ethic, morals, values. We don't want them learning the kind of things that they would learn at home. FESSLER: Social workers here say they're seeing it more and more - stressed out families, kids paying the price. Marsha Patrick runs the local Head Start program. She said she had to hire nine extra classroom workers this year to deal with increasingly unruly kids. MARSHA PATRICK: Everything will be fine and then all of a sudden they are literally off the wall. They might be walking on the tables. They might run up and down on the radiators. Or, you know, they just cannot control whatever it is that's making them go off like that. FESSLER: She suspects that it's the strain of living with adults who are overwhelmed or who don't have the skills they need to raise children because they themselves came from troubled homes. Her program is trying to break the cycle. But Patrick says it's difficult, with factory jobs that used to support a middle class here disappearing in droves. PATRICK: Unless we have those jobs to offer those folks, then, you know, they're going to feel good about it and want to go to work for and do - the kids are going to be the ones who are suffering and we're seeing it. FESSLER: Of course poverty is about more than a lack of jobs. It can also mean isolation. The yard around Frank and Amber Adams' trailer home in rural Hammondsport is filled with chickens and ducks, cats and dogs. Frank, who's 41, has been poor his entire life. He says it's been a lot of ups and downs, mostly downs. He survives by selling scrap and doing odd jobs and masonry work. He built most of his trailer home himself. FRANK ADAMS: We have children. This is our boys' room. This is my other boy's room, and then we have our laundry room. FESSLER: Frank and Amber have seven children between them from other relationships, but the children are scattered about. One is in a juvenile detention center. Right now Amber's goal is to regain custody of her youngest three. But first she has to clean up her act. She's a recovering crack addict. So is Frank. He says it's pretty common around here.

The economy, maybe they don't have a job so they gotta sell some of the drugs to make money, and then they get addicted to the drug themselves. FESSLER: But a year ago. . .

FESSLER: Now he's helping Amber through counseling, although Frank says sometimes he has to redeem empty soda cans just to buy gas to take her to class. I ask him if it's harder being poor today than when he was young. F ADAMS: I believe it is because people aren't as outgoing and gracious as they were back in the day. Back in the day your neighbors helped each other. FESSLER: And that's another big difference for poor families today. They might have TVs and cell phones, but researchers say they can be more disconnected than ever, from neighbors, work, family, all those social networks that help people through life. When we finished talking, Amber takes a picture off the wall. It shows six of their seven children dressed up for their wedding last summer. And she reads the words written on the side.

INSKEEP: Pam continues her reporting on families living in poverty this afternoon on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Here we are, the richest nation on Earth and according to the U. S. census, 46 million Americans live in poverty. Millions more are close to that official definition of poverty. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  It's a reminder that not quite everything has changed since President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty began 50 years ago. INSKEEP: One thing that has changed is that the percentage of people in poverty went down. MONTAGNE: Here's another thing. Poverty looks different. Visit the homes of people living below the poverty line and you might find a flat screen TV, a computer, the latest sneakers. INSKEEP: That raises questions about what it means to be poor in America today. NPR's Pam Fessler reports. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: At first glance, Victoria Houser's life doesn't look all that bad.  She lives in a cozy two-bedroom apartment in Painted Post, a small town in Western New York. She has food, furniture and toys for her almost two-year-old son, Brayden. Right now he's playing a game called Fruit Ninja on her electronic tablet. VICTORIA HOUSER: He just likes touching it because he always sees me on my computer, my iPad, or something. FESSLER: Brayden's father is out of the picture, and Houser knows, as a 22-year-old single mother, she could be a lot worse off. At least she has a job, $10 an hour preparing food at a company cafeteria. Still, you don't have to look too far to see her life is teetering on the edge. This nice-looking apartment? HOUSER: It's kind of not a very safe place to live. There've been quite a few drug busts here. FESSLER: Not to mention a next-door neighbor arrested for allegedly murdering someone and stuffing the body in a cupboard. HOUSER: I don't even let him play outside because I'm scared of the people that are here. FESSLER: But this subsidized housing is all that Houser can afford. Most of her paycheck goes for things like food and diapers and gas. And she says what look like luxuries are mostly gifts from family or friends. And for her they're necessities - a car to get to work, a computer to take online college courses, a cell phone to check up on her son. HOUSER: What's a lion say? What's a doggie say? What's a doggie say? FESSLER: But there's one thing Houser doesn't have, and that's a lot of hope for the future. HOUSER: Basically, I'm stuck here. FESSLER: In what she sees as a never-ending cycle, with a constant fear that one emergency will send everything tumbling down. HOUSER: Poor to me is the fact that I'm working my butt off. I'm trying to go to school. I'm trying to take care of my son and that's just not enough. FESSLER: And it's this frustration and despair that those who work with struggling families say is the true face of poverty today, that it's not just a lack of material things. Kelly Wells says she sees it all the time. KELLY WELLS: It used to be that if you were poor, you just didn't have the basic things, like maybe you didn't have a washer and dryer and you were able to get by. FESSLER: She's with Pro Action, a local nonprofit that tries to help people like Victoria Houser. Wells says today things are very different.

I'm Michel Martin. We'd like to begin today's program by talking about immigration. This week the Obama administration announced plans to allow the spouses of some highly skilled, temporary immigrants to work in the United States. The administration hopes this change will help keep the best and brightest technology workers and scientists in this country. But there are critics on both sides. Some say the proposal is too narrow, others say their promise leaves fewer jobs for Americans. We wanted to hear more about what this change could mean. So we've called upon Laura Murray-Tjan. She is an immigration lawyer and professor at Boston College Law School. She joins us from Boston. Welcome. Thanks for joining us. LAURA MURRAY-TJAN: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: Also joining us is Vinny Lingham. He is co-founder and CEO of gyft. com. He's an immigrant from South Africa. He's advocated for immigration and visa reform. And he's with us from Stanford, California. Mr. Lingham, thank you so much for joining us as well. VINNY LINGHAM: Yeah, thank you for having me. MARTIN: So, Laura Murray-Tjan, let me start with you, professor. This proposal affects workers on something called H-1Bs. And that could be hundreds of thousands of people. But it doesn't affect all of them, am I right? MURRAY-TJAN: That's correct. It actually affects a narrow group of them. So H-1Bs, like you said, they're specialty occupation workers primarily in the STEM fields - so science, technology, engineering and mathematics. And this affects the spouses of those workers who are already on a path to obtaining permanent residency. MARTIN: So these are people - aren't just people who are just here working who expect to stay here for the - the H-1Bs are generally - what? - six years. They - visas for six years? So people during that time who've applied for permanent residency, a green card, they are the people who can apply. Is that correct? MURRAY-TJAN: Exactly. And their employers have to have sponsored them for those green cards. So it's not a unilateral decision on their part. MARTIN: OK, go ahead. So why - Vinny, I want to hear from you as well. But what does this allow - what change will this make? Is this a big change? Since it doesn't affect all of these workers, it'll only affect some. Is this still a significant change? LINGHAM: Look, every step forward is, I think, significant in the way we look at immigration reform. But it's a big change for people who have been living here, you know, for many years paying their taxes, you know, productive members of society and having spouses who are either not living with them in the United States and living back home because financially they can't afford to do that or living locally but not being able to, you know, contribute to society effectively. And so therefore, you know, it puts pressure on the families 'cause you've got, you know, one working spouse. And, you know, I think it's just fair, right? Someone has been here for a couple years. They are on the path to permanent residency, and I personally think that the spouse should have probably been able to work from the beginning. I think if you bring - if someone is coming across on a highly skilled visa, and, you know, what's the point of leaving the spouse at home not being able to do anything? And so, you know, but fundamentally we're moving in the right direction. I think more could be done, but there are challenges to that. MARTIN: Laura, could you explain to us - Professor Murray-Tjan, could you explain to us, like, what - what it is - amplify the issue that Mr. Lingham is talking about here. What is the problem that this is designed to address? And I'd also wanted to ask you why do you think it's evoked kind of a strong reaction, particularly even on the Republican side where a lot of people on the Republican side have traditionally been supporters of immigration that favors highly skilled workers? So talk a little bit about that, if you would? MURRAY-TJAN: Sure. Please do call me Laura, instead of professor. That does go down easier, believe it or not. MARTIN: OK. MURRAY-TJAN: Well, there are two problems. One of the problems is that the Republicans are afraid of executive overreach. They're afraid that Obama is experimenting with exercising executive discretion - giving work cards, for example, to the deferred childhood arrivals. That program of June 2012, that was a first major step. Now, he comes along. He's giving work authorization to the spouses of H-1B workers. That's the immigration and nationality law title for these people - the H-1B workers. So it makes them nervous that he's taking these steps towards unilaterally authorizing people to either remain or to work. And of course they're worried about displacing American workers. And that has gotten - that has gotten spoken a lot about in the past few days by people like Senator Jeff Sessions and Senator Chuck Grassley. That's their stated concern, in addition to the executive overreaching. MARTIN: And can you - have you, as a lawyer, addressed people who have been in this situation? Talk a little bit about that. MURRAY-TJAN: As a lawyer, I do not actually do H-1. . . MARTIN: No, I'm asking you, like, what - in the field, like, is thus one of those pressing concerns? Or is this a. . . MURRAY-TJAN: This is a huge, huge issue. MARTIN: And tell me. . . MURRAY-TJAN: This is a gigantic issue. MARTIN: Tell me why. MURRAY-TJAN: Well, the H-1B cap was reached within a week of the application period. There are so many more workers who want to obtain this visa than can. And there are tech companies clamoring for these workers. So it is viewed as an enormous problem both by the immigration bar and by the tech companies themselves. MARTIN: Mr. Lingham, what about that? I mean, is this - do you view this as kind of a competitive issue, that - you are a permanent resident with a green card yourself. You're the CEO of a startup in Silicon Valley. Do you see this as part of a kind of a competitive advantage in trying to hire the best people, offering this? LINGHAM: Well, I mean, so one of the people startups have right now is that we really can't compete with the big guys. We're struggling. And the talent pool is big, but it's very tight. So hiring engineers, it's, you know - it's a challenge. So, you know, the only way for us to solve the problem typically is to look elsewhere for talent because if, you know, Google, Facebook, you know, they're sucking up the thousands of workers that are already here, we have to pull workers in from, you know, other places. Now, you can have two arguments to this. You could argue, well, we should be pulling them in from other parts of the United States. But the reality is, we, you know - as startups, we need to hire people who typically are coming out of grad school, studied for, you know, computer science, etc. And there's just a limited number of graduates. I mean, the U. S. only has, you know, 5 percent of the world's population. So if you look at sort of the niches we all play in, in certain areas of focus, who are highly skilled, they may only be, call it - you know, I'm throwing out numbers here - but a couple of hundred people in a specific field related to machine learning, for example. So if they're all going to the Googles and Facebooks of the world, you got to look elsewhere, right? So there is a - just a mathematical need for us to look elsewhere because we just don't have enough grads in the U. S. in certain fields. And, you know, the Obama administration and, you know, many other other political groups have been advocating for STEM. And there are just not enough sort of STEM - science, technology, education, mathematics - graduates. MARTIN: Can I ask you about that, though, Mr. Lingham? I have two questions I wanted to ask you briefly, if you can. That, first, to address the argument that some of the Republicans have made and presumably some other - presumably some Democrats would agree with this - that this really relieves pressure on the educational system to produce more American graduates. LINGHAM: Right, but we've actually misaligned the incentives 'cause what we do is we give universities in the U. S. gradings. And we tell them, well, you know what? You should accept more people from international countries and educate them here because that will give you higher rankings when we rank the schools. So guess what? We go in our universities, you know, who are partially funded by taxpayer money, you know, to an extent, go and bring in people from around the world to create diversity in the classroom. But then these people can't work in our country, and we ship them back to their country of origin. That makes no sense to me at all. MARTIN: Is it also that many of these spouses are also highly skilled themselves? Is that part of it? LINGHAM: I mean, typically, you don't really get - you know, use the disparity between people who are highly skilled and the spouses they choose. Sometimes, you do. And sometimes, they're not even in the same field. So, you know, it doesn't mean that just because one person is a scientist the other one is going to be a scientist. It just could be, you know, a lawyer and an artist or a scientist and an artist. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the same, you know, industry or field. I think, you know, when you look at the problem just purely from a quantitative perspective, I think we've got something like 500,000 H-1Bs, and of those, 100,000 have got applications in for green cards, permanent residency. So if, for example, all of them are going on to the green cards and all their spouses were put on - you know, given work permits, that's 100,000 extra workers, you know, into the market. Now, if you're looking at the sort of, you know unemployment numbers, we're talking millions. I mean, this is not even a - this is a fraction of the number of workers that are out there right now. And, quite frankly, I think given where these - where their spouses probably work and the areas they're working in, there may be pockets where jobs are available, and they can fill the need. But I think it's much more - it's much better to have productive members of society than people being forced to sit at home. MARTIN: Laura, can I ask you a question in the time that we have left? Is that - does the administration have the capacity to process all of these applications? I mean, as you just - you mentioned earlier that there's already been - the administration has decided to administratively move forward with what it had hoped to do legislatively, which is to allow deferred action on children who are brought here as children by parents, even if the parents are themselves not here with proper authorization. So that's a huge number of people, is it not? So do they even have the capacity administratively to process this because part of the issue here is the backlog, right? MURRAY-TJAN: Well, there are no conditions attached to those spouses' employment authorization documents. So it's actually a fairly quick and easy process. You prove that you're in the process of applying for a green card, and you file an application for work authorization. And it's actually quite simple. So I would anticipate that that would not grow into a substantial backlog. MARTIN: So - and, Laura, finally, what are these spouses doing now? If they can't work. . . MURRAY-TJAN: They might be. . . MARTIN: . . . What do they do? MURRAY-TJAN: They might be going to school. They might be staying at home for their children because most of these spouses, anecdotally, are in fact wives. You do hear stories about depression, alienation, suicidality. It's a major problem. And, you know, it was interesting. One of Vinny's first comments was that this seems fair. It really is a humanitarian issue. It's almost cruel to the spouses of the skilled workers to have to remain home and end their careers when they could be productive members of our society, like Vinny said, raising children while working, being role models for their children in terms of women in the workplace. And instead, they're being forced to languish and sacrifice their own talents. So like he said, I think it's only fair. You know, of course the president could have gone further and granted work authorization to all of these spouses. But it would have faced much more blowback from the opponents to this policy. MARTIN: So even the temporary workers - you're saying that some advocates would like even the temporary workers to have had the right to have their spouses to work. And briefly - we don't have that much time - but do you have any sympathy for the other side of the argument, that people say, well, this reduces pressure on American universities to train more STEM graduates? MURRAY-TJAN: I have never heard that argument. I've heard what Vinny said, that we actually fear a brain drain as our highly skilled graduates are leaving the country because they can't get visas. And, yes, Obama could have given visas to all of the H4s. MARTIN: Lara Murray-Tjan is an immigration lawyer and professor at Boston College Law School. Vinny Lingham is cofounder and CEO of gyft. com. Thanks to you both for joining us. We appreciate it. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin.

But the reality is, we, you know - as startups, we need to hire people who typically are coming out of grad school, studied for, you know, computer science, etc. And there's just a limited number of graduates. I mean, the U. S. only has, you know, 5 percent of the world's population. So if you look at sort of the niches we all play in, in certain areas of focus, who are highly skilled, they may only be, call it - you know, I'm throwing out numbers here - but a couple of hundred people in a specific field related to machine learning, for example. So if they're all going to the Googles and Facebooks of the world, you got to look elsewhere, right? So there is a - just a mathematical need for us to look elsewhere because we just don't have enough grads in the U. S. in certain fields. And, you know, the Obama administration and, you know, many other other political groups have been advocating for STEM. And there are just not enough sort of STEM - science, technology, education, mathematics - graduates. MARTIN: Can I ask you about that, though, Mr. Lingham? I have two questions I wanted to ask you briefly, if you can. That, first, to address the argument that some of the Republicans have made and presumably some other - presumably some Democrats would agree with this - that this really relieves pressure on the educational system to produce more American graduates. LINGHAM: Right, but we've actually misaligned the incentives 'cause what we do is we give universities in the U. S. gradings. And we tell them, well, you know what? You should accept more people from international countries and educate them here because that will give you higher rankings when we rank the schools. So guess what? We go in our universities, you know, who are partially funded by taxpayer money, you know, to an extent, go and bring in people from around the world to create diversity in the classroom. But then these people can't work in our country, and we ship them back to their country of origin. That makes no sense to me at all. MARTIN: Is it also that many of these spouses are also highly skilled themselves? Is that part of it? LINGHAM: I mean, typically, you don't really get - you know, use the disparity between people who are highly skilled and the spouses they choose. Sometimes, you do. And sometimes, they're not even in the same field. So, you know, it doesn't mean that just because one person is a scientist the other one is going to be a scientist. It just could be, you know, a lawyer and an artist or a scientist and an artist. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the same, you know, industry or field. I think, you know, when you look at the problem just purely from a quantitative perspective, I think we've got something like 500,000 H-1Bs, and of those, 100,000 have got applications in for green cards, permanent residency. So if, for example, all of them are going on to the green cards and all their spouses were put on - you know, given work permits, that's 100,000 extra workers, you know, into the market. Now, if you're looking at the sort of, you know unemployment numbers, we're talking millions. I mean, this is not even a - this is a fraction of the number of workers that are out there right now. And, quite frankly, I think given where these - where their spouses probably work and the areas they're working in, there may be pockets where jobs are available, and they can fill the need. But I think it's much more - it's much better to have productive members of society than people being forced to sit at home. MARTIN: Laura, can I ask you a question in the time that we have left? Is that - does the administration have the capacity to process all of these applications? I mean, as you just - you mentioned earlier that there's already been - the administration has decided to administratively move forward with what it had hoped to do legislatively, which is to allow deferred action on children who are brought here as children by parents, even if the parents are themselves not here with proper authorization. So that's a huge number of people, is it not? So do they even have the capacity administratively to process this because part of the issue here is the backlog, right? MURRAY-TJAN: Well, there are no conditions attached to those spouses' employment authorization documents. So it's actually a fairly quick and easy process. You prove that you're in the process of applying for a green card, and you file an application for work authorization. And it's actually quite simple. So I would anticipate that that would not grow into a substantial backlog. MARTIN: So - and, Laura, finally, what are these spouses doing now? If they can't work. . . MURRAY-TJAN: They might be. . . MARTIN: . . . What do they do? MURRAY-TJAN: They might be going to school. They might be staying at home for their children because most of these spouses, anecdotally, are in fact wives. You do hear stories about depression, alienation, suicidality. It's a major problem. And, you know, it was interesting. One of Vinny's first comments was that this seems fair. It really is a humanitarian issue. It's almost cruel to the spouses of the skilled workers to have to remain home and end their careers when they could be productive members of our society, like Vinny said, raising children while working, being role models for their children in terms of women in the workplace. And instead, they're being forced to languish and sacrifice their own talents. So like he said, I think it's only fair. You know, of course the president could have gone further and granted work authorization to all of these spouses. But it would have faced much more blowback from the opponents to this policy. MARTIN: So even the temporary workers - you're saying that some advocates would like even the temporary workers to have had the right to have their spouses to work. And briefly - we don't have that much time - but do you have any sympathy for the other side of the argument, that people say, well, this reduces pressure on American universities to train more STEM graduates? MURRAY-TJAN: I have never heard that argument. I've heard what Vinny said, that we actually fear a brain drain as our highly skilled graduates are leaving the country because they can't get visas. And, yes, Obama could have given visas to all of the H4s. MARTIN: Lara Murray-Tjan is an immigration lawyer and professor at Boston College Law School.

I'm Melissa Block. Timothy Geithner was president of the New York Federal Reserve when the Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. A few months later, he'd become President Obama's Treasury secretary, the crisis deepening on his watch. He takes it all on in a new book out today called \"Stress Test. \" He details one crisis after another, helping to engineer the unwinding of Lehman, Bear Stearns and the nation's biggest thrift, Washington Mutual to name a few. Geithner sat down to talk about his thought process during that time with my colleague, Robert Siegel. ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: Timothy Geithner acknowledges the deeply mixed reviews he got as Treasury secretary. Wall Street types take him for a crypto socialist champion of excessive government intervention and regulation. Occupy Wall Street types take him for a tool of the banks. Geithner sees himself as a guy who was trying to get the financial system out of multifaceted crisis with the threat of a Great Depression looming. TIMOTHY GEITHNER: You know, it's like you're in the cockpit of the plane, your engine's burning, smoke's filling the cabin, it's filled with a bunch of people that are fighting with each other about who's responsible, you have terrorists on the plane and people want you to come out of the cockpit and put them in jail. And you have to land the plane. That terrifying core objective in a crisis is to make sure you first put out the fire. SIEGEL: There's a moment in the book when you give vent to a sentiment that you more typically dismiss as an Old Testament urge to punish.  You write this: I used to joke that there would be less moral hazard if financial executives had to put up their own homes as collateral, the head of assets of their firms. And you describe walking past an oceanfront mansion of a former head of Bear Stearns, the bankrupt Wall Street firm, and saying that one should have been the first loss. Isn't that exactly what your critics on the left felt and still feel? GEITHNER: Well, people on the right and the left both believe that there was a way to save the country from disaster and still let the system all apart, impose losses on creditors. But in a financial panic, as we saw in '08, it's the opposite of what makes sense to protect people. In some sense, the paradox of this is the only way to reduce damage to the innocent victims of a crisis is to make sure you keep the lights on. Because if you don't keep the lights on in a financial system, then you're going to face depression level unemployment. That's the paradox of it. SIEGEL: You describe the collapse of Washington Mutual, the nation's biggest thrift at the time, as, and I quote, one of the least appreciated episodes of the crisis and one in which you write the U. S. government made things worse. Your antagonist in that case was the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila Bair. What did she do that struck you as so wrong? GEITHNER: Well, I want to do this in the fairest way. And that was a terrible mistake and it was a completely avoidable mistake because in that moment, even though the crisis was at its most - the country was at its most perilous state and that panic was gaining momentum, in that context, what the FDIC did is use the normal playbook and they gave that bank to another bank for a very cheap price and imposed losses or haircuts on the creditors of Washington Mutual. And what that happened - and it happened within a matter of minutes, it was like adding fuel to the fire. And that fire that was already burning bright and hot, spread to imperil, in a matter of days, some of the much stronger banks across the country. SIEGEL: You're saying because the creditors of Washington Mutual were forced to settle for a lot less than 100 cents on the dollar, what they. . . GEITHNER: Yeah, just to be fair. And to Sheila Bair's credit and the credit of her colleagues at the FDIC, they reversed course very quickly. SIEGEL: But you were very critical of her at the time. You are in the book. In Andrew Ross Sorkin's article in the New York Times Sunday magazine, Sheila Bair returns the favor. Sorkin quotes her as saying of your policies, putting up walls of money to restore faith in the banks, Tim had no idea whether the government's money would be lost. Taxpayers will never be adequately compensated for the tremendous risks he took with their money. Did you actually have an idea that the government's money would not be lost and that this was safe? GEITHNER: You know, we didn't do this with the expectation we would make money for the taxpayer. We did it with the knowledge that only by taking risks the market wouldn't take would we be in a position to prevent mass unemployment on the global scale. And that knowledge was informed by the judgment and the record of history. Now, the fact that we earned a return on the rescue, well over $100 billion, of course, does not compensate people for the damage caused by the crisis. Of course, it couldn't and it couldn't -- there's no way it could. But if we hadn't designed the rescue as forcedly - and, of course, what Sheila Bair did at the FDIC was part of that rescue - we would have left people with much more damage and much more damage to the country. SIEGEL: But these haircuts for Washington Mutual's creditors, which you describe as adding fuel to the fire, annoyed you so much, later on, the government bailed out the auto companies and I remember Chrysler bondholders, I believe it was, claiming that their rights were being trampled when they took haircuts in the accelerated bankruptcy. They lost. It worked. Life went on. It didn't fuel any greater fire. GEITHNER: Excellent question. And you know, it's just that this is a core, hard thing we don't like to admit, and it seems unfair, but, you know, banks are different. They're different because their existence depends on, in a way that's different from any other industry, their ability to convince people to keep their money in the bank. And when they lose that ability, then they cannot function. And when they can't function, as you saw in the wake of Lehman and Washington Mutual, what they have to do is liquidate assets at a terrible loss and that adds fuel to the fire. SIEGEL: But when you speak of the unique thing about banks, I'm reminded of the Wall Street veteran Felix Rohatyn once telling me that he came from the times when banks were in the business of conserving wealth, protecting wealth, not creating wealth. It seems that the banking sector that was there before you became head of the New York Fed, the banking sector as it now exists, puts its credibility on the line all the time by creating things like synthetic collateral debt obligations, exotic instruments that sometimes the banks themselves don't even understand. So they've increased the risk of loss of credibility by that standard. GEITHNER: I think you should think about this slightly differently. This was not a crisis caused by financial innovation on a massive scale. It wasn't a crisis caused fundamentally by a set of new fancy things that, in retrospect seem very risky. It was a crisis caused because we had a long period of confidence that it was safe to lend a lot of money, safe to borrow a  lot of money relative to income, that your house prices would never fall, that recessions would be short and shallow. No memory of panic, no memory of depression. And what happened in that environment was that people ended up taking too much risk. SIEGEL: Now you argue that in the book, that these were old fashioned causes behind the collapse. I just. . . GEITHNER: In fancy new forms. SIEGEL: But, you know, my reaction was it's like saying I got robbed because I forgot to lock the door in my house. It's a simple, old fashioned reason. But if the lock, you know, on my house is some kind of a combination lock where you have to solve three quadratic equations to lock the door, I've hugely increased the risk of leaving my door unlocked. And it seemed to me that the complexity and what passed for innovation, I just can't, in my own mind, eliminate it from responsibility either way. GEITHNER: Let me try it this way and see if this is more convincing. What happened in our financial system before the crisis was over a period of decades the system outgrew, found a way around all the safeguards we put in place after the Great Depression. And we allowed this whole new set of risky institutions to grow and build and become massive and huge. And to prevent that risk, all you need to do, and I'm saying, you know, I'm trying to reach for a simple thing, maybe I'm making your point, is force that set of core institutions to hold sticker shock absorbers against the risk of loss. Because you cannot know what the future brings. SIEGEL: (unintelligible) when you say we did this, we made the securities that way, would say actually they did. The people who were issuing the securities managed to get all the regulations changed in their favor, to make the financial sector exactly what it was at the beginning of the. . . GEITHNER: But to understand the perception, given the scale of innovation, but the vital, critical decisive problem was a more simple problem, which is people did not anticipate the risk that house prices might fall, we could face a bad recession and that might induce a financial panic. SIEGEL: One of the first things you write about was your maiden speech as Treasury secretary. And you write that your own judgment, quote, \"it sucked,\" unquote. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: I've spoken with Henry Paulson who preceded you as Treasury secretary. And he recalls, he says his greatest regret is having been unable to persuade people that what Washington did wasn't to help banks, it was to help people. Why such poor communication? GEITHNER: Well, you know, I wasn't hired to be the communications guy and I wasn't good at it. I don't think anybody found a way to, in that moment, to explain and describe it. And I think that's because at its core the things we have to do the work going to look like we were rewarding the arsonists. And it is, I think, impossible to expect a normal human to explain to them that the only way to protect them from that risk was to reward the people who had taken a lot of risk with their money. And I think at its core, that's why governments typically do a terrible job in financial crises. SIEGEL: You were the most unlikely of Treasury secretaries by resume, not a banker, not a politician or a corporate CEO, not an economist, what makes a good Treasury secretary? GEITHNER: It sort of depends on the moment, I think. And I tell the story the book about when I first met him, and he told me that he might have asked me to come to Washington. I. . . SIEGEL: President Obama, we're talking about. GEITHNER: President Obama, then-Senator Obama. I tried very hard to talk him out of it because I felt at that time that there were better choices. And that I was already so up to my neck in the choices we'd already made, that I was very proud of, I would distance myself from, would complicate his capacity to try to rebuild confidence. SIEGEL: Things that you had part of at the New York Fed. GEITHNER: Yeah, because we'd already at that point, you know, done a set of necessary things to try to break the panic that were what fed this deep sense of unfairness. And my view was if he, understanding my weaknesses and my experience, asked me to do it, when your president asks you to do that in a moment of crisis then you say yes to that. SIEGEL: Well, what did he say in response to your eloquent explanation of. . . (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: . . . why you weren't the man for the job? GEITHNER: He seemed unmoved. (LAUGHTER)GEITHNER: He seemed unmoved by the (unintelligible), you know. . . SIEGEL: You fail to communicate again. GEITHNER: I failed to communicate again. It was just a failure of communication, typical thing for me. (LAUGHTER)GEITHNER: But I am kind of lucky. I feel so lucky he asked me to do it and I so admire him. SIEGEL: Well, Timothy Geithner, former secretary of the Treasury and author now of \"Stressed Test: Reflections Of Financial Crises,\" thanks a lot for talking with us again. GEITHNER: Thank you, Robert. BLOCK: And you can read an excerpt of Geithner's new memoir at NPR. board. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BLOCK: Stay with us. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED continues right after this.

The electricity is not hooked up yet so there's a portable generator running in the driveway. DE DESHARNAIS: Until we start sheet rocking, most of the guys expect to work with a generator. They don't expect to have power here. ARNOLD: The stairs to get up to the front door are still on the to-do list too. DESHARNAIS: We simply are waiting on some stairs. (LAUGHTER)ARNOLD: I think I can get up there. Alright. Desharnais is Vice President of Operations for Ashwood Development, which builds subdivisions like this one in New Hampshire. Over the past 30 years they've built 3,000 houses but not too many since the housing crash. Back before the market got overheated in a normal year they'd be selling. . . DESHARNAIS: We were probably closing like 60 or 70. And we'd come in, we buy the, forest so to speak. We put in the roads and then we start building the houses. So we do it from, you know, A to Z. So now we are down to probably 30 a year. ARNOLD: That's about half of normal. And we've been seeing that same slump around the whole country for more than five years now. We haven't seen anything close to that kind of a long-term construction crash since WWII. IAN SHEPHERDSON: This is a completely unprecedented collapse. ARNOLD: Ian Shepherdson is chief U. S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. SHEPHERDSON: What we learned was that if you pump enough leverage into a housing market, and then take it out very quickly, you can see collapses the likes of which you never even imagined. And that's exactly what happened. ARNOLD: So homebuilding remains a kind of sleeping giant. If it wakes up, it could create a lot of good paying constructions jobs and manufacturing jobs for people making windows and dishwashers and lawn-mowers. It can offer a real boost. And last spring it seemed like that boost was coming. SHEPHERDSON: Things seemed to be coming back and we were seeing a big pickup in house prices and construction was picking up, as well. Everyone got very excited but then mortgage rates went up. And at that point things came fairly quickly to a jibbering halt. And they haven't got any better since then. ARNOLD: Shepherdson thinks housing is now caught in a serious pickle. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low for a long time. But as the economy improves rates are going to keep rising, that's just what tends to happen, and if home-buyers disappear when rates go up. . . SHEPHERDSON: We're sort of stuck and that's what the survey evidence seems to be suggesting, that the home-builders are not seeing any sort of bounce that everyone was expecting after the winter. After the weather got better, we were looking for the homebuilder survey to come in a bit stronger today and it didn't happen. ARNOLD: Shepherdson thinks in this recovery housing is going to continue to disappoint and remain very sluggish. Still other economists are more optimistic. And that same survey, from the National Association of Homebuilders, reported more optimism that sales will pick up over the next six months. (SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION)DESHARNAIS: Hey, guys. We're insulating this one, these guys will probably, I'm guessing from the looks of the wrap up, later today or tomorrow morning, I'm guessing. ARNOLD: In New Hampshire, De Desharnais is feeling optimistic, too. DESHARNAIS: The spring, quite honestly, we've seen more traffic on our sites this spring than we've seen in years, seven years probably. I do see a lot more sold signs popping up and stuff. So yeah, we are hopeful. ARNOLD: Tomorrow, the Commerce Department will release its latest numbers on how many new homes are actually getting built. Chris Arnold, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   There's something missing from the recovery in the housing market, and that is new houses.

Johnson declared a national war on it. Our arts reporter Neda Ulaby decided to look at one of the very few jobs where poverty is romanticized. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: It's seen as somehow ennobling to be poor if you're a Franciscan friar or an artist. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ULABY: That's from a recent production of \"La Boheme\" put on by the Pacific Opera Project in Los Angeles. It's run by Josh Shaw, who says its story of starving artists hits a little close to home. JOSH SHAW: Yeah. I mean, there's been times recently times when I practically had nothing in my bank account. ULABY: Shaw says almost everyone in his company works multiple jobs - waiting tables, teaching music, writing for little publications. Their lives are not too different from the artsy bohemians' in Puccini's opera. SHAW: And it just kind of hit us like man, why don't we produce this. ULABY: But how is its story of suffering romantically for art's sake faring in an age of rising income inequality? (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GIRLS\")ULABY: In the HBO series \"Girls,\" young faux bohemians subsidize their Brooklyn rents with handouts from their parents. Playwright and performer Mike Albo loves \"Girls,\" even though it bears little resemblance to the vision of fabulous poverty he aspired to decades ago. MIKE ALBO: I moved to the city thinking like, ooh, but I'm like Patti Smith. I'll just sleep on a mattress and, you know, eat one potato. ULABY: But Albo says his romance with artistic poverty is dead. ALBO: Lets see, today I have $280 in my bank account, and I'm going to the dentist and so I've got to pay that off on my credit card. My credit card limit is $600. I have $300 on my credit cards, so I think I can pay my dental bill. That is the plate spinning that I'm doing to live in New York right now. ULABY: And that is why a new generation of artists would never dream of a glamorously poor existence almost anywhere, much less in the capital of the art world. BIANCA DIAZ: I mean, it's sort of impossible. Like New York, I mean you can't live for there. And to live for there is really sad. ULABY: Bianca Diaz lives in Pilsen. That's a Mexican-American neighborhood in Chicago that's also been for years an artists' enclave. It was actually founded more than a century ago by Bohemians - the real ones from Czechoslovakia. Diaz graduated last year from the Rhode Island School of Design, where she says her classmates showed zero interest in living in garrets and eating ramen noodles. DIAZ: Yeah, I really don't feel like people are sort of glamorizing poverty as much. ULABY: She says they're more interested in glamorous technology. A YouTube channel might be today's equivalent of a raw loft space on Avenue B. Musician Stefin Brackett sees a deeper problem than the rising costs of life in cities and that's how artists are viewed broadly. STEFIN BRACKETT: We're not laborers, we're not working. ULABY: All kinds of Puritan projections are put on jobs like his, he says, that are fundamentally about creating visions, not pulling paychecks. BRACKETT: Because we are living this kind of dreamed upon lifestyle, I think there's kind of like a passion tax. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ULABY: Brackett is an MC with a group called the Flobots. They try to redress what they see as the general devaluation of the arts by bringing music education to public schools in Denver. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)ULABY: Arts education is itself impoverished, even though study after study points to its importance in a post-industrial global economy. One year after Lyndon B. Johnson started the War on Poverty, he approved the National Endowment for the Arts that supports artists and arts education. Its current budget, says visual artist William Powhida, is about a $146 million. WILLIAM POWHIDA: And that's for everything from dance to theater, including the visual arts. ULABY: Just compare that, he says, to today's private art market. On Tuesday night, in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at Christy's in New York. POWHIDA: If you had like you a two percent tax on just the auctions in New York, you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights. ULABY: Critics might call that wealth redistribution. Powhida finds it strange and not a little cruel that art is one of the most excessive markers of income inequality, even as artists tend to be among the least well paid workers in the art industry.

All this year, NPR is devoting special coverage to the issue with stories about what poverty looks like today. In a minute we'll hear one reporter's story about covering poverty in America and why there's so much disagreement about how to solve it. But first, another economic disagreement, this one over inequality. Many economists agree that the vast wealth gap is a big problem. But they also say some level of inequality is necessary for capitalism to work. NPR's John Ydstie explores what the right level might be and how the U. S. might achieve it. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Inequality in the U. S. has risen to levels not seen since the 1920s. The top one percent pocket more than 20 percent of the nation's income, and the 400 richest people in the country own more wealth than everyone in the bottom 50 percent. That's not healthy for society or the economy says Branko Milanovic, and economist at the City University of New York Graduate Center. For one thing, he says, it undermines the idea of equal opportunity. BRANKO MILANOVIC: It makes some people excluded or poor and unable to actually, for example, go to school, complete studies and contribute to society. YDSTIE: That hurts individuals, and Milanovic says it hurts the broader economy by not allowing a whole segment of society to be as productive as it could be. French economist Thomas Piketty has warned in his bestseller \"Capital\" that inequality is likely to grow. That's because, he says, capitalism tends to reward the owners of capital with a greater and greater share of the economy's output. Meanwhile, wage earners get a smaller and smaller share. Milanovic says that concentration of wealth is a threat to democracy. MILANOVIC: The elite start dominating the - you know, the political discourse and even political decision making, and then they reinforce their own privilege. YDSTIE: Still, Milanovic says, some level of inequality is needed to make capitalism work. MILANOVIC: It provides incentives for harder work, study, investment and, you know, general desire to better one's condition and conditions of one's kids. YDSTIE: But what's the right level of inequality? Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, says whether a certain level of inequality is good or bad depends on how it came to be. TYLER COWEN: If your society has a lot of inequality because a lot of your producers have done very well selling their products on global markets, that kind of inequality is not harmful in general. But if you have inequality because your poorer people don't have enough economic opportunities, I would say that is a big problem. YDSTIE: Cowen thinks the big rise in incomes at the top is coming mostly for the right reasons. But he's concerned that incomes are stagnating for Americans in the middle and at the bottom. He believes that's partly the result of inadequate education and the high cost of health care and housing. There was a period of declining inequality in the U. S. in the three decades after World War II. But as Cowen points out, that happened because so much wealth and capital, like factories, were destroyed in the previous three decades by two world wars and the Great Depression. COWEN: The relative equality following World War II was because we had destroyed so many things in the world, and we needed to rebuild them. And that created a lot of middle-class jobs for people. But short of having another world war, we cannot re-create those circumstances, and of course, we shouldn't try to. YDSTIE: But there were other reasons for a more equal distribution of income and wealth back then - higher taxes on the wealthy, for one. And labor economist Richard Freeman says there was another big difference between then and now. RICHARD FREEMAN: One of the key factors in that period of time was we had very strong unions. YDSTIE: Those unions bargained with the owners of capital to give workers a larger share of the economy's output. But Freeman says we shouldn't look to unions, which are much weaker now, to have a big impact. In fact, he takes a very different tack. FREEMAN: The capitalists are making money. Everybody's got to be a bit of a capitalist. YDSTIE: That's an idea as old as America's beginning, says Freeman. The founders, he says, thought broad ownership of land, a capital asset, was very important. FREEMAN: That was being driven by the notion that if we don't make sure that everybody has an ownership stake in what was the capital of that time, we were going to end up with a class of rich people separate from the middle-class. And that was not healthy for democracy. YDSTIE: Freeman advocates employee stock ownership and profit sharing as tactics for closing America's inequality gap. Branko Milanovic suggests substantial estate taxes and more equal taxation of labor and capital. Currently, income from labor is taxed at significantly higher levels. Tyler Cowen would focus on improving education and on making health care and housing more affordable to help people at the bottom do better. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Michel Martin. We'd like to begin the program today by talking about young people and housing. Buying a home used to be a major rite of passage of adulthood. But now more young people are not only putting it off, they're also moving back home with parents. According to U. S. Census data, the rate of homeownership for young adults has declined in the past decade from 43. 6 percent to just over 36 percent today. And that could have serious implications for the wider economy. We wanted to talk more about this so we've called NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax once again. Welcome back, Marilyn. Thanks for joining us once again. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. Great to be here. MARTIN: And for additional perspective, we've also called Lisa Sturtevant. She is the vice president for research at the National Housing Conference. Lisa, thank you for joining us as well here in Washington, D. C. LISA STURTEVANT: Thank you. MARTIN: So, Marilyn, let me start with you. By the numbers, it seems that the housing market is strengthening. You've reported on this. But you were talking with realtors who came to Washington last week for a conference. There's an underlying concern underneath that. GEEWAX: Yes, I spent a lot of time last week with thousands of realtors who were in town and I listened to their economists. And here's the big picture - it was a very tough winter. A lot of snow. People didn't want to go out to an open house when there's three feet of snow in the driveway. So that was a bad period. But now that it's warmed up and the snow is melting, things really have turned up. And it's looking like a pretty good year for housing, you know, prices are up, sales are looking reasonably strong, housing starts surged a lot in April. So it feels pretty good. But then, if you dig into the numbers and separate it a little bit, what you really see happening is it's the higher-end of the market that's doing well - vacation home sales are good. And the typical new home price is now about $290,000, which is the highest. . . MARTIN: That's the average new home price? GEEWAX: Yes, the median price is up to $290,000. And that is the highest ever recorded. So in other words, what's happening is the homebuilders are aiming for that - the first home being a pretty expensive home. You know, this new home is for people who have really high incomes. And that's a tough problem if you're a younger person. The statistics on that were much more dismal. They're finding that they're about - they call them the missing young people. They're missing because they're not in apartments. They're not buying homes. There are about 3 million missing young people. And where they seem to be is in mom and dad's basement. They're just staying at home with their parents. MARTIN: So, Lisa, pick up the thread here if you would - is the issue here that young people are not making enough money to get into the market? Is it that people with more money are bidding up the cost of the homes? What's going on here? STURTEVANT: Yeah. No, I think you're exactly right. I think, you know, there's problems on the demand side for young people, as we can talk more about. They're entering into the labor market in one of the worst economies that we've had in decades. And so - and not only that, as we've come out of the economic recession, the number of jobs that are being added and the types of jobs are frankly different than what we'd lost. The jobs that we're adding are lower-wage jobs. They tend to be in sectors that pay a little bit less. And so they're faced with lower job prospects, and they're also saddled with higher debt in the form of student debt. And then out on top of that, the demographic factors in that they're delaying getting married. And so when you have only one income in a household instead of two, all of those things make it more difficult to buy a home. MARTIN: Well, you know, but we actually reached out on Facebook 'cause we wanted to hear what other people's experiences were. And let me tell you, a lot of people would like to talk about this. We got hundreds of responses on this question on Facebook. And I just want to read one of them from somebody who doesn't have any of those things that you talked about and still feels that he's priced out of the market. We heard - here's Mark Hassleburg (ph). He's 30 years old. He lives near the San Francisco Bay area. He is married. He and his wife both have steady jobs. Together they make - about $95,000 last year. But they found they can't afford to buy a home anywhere near where they work. Here's what he had to say. MARK HASSLEBURG: Owning your own home is definitely at the top of our list of priorities, so to speak. Or at least so we thought, until we started looking into it more, especially in the town and area we live now, which we love. It's a great neighborhood. We've got friends and family close by. But to find something that we could actually afford, we'd have to move about four hours away. MARTIN: So I think - so people will hear that, and they'll think, is this lifestyle; that young people aren't willing to make lifestyle compromises? Or is it something else? STURTEVANT: No, I'm so glad that you raised this point. I'm glad to hear that comment because in the places where jobs are the best - in places like San Francisco and Washington, D. C. - what we're facing is a supply problem. And so when you're faced with a place that constrains supply through zoning, through land-use plans, reducing the amount of housing that comes onto the market, that also has this impact of keeping prices high. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about why so many young adults are staying out of the home-buying market. Our guests are Lisa Sturtevant of the National Housing Conference. That's who was speaking just now. Also with us, NPR business editor Marilyn Geewax. Let me play, Marilyn, for you a clip from Jessie Hunter (ph). She's 26 years old. She lives and works in Austin, Texas. She has stable work in the health care industry. She says she can't get the money together to buy a house. Here's part of what she told us. JESSIE HUNTER: I have enormous student loans that essentially comprise a month's rent every month, and it eats up all of my disposable income. I'm not really able to save any money, even though I've got a fantastic job. MARTIN: So, Marilyn, what about that? GEEWAX: That's exactly what the economists are telling the realtors; that this student debt problem is just a tremendous overhang on the market. This year, in the class of 2014 - congratulations, kids. You're the most indebted in history. Seventy percent - 7 out of 10 kids coming out of college - have debt. And right now, that's running at about $33,000 per person. So that's - even after you adjust for inflation, that's twice what it was 20 years ago. So people who were graduating the '90s, they could pay off that debt in a few years - maybe five years - and then you could start to move on to buying a home. But now, you know, really, young people are looking at debt overhang of - you know, they're well into their 30s before they can even start to feel their way out of that pile of debt. And then you've got to start to save for that first home. So it delays the whole process, and it makes people reluctant to get married. Who wants to marry into somebody else's debt? Now you've got twice as much debt. It's really delaying the whole process that leads to adulthood. MARTIN: I want to ask each of you whether this is a policy issue, or is this something that the country needs to worry about as a policy issue? Or is it, in fact, a matter of people making different choices given the circumstances that they are presented with? And I just want to read this from Christian Moore (ph), who says he's 27 years old. He says, I gross well over the median American, but I'm not even close to homeownership because he graduated. He had student loan debt - about $25,000. He's paid - he says he's paid a lot of it down. But he's making payments on a modest car. He says, but look, I take vacations. I see concerts. I budget. So he's not whining. He's not seeing - he says, I'm not whining, but look, real estate prices where he lives are high. The median home price for a two-bedroom home is $257,000, according to Zillow. So he says, look, if I save 20 percent of my net income, I could afford a 20 percent down payment and have little or no nest egg in case of an emergency. And he says, look, to sum it up, I think me and a lot of my peers would rather have a meaningful - meaningful life experiences than save up to buy a home. GEEWAX: So. . . MARTIN: So how do you - how do - how do you hear that? GEEWAX: Well, I. . . MARTIN: I mean, I think some people will think he's whining. I don't think he's whining. He's just saying. . . GEEWAX: I talked to some of the realtors about that and said, you know, what about when you talk to young people? What are they telling you? And they said, you know, one of the things they want to do is to be - to enjoy their lives a little bit, to not just constantly feel this sense of debt burden, where if you have a student debt and you have a car loan and then you're going to take on a mortgage - a lot of them are like, hey, you know, this is all I care to really deal with. I want to still have some life. And the other thing is they want to be able to chase a better job. So they don't want to have that sense of roots because what if something better opens up in another city? They want to be able to chase a better paycheck. So this one realtor I was speaking with from the state of Washington said, it's really tough to get younger adults to commit to owning a home because they can't take the psychological burden of more debt, and they want to be free enough to move on to greener pastures. MARTIN: Well, so one can understand why realtors would be very interested in having people, you know - the market continuing to turn over because that's how they make their money. They make money off the transactions. But should the rest of the country care about this? I mean, is this a problem to be solved or just a circumstance that's interesting? STURTEVANT: No, I think that's a great question. And I think - I'm glad that we're talking about the fact that this is a preference among a lot of folks in this generation. I think there's one thing to consider is that home ownership in America is the way that wealth gets accumulated. It's the primary means by which we accumulate wealth. So if that mechanism for this generation to accumulate wealth isn't working the way it has in the past, I think it opens questions about how we treat renters and their prospects for accumulating wealth over the long-term so that we don't increase this divide between wealth accumulation, not only by income group, but now - but by generation. MARTIN: Did - Marilyn, go ahead. GEEWAX: Well, I wanted to say on this issue is - speaking for us baby boomers. There are a lot of people who think, hey, I got mine. I'm cool. I bought a house young, and I've, you know, been paying on it so everything's set. But to sell my house - someday I will want to retire, eventually. And I will probably want to downsize my house. Who's going to buy it? So if you baby boomers are thinking, hey, we're cool. You're kind of not because you need to have that - the chain moving along - the kind of the conveyor belt where somebody who's 29 buys a small home, and then they move to the nicer one. And eventually they can buy my house, and I can retire and have some savings from that sale. If you break down this chain, it can affect every generation. We all have a stake in how younger people are doing. MARTIN: Is there - the economists that you spoke with at the realtors conference last week have a perspective on how this issue should be addressed? Because on the one hand, when young people - people aren't willing to move for opportunities. People are critical of them. I mean, it seems like young people are being criticized no matter what they do. I mean, so do they have a sense from a policy standpoint if there's something that they think should be different? And we also haven't had time to mention or dig into the whole question of underwriting standards because a lot of people are saying that the underwriting standards have gotten very difficult for new buyers to overcome. We don't have time to really dig into whether that's true or not. But what's your take on it, Marilyn? GEEWAX: Well, keep in mind, these realtors were here in Washington - not a coincidence. They were here to go to the Hill. They were talking with their elected officials. And really where they're looking for some kind of relief is some of the lending standards they feel are just really too high. There's been a reaction to what happened when things were too loose. But now it's really tough on, especially minorities - a lot of Latino and African-American families who had a rough time. This was a really bad recession. So maybe your credit score got beat up pretty good in 2008 and '09 when you had to live on credit cards to get by. Maybe now you're working again - actually, you're a good risk, and you have a family. You want a home. But that credit score that's still dragging over from a couple of years ago is still haunting you. So they want help with that. MARTIN: Marilyn Geewax is senior business editor at NPR. Lisa Sturtevant is the vice president for research at the National Housing Conference. They were both kind enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. , studios. Ladies, thank you both so much. GEEWAX: Good to be with you. STURTEVANT: You're welcome. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. I'm Michel Martin. We'd like to begin the program today by talking about young people and housing. Buying a home used to be a major rite of passage of adulthood. But now more young people are not only putting it off, they're also moving back home with parents. According to U. S. Census data, the rate of homeownership for young adults has declined in the past decade from 43. 6 percent to just over 36 percent today. And that could have serious implications for the wider economy. We wanted to talk more about this so we've called NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax once again. Welcome back, Marilyn. Thanks for joining us once again. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. Great to be here. MARTIN: And for additional perspective, we've also called Lisa Sturtevant. She is the vice president for research at the National Housing Conference. Lisa, thank you for joining us as well here in Washington, D. C. LISA STURTEVANT: Thank you. MARTIN: So, Marilyn, let me start with you. By the numbers, it seems that the housing market is strengthening. You've reported on this. But you were talking with realtors who came to Washington last week for a conference. There's an underlying concern underneath that. GEEWAX: Yes, I spent a lot of time last week with thousands of realtors who were in town and I listened to their economists. And here's the big picture - it was a very tough winter. A lot of snow. People didn't want to go out to an open house when there's three feet of snow in the driveway. So that was a bad period. But now that it's warmed up and the snow is melting, things really have turned up. And it's looking like a pretty good year for housing, you know, prices are up, sales are looking reasonably strong, housing starts surged a lot in April. So it feels pretty good. But then, if you dig into the numbers and separate it a little bit, what you really see happening is it's the higher-end of the market that's doing well - vacation home sales are good. And the typical new home price is now about $290,000, which is the highest. . . MARTIN: That's the average new home price? GEEWAX: Yes, the median price is up to $290,000. And that is the highest ever recorded. So in other words, what's happening is the homebuilders are aiming for that - the first home being a pretty expensive home. You know, this new home is for people who have really high incomes. And that's a tough problem if you're a younger person. The statistics on that were much more dismal.

MARTIN: So, Lisa, pick up the thread here if you would - is the issue here that young people are not making enough money to get into the market? Is it that people with more money are bidding up the cost of the homes? What's going on here? STURTEVANT: Yeah. No, I think you're exactly right.

That's according to a report out this morning from a coalition of 300 non-profits in California, a coalition that advocates for access to financial services for people in low-income and minority communities. The report also finds that banks and other firms are improperly rejecting homeowners who should qualify for programs to lower their mortgage payments. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and other banks in recent years paid billions of dollars in settlements related to improper foreclosures.  And they also agreed to reforms. But according to this new report, these banks are still making mistakes and foreclosing on people when they shouldn't be. KARYNN KELLY: Greg died here at the house. ARNOLD: KaRynn Kelly is showing us around her house in Oakland, California. Her ex-husband Greg passed away last summer. He had cancer. And she moved back into the house to care for him with their 24-year-old son Ian. It turned out that Greg hadn't told them until he was near-death that he'd fallen behind on the mortgage. KELLY: This has been the family home, and I know that he died saying that I don't want you guys to be out on the street. ARNOLD: KaRynn Kelly and her son both have jobs. She's an administrative assistant at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and together, they make about $85,000 a year. So, her housing counselor says that they're good candidates for a loan modification through JPMorgan Chase, their loan servicer, so they could afford to stay in their house with a lower payment. And that's what they've been trying to do. KELLY: Ian and I would both submit our paystubs - oh, and our bank statements, and utility bills - and Chase representatives, they would be in different states, and they would cross over each other and say, well, I didn't get the documents. ARNOLD: That's dragged on for six months. Meanwhile, she says the bank sent them foreclosure sale notices, and people have been coming around the house to peek in the windows, rattling the doorknobs, trying to check the place out so they could put in a bid at auction. KELLY: I mean, it was extremely frightening, because, you know, not only are you frustrated and still grieving, now you're trying to figure out, you know, are these people going to break into the home? ARNOLD: For years, there have been these complaints about banks or other firms that service home loans losing documents, taking forever. Meanwhile, the foreclosure gears crank forward, and people lose their homes. Legal reforms and settlements were supposed to fix these problems. . . LISA SITKIN: There certainly have been improvements, but to this day, we continue to have issues even at the most basic level. ARNOLD: Lisa Sitkin is an attorney who works with the California Reinvestment Coalition, which just came out with this report. She says, for example, once a homeowner applies for a loan modification, the bank has to suspend all foreclosure proceedings until the person's been given a proper review. SITKIN: There are some strong laws and if the servicers go ahead with foreclosure - any stage of it, really - when there's an application being reviewed, they are breaking, in many cases, both federal and state law. ARNOLD: But Sitkin says that still happens, as it did with KaRynn Kelly, who's her client. SITKIN: I had to send urgent notices to various people - I just happened to have those contacts at Chase - to get the sale postponed, and that should have been automatic. There shouldn't have been any need for me to intervene. ARNOLD: JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that the bank has suspended all foreclosure activity on the house. The bank also pointed out that it did a prior loan modification for KaRynn's ex-husband. Chase says it has thousands of employees working to help homeowners. In addition, a separate recent report from regulators said that banks and servicers have made progress. But, Lisa Sitkin says, there are still too many mistakes. SITKIN: And I still have borrowers who get denied. I had one just last week, because the bank miscalculated their income, which, to me, is always sort of shocking, since I think the one thing the banks should be able to do is count somebody's income, right? ARNOLD: The new report calls upon regulators to do a better job of enforcing recently foreclosure reforms. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

So, her housing counselor says that they're good candidates for a loan modification through JPMorgan Chase, their loan servicer, so they could afford to stay in their house with a lower payment. And that's what they've been trying to do. KELLY: Ian and I would both submit our paystubs - oh, and our bank statements, and utility bills - and Chase representatives, they would be in different states, and they would cross over each other and say, well, I didn't get the documents. ARNOLD: That's dragged on for six months. Meanwhile, she says the bank sent them foreclosure sale notices, and people have been coming around the house to peek in the windows, rattling the doorknobs, trying to check the place out so they could put in a bid at auction. KELLY: I mean, it was extremely frightening, because, you know, not only are you frustrated and still grieving, now you're trying to figure out, you know, are these people going to break into the home? ARNOLD: For years, there have been these complaints about banks or other firms that service home loans losing documents, taking forever. Meanwhile, the foreclosure gears crank forward, and people lose their homes. Legal reforms and settlements were supposed to fix these problems. . . LISA SITKIN: There certainly have been improvements, but to this day, we continue to have issues even at the most basic level. ARNOLD: Lisa Sitkin is an attorney who works with the California Reinvestment Coalition, which just came out with this report. She says, for example, once a homeowner applies for a loan modification, the bank has to suspend all foreclosure proceedings until the person's been given a proper review. SITKIN: There are some strong laws and if the servicers go ahead with foreclosure - any stage of it, really - when there's an application being reviewed, they are breaking, in many cases, both federal and state law. ARNOLD: But Sitkin says that still happens, as it did with KaRynn Kelly, who's her client. SITKIN: I had to send urgent notices to various people - I just happened to have those contacts at Chase - to get the sale postponed, and that should have been automatic. There shouldn't have been any need for me to intervene. ARNOLD: JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that the bank has suspended all foreclosure activity on the house. The bank also pointed out that it did a prior loan modification for KaRynn's ex-husband. Chase says it has thousands of employees working to help homeowners. In addition, a separate recent report from regulators said that banks and servicers have made progress. But, Lisa Sitkin says, there are still too many mistakes. SITKIN: And I still have borrowers who get denied. I had one just last week, because the bank miscalculated their income, which, to me, is always sort of shocking, since I think the one thing the banks should be able to do is count somebody's income, right? ARNOLD: The new report calls upon regulators to do a better job of enforcing recently foreclosure reforms. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. The destitute city of Detroit is getting some help today from America's biggest bank. JPMorgan Chase is pouring $100 million into the Motor City. The gift could help build momentum for an even bigger aid package to help Detroit through bankruptcy. It could also help repair the bank's battered reputation and that of its CEO. Jamie Dimon made a personal appearance in Detroit to announce the gift. Here's Sarah Hulett of Michigan Radio. SARAH HULETT, BYLINE: For a lot of people, Jamie Dimon will forever be linked to the mortgage crisis that hit Detroit as hard as any city. But there was no mention of that at today's announcement, of course. Instead, there was a plated lunch - chicken and salad, with cupcakes - an uplifting video, and a standing ovation led by Michigan's governor, Rick Snyder. (APPLAUSE)GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER: That's the Detroit, Michigan thank you, you deserve. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)HULETT: The bulk of the $100 million-commitment from JPMorgan Chase will go to business loans, addressing blight and job training. And Jamie Dimon says, make no mistake, he doesn't consider this a charitable contribution. JAMIE DIMON: We are a, just to make it clear, a for-profit institution. . . (LAUGHTER)DIMON: And we are making an investment in Detroit. HULETT: Forty million dollars will be targeted for two Detroit investment funds that are already lending money to city businesses, including this one. (SOUNDBITE OF BARKING DOGS)LIZ BLONDY: My name is Liz Blondy and I'm the owner of Canine to Five. We offer dog day care, dog boarding and dog grooming. HULETT: Since she opened nine years ago, Blondy has received two loans worth about $150,000, from one of the two development funds that will share the JPMorgan Chase money. Now, Blondy is ready to expand again and she says she's gone to traditional lenders. BLONDY: They're not interested in financing it because of the real estate values in the city of Detroit. HULETT: But nonprofit lenders appear much more willing to take a risk on Detroit businesses like Blondy's. And she says it's those lenders that are going to drive redevelopment here. Governor Snyder says this infusion of cash from JPMorgan Chase is another sign of Detroit's comeback. And he hopes it will help nudge along a deal to get the state to pony up for an aid package. SNYDER: 'Cause this is a sign to show Detroit is coming back and to give more people confidence that by doing the settlement, it will only accelerate the comeback of the city, which helps all the State of Michigan. HULETT: Those bills cleared a first hurdle today. But there's still significant resistance, especially by Republicans fearing election-year retribution from a Tea Party-affiliated group funded by the Koch brothers. And to be clear, the money Chase is spending here has nothing to do with that bankruptcy deal referred to as the Grand Bargain. That deal is intended to protect pensioners from steeper cuts and keep city-owned artworks off the auction block. So why is JPMorgan Chase spreading cash around Motown? DENNIS KELLEHER: One of the things they do is try to help their reputation enhancement by showing up for photo ops. HULETT: That's Dennis Kelleher, a former lobbyist who now heads Better Markets, a non-profit group advocating for regulatory reform. Kelleher says remember that JPMorgan Chase helped create the economic wreckage in Detroit. It was fined $13 billion for its lending practices. And keep this in mind: It's a $2 trillion bank, and Dimon's compensation last year alone was more than $20 million. KELLEHER: So it's great that they're investing in Detroit, as they should have been doing all along. But $100 million from JPMorgan Chase is not even a drop in the bucket. It's probably the equivalent of about $10 to a regular person.

ZOE CHACE, BYLINE: Steve Wardak is one of those people. This guy is a big fan of the penny. He's never walked past a penny on the street and not picked it up. In fact, instead of taking his change to the bank and cashing it in for dollars, like most people do, Steve does the opposite. He takes paper money to his local bank in Pittsburgh and asks for pennies. STEVE WARDAK: I have $50 that I don't need for anything else right now. So I'm going to in here to the PNC Bank and ask for two boxes of pennies. CHACE: Steve is not a mere coin enthusiast. He is a speculator, of sorts. He is looking for copper. These days, pennies are made out of mostly zinc. The metal inside is worth about one cent. But before 1982, they were mostly copper. WARDAK: Nineteen eighty-two and prior, they were 90 percent copper and they're worth about two cents, maybe a little more depending on the price of copper. So I like to pull those out and double my money very slowly. (LAUGHTER)CHACE: Very slowly. WARDAK: Yeah. CHACE: This prospecting for copper - one old penny at a time - there are thousands of people doing this. This is the thing, Steve Wardak is what's known as a coin roll hunter. The coin roll hunters, they like to go online and show off their hauls. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Well, guys. I did it again. I had to go and pick up another box, $25 worth of penny rolls. CHACE: There are dozens of these. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: These are all pre-1982 copper pennies. See? CHACE: Some people have special machines that sort out the pre-1982s out from the post-1982s. WARDAK: I can turn it on for a second to show you how fast it goes. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)WARDAK: These are all copper. . . CHACE: Steve doesn't have a machine 'cause he likes to sort by hand. He gets the coins and he brings them home to his fianc\u00c3\u00a9. And this is kind of the thing they do together at night. They sit next to each other in the living room and go through them. WARDAK: Just get going. Like, I'll give her a box and I'll take my own box - '82, there's '82. (SOUNDBITE OF PENNIES)CHACE: You actually get lucky really quickly. Almost a third of the pennies Steve is pulling out are 1982 or before. WARDAK: These are the copper pennies. You can tell the difference in sound. (SOUNDBITE OF COPPER PENNIES)WARDAK: And these are the zinc pennies that they make now. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ZINC PENNIES)WARDAK: Sounds completely different. It sounds like fake money. CHACE: Kind of subtle to the untrained ear. Listen for the base. Copper. . . (SOUNDBITE OF COPPER PENNIES)CHACE: Zinc. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ZINC PENNIES)CHACE: Steve has collected $475 in old pennies. He figures the copper is worth double the face value, so that's a thousand dollars, practically, stacked in boxes in the back of his closet. (SOUNDBITE OF PENNIES)WARDAK: Eighty two. . . CHACE: You know, there is this problem with this investment strategy which is, right now, it is illegal to melt these pennies down. The copper in these pennies is stuck there. Unless - and this is what these guys are hoping for - the U. S. government kills off the penny, then the pennies are no longer U. S. currency. You can scrap them, melt them down. If you turned on the computer right now and you saw that they'd abolished the penny, what would you do? (LAUGHTER)WARDAK: I would probably go buy as many boxes as I could afford. CHACE: Steve, though, he says he would not scrap them right away, because that day - the day they kill the penny - that is a sad day for him. WARDAK: When the pennies are abolished then that's the end of one of your hobbies right there. 'Cause, hey, I kind of like like look through so many more. And it's fun to do. CHACE: You would miss them. WARDAK: Yeah. Yeah, I would. CHACE: Some guys are already making money off this expectation that the penny will die. Like, this one guy out in Portland, Oregon. He rented out some space in an armored car warehouse, so he has a regular supply of coins coming in. He sorts them with industrial-size sorting machines and sells off the copper ones online.

Now we'd like to talk about an overlooked economic force. We are talking about women. In recent years, a lot of advocates and activists have talked about the global economic importance of educating girls and women. But there's an aspect of this that seems to have been overlooked, and that is the financial education of women. It turns out that women create and influence more than a quarter of the world's wealth - upwards of $20 trillion. In the U. S. alone, women hold decision-making power over more than $11 trillion dollars. And that represents a tremendous opportunity to influence the global economy and society - all this according to a new report titled \"Harnessing The Power Of The Purse: Female Investors And Global Opportunities For Growth. \" It's by the nonprofit think tank - the Center for Talent Innovation. And the center's founding president Sylvia Ann Hewlett co-authored the report. She was also part of TELL ME MORE's Women in Tech series in March. And she is with us now from London. Thank you so much for joining us once again. SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: It's great to be part of your show, Michel. MARTIN: So what motivated this study? HEWLETT: Really, market failure. Think of this - of the well-heeled women in the six countries that we look at - you know, the U. S. , the U. K. , India, China, Hong Kong and also Singapore - 53 percent of these women have no financial advisor because they really don't like what's on offer. They want to talk about how they align their financial resources with the meaning and purpose of their lives. One of the most amazing interviews in this study is with a young woman called Fiona Kushek (ph) - one of these, you know, biometric entrepreneurs. She started a company when she was 32. She just sold it for 21 million pounds. And she went looking for advice because she had a very special set of dreams. She wanted to make a difference to women running startups in the biomedic sector. So, you know, she went to the standard kind of financial advisor. He was very patronizing. He saw that she wasn't, as he put it, from money. And eventually she ended up with a woman advisor in a boutique firm who understood that this woman was very serious about, you know, putting her legacy out there. MARTIN: Let me just unpack a little bit of these details here. You found that 53 percent of the women surveyed did not have financial advisors - and 75 percent of the American women under 40. And 67 percent of all of these women surveyed felt they were misunderstood by the financial advisors if they did have one. Did you notice any interesting country by country differences - and really differences in the ways women in different countries address the question of wealth? HEWLETT: Absolutely. One amazing thing about the U. S. is that women who inherit wealth are incredible philanthropists. That's not so true in China. And that's a very important, you know, not detail but piece to grasp. Similarly, women in the U. K. are actually more confident as investors than U. S. women. And Chinese women are off the charts in terms of their confidence. We find that there is a lot of traditional role-playing around money in the U. S. It's, I think, a product of the '50s. In China, you know, women controlled the silk trade all those years ago. The same is true of traders in Nigeria. They were always women. So there are parts of the world where women have always been much more comfortable controlling money and making those decisions. That is true, you know, in Heartland American. And again, that is a fascinating piece of this study. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about the way women create an inherit wealth. That's the focus of a new report called \"Harnessing The Power Of The Purse. \" Our guest is co-author Sylvia Ann Hewlett. This is not a small group of people. You found that 66 percent of the respondents identified as the financial decision-makers in their households. I think that many people would be surprised by that, if they are in fact the people making the financial decisions. Yet, the people who are supposed to be advising them, or at least are available for that purposes, don't - it sounds like they don't respect them. HEWLETT: Right, and don't get it. MARTIN: Yeah. HEWLETT: We find, for instance, that there's a big dichotomy between the women who make their own money and the wives and the widows. MARTIN: Oh, tell me about that. HEWLETT: And the wealth creators, who are now the majority of women with affluence, really have a very different idea in terms of what they want to do with it. What we see distinguishes them from men in the same category is this link to their dreams, to their legacies, to the idea that they want to align their life goals with their financial assets. They like performance. They like to do well with their money. I mean, it's not that that is not important. But they also want it to be a vehicle for, you know, meaning and purpose. In some cases, it is altruism. For instance. a lot of women are particularly interested in investing in companies that do very well on diversity, that have women in leadership. They want their values to be expressed in their investments. Others, for instance, have the dream of, you know, supporting girl power or startups. I mean, the dream can be different. Maybe someone has a passion for yoga and want to support, you know, that practice. But whatever the dream is, it needs an expression in your portfolio. And we find in traditional financial services this is not understood. It's not delivered. And one of the magics of this study, we now know the behaviors, the approaches, the attitudes that women are looking for in their financial advisors. MARTIN: Does the report speak to whether women are better serving other women? If women are the financial advisors, do they get it? HEWLETT: Well-off women don't care too much whether it's the man or a woman who is actually the advisor. But they want the team to be gender balanced. They want the team and the set of offerings to be infused with what they call gender smarts - an understanding of the female marketplace. MARTIN: You've interviewed so many people from so many different backgrounds, it just seems odd to me that an industry, which is supposedly data driven, right? . . . HEWLETT: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Which is focused on customer needs. . . HEWLETT: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Doesn't grasp that there are these sources of wealth out there and doesn't understand that women want to be heard when they talk. I just - can you explain that? HEWLETT: I can. We're discovering that some of the major banking companies, for instance, use a questionnaire that was developed for the Marines to select financial advisors. It's also true that they market to wealthy women all the time. But I think at the back of their minds is this notion that it is the wives and the widows who are pretty passive. So I think what women are yearning for is to be treated seriously, to be treated as professionals, as folks who have created wealth that don't need to be condescended to. They also want to be dealt with very efficiently because the last thing professional women have in their lives is a lot of spare time. And it's fascinating, you know, one of the focus groups we went around the table, and several of the very prominent women in the room did not have a financial advisor because, you know, they had felt that the value wasn't there. MARTIN: May I ask if you have had this experience yourself in seeking financial advice, if it's OK that I ask that as an entrepreneur yourself? HEWLETT: No, do. I mean. . . MARTIN: Have you had that experience? HEWLETT: I'm very glad you asked that. I felt a little bit like the poster child today because, you know, clearly, I have some assets. I also have a complicated life. I have five children. I have a big career. I have no time. But I definitely care about how my assets are allocated. And I have tried two or three and gotten not very far. It's in very safe places. But last time I looked, for instance, I found that a bunch of the top picks were fast food and defense. Those are not places that I wanted my money to be invested in. So I do feel myself a little frustrated on this front. MARTIN: What would improve this situation - different training in what we sometimes call emotional intelligence? HEWLETT: You know, I think empathy - the ability to sit in someone else's shoes. All of this is incredibly important. But what we see at the core here is the yearning for a team of, you know, financial advisors who really do take the diversity of the marketplace these days very seriously and understand that all kinds of new players are driving value in this global economy. And a whole lot of them are not traditional white men. MARTIN: Do you feel comfortable projecting forward that if women were to be more respected and more aware of their own financial influence globally, how it might change either the economy or our politics? I understand that's a very sort of vast question. I'm just curious if you have thoughts about that. HEWLETT: Well, it's fascinating. For starters, it's a huge engine for growth. Right now, you know, a few trillion dollars are just sitting on the table - a whole lot of them being held in cash because there is no investment off these assets. So that's a bad idea for the global economy. But the other thing that's true, given the thought and the long-run legacy that women want to put into how they allocate their assets, one would think it would be a whole piece of, I guess, social energy, which would be enormously good for the, you know, human flourishing in this world. MARTIN: Sylvia Ann Hewlett is an economist and the founding president of the Center for Talent Innovation. The center released a report today, which she co-authored, titled \"Harnessing The Power Of The Purse. \" And she was with us from our bureau in London. Sylvia Ann Hewlett, it was a pleasure to speak with you as always. Thank you for joining us. HEWLETT: It was great. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Now we'd like to talk about an overlooked economic force. We are talking about women. In recent years, a lot of advocates and activists have talked about the global economic importance of educating girls and women. But there's an aspect of this that seems to have been overlooked, and that is the financial education of women. It turns out that women create and influence more than a quarter of the world's wealth - upwards of $20 trillion. In the U. S. alone, women hold decision-making power over more than $11 trillion dollars. And that represents a tremendous opportunity to influence the global economy and society - all this according to a new report titled \"Harnessing The Power Of The Purse: Female Investors And Global Opportunities For Growth. \" It's by the nonprofit think tank - the Center for Talent Innovation. And the center's founding president Sylvia Ann Hewlett co-authored the report. She was also part of TELL ME MORE's Women in Tech series in March. And she is with us now from London. Thank you so much for joining us once again. SYLVIA ANN HEWLETT: It's great to be part of your show, Michel. MARTIN: So what motivated this study? HEWLETT: Really, market failure. Think of this - of the well-heeled women in the six countries that we look at - you know, the U. S. , the U. K. , India, China, Hong Kong and also Singapore - 53 percent of these women have no financial advisor because they really don't like what's on offer. They want to talk about how they align their financial resources with the meaning and purpose of their lives. One of the most amazing interviews in this study is with a young woman called Fiona Kushek (ph) - one of these, you know, biometric entrepreneurs. She started a company when she was 32. She just sold it for 21 million pounds. And she went looking for advice because she had a very special set of dreams. She wanted to make a difference to women running startups in the biomedic sector. So, you know, she went to the standard kind of financial advisor. He was very patronizing. He saw that she wasn't, as he put it, from money. And eventually she ended up with a woman advisor in a boutique firm who understood that this woman was very serious about, you know, putting her legacy out there. MARTIN: Let me just unpack a little bit of these details here. You found that 53 percent of the women surveyed did not have financial advisors - and 75 percent of the American women under 40. And 67 percent of all of these women surveyed felt they were misunderstood by the financial advisors if they did have one. Did you notice any interesting country by country differences - and really differences in the ways women in different countries address the question of wealth? HEWLETT: Absolutely. One amazing thing about the U. S. is that women who inherit wealth are incredible philanthropists. That's not so true in China. And that's a very important, you know, not detail but piece to grasp. Similarly, women in the U. K. are actually more confident as investors than U. S. women. And Chinese women are off the charts in terms of their confidence. We find that there is a lot of traditional role-playing around money in the U. S. It's, I think, a product of the '50s. In China, you know, women controlled the silk trade all those years ago. The same is true of traders in Nigeria. They were always women. So there are parts of the world where women have always been much more comfortable controlling money and making those decisions. That is true, you know, in Heartland American. And again, that is a fascinating piece of this study. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we're talking about the way women create an inherit wealth. That's the focus of a new report called \"Harnessing The Power Of The Purse. \" Our guest is co-author Sylvia Ann Hewlett. This is not a small group of people. You found that 66 percent of the respondents identified as the financial decision-makers in their households. I think that many people would be surprised by that, if they are in fact the people making the financial decisions. Yet, the people who are supposed to be advising them, or at least are available for that purposes, don't - it sounds like they don't respect them. HEWLETT: Right, and don't get it. MARTIN: Yeah. HEWLETT: We find, for instance, that there's a big dichotomy between the women who make their own money and the wives and the widows. MARTIN: Oh, tell me about that. HEWLETT: And the wealth creators, who are now the majority of women with affluence, really have a very different idea in terms of what they want to do with it. What we see distinguishes them from men in the same category is this link to their dreams, to their legacies, to the idea that they want to align their life goals with their financial assets. They like performance. They like to do well with their money. I mean, it's not that that is not important. But they also want it to be a vehicle for, you know, meaning and purpose. In some cases, it is altruism. For instance. a lot of women are particularly interested in investing in companies that do very well on diversity, that have women in leadership. They want their values to be expressed in their investments. Others, for instance, have the dream of, you know, supporting girl power or startups. I mean, the dream can be different. Maybe someone has a passion for yoga and want to support, you know, that practice. But whatever the dream is, it needs an expression in your portfolio. And we find in traditional financial services this is not understood. It's not delivered. And one of the magics of this study, we now know the behaviors, the approaches, the attitudes that women are looking for in their financial advisors. MARTIN: Does the report speak to whether women are better serving other women? If women are the financial advisors, do they get it? HEWLETT: Well-off women don't care too much whether it's the man or a woman who is actually the advisor. But they want the team to be gender balanced. They want the team and the set of offerings to be infused with what they call gender smarts - an understanding of the female marketplace. MARTIN: You've interviewed so many people from so many different backgrounds, it just seems odd to me that an industry, which is supposedly data driven, right? . . . HEWLETT: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Which is focused on customer needs. . . HEWLETT: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Doesn't grasp that there are these sources of wealth out there and doesn't understand that women want to be heard when they talk. I just - can you explain that? HEWLETT: I can. We're discovering that some of the major banking companies, for instance, use a questionnaire that was developed for the Marines to select financial advisors. It's also true that they market to wealthy women all the time. But I think at the back of their minds is this notion that it is the wives and the widows who are pretty passive. So I think what women are yearning for is to be treated seriously, to be treated as professionals, as folks who have created wealth that don't need to be condescended to. They also want to be dealt with very efficiently because the last thing professional women have in their lives is a lot of spare time. And it's fascinating, you know, one of the focus groups we went around the table, and several of the very prominent women in the room did not have a financial advisor because, you know, they had felt that the value wasn't there. MARTIN: May I ask if you have had this experience yourself in seeking financial advice, if it's OK that I ask that as an entrepreneur yourself? HEWLETT: No, do. I mean. . . MARTIN: Have you had that experience? HEWLETT: I'm very glad you asked that. I felt a little bit like the poster child today because, you know, clearly, I have some assets. I also have a complicated life. I have five children. I have a big career. I have no time. But I definitely care about how my assets are allocated. And I have tried two or three and gotten not very far. It's in very safe places. But last time I looked, for instance, I found that a bunch of the top picks were fast food and defense. Those are not places that I wanted my money to be invested in. So I do feel myself a little frustrated on this front. MARTIN: What would improve this situation - different training in what we sometimes call emotional intelligence? HEWLETT: You know, I think empathy - the ability to sit in someone else's shoes. All of this is incredibly important. But what we see at the core here is the yearning for a team of, you know, financial advisors who really do take the diversity of the marketplace these days very seriously and understand that all kinds of new players are driving value in this global economy. And a whole lot of them are not traditional white men. MARTIN: Do you feel comfortable projecting forward that if women were to be more respected and more aware of their own financial influence globally, how it might change either the economy or our politics? I understand that's a very sort of vast question. I'm just curious if you have thoughts about that. HEWLETT: Well, it's fascinating. For starters, it's a huge engine for growth.

I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Each spring Russian president Vladimir Putin welcomes international business and political leaders to an economic forum in St. Petersburg. It started today and Putin told those who arrived that Russia is ready to do business, although it expects to be treated as an equal. Not as many people were listening as Putin might have liked. Some of those invited did not show up. They stayed away to protest Russia's actions in Ukraine. NPR's Jackie Northam reports on Putin's awkward stance on the world stage. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: For nearly two decades, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum has been a glittering event, pulling in business and political leaders from across the globe. It's Russia's answer to the other major economic event in Davos, Switzerland, and a chance to showcase all Russia has to offer, says Anders Aslund, with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ANDERS ASLUND: It's a wonderful, big event with big receptions, with thousands people at the old Czar palaces in the center of St Petersburg. And President Putin loves being there and he loves being among big American CEOs in particular. NORTHAM: In the past, that would have included the chief executives of major companies such as Pepsi, Goldman Sachs and Alcoa, the aluminum giant. But this year, Putin is going to be mighty lonely. The Obama administration has encouraged companies doing business with Russia not to attend the St. Petersburg forum. Ryan Lance, the head of ConocoPhillips, told shareholders he was already having second thoughts because of Russia's annexation of Crimea, but made up his mind after hearing the U. S. State Department's concerns. Boeing spokesman John Dern told NPR that the aircraft manufacturer decided not to send its senior executive at the request of the U. S. government. Instead, it will send the company's representative in Moscow. Jamison Firestone, a partner with FD Advisory in London, says as the absence of so many senior executives sends a strong signal. JAMISON FIRESTONE: It sends a signal that Russia's becoming a pariah nation where foreign countries don't want to invest because their investments aren't safe in a lawless country. NORTHAM: Only four U. S. companies, including Caterpillar, sent their top executives to St. Petersburg. Although there are some European companies avoiding the event, many energy firms are sending their senior managers. Firestone, an American lawyer who helps companies do business in Russia, says Putin is the type that will keep a close eye on who is - and is not - attending the economic forum. He says that could put some companies with large projects in Russia in a difficult position. FIRESTONE: You know, there may be some blowback, but it's difficult for me to believe that at a time when Russia really needs every dollar it can get that they're going to really retaliate against large American companies because somebody didn't show up at the economic forum. NORTHAM: The Peterson Institute's Aslund says Russia is seeing a massive flight of capital. He says as much money, about $65 billion, left the country in the first three months of this year as it did during all of last year. And he says uncertainty is causing foreign investment to dry up. ASLUND: There is a sense now in the business community that we don't know what President Putin will come up with next, nor do we know how the United States and the European Union will respond to it, so it's better not to do too much. NORTHAM: This could all be material for discussion during the three-day St. Petersburg's forum, which the official website says is dedicated to sustaining confidence in a world undergoing transformation.

I'm Scott Simon. Governor Chris Christie has declared New Jersey's beaches open for the Memorial Day weekend. The governor's hoping to reassure tourists that the Jersey Shore is ready for business a year and a half after super storm Sandy hit. WHYY's Tracey Samuelson says there's plenty of optimism this year following the state's worst natural disaster. TRACEY SAMUELSON, BYLINE: Before we get into this summer, let's recap last year's season. Both statistics and anecdotes suggest the tourism industry had mixed results. In July, Long Beach Township Mayor Joe Mancini told me he thought the weekly rental market in his area of the shore was down 30 percent. The problem was that many tourists were confused about the level of damage. MAYOR JOE MANCINI: You know, every time they showed that roller coaster in the water off of Seaside, they thought that was the entire Jersey coast. But it's not. SAMUELSON: But the news wasn't all bad. In the nine New Jersey counties which were most damaged by Sandy, most saw modest gains in the amount tourists spent last year. Some of those increases might've been thanks to the recovery effort, says Brian Tyrrell. He's a professor of hospitality and tourism management at Richard Stockton College in the Atlantic County. BRIAN TYRRELL: We actually saw some increase last year, particularly early in the year, increases in hotel revenue, for instance, due to FEMA and Red Cross and construction officials coming down. SAMUELSON: But however mixed the results from last year were, Tyrrell is optimistic that this summer will be a good one for the shore. TYRRELL: We are fully expecting that it's going to be a real banner year this year for the Jersey Shore. And I think that there's a lot of communities that are really, you know, ready and well-prepared to see visitors back. SAMUELSON: Realtor Matt Schlosser says things are looking up after Sandy cut his business in half last summer, mainly because so many people hadn't finished fixing their houses yet. MATT SCHLOSSER: I don't think we're going to be on track for 2012 numbers. I think the demand is there, but if we have 20 percent less homes, we can't do those types of numbers. SAMUELSON: But the houses he does have are newer, bigger, more expensive. That's helping him make up some lost revenue. ELAINE ATLEE: I mean, overall, driving around it really doesn't look like there was a storm anymore. Everything looks good, in order. SAMUELSON: Elaine Atlee is a real estate agent with Prudential Zack Shore Properties. She says rentals on Long Beach Island last summer started slow but eventually picked up. And so she's optimistic about this season. Bookings have been strong so far, and each week, there are more homes available to rent as people finish repairs. ATLEE: There's a handful that'll be ready for next summer, so the inventory will increase again next year. SAMUELSON: And because of the storm, there are some people who are renting out their homes who haven't in the past, including Atlee. ATLEE: My house is coming along great. SAMUELSON: We stop alongside her new house, still under construction. When it's done, renters will move in before she does. ATLEE: Just kind of help offset the cost of the construction and all the new furniture and everything that the house needs. SAMUELSON: She's already fully booked for August.

The book, which deals with growing inequality, has been a publishing phenomenon. It currently tops many non-fiction best seller lists. But late last week, The Financial Times published a story citing errors in the book and suggesting that some of its conclusions are mistaken. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Piketty's book has been widely praised by economists for breaking new ground in the area of economic inequality. At the heart of the book is his assertion that inequality is not an accident, but inherent to capitalism. He says over the long-term, higher returns to capital than to labor are giving the richest people in the world a growing share of global wealth. As evidence of this, Piketty points to rising concentrations of wealth in the U. S. and Europe since the 1970s. But the Financial Times discovered some flaws in Piketty's work. It found errors in the data he used, suggested he had cherry-picked the data to support his conclusions and even constructed some data out of thin air. Economist Tyler Cowen of George Mason University assesses the FT criticism this way. TYLER COWEN: The FT found a number of small mistakes in what he did which don't matter so much, but perhaps are an embarrassment. YDSTIE: But Cowen says the FT found one big thing. COWEN: That when you use better numbers for the United Kingdom, it seems that measured wealth and equality for the United Kingdom has not been going up. YDSTIE: And when the FT's different data for Britain is combined with the data for the rest of Europe, it shows overall, European wealth is not becoming more concentrated. Cowen acknowledges that the FT numbers may be flawed as well. For instance, the wealth data don't include offshore bank accounts. But he says. . . COWEN: I don't think anyone has the right numbers. But I also don't think that necessarily saves Piketty. We have an impressionistic sense that a lot of kinds of inequality have gone up. But the Piketty book makes a lot of very specific claims about how, why and when. And it seems that, on a lot of those, we're probably better off saying we simply don't know. YDSTIE: Piketty has defended himself saying the FT is being ridiculous. But he, too, has acknowledged that the available data on wealth are imperfect. However, Piketty told the French news agency AFP that, quote, \"more recent studies only support my conclusions by using different sources. \" But Cowen thinks Piketty simply doesn't make a strong case that high returns on capital are a bad thing. COWEN: If we're really in a world where capital just keeps on accumulating and earning 5 percent, I think, in the long run, that will turn into higher wages and a lot of innovation. And it actually will be a pretty sweet scenario. I worry about capital not earning enough. YDSTIE: Economist Branko Milanovic has a different take on the FT's criticism of Piketty's work. BRANKO MILANOVIC: He might have made a mistake. That's possible. But it was not going to affect the main conclusion. YDSTIE: Milanovic is a professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. He says Piketty's conclusion that higher returns to capital will produce a greater concentration of wealth are not in question. MILANOVIC: That's not in the dispute in the Financial Times article - that the concentration of income from capital is greater than labor. What the Financial Times dispute is, that in the case of U. K. , the increase in concentration of wealth has been overestimated. YDSTIE: Milanovic credits Piketty for publishing all of his data on the Internet. It's actually been there for more than a year. Milanovic says that will lead to challenges but also deepen understanding of the issues of economic inequality. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

YDSTIE: And when the FT's different data for Britain is combined with the data for the rest of Europe, it shows overall, European wealth is not becoming more concentrated. Cowen acknowledges that the FT numbers may be flawed as well. For instance, the wealth data don't include offshore bank accounts. But he says. . . COWEN: I don't think anyone has the right numbers. But I also don't think that necessarily saves Piketty. We have an impressionistic sense that a lot of kinds of inequality have gone up. But the Piketty book makes a lot of very specific claims about how, why and when. And it seems that, on a lot of those, we're probably better off saying we simply don't know. YDSTIE: Piketty has defended himself saying the FT is being ridiculous. But he, too, has acknowledged that the available data on wealth are imperfect. However, Piketty told the French news agency AFP that, quote, \"more recent studies only support my conclusions by using different sources. \" But Cowen thinks Piketty simply doesn't make a strong case that high returns on capital are a bad thing. COWEN: If we're really in a world where capital just keeps on accumulating and earning 5 percent, I think, in the long run, that will turn into higher wages and a lot of innovation. And it actually will be a pretty sweet scenario. I worry about capital not earning enough. YDSTIE: Economist Branko Milanovic has a different take on the FT's criticism of Piketty's work. BRANKO MILANOVIC: He might have made a mistake. That's possible. But it was not going to affect the main conclusion. YDSTIE: Milanovic is a professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. He says Piketty's conclusion that higher returns to capital will produce a greater concentration of wealth are not in question. MILANOVIC: That's not in the dispute in the Financial Times article - that the concentration of income from capital is greater than labor. What the Financial Times dispute is, that in the case of U. K. , the increase in concentration of wealth has been overestimated. YDSTIE: Milanovic credits Piketty for publishing all of his data on the Internet. It's actually been there for more than a year. Milanovic says that will lead to challenges but also deepen understanding of the issues of economic inequality.

Our guest, journalist Howard French, says there's debate about whether China's push into Africa will lead to African development and prosperity, or exploitation reminiscent of 19th century European colonialism. But, he says, it's led to another remarkable development. More than a million Chinese citizens have permanently moved to Africa, buying land, starting businesses and settling among local populations.

He's now in the faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Howard French, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's just begin by talking a little bit about China's drive to invest and build economic relationships in the developing world. I mean, how long has this been happening? What drives it? HOWARD FRENCH: Well, so this has happened really in two phases through two different - very different approaches. In the 1960s, a revolutionary China during the Maoist era tried to forge relations very broadly across the Third World, in a political sense, promoting rebellions and revolutionary movements here and there and trying to unify a coalition of what used to widely be called Third World countries around it in the global South. China then opens up and begins reforming its economy, going capitalist, to put it simply, in the late 1970s, and subsequently, probably in the early- to mid-1990s, begins to survey the world and understand, I think quite astutely, that huge opportunities for it were opening up in parts of the world that were not being particularly attended to by the West. And the place that stood out first-and-foremost in that regard was Africa. DAVIES: And their interest was in both raw materials and markets? FRENCH: So as China began to emerge as this manufacturing superpower in the 1990s in the early phases of this, they saw that they had an advantage or an interest in securing sources of raw materials around the world. And Africa is, was and still remains clearly one of the premier sources for raw materials. So this was the first step of their engagement with Africa. But it didn't by any means end there. I think already as far back as the mid-1990s, China's political leaders had the foresight to understand that Africa had a great deal of unrecognized economic potential and had a particular kind of demographic profile, meaning that Africa's population was set to increase very rapidly and that there was a great prospect that Africa would also have, along with this demographic rise, growing middle classes. And so China was, at the same time as it was seeking to secure natural resources, it was beginning to think about Africa as a place where it could develop markets - important markets for itself for the future. DAVIES: Now, you write in the book that a kind of barter system developed in which the Chinese would provide big projects. Give us some examples of this - big projects in African countries - and what the Chinese got in return. FRENCH: The kinds of projects could be railways. I was in Kenya just last week where the Chinese premier was visiting to sign a very large deal to develop a national railway - a new national railway system for Kenya that will eventually link up to other landlocked countries in East Africa. But other sorts of projects include new port systems, new highway systems, airports, stadiums and in some cases, things like smelters or factories of one kind or another. In Angola, it involves the development of a university system and of housing complexes all over the country. And what China has been doing typically has been offering to create these sorts of infrastructure for their African client states in exchange for a secure source of a particular natural resource that will - a contract that will provide China with its needs over a length of 20 or 30 years. DAVIES: Now, to what extent are these relationships driven by the official Chinese government policy, and to what extent do they represent, you know, entrepreneurial moves by Chinese companies who act as independent actors? FRENCH: In terms of the movements of people, the first phase of this process is very much the result of Chinese state policy. In the 1990s, Beijing begins to formulate this idea of Going Out - that was the official name of the policy - where a national priority was established to seek business in faraway lands, especially in parts of the world like Africa where China didn't really have much of a history of economic engagement, certainly in a capitalist mode. And so once this watchword was established, Chinese provinces then begin to compete among themselves for business in Africa and in other parts of the world that were designated as priorities. Up to that point, this is very much a state-driven process. But then something very interesting begins to happen. Once Chinese companies begin to secure projects in these sorts of places - for example, the construction of a port or an airport or a highway system - they move, let's say, 1,000 or 2000 workers to the target country for a fixed period of time - a year or two - during which time they'll be, you know, building this new infrastructure. And at the end of that period, a certain percentage of these workers - and it would vary from case to case - decided, well, look, you know, hey, Africa is not such a bad place after all. We may have had very little idea of Africa or perhaps a poor image of Africa. And these workers then discovered, well, you know, this is pretty agreeable. There's lots of opportunity here. I think at the end of my contract, I'll stay behind. I'll just stay here. That stay-behind phenomenon is very much an individual decision. I see no particular evidence that the Chinese state has been a major factor in encouraging what has ultimately become a kind of, let's say, a form of migration where these people complete their contracts and remain on the ground in the destination country for the medium or longer-term. DAVIES: You know, it's fascinating in the book that people see economic opportunity in Africa - a lot of Chinese people - but they're also driven by things they don't like about life in China. What are they? FRENCH: Most of the people we've been talking about so far in terms of migration are what in our country would be called working class or at best, socioeconomically speaking, lower-middle class people. And as such, they tend to come from secondary cities in China, especially cities that are not on the East coast of China, where most wealth is concentrated. And people in those cities - these secondary cities - they have not benefited from the full blush of the economic growth that China has enjoyed for the last 30 or so years. And so right away, they're seeking - perhaps out of envy of the wealth that has really taken root in the East, they're seeking greater opportunity to catch up. But they find very often that in secondary cities in China, the opportunities to catch up are lacking. And so this drives them to seek opportunity outside. The things that they complain about in China run from just the sheer crowding of cities in China, to the environment - rampant pollution in many places - to corruption. Corruption is something that many, many of the people I interviewed complained about. The would often say to me, unprompted, that African countries, which we often think of as being, you know, terribly corrupt, were less corrupt in terms of the way they lived their daily lives than China itself. And then finally something they sometimes were fleeing was a feature of Chinese capitalism that's not widely understood in this country, which is the copycat nature of economic competition in China. If I invent a gewgaw and begin to sort of manufacturer it and sell it on a street corner and somebody notices that it's doing good business, then, you know, in China, very often, it seems like a week later, 10 people have copied that idea and are trying to sell the same gewgaw. Very often, Chinese people would say to me that they were looking for places where there weren't so many Chinese people, which I thought to be amusing. DAVIES: You spent some time in Mozambique with a Chinese immigrant, Hao Shengli - is that - am I getting close to his name? FRENCH: Hao Shengli. DAVIES: Hao Shengli. Just tell us a little bit about how he got there and what kind of farming business he established. FRENCH: So Hao Shengli had a been sort of a moderately successful businessman back in China who had a peculiar marital history. He had taken on several wives in succession, but after each divorce, had maintained an intimate and financial relationship with the past wife, even as he took on a new wife. And so this led to a need for him to continually amass more and more money. And this drove him eventually to seek opportunity outside of China. He initially tries to open some businesses in the Middle East. They don't succeed. And he went to a trade fair in southern China where, for the first time, he's exposed to talk about opportunities in Africa. And he decided to try his hand there, and this leads him to go to Mozambique where he believed, because it was a Portuguese-speaking country, he wouldn't find any Chinese people. He -Hao Shengli was driven by this very common motive that we've talked about before, where, you know, he wants to get to a place where there's not going to be any competition from other Chinese people. And so he goes to Mozambique, and I meet him in the capital, Maputo. And he very generously drives me to his farm. DAVIES: And how is he able to buy so much arable land? FRENCH: So Hao had come with a certain amount of savings. He was a businessman. In China, he had had a reasonable success. He had saved up - I don't know - over $100,000, which he had arrived with. And he described a process to me where he sort of makes his way from county to county ingratiating himself to local officials. And in the county where he finally settled, he had apparently helped in the construction of some local roads there. And this had won him great favor with local officials. And he ends up using these relationships to secure interest in this land. He made a payment for the land, and then he settles on the land. He begins farming Stevia, which is a plant that produces sweeteners that are used in diet sodas. And his scheme is to become a giant Stevia producer and to export to the likes of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, etc. Hao very quickly, though, runs into trouble with residents of the surrounding villages around his land who are resentful of the fact that he secured this very rich and irrigated valley, which had been years earlier owned and run by Portuguese colonials. And so he develops this scheme to bring his sons to Mozambique - teenage sons, one of them about 17, one of them a few years younger. And his idea that he comes up with is that if he marries off or at least has his sons procreate with local women, that the children of these couplings will become part of his clan. And as Mozambican citizens, they will be able to own the land legally in perpetuity. And his hold on this rich valley then can't be challenged. DAVIES: Well that's - that's an entrepreneurial spirit to family building, isn't it? FRENCH: Absolutely. DAVIES: This immigrant, Shengli, who had bought this land and was bringing his sons over and had big plans, how exactly did he figure his son would get African wives? I mean, what would they do to get them? Is it a matter of dating? Is it a matter of visiting their parents? FRENCH: Very good question. I mean, so the exact details are a bit hazy here. But as I began to talk through these questions with Shengli, it emerges that he himself may have had something of a relationship with the girl who ends up being the girlfriend of his first son - either that or he had a relationship with a friend of the girl who becomes the girlfriend of his son. As we talk these things through, he tells me that through a variety of payments made to essentially the family members of the clan of eligible girls - eligible in his view - girls, he had been able to secure relationships with various local girls. And he exhibited a great deal of impatience for his younger son, who he called Little Fatty. This is a prepubescent - I don't know - I want to say 14-year-old, who had just arrived very recently from China and really had no sort of native interest in girls yet. And Hao was deeply irritated by this, saying, you know, we've got to get on with this, we've got to get on with this. You know, he's thinking about building his clan, and he's paired off the older son with a girl and - who knows? - but they may have had children by now. And he's very anxious to see this happen with the younger boy as well. DAVIES: We're speaking with Howard French. His book is \"China's Second Continent. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is Howard French. His new book is \"China's Second Continent: How A Million Migrants Are Building A New Empire In Africa. \"You write about Zambia, a landlocked country in Southern Africa, where there are 100,000 Chinese. The country has some of the world's largest copper deposits. And what's interesting about this, I guess, is that it was ruled by the British. It was Northern Rhodesia that separated and became its own independent country. And the government there began to privatize the copper mines right about the time that China was expanding its economic reach into the world - this Going Out policy of the government. Tell us a bit about what the Chinese bought in Zambia and what kind of economic relationships developed. FRENCH: So you've got the sense of timing just right. The Chinese come along liberalizing their economy and pursuing business in far-flung places that they had sort of assessed the West to not be terribly attached to. And Zambia comes very prominently on this list because it is a producer of an essential commodity, copper, which goes into every kind of electronic device that you can imagine. And the IMF had just forced the Zambian government to restructure its economy and to sell off state companies in the global economy of the moment. Copper prices were low, historically speaking, and Zambia had to sell off these assets in a sort of fire sale manner. China, just through dumb luck, stumbles upon these opportunities at that very moment and ends up acquiring some of the best copper mines in the world for just extraordinarily low prices. DAVIES: And what were the relationships like between the Chinese owner of these mines and, I guess, some smelting operations, too - right? - and the African workers who worked there? FRENCH: So the acquisition of these big mines at the moment in history we were just talking about was done by big Chinese companies - state companies, typically. And they subsequently run into all sorts of problems in terms of enforcement of safety standards and labor relations. Chinese mines in Zambia become the scene of some very ugly confrontations between Chinese management and African workers, in a few cases leading to the deaths of Africans as they protested or sort of lay siege to the headquarters of the company. In a couple of instances, there were reprisals or attacks by Chinese on the African workers. The minors that I focused on in my own reporting were private people who had - in the case of the main person who I profiled in my Zambia chapter, had essentially been a translator for a Chinese state company earlier in the Going Out period. And as an English-speaking translator, he had learned on the fly by translating for engineering companies how to build things like smelters. And so he comes to Zambia and sees that the ground is literally - that there are rocks lying about in Zambia that are green and therefore full of copper content. And he figures, well, if I build a smelter here, I can mine these rocks and I can make a fortune for myself. And this man describes how he pulls together this effort. And I visit this immense, very impressive, privately owned smelter that he had built through his own ingenuity. DAVIES: And what did Zambians that you spoke to tell you about working for him and the Chinese employers generally? FRENCH: Zambians who worked in the mining industry in that part of northern Zambia for Chinese owners generally had stories, very unhappy stories, of being forced to work, you know, sometimes without gloves, without masks, without helmets, in very unsafe conditions, handling chemicals or very hot materials with high rates of injury. And you receive story after story about this. The worst of these stories came from other mines, not this person in particular's mine. However, this man led me through his smelter, clearly his pride and joy, the latest of several smelters on this one site. And we entered into a sort of hangar-like building where the furnaces - the latest of his sort of kiln-like furnaces had been built. And the air was so thick with smoke - I'm asthmatic - that I was worried that I was going to be in trouble. You could barely see in broad daylight in this building because the soot from the smelter was so thick. And you had kind of almost a medieval scene where these African workers were carting coal to keep the furnace stoked to the very precipice of the furnace and throwing it in.  You know, you get 10 feet away from the furnace and it's already too hot to stand still. And they would have to walk up to the sort of precipice of the furnace and keep loading it with coal. DAVIES: And the workers had nothing to protect their breathing from all the stuff in the air, right? FRENCH: That's correct. DAVIES: So you have the Zambian government which has labor laws and their health and safety standards of some kind. And as you tell the story, it seems that there's a perception of these foreign owners coming in and getting away with very troubling violations - horrific conditions. How does the government react, and do the Chinese intervene in Zambian politics to protect their interests? You see this in a lot of places. FRENCH: So they don't really have a lot of leverage with China on these sorts of issues. China is, for the foreseeable future, going to be the one big customer for Zambian copper in the world and the one big, willing investor in new copper production and in copper transformation in the world. And so this new government, for all of its outspokenness on this issue, for all of its apparent desire to change the way the copper industry runs in Zambia, has not proven very able to change the nature of the industry or to get China to behave very differently. GROSS: Howard French will continue his interview with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in the second half of the show. French is the author of the new book \"China's Second Continent. \" I am Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies reported with journalist Howard French about his new book, \"China's Second Continent. \" It's about how China is increasing its presence in Africa, seeing land and natural resources vital to China's industrial expansion and markets for growing Chinese companies. More than a million Chinese citizens have moved to Africa buying land, starting businesses and settling among local populations. DAVIES: There are questions raised about whether this enormous Chinese investment and engagement with Africa is in the end good for Africans and African countries and citizens. And before I ask you that question, let me just ask you to compare how this surge of Chinese investment and activity differs from, you know, the Western kind of economic engagement in the continent in the '60s, '70s and '80s. FRENCH: There's one feature that seems most strikingly similar to me in terms of the kind of empire that we think of - European empire in North and South America and in various parts of Asia and Africa in the 19th century, where the powerful foreign entity comes and establishes its interests in a faraway, much poorer, much weaker part of the world. And what does it do? Typically, it builds infrastructure to accomplish a few things, notably to secure the supply of the kinds of goods - whether it's gold or copper or iron or bauxite or whatever it needs from the poor target country - and on the other hand, to serve as the conduit for its own manufactured goods, very often manufactured goods which are made with these inputs, these natural resources. And so, you know, this was seen in the 19th century by European powers establishing these kinds of networks of infrastructure in markets all over the world. Wherever European powers established themselves in an imperial mode, they did these sorts of things. And today you see China reproducing these modes, building as we have discussed earlier, ports and airports and railroads and highway systems that, you know, the soft power, sort of nice face of this is that they're serving Africa's transportation needs - which is indeed partly true - but which also serve the purpose of opening up markets for Chinese goods and of helping evacuate the things that China needs from these target countries for its own economic purposes. The real difference is - the most important difference is that in today's world, a feature of imperialism that was common in the past, direct political control of a foreign country, is seen as intolerable and even impractical, that it's costlier than need be when you can get everything you need without having to assume the costs of government. And so China has settled on this infrastructure approach of opening up hinterland, getting better access to raw materials and providing networks for the diffusion and distribution of its own goods in a way that I think really resembles many of the patterns of the past. DAVIES: You know, there's a point of view that says, you know, decades ago when the West was investing in Africa, it attached a lot of conditions to grants and aid and insisted upon the development of democratic institutions before the investments would go forward, and as a result, a lot of things didn't happen. The contrast is China, with its ambition, charges in kind of disinterested in whether there are democratic institutions. They're much more interested in just, you know, doing the work, making money. And the argument is that the Chinese way will, over the long term, generate prosperity, build a middle class. And that it's from that middle class you'll have the basis for the growth of democratic institutions. FRENCH: I'm very skeptical of this view. The first thing I would say though is that the West's consistency on these sorts of questions is itself highly problematic. The West has indeed very often enunciated principles of various kinds, but they've been mostly respected in the breach. The United States and other Western powers have been strategic partners of long-standing with any number of undemocratic countries and outright dictatorships in Africa. So there's that. The second thing that I would say, though, is that Africans themselves, in my experience, tend to be skeptical of this view that there's something wonderful about, you know, the expediency of nondemocratic processes - that if we get a benevolent dictator or we get a partner like China that doesn't attach any particular importance to democratic processes or various other sorts of open and transparent procedures, that, you know, at least we can get the ball rolling and a kind of takeoff will occur. I don't think Africans generally buy into this themselves. You know, it is the governments of many African countries that are against conditionality. They say, you know, they're tired of being talked down to. They don't wish to be lectured to or held to other people's standards or rules of openness or procedure or democracy or fairness, etc. , etc. - that they're perfectly capable of establishing their own rules and knowing what's best for them. But this is a self-serving argument, in my experience. And the view of most African citizens - who have seen predatory government after predatory government and who understand that of course if you are in the position of a predator, you don't want anyone enjoying oversight over you - you want to be able to, you know, feast as freely and as much as you can get away with. African citizens of the countries that I have visited, by and large, would like to see a more rule-based system, a more equitable system, a more open and transparent system. And they would like to see, I believe, China play within those rules. DAVIES: Well, Howard French, it's been interesting. Thanks so much. FRENCH: Thank you. GROSS: Howard French spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies who is a senior reporter for WHYY. French is the author of the new book, \"China's Second Continent. \" TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.

And so right away, they're seeking - perhaps out of envy of the wealth that has really taken root in the East, they're seeking greater opportunity to catch up. But they find very often that in secondary cities in China, the opportunities to catch up are lacking. And so this drives them to seek opportunity outside. The things that they complain about in China run from just the sheer crowding of cities in China, to the environment - rampant pollution in many places - to corruption. Corruption is something that many, many of the people I interviewed complained about. The would often say to me, unprompted, that African countries, which we often think of as being, you know, terribly corrupt, were less corrupt in terms of the way they lived their daily lives than China itself. And then finally something they sometimes were fleeing was a feature of Chinese capitalism that's not widely understood in this country, which is the copycat nature of economic competition in China. If I invent a gewgaw and begin to sort of manufacturer it and sell it on a street corner and somebody notices that it's doing good business, then, you know, in China, very often, it seems like a week later, 10 people have copied that idea and are trying to sell the same gewgaw. Very often, Chinese people would say to me that they were looking for places where there weren't so many Chinese people, which I thought to be amusing. DAVIES: You spent some time in Mozambique with a Chinese immigrant, Hao Shengli - is that - am I getting close to his name? FRENCH: Hao Shengli. DAVIES: Hao Shengli. Just tell us a little bit about how he got there and what kind of farming business he established. FRENCH: So Hao Shengli had a been sort of a moderately successful businessman back in China who had a peculiar marital history. He had taken on several wives in succession, but after each divorce, had maintained an intimate and financial relationship with the past wife, even as he took on a new wife. And so this led to a need for him to continually amass more and more money. And this drove him eventually to seek opportunity outside of China. He initially tries to open some businesses in the Middle East. They don't succeed. And he went to a trade fair in southern China where, for the first time, he's exposed to talk about opportunities in Africa. And he decided to try his hand there, and this leads him to go to Mozambique where he believed, because it was a Portuguese-speaking country, he wouldn't find any Chinese people. He -Hao Shengli was driven by this very common motive that we've talked about before, where, you know, he wants to get to a place where there's not going to be any competition from other Chinese people. And so he goes to Mozambique, and I meet him in the capital, Maputo. And he very generously drives me to his farm. DAVIES: And how is he able to buy so much arable land? FRENCH: So Hao had come with a certain amount of savings. He was a businessman. In China, he had had a reasonable success. He had saved up - I don't know - over $100,000, which he had arrived with. And he described a process to me where he sort of makes his way from county to county ingratiating himself to local officials. And in the county where he finally settled, he had apparently helped in the construction of some local roads there. And this had won him great favor with local officials. And he ends up using these relationships to secure interest in this land. He made a payment for the land, and then he settles on the land. He begins farming Stevia, which is a plant that produces sweeteners that are used in diet sodas. And his scheme is to become a giant Stevia producer and to export to the likes of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, etc. Hao very quickly, though, runs into trouble with residents of the surrounding villages around his land who are resentful of the fact that he secured this very rich and irrigated valley, which had been years earlier owned and run by Portuguese colonials. And so he develops this scheme to bring his sons to Mozambique - teenage sons, one of them about 17, one of them a few years younger. And his idea that he comes up with is that if he marries off or at least has his sons procreate with local women, that the children of these couplings will become part of his clan. And as Mozambican citizens, they will be able to own the land legally in perpetuity. And his hold on this rich valley then can't be challenged. DAVIES: Well that's - that's an entrepreneurial spirit to family building, isn't it? FRENCH: Absolutely. DAVIES: This immigrant, Shengli, who had bought this land and was bringing his sons over and had big plans, how exactly did he figure his son would get African wives? I mean, what would they do to get them? Is it a matter of dating? Is it a matter of visiting their parents? FRENCH: Very good question. I mean, so the exact details are a bit hazy here. But as I began to talk through these questions with Shengli, it emerges that he himself may have had something of a relationship with the girl who ends up being the girlfriend of his first son - either that or he had a relationship with a friend of the girl who becomes the girlfriend of his son. As we talk these things through, he tells me that through a variety of payments made to essentially the family members of the clan of eligible girls - eligible in his view - girls, he had been able to secure relationships with various local girls. And he exhibited a great deal of impatience for his younger son, who he called Little Fatty. This is a prepubescent - I don't know - I want to say 14-year-old, who had just arrived very recently from China and really had no sort of native interest in girls yet. And Hao was deeply irritated by this, saying, you know, we've got to get on with this, we've got to get on with this. You know, he's thinking about building his clan, and he's paired off the older son with a girl and - who knows? - but they may have had children by now. And he's very anxious to see this happen with the younger boy as well. DAVIES: We're speaking with Howard French. His book is \"China's Second Continent. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is Howard French. His new book is \"China's Second Continent: How A Million Migrants Are Building A New Empire In Africa. \" You write about Zambia, a landlocked country in Southern Africa, where there are 100,000 Chinese. The country has some of the world's largest copper deposits. And what's interesting about this, I guess, is that it was ruled by the British. It was Northern Rhodesia that separated and became its own independent country. And the government there began to privatize the copper mines right about the time that China was expanding its economic reach into the world - this Going Out policy of the government. Tell us a bit about what the Chinese bought in Zambia and what kind of economic relationships developed. FRENCH: So you've got the sense of timing just right. The Chinese come along liberalizing their economy and pursuing business in far-flung places that they had sort of assessed the West to not be terribly attached to. And Zambia comes very prominently on this list because it is a producer of an essential commodity, copper, which goes into every kind of electronic device that you can imagine. And the IMF had just forced the Zambian government to restructure its economy and to sell off state companies in the global economy of the moment. Copper prices were low, historically speaking, and Zambia had to sell off these assets in a sort of fire sale manner. China, just through dumb luck, stumbles upon these opportunities at that very moment and ends up acquiring some of the best copper mines in the world for just extraordinarily low prices. DAVIES: And what were the relationships like between the Chinese owner of these mines and, I guess, some smelting operations, too - right? - and the African workers who worked there? FRENCH: So the acquisition of these big mines at the moment in history we were just talking about was done by big Chinese companies - state companies, typically. And they subsequently run into all sorts of problems in terms of enforcement of safety standards and labor relations. Chinese mines in Zambia become the scene of some very ugly confrontations between Chinese management and African workers, in a few cases leading to the deaths of Africans as they protested or sort of lay siege to the headquarters of the company. In a couple of instances, there were reprisals or attacks by Chinese on the African workers. The minors that I focused on in my own reporting were private people who had - in the case of the main person who I profiled in my Zambia chapter, had essentially been a translator for a Chinese state company earlier in the Going Out period. And as an English-speaking translator, he had learned on the fly by translating for engineering companies how to build things like smelters. And so he comes to Zambia and sees that the ground is literally - that there are rocks lying about in Zambia that are green and therefore full of copper content. And he figures, well, if I build a smelter here, I can mine these rocks and I can make a fortune for myself. And this man describes how he pulls together this effort. And I visit this immense, very impressive, privately owned smelter that he had built through his own ingenuity. DAVIES: And what did Zambians that you spoke to tell you about working for him and the Chinese employers generally? FRENCH: Zambians who worked in the mining industry in that part of northern Zambia for Chinese owners generally had stories, very unhappy stories, of being forced to work, you know, sometimes without gloves, without masks, without helmets, in very unsafe conditions, handling chemicals or very hot materials with high rates of injury. And you receive story after story about this. The worst of these stories came from other mines, not this person in particular's mine. However, this man led me through his smelter, clearly his pride and joy, the latest of several smelters on this one site. And we entered into a sort of hangar-like building where the furnaces - the latest of his sort of kiln-like furnaces had been built. And the air was so thick with smoke - I'm asthmatic - that I was worried that I was going to be in trouble. You could barely see in broad daylight in this building because the soot from the smelter was so thick. And you had kind of almost a medieval scene where these African workers were carting coal to keep the furnace stoked to the very precipice of the furnace and throwing it in.  You know, you get 10 feet away from the furnace and it's already too hot to stand still. And they would have to walk up to the sort of precipice of the furnace and keep loading it with coal. DAVIES: And the workers had nothing to protect their breathing from all the stuff in the air, right? FRENCH: That's correct. DAVIES: So you have the Zambian government which has labor laws and their health and safety standards of some kind. And as you tell the story, it seems that there's a perception of these foreign owners coming in and getting away with very troubling violations - horrific conditions. How does the government react, and do the Chinese intervene in Zambian politics to protect their interests? You see this in a lot of places. FRENCH: So they don't really have a lot of leverage with China on these sorts of issues. China is, for the foreseeable future, going to be the one big customer for Zambian copper in the world and the one big, willing investor in new copper production and in copper transformation in the world. And so this new government, for all of its outspokenness on this issue, for all of its apparent desire to change the way the copper industry runs in Zambia, has not proven very able to change the nature of the industry or to get China to behave very differently. GROSS: Howard French will continue his interview with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in the second half of the show. French is the author of the new book \"China's Second Continent. \" I am Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies reported with journalist Howard French about his new book, \"China's Second Continent. \" It's about how China is increasing its presence in Africa, seeing land and natural resources vital to China's industrial expansion and markets for growing Chinese companies. More than a million Chinese citizens have moved to Africa buying land, starting businesses and settling among local populations. DAVIES: There are questions raised about whether this enormous Chinese investment and engagement with Africa is in the end good for Africans and African countries and citizens. And before I ask you that question, let me just ask you to compare how this surge of Chinese investment and activity differs from, you know, the Western kind of economic engagement in the continent in the '60s, '70s and '80s. FRENCH: There's one feature that seems most strikingly similar to me in terms of the kind of empire that we think of - European empire in North and South America and in various parts of Asia and Africa in the 19th century, where the powerful foreign entity comes and establishes its interests in a faraway, much poorer, much weaker part of the world. And what does it do? Typically, it builds infrastructure to accomplish a few things, notably to secure the supply of the kinds of goods - whether it's gold or copper or iron or bauxite or whatever it needs from the poor target country - and on the other hand, to serve as the conduit for its own manufactured goods, very often manufactured goods which are made with these inputs, these natural resources. And so, you know, this was seen in the 19th century by European powers establishing these kinds of networks of infrastructure in markets all over the world. Wherever European powers established themselves in an imperial mode, they did these sorts of things. And today you see China reproducing these modes, building as we have discussed earlier, ports and airports and railroads and highway systems that, you know, the soft power, sort of nice face of this is that they're serving Africa's transportation needs - which is indeed partly true - but which also serve the purpose of opening up markets for Chinese goods and of helping evacuate the things that China needs from these target countries for its own economic purposes. The real difference is - the most important difference is that in today's world, a feature of imperialism that was common in the past, direct political control of a foreign country, is seen as intolerable and even impractical, that it's costlier than need be when you can get everything you need without having to assume the costs of government. And so China has settled on this infrastructure approach of opening up hinterland, getting better access to raw materials and providing networks for the diffusion and distribution of its own goods in a way that I think really resembles many of the patterns of the past. DAVIES: You know, there's a point of view that says, you know, decades ago when the West was investing in Africa, it attached a lot of conditions to grants and aid and insisted upon the development of democratic institutions before the investments would go forward, and as a result, a lot of things didn't happen. The contrast is China, with its ambition, charges in kind of disinterested in whether there are democratic institutions. They're much more interested in just, you know, doing the work, making money. And the argument is that the Chinese way will, over the long term, generate prosperity, build a middle class. And that it's from that middle class you'll have the basis for the growth of democratic institutions. FRENCH: I'm very skeptical of this view. The first thing I would say though is that the West's consistency on these sorts of questions is itself highly problematic. The West has indeed very often enunciated principles of various kinds, but they've been mostly respected in the breach. The United States and other Western powers have been strategic partners of long-standing with any number of undemocratic countries and outright dictatorships in Africa. So there's that. The second thing that I would say, though, is that Africans themselves, in my experience, tend to be skeptical of this view that there's something wonderful about, you know, the expediency of nondemocratic processes - that if we get a benevolent dictator or we get a partner like China that doesn't attach any particular importance to democratic processes or various other sorts of open and transparent procedures, that, you know, at least we can get the ball rolling and a kind of takeoff will occur. I don't think Africans generally buy into this themselves. You know, it is the governments of many African countries that are against conditionality. They say, you know, they're tired of being talked down to. They don't wish to be lectured to or held to other people's standards or rules of openness or procedure or democracy or fairness, etc. , etc. - that they're perfectly capable of establishing their own rules and knowing what's best for them. But this is a self-serving argument, in my experience. And the view of most African citizens - who have seen predatory government after predatory government and who understand that of course if you are in the position of a predator, you don't want anyone enjoying oversight over you - you want to be able to, you know, feast as freely and as much as you can get away with. African citizens of the countries that I have visited, by and large, would like to see a more rule-based system, a more equitable system, a more open and transparent system. And they would like to see, I believe, China play within those rules. DAVIES: Well, Howard French, it's been interesting. Thanks so much. FRENCH: Thank you.

Last week the Financial Times challenged some of his data, but Piketty stands by his conclusions. It isn't the data, or the book's conclusions that's grabbed the attention of our linguist Geoff Nunberg. It's the use of the word capital in Piketty's title which seems to be a plain allusion to Carl Marx's classic \"Das Kapital,\" or in English \"Capital,\" which led to the modern use of the words capitalism and capitalist. Here's Geoff. GEOFF NUNBERG: \"Capital In The Twenty First Century\" evokes another famous tone with capital in its title. It makes comparisons inevitable. The title's a red flag for the right, in every sense of the term. A Frenchman who alludes to Marx and advocates a global wealth tax to reduce inequality is like shooting poisson in a barrel. And while liberals don't find the book particularly Marxist in its theory or its predictions, they do see it as Marxian in the sweep of its ambition and its ideas. There's a linguistic link, too. For all their differences, Piketty and Marx talk about capital in the same singular way. Each of them puts it at the center of his narrative, not just as a sum of money and productive assets, but as a historical character in its own right. Piketty sometimes talks about capital as if it were an animate being. Capital is always entrepreneurial. That is its vocation, he says, which echoes Marx's remark that capital throws off living offspring. For both men, in fact, the capitalists themselves figure only as personifications of capitalist extras, neither heroes nor villains, just the supernumeraries who carry capital on stage on her litter. It says something that Piketty could write a 700-page book on the concentration of wealth under capitalism without ever using the word greed. William F. Buckley used to say that the trouble with capitalism was capitalists. Piketty would have told him, no, you've got it backwards. We don't usually think of capitalism actor in itself, which may be why \"Das Kapital\" is the only classic work of Marx whose title we usually leave in the original German. It makes the concept seem alien, along with those other European words for class and money that we leave untranslated, like ronchiez and bourgeoisie. But it was Marx's notion of the centrality of capital that led later socialists to use the word capitalism to describe the prevalent economic system. When the term first entered English, it belonged entirely to the left. It conjured up workers bent over their machines, child labor and the plutocrats personified by the top-hatted little man on the Monopoly set - which by the way, was based on a game invented in 1903 to instruct people in the injustices of the capitalist system. Defenders of the system objected to those connotations and complained that capitalism was a misleading name, which it may very well be. They preferred private enterprise, which focused on the businessman's initiative rather than his inquisitiveness, or better yet, free enterprise, which linked the system to our democratic values. That term caught on in the 1930s when American business launched a concerted PR campaign to add it to Roosevelt's four freedoms as the fifth freedom - freedom of speech and religion, freedom from want and from fear, and freedom of enterprise, too. By the postwar years, free enterprise and free markets were slogans that defined the American way of life. But to some, those phrases suggested Chamber of Commerce boosterism which is what led writers like Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman to try to reclaim capitalism as a positive term that didn't require sweetening. They had some success, particularly among the people who like to dwell on the frontier justice of capitalism's capacity to reward success and punish failure. Yet even now, the name capitalism can still make its advocates uneasy. The Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz has urged the party to replace it with economic freedom. And not long ago, the conservatives who control the Texas State Board of Education ordered that textbooks should replace the word with free enterprise, which is still a term people prefer to use when they are endowing a foundation or university chair to promote the virtues of the capitalist system. But if capitalism is still half in the shadows, capitalist is completely out of bounds. You can use the word as an adjective of course - as in capitalist societies - and you can describe somebody as a venture capitalist. But Forbes and The Wall Street Journal almost never used capitalist by itself as a job description, unless they are mocking the jargon of the left. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, the Walden offspring - they're not capitalists but entrepreneurs, investors or just billionaires, depending on how they came by their piles. There are people who probably describe themselves as capitalist, of course, but usually with a slightly defiant tone. We don't even use capitalist for somebody who advocates the system the way we do with socialist. To call somebody a socialist is to say what he believes. To call him a capitalist is just to tell you what he does. Capital can't shake off its historical resonances even now which is what gives Piketty's title its power to rouse. That's the real contradiction of capitalism. Even at the moment of its absolute global triumph, it's haunted by the Marxist specters buried in its name.

Good morning, I'm in David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. The United States in the midst of what Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan calls the \"worst rental affordability crisis\" ever. Poor families have been hit the hardest, an overwhelming majority spent more than half of their incomes on rent. Others live in substandard housing, or are homeless. The problem is especially acute in fast-growing areas like Washington, D. C. as NPR's Pam Fessler reports. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Much of what you need to know about the affordable housing crisis can be seen right outside NPR's headquarters, just a few blocks from the U. S. Capitol. It's in an area called NoMa, which stands for North of Massachusetts Avenue, and it's a pretty busy, happening place right now. WILL MERRIFIELD: It sort of looks like a playground for young professionals, almost. FESSLER: Will Merrifield is a staff attorney at the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless. We're taking a walk around the block. MERRIFIELD: Pet shops, coffee shops, you know, bike lanes, dog parks. FESSLER: All the things he says that attract the kinds of people who can afford the luxury apartments that are also springing up around here - bright new structures with rooftop pools, fountains - big banners advertising modern, upscale living. MERRIFIELD: I mean, I don't know what these places go for but you do. FESSLER: I just happen to know. OK, so here we have. . . I checked it all out beforehand. Studio apartments rent for about $1,500 a month, two-bedrooms go for as much as $6,000. Pretty standard for a hot market like Washington, D. C. , but Merrifield says just look across the street. MERRIFIELD: It's so cliche, but it really is like the tale of two cities. FESSLER: Across from NPR are several public housing complexes and a huge parking lot where a subsidized apartment building once stood. It was torn down six years ago and residents were promised that new, affordable units would be built in its place - a promise yet to be realized. Instead, these and many other low-income residents have been squeezed out of the area. MERRIFIELD: You know, probably people who live in these new buildings have no idea - have absolutely no idea, how the people who have been displaced by this housing market - what they have to go through and how they're living. TONI SMART: I'm stuck here in this apartment. They won't fix anything. My heater has been busted since I moved in. I've been here since 2012 - May. FESSLER: Toni Smart is a 28-year-old mother of two. She's showing me her small, rundown apartment in another part of the city. To keep warm this winter, she kept the oven on. Smart has lived in Washington, D. C. all her life and she works, but with her minimum wage job, she really can't afford to live here anymore. SMART: Where am I going to find another apartment for $769? You know? Where am I going to find one? I'd rather deal with no heat than to be back in the shelter. FESSLER: Smart and her kids bounced around the city's homeless shelter system three years ago. That's where a growing number of D. C. families are ending up. Smart says working people like her need more help. She had some rental assistance, but that's now gone. And she could qualify for subsidized housing, but there are currently 72,000 families on the city's waiting list. SMART: What is the government going to do with the people that's in the District that's like just meeting ends meet? Like I'm not no basketball player, I'm not no supermodel - come on. ADRIANNE TODMAN: It's sort of the problem we see across the country in our large urban areas, where cities are popular again. FESSLER: Adrian Todman runs the D. C. Housing Authority. She says the city does have more subsidized housing units than it did a decade ago, but she admits they can't keep up with the growing demand. The city keeps losing affordable housing, mostly replaced by high-end apartments. Still, says Todman, there are advantages to all this new growth. TODMAN: When people move to D. C. , we get a stronger tax base. What happens when you have a stronger tax base? You get more money into the city's coffers. What happens when you get money into the city's coffers? You now have money to pay for better education, better housing. FESSLER: And she says the city has committed to spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new affordable housing. She also promises that all those apartments knocked down across from NPR's headquarters will be replaced. TODMAN: I think that we probably just need to act with a bit more urgency. FESSLER: Which isn't enough for advocates like Will Merrifield, who say that people need housing now. Indeed, earlier this month, a friend called Toni Smart at work to alert her that all of her possessions were out on the street - she'd been evicted. Her rental assistance from the city was a day late. A court got her right back into the apartment, but by the time Smart got home that day. . . SMART: My kids' toys was gone, their bikes was gone, the TVs was gone. Everything was gone. FESSLER: She's now trying to refurnish. And she's pretty sure she has enough money to pay June's rent, but after that, who knows? Pam Fessler, NPR News, Washington. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm in David Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And I'm Steve Inskeep. The United States in the midst of what Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan calls the \"worst rental affordability crisis\" ever. Poor families have been hit the hardest, an overwhelming majority spent more than half of their incomes on rent. Others live in substandard housing, or are homeless. The problem is especially acute in fast-growing areas like Washington, D. C. as NPR's Pam Fessler reports. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Much of what you need to know about the affordable housing crisis can be seen right outside NPR's headquarters, just a few blocks from the U. S. Capitol. It's in an area called NoMa, which stands for North of Massachusetts Avenue, and it's a pretty busy, happening place right now. WILL MERRIFIELD: It sort of looks like a playground for young professionals, almost. FESSLER: Will Merrifield is a staff attorney at the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless. We're taking a walk around the block. MERRIFIELD: Pet shops, coffee shops, you know, bike lanes, dog parks. FESSLER: All the things he says that attract the kinds of people who can afford the luxury apartments that are also springing up around here - bright new structures with rooftop pools, fountains - big banners advertising modern, upscale living. MERRIFIELD: I mean, I don't know what these places go for but you do. FESSLER: I just happen to know. OK, so here we have. . . I checked it all out beforehand. Studio apartments rent for about $1,500 a month, two-bedrooms go for as much as $6,000. Pretty standard for a hot market like Washington, D. C. , but Merrifield says just look across the street. MERRIFIELD: It's so cliche, but it really is like the tale of two cities. FESSLER: Across from NPR are several public housing complexes and a huge parking lot where a subsidized apartment building once stood. It was torn down six years ago and residents were promised that new, affordable units would be built in its place - a promise yet to be realized. Instead, these and many other low-income residents have been squeezed out of the area. MERRIFIELD: You know, probably people who live in these new buildings have no idea - have absolutely no idea, how the people who have been displaced by this housing market - what they have to go through and how they're living. TONI SMART: I'm stuck here in this apartment. They won't fix anything. My heater has been busted since I moved in. I've been here since 2012 - May. FESSLER: Toni Smart is a 28-year-old mother of two. She's showing me her small, rundown apartment in another part of the city. To keep warm this winter, she kept the oven on. Smart has lived in Washington, D. C. all her life and she works, but with her minimum wage job, she really can't afford to live here anymore. SMART: Where am I going to find another apartment for $769? You know? Where am I going to find one? I'd rather deal with no heat than to be back in the shelter. FESSLER: Smart and her kids bounced around the city's homeless shelter system three years ago. That's where a growing number of D. C. families are ending up. Smart says working people like her need more help. She had some rental assistance, but that's now gone. And she could qualify for subsidized housing, but there are currently 72,000 families on the city's waiting list. SMART: What is the government going to do with the people that's in the District that's like just meeting ends meet? Like I'm not no basketball player, I'm not no supermodel - come on. ADRIANNE TODMAN: It's sort of the problem we see across the country in our large urban areas, where cities are popular again. FESSLER: Adrian Todman runs the D. C. Housing Authority. She says the city does have more subsidized housing units than it did a decade ago, but she admits they can't keep up with the growing demand. The city keeps losing affordable housing, mostly replaced by high-end apartments. Still, says Todman, there are advantages to all this new growth. TODMAN: When people move to D. C. , we get a stronger tax base. What happens when you have a stronger tax base? You get more money into the city's coffers. What happens when you get money into the city's coffers? You now have money to pay for better education, better housing. FESSLER: And she says the city has committed to spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new affordable housing.

Manufacturing is high, unemployment is low. The economy is expanding, and yet the strangest report has recently come out of Europe. It says all of that success is actually a problem for the rest of the Eurozone. Zoe Chace of our Planet Money team wondered why Germany's success isn't considered a good thing. ZOE CHACE, BYLINE: Germany's got a thing about making stuff the world wants. JACOB KIRKEGAARD: Germany has always had what you could call an export fetish. You know, they've always been very focused on exporting as much as possible. CHACE: Jacob Kirkegaard with the Peterson Institute says when you have incredible export growth, money pours into the country. And ideally when a country makes a bunch of money, they spend a bunch of money. That was the whole idea of the European union - the money easily flows from one country to another. Say you're an Italian winemaker. Gianluca Garofoli, this is what he thinks the Germans do with that money. GIANLUCA GAROFOLI: They come with their cars, and they fill the truck of wine. This is the best thing. CHACE: But that's not really happening these days, Gianluca says. Germans aren't traveling so much to Italy and buying fine wines. And this is backed up by statistics. Turns out Germany is exporting much more than it's importing. Rather than running a big deficit like many other European countries, Germany has a trade surplus - a big one. Jacob Kirkegaard says no developed country in the history of the world has ever been so successful and so frugal at the same time. And when you have a really big country not buying much of anything, that's a problem. KIRKEGAARD: It's fair to say that if every consumer everywhere behaved like the German consumer, then the world would be in almost permanent recession. CHACE: This is why the Germans got in trouble with the European commission. They recently put out a report saying, Germans, you're not drinking enough Italian wine or eating enough Spanish figs. Basically, you're not buying enough stuff. Your trade surplus is above allowable limits. So start spending, or you will be in really big trouble next time one of these reports comes out. Now, one reason this kind of imbalance happens is these are really different cultures around money that have come together to share the Euro. Here's Gianluca, the Italian winemaker. GAROFOLI: I think it's a kind of an attitude of the German people. You are, like, cool if you buy something for reasonable price. It's a national mentality. CHACE: I know this may sound like a stereotype - the penny-pinching German. But talk to a German. PHILIP PLICKERT: I wouldn't pay too much for a bottle of wine actually. CHACE: This is Philip Plickert, the economics editor at the German newspaper, the FAZPLICKERT: My budget for a bottle of wine would be six or seven euros. That's OK. That's reasonable. I'm afraid that Italian wine won't save Italy. They have to produce something else. CHACE: Oh, Italy, you just got told by a German. That does happen in the EU these days. And the German household savings rate, it is really high. Germans are not splurging. But there's a deeper systemic issue in the European Union beyond culture that explains the surplus - the shared currency itself. If Germany still had its own money, the old deutchmark, it would have been really hard to build up a surplus like this. If people wanted to buy German stuff, they'd have to use marks. The more popular German stuff got, the more valuable the mark would get. Their currency would get really strong. And that would have corrected the problem. German products get more expensive, exports slow down and inside Germany, the strong mark makes things like Italian wines seem super cheap. Gianluca, the winemaker, says in fact it was easier to sell his wines back before the euro, back when Italy was using the lira. GAROFOLI: When we used to sell our wines in lira, obviously our wines were much, much, much cheaper. And it was much easier to export all over the world. So, yes, from my point of view, yes, it was easier with liras than with euros. CHACE: But today, Italy and Germany are both on the euro. So exchange rates between the two countries do not automatically adjust to even things out. German cars seem like a deal. Italian wine looks expensive. The Germans keep racking up the surpluses, and the Italians rack up the deficits. It's hard to solve this problem. Nobody wants Germany to produce fewer cars, but it's also hard to make individual Germans change their behavior. Here's Plickert, the German newspaper editor. PLICKERT: How should you order people to spend their money? I mean, it's a free country and this is a free economy. I mean, we don't have a kind of commissioner who orders people to spend or to save. It's millions of individuals who make their individual decisions. CHACE: Theoretically, if Germany makes no changes and the surplus gets worse, they'll have to play a fine to the European Commission. Money that will be put into a bailout fund for Eurozone countries. Zoe Chace, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: This is NPR News.

Remember I said earlier that there is a mixed picture for new graduates? Well, the going is tougher for new graduates who are black, even if they studied high demand fields like engineering. A recent report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research titled \"A College Degree Is No Guarantee\" says that last year, about 12 percent of black college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were unemployed. For all college graduates in the same age range, that's graduates of all races, the unemployment rate was about half that. Of course, we assume that there's a lot going on behind these numbers. So we have two guests with us to talk about this issue and what black graduates face as they search for jobs this summer and why. Janelle Jones is a research associate at the Center for Economic Policy and Research. She is one of the authors of the report. She's with us in our studios in Washington, D. C. Welcome, thanks for coming in. JANELLE JONES: Thanks so much for having me. MARTIN: Also joining us is Professor Nancy DiTomaso. She is vice dean for faculty and research at Rutgers Business School-Newark and New Brunswick. Nancy's also the author of the book \"The American Non-Dilemma: Racial Inequality Without Racism,\" and we are speaking to her from member station WBGO in Newark. Professor DiTomaso, thanks so much for joining us once again. NANCY DITOMASO: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So, Janelle, let's start with you. The report says that compared to non-black graduates, black graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed. And one of the things that stands out to me, is something I mentioned earlier, this is true even in high-demand fields. For example, 10 percent of black college graduates with - with computer-related fields were - sorry, 10 percent of black college graduates in engineering and 11 percent with math and computer related fields were unemployed. That's compared with 6 percent of engineering grads and 7 percent of all math grads. So the obvious question is, why? JONES: Right, yeah. So we do talk about that in the report. And we also - I mean, you talked about the numbers for engineering. Thirty-two percent of black college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 are underemployed - 32 percent. MARTIN: I'm going to get to that. JONES: Right. MARTIN: I'm going to get to the underemployed as well. But I want to - specifically, what is the - what's the why? JONES: Right. Well, the why is definitely a weak labor market. We have, you know, we have seen that we're basically in recovery, but these young African-American graduates are definitely not feeling recovered. So the weak labor market  definitely has something to do with it, and we also talk a little bit about racism in the report. And. . . MARTIN: Well, talk a little bit more about racism in the report. JONES: (Laughing). MARTIN: Let's hear about it. JONES: Sure. So, you know, we have - we list a couple of studies where you show - you basically have a black applicant and white applicant. You send out the exact same resume, white applicant's more likely to get a call back. And even when we - in the report we look at, you know, by major. So these are people who have studied the same thing, they're the same age, and blacks are more likely to be unemployed. So, you know, it's not skills. It's not experience. It's something else. And we think that that something else is labor market discrimination. MARTIN: And talk about the underemployment. As you mentioned that we have also talked about unemployment, but you said that the high percentage of black graduates are underemployed, meaning they're working at jobs for which they are overqualified. And that's more likely to be the case, and why do we think that is? JONES: Right. Well, again, racism and the weak labor market has something to do with it. More than half of these black college graduates are in jobs that don't require a degree. And that just - I mean, that really blows my mind. You go to school, you stay, you finish, you get a job, and it doesn't require a degree. That is just incredibly discouraging, and it's something that, you know, a lot of people are dealing with. MARTIN: Professor DiTomaso, let's turn to you now. The Atlantic did a piece about this report, and you are quoted in it. And you say, this study, its findings, as terrible as they are, honestly should not come as a shock to anybody who's willing to face the truth about employment and unemployment in the United States. So talk about that. Why do you think that that is true? DITOMASO: Well, first of all there is context to these kinds of numbers. The same kinds of proportions have actually been in effect, or been represented in the job market for at least the last 50 years. Fifty years or so, the ratio of white unemployment to black unemployment was about 2. 1, and more recently it's about 2. 2, meaning that twice as many blacks are unemployed as whites, both 50 years ago and now. And although there's been some minor variations across year, depending on the economic conditions of the country, it's really been about the same ratio for a very long time. MARTIN: Is there. . . DITOMASO: So and that's. . . MARTIN: . . . Is there anything - and I understand that you're saying that, look, this has been true for the past 50 years. But is there anything in the present moment that makes the underemployment and unemployment of black graduates unique? Anything at all? DITOMASO: Well, certainly the economic crisis that started in 2008 and the very slow recovery since then has exacerbated whatever kinds of processes or mechanisms already were at play. But I wanted to call attention to an issue that I've been trying to raise when these kinds of discussions come up, which is that one could take these same numbers - of the unemployment rate, the underemployment rate, the issues regarding new graduates trying to get jobs or people in different kinds of fields trying to get jobs - and turn it around. Instead of saying that blacks are more likely to be unemployed or that they're more likely to be underemployed and so on, you could use those very same numbers and say that whites are more likely to get jobs and they are less likely to be underemployed. So again, in my analysis and research, I think that the dynamics - it's not so much racism and discrimination, although I'm sure that those exist, as it is that the job market in general works in terms of people helping each other. And whites help other whites get jobs, and when the number of jobs available are very tight and scarce, those kinds of processes are even more likely to take place. And so whites are, if you are, if you will, over employed (laughing) or overrepresented in the available opportunities. And I think that's the dynamic that is more important to look at because it's one that we haven't given enough attention to. MARTIN: I want to hear more about that. For those who are interested in this question, and I assume that's many people, who want to know what the situation is for other minorities, that falls somewhere in between that of blacks and whites. According to the federal data in 2013, the share of all college-educated Asian-Americans who are unemployed roughly equal the proportion of whites. But all Hispanic college graduates faced a 5 percent unemployment rate, which was more than whites but less than African-Americans. So let's wheel around. And, Professor DiTomaso, let's talk about - and, Janelle, I want to hear from you, too, as well - what's the right approach to this? How would you say - what is the best way to address this for people who believe that this gap is unacceptable, given that the message that, you know, policymakers, educators, parents are all saying if you get the right skills, that that will address the problem? These data suggest that that is not necessarily the case. So, Professor DiTomaso, you've said, you've studied this quite closely. What do you say to that? If you say the issue is that whites tend to help whites, which is - tends not to be illegal, (laughing) right? Or at least there's no federal. . . DITOMASO: Right, yes. MARTIN: . . . There's no specific prohibition against that. It's called kind of networking. But what do you say? What's the right way to address this? DITOMASO: Well, first of all, it's consequential if whites help other whites and other groups help those that are like themselves as well. But whites are disproportionately in the positions where they get to make the decisions about who gets hired, who has opportunities. They're more likely to be in jobs with higher incomes, with more authority, with more training and so on. And therefore, when we have these kinds of processes, where jobs are obtained, or more likely because of these kinds of networking processes, it's very consequential in terms of reproducing inequality. And that can take place without necessarily using racism as an explanation. Again, it's - from my perspective, it's more the favoritism that whites show toward other whites than it is the discrimination or racism that whites show, certainly intentionally, toward blacks or other nonwhites. So what does one do about it? I think that it's important on the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, to raise these issues again in terms of a policy level, a collective level. There needs to be attention to how these kinds of decisions, about who gets hired and who gets jobs and what kinds of opportunities are available. It used to be that - at least in the early days of the passage of the Civil Rights Act and then following with executive orders, that affirmative action was seen as a particular solution. And again, if you see affirmative action not as a way to give preferences to blacks, but to stop giving preferences to whites, then that policy, in fact, was very effective in terms of changing some of the picture in terms of who had access to certain kinds of jobs. At the organizational level, companies can also pay more attention to the kind of biases that decision-makers make for whites, as opposed to the biases against blacks, which is where all of their attention has been focused. MARTIN: I need to, I want to give, I need to give Janelle a chance. . . DITOMASO: Sure. MARTIN: . . . To weigh in on this question as well. So, Janelle Jones, final thought from you? JONES: Sure. So I think that, you know, one thing that we've seen is that when the labor market is doing well for everyone, blacks tend to, kind of, rise with that tide. So the strongest period of growth, for wages and labor market opportunities for African-Americans was when, you know, the entire economy was at full employment in the early 2000s. So I think that, you know, the likelihood of getting, kind of, a national policy that addresses blacks getting better jobs is not likely. So I think that, you know, one way we can do this is really focus on full employment for everyone and  recovering the labor market at the bottom.

MARTIN: I'm going to get to that. JONES: Right. MARTIN: I'm going to get to the underemployed as well. But I want to - specifically, what is the - what's the why? JONES: Right. Well, the why is definitely a weak labor market. We have, you know, we have seen that we're basically in recovery, but these young African-American graduates are definitely not feeling recovered. So the weak labor market  definitely has something to do with it, and we also talk a little bit about racism in the report. And. . . MARTIN: Well, talk a little bit more about racism in the report. JONES: (Laughing). MARTIN: Let's hear about it. JONES: Sure. So, you know, we have - we list a couple of studies where you show - you basically have a black applicant and white applicant. You send out the exact same resume, white applicant's more likely to get a call back. And even when we - in the report we look at, you know, by major. So these are people who have studied the same thing, they're the same age, and blacks are more likely to be unemployed. So, you know, it's not skills. It's not experience. It's something else. And we think that that something else is labor market discrimination. MARTIN: And talk about the underemployment. As you mentioned that we have also talked about unemployment, but you said that the high percentage of black graduates are underemployed, meaning they're working at jobs for which they are overqualified. And that's more likely to be the case, and why do we think that is? JONES: Right. Well, again, racism and the weak labor market has something to do with it. More than half of these black college graduates are in jobs that don't require a degree. And that just - I mean, that really blows my mind. You go to school, you stay, you finish, you get a job, and it doesn't require a degree. That is just incredibly discouraging, and it's something that, you know, a lot of people are dealing with. MARTIN: Professor DiTomaso, let's turn to you now. The Atlantic did a piece about this report, and you are quoted in it. And you say, this study, its findings, as terrible as they are, honestly should not come as a shock to anybody who's willing to face the truth about employment and unemployment in the United States. So talk about that. Why do you think that that is true? DITOMASO: Well, first of all there is context to these kinds of numbers. The same kinds of proportions have actually been in effect, or been represented in the job market for at least the last 50 years. Fifty years or so, the ratio of white unemployment to black unemployment was about 2. 1, and more recently it's about 2. 2, meaning that twice as many blacks are unemployed as whites, both 50 years ago and now. And although there's been some minor variations across year, depending on the economic conditions of the country, it's really been about the same ratio for a very long time. MARTIN: Is there. . . DITOMASO: So and that's. . . MARTIN: . . . Is there anything - and I understand that you're saying that, look, this has been true for the past 50 years. But is there anything in the present moment that makes the underemployment and unemployment of black graduates unique? Anything at all? DITOMASO: Well, certainly the economic crisis that started in 2008 and the very slow recovery since then has exacerbated whatever kinds of processes or mechanisms already were at play. But I wanted to call attention to an issue that I've been trying to raise when these kinds of discussions come up, which is that one could take these same numbers - of the unemployment rate, the underemployment rate, the issues regarding new graduates trying to get jobs or people in different kinds of fields trying to get jobs - and turn it around. Instead of saying that blacks are more likely to be unemployed or that they're more likely to be underemployed and so on, you could use those very same numbers and say that whites are more likely to get jobs and they are less likely to be underemployed. So again, in my analysis and research, I think that the dynamics - it's not so much racism and discrimination, although I'm sure that those exist, as it is that the job market in general works in terms of people helping each other. And whites help other whites get jobs, and when the number of jobs available are very tight and scarce, those kinds of processes are even more likely to take place. And so whites are, if you are, if you will, over employed (laughing) or overrepresented in the available opportunities. And I think that's the dynamic that is more important to look at because it's one that we haven't given enough attention to. MARTIN: I want to hear more about that. For those who are interested in this question, and I assume that's many people, who want to know what the situation is for other minorities, that falls somewhere in between that of blacks and whites. According to the federal data in 2013, the share of all college-educated Asian-Americans who are unemployed roughly equal the proportion of whites. But all Hispanic college graduates faced a 5 percent unemployment rate, which was more than whites but less than African-Americans. So let's wheel around. And, Professor DiTomaso, let's talk about - and, Janelle, I want to hear from you, too, as well - what's the right approach to this? How would you say - what is the best way to address this for people who believe that this gap is unacceptable, given that the message that, you know, policymakers, educators, parents are all saying if you get the right skills, that that will address the problem? These data suggest that that is not necessarily the case. So, Professor DiTomaso, you've said, you've studied this quite closely. What do you say to that? If you say the issue is that whites tend to help whites, which is - tends not to be illegal, (laughing) right? Or at least there's no federal. . . DITOMASO: Right, yes. MARTIN: . . . There's no specific prohibition against that. It's called kind of networking. But what do you say? What's the right way to address this? DITOMASO: Well, first of all, it's consequential if whites help other whites and other groups help those that are like themselves as well. But whites are disproportionately in the positions where they get to make the decisions about who gets hired, who has opportunities. They're more likely to be in jobs with higher incomes, with more authority, with more training and so on. And therefore, when we have these kinds of processes, where jobs are obtained, or more likely because of these kinds of networking processes, it's very consequential in terms of reproducing inequality. And that can take place without necessarily using racism as an explanation. Again, it's - from my perspective, it's more the favoritism that whites show toward other whites than it is the discrimination or racism that whites show, certainly intentionally, toward blacks or other nonwhites. So what does one do about it? I think that it's important on the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, to raise these issues again in terms of a policy level, a collective level. There needs to be attention to how these kinds of decisions, about who gets hired and who gets jobs and what kinds of opportunities are available. It used to be that - at least in the early days of the passage of the Civil Rights Act and then following with executive orders, that affirmative action was seen as a particular solution. And again, if you see affirmative action not as a way to give preferences to blacks, but to stop giving preferences to whites, then that policy, in fact, was very effective in terms of changing some of the picture in terms of who had access to certain kinds of jobs. At the organizational level, companies can also pay more attention to the kind of biases that decision-makers make for whites, as opposed to the biases against blacks, which is where all of their attention has been focused. MARTIN: I need to, I want to give, I need to give Janelle a chance. . . DITOMASO: Sure. MARTIN: . . . To weigh in on this question as well. So, Janelle Jones, final thought from you? JONES: Sure. So I think that, you know, one thing that we've seen is that when the labor market is doing well for everyone, blacks tend to, kind of, rise with that tide. So the strongest period of growth, for wages and labor market opportunities for African-Americans was when, you know, the entire economy was at full employment in the early 2000s. So I think that, you know, the likelihood of getting, kind of, a national policy that addresses blacks getting better jobs is not likely. So I think that, you know, one way we can do this is really focus on full employment for everyone and  recovering the labor market at the bottom.

I'm Michel Martin. It's June, and that means that nearly two million new college graduates are starting the next phase of their lives. And among those who are searching for jobs, it turns out that they may have better odds of finding jobs this year than in the recent past. But it's still tough out there, especially for certain graduates, and we'll have more on that in a few minutes. But for young people, overall, there are still high levels of unemployment, and many graduates are being hired into positions that offer low wages and don't require college degrees. Joining us to talk about the good, the bad and the ugly news for the class of 2014 is Marilyn Geewax. She's a senior business edit - news editor at NPR. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us, once again. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So what's the big picture? What measure are analysts using to suggest that there is a brighter outlook this year? GEEWAX: Well, there's an organization - the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Every spring, they do a survey to see how things are going, and this year it's showing that employers are expecting to hire nearly 9 percent more college graduates. And they're planning to pay them 1. 2 percent more than they did last year. So that's - you know, that's the right direction. You want to see hiring up, and you want to see wages going up, and the overall economy seems to be stronger. The last three months we've had more than 200,000 new jobs for each month. We'll get a new report on Friday, but in general it's looking better. Let's just say if you had an older sibling who was class of 2009, you're lucky you're you this year, because it's better than it was a few years ago. MARTIN: So what are the challenges that are still out there? GEEWAX: The big problem for a lot of college graduates is not so much finding a job, but finding a job you actually want and that pays you something decent. The Labor Department says the unemployment rate for college graduates is about 3. 3 percent. In other words, full employment - you can get a job if you're a college graduate. The problem is, when you look at the statistics, about four out of ten are in jobs that really don't require a college education. In other words, you graduate from college, and yes, someone wants to hire you. But you're working in a retail sales job at the mall. You're really not in the field that you wanted to be in. MARTIN: And of course, that has implications for people who don't have college graduates, because people with those degrees are kind of crowding out people who, otherwise, would have those opportunities. Talk about another issue, if you would, that's been in the news a lot in recent years, which is the level of debt that college graduates bring with them to get that degree. Do we - what do we know? GEEWAX: The Senate just had another hearing, this morning, about student debt. And, you know, the numbers there are terrible. There's about 1. 2 trillion dollars in student debt, and that's spread over about 40 million people. The typical student debt is about 33,000 dollars this year, and that's a record. It's twice - even after you adjust for inflation, it's about twice what it was 20 years ago. So there are lots of people graduating who are getting jobs. Yes, it's good to be a college graduate, but the jobs are too often not in something that pays well, and the students are heavily burdened with debt. MARTIN: Is there any advice that you feel comfortable giving to recent college graduates who are on the market and looking for those first opportunities? GEEWAX: Well, I'm - I am certainly not - I want to be clear. I am not a guidance counselor. But I do look at data, and it's just overwhelmingly clear that the jobs that are really paying right now are all the jobs that I would find awful, but. . . MARTIN: Like what? GEEWAX: You know, computer science, engineering, accounting - the best job out there, the statistics show, is to be a petroleum engineer. Starting salaries - 22-year-olds coming out of college are being offered jobs at more than 95,000 dollars a year. So if you want to be a 23-year-old making in the six figures, be a petroleum engineer. But, you know, that's a very tough way to go. The jobs that tend to not pan out are those that are, like, media studies and psychology and arts. Those kinds of softer majors are still having pretty low salaries, and that's where the trouble really is. So that. . . MARTIN: Meaning us. (LAUGHTER)GEEWAX: Looking at ourselves, yes. We are typical examples. . . MARTIN: Of. . . GEEWAX: . . . Of what's a real problem. But, you know, there are more problems, though, that even if you have the kind of degrees that we have in journalism, the real problems for people are dithering. I mean, no matter what your major is - yes it's great to be a petroleum engineer, but if you're going to graduate in journalism, make sure you're doing it the right way. That is, do it in four years. Don't drag it out over six years. That's a real problem. MARTIN: Why? Why? Because of the debt load. . . GEEWAX: Because of the debt, yeah. MARTIN: Because it tends to increase the debt, and then it becomes harder to. . . GEEWAX: Harder and harder. MARTIN: . . . To pay off that debt and your options are limited and. . . GEEWAX: And you're coming out of school, you're 24 - 25-years-old, and there are already people, you know, running up your back who are 22-years-old. And they'll, you know - it sort of looks better to an employer to see somebody who's been really aggressive about finishing school in four years. And the other thing that you really need to keep in mind is the value of internships. That, on the one hand, yeah, you want to graduate in four years, but you want to make sure that you've layered in, during those four years, ways to get your foot in the door. That's what the statistics really show, is that people who have managed to get some work experience and finish in a timely fashion, get good grades - those are the things that tend to help you get through school. You know, the problem, I think, is we all have a kind of an image of, college should be fun, you know. It's beer and football, and that's nice. We all did a little of that. But you also have to realize that going to college is a job that has to be taken seriously, or you end up with a - 33,000 dollars in debt, you're 25-years-old, you've changed majors three times. And those are the people that really end up having a lot of trouble in the job market. MARTIN: Marilyn Geewax is a senior business news editor at NPR, with us once again in our Washington, D.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. New government data out today showed the economy hit an important milestone last month. The U. S. finally regained all the jobs it lost during the Great Recession. Employers added 217,000 jobs in May, pushing the number of jobs in the U. S. to a record level. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, the solid growth is welcome, but passing this milestone didn't spark much celebration. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: It's safe to say not many champagne corks were popped when it became clear the number of payroll jobs had passed the prerecession level. That's because it's taken nearly six and a half years just to regain the 8. 7 million jobs lost during the recession. Even the reaction from the White House was subdued. Jason Furman is head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JASON FURMAN: We're back to where we were at the end of 2007. And absolutely, we should have moved ahead over that time. But every month that we put, you know, 200,000 jobs, you know, a little more, a little bit less, up on the board. You're closing that job gap, and you're moving this economy towards the recovery that we really need. YDSTIE: Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, says for several years now the job market has been turning in fairly steady improvements. GARY BURTLESS: Just not fast enough to soak up all of the additional unemployed workers that the recession gave us. YDSTIE: Indeed the unemployment rate remained unchanged in May at 6. 3 percent - well above prerecession levels. And nearly 10 million Americans remain unemployed. Many others are so discouraged, they're not looking for jobs. Therefore, they aren't counted as unemployed. Millions are also underemployed, says John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. JOHN SILVIA: It's important to note that, yes, we've hit the number of jobs prior to the recession, but the percentage of those jobs that are part-time is significantly greater than before. YDSTIE: And obviously those part-time jobs come with part-time salaries. That's put a restraint on consumer demand. And Heidi Shierholz, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, says that's been a major factor in the slow recovery of the economy and the job market. HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: When we do see a real ramp-up in demand, employers will have to hire people to meet that demand. And then we will get into a really robust jobs recovery. We're just not quite there yet. YDSTIE: Job growth has been well above average for the past three months as the job market has bounced back from the hit it took during the severe winter. John Silvia says he thinks it's shifted into a higher gear. SILVIA: I think when you look at the data, probably by the end of this year, you're going to be average - something like 210,000 to 220,000. That's clearly an improvement over the numbers for the last three years. So now we've reached a new level. I think it's sustainable. I think it's very positive for the overall economy. YDSTIE: But that will still leave some long-term unemployed behind, says Silvia, because they no longer have the skills to do many of the jobs the economy offers. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   And I'm Robert Siegel. New government data out today showed the economy hit an important milestone last month. The U. S. finally regained all the jobs it lost during the Great Recession. Employers added 217,000 jobs in May, pushing the number of jobs in the U. S. to a record level. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, the solid growth is welcome, but passing this milestone didn't spark much celebration. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: It's safe to say not many champagne corks were popped when it became clear the number of payroll jobs had passed the prerecession level. That's because it's taken nearly six and a half years just to regain the 8. 7 million jobs lost during the recession. Even the reaction from the White House was subdued. Jason Furman is head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JASON FURMAN: We're back to where we were at the end of 2007. And absolutely, we should have moved ahead over that time. But every month that we put, you know, 200,000 jobs, you know, a little more, a little bit less, up on the board. You're closing that job gap, and you're moving this economy towards the recovery that we really need. YDSTIE: Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, says for several years now the job market has been turning in fairly steady improvements. GARY BURTLESS: Just not fast enough to soak up all of the additional unemployed workers that the recession gave us.

I'm Dave Greene. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. The government's monthly jobs report released earlier today shows the U. S. economy hit a milestone in May. The report shows that after years of painfully slow job growth, the United States has finally surpassed the number of jobs it had before the great recession. NPR's John Ydstie has the good news and bad news. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The good news is that the economy added 217,000 jobs last month. That puts the total number of jobs well above the 138. 4 million record set back in December of 2007, just before the economy tumbled into recession. Labor economist Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution says the bad news is that it's taken almost six and a half years just to get back all the jobs we lost in the recession. That's the longest jobs recovery since before World War II. GARY BURTLESS: It's happy that we're hitting this threshold, but it's sad it's taken us this long. YDSTIE: Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute agrees that hitting this employment milestone isn't necessarily a proud moment. HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: We should have added around 7 million jobs over the last six and a half years, just to hold steady. So just getting back to where we were before the recession began nearly six and half years ago, leaves us in a really big hole. YDSTIE: Burtless says job growth has been steady in the past few years, but too slow to provide employment for all the new working age Americans added during the past six and a half years and the millions laid off during the recession. And he says the relatively rapid decline in the unemployment rate from 10 percent to 6. 3 percent is somewhat misleading. BURTLESS: The unemployment rate is covering up for the fact that lots of people are so discouraged that they are not actively seeking work. They're not counted as unemployed. YDSTIE: After a big drop in April, many economists had expected the unemployment rate might tick up a notch in May. But it remained at 6. 3 percent. Despite the steady decline in the unemployment rate over the last years, May's numbers show that nearly 10 million American remain unemployed. It also showed no change in the number of long-term unemployed, people who've been out of work more than 26 weeks. And partly because many workers are too discouraged to look for employment, the percentage of Americans in the job market remains at a 35-year low. So what's the reason for this slow growth that's held back the job market? Here's one big reason, says Heidi Shierholz, weak consumer demand. SHIERHOLZ: Employers are smart. They're going to hire people exactly when they need them to meet some increased demand for their goods and services. That's the missing piece. Demand is the missing thing out there. YDSTIE: The solid May jobs numbers do brighten the picture a bit. They show average job growth over the past three months above 230,000. That suggests the economy continues its steady recovery.

Let's zoom in on a region that stands out for its high unemployment, Central California's San Joaquin Valley. NPR's Kelly McEvers went to find out why it's so hard to get a job amid some of the most productive farmland on earth. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1: Employment Development Department, work force services. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: It's first thing in the morning. And people are calling and lining up to sign up for unemployment benefits and look for jobs. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: (Spanish spoken). MAN 1: Yeah, yes. (Spanish spoken). MCEVERS: Even before the economic downturn, Fresno County's numbers were not good. But now unemployment in this area is double the national average - 6 to 7 percent nationwide, 11 to 12 percent here in Fresno. And that's an improvement over recent years. STEPHEN GUTIERREZ: Twelve-point-nine in 2013, 15 percent in 2012, 2011 we had an average of 16. 4. 2010, 16. 7. MCEVERS: That's Stephen Gutierrez with the Employment Department's information division. He say of the 10 cities with the highest unemployment in the U. S. , more than half of them are regularly here in the San Joaquin Valley, a place just under 200 miles, but a world away from cities like San Francisco and San Jose on the coast. Analysts say that's because this region's economy is dominated by one thing - agriculture, the grape, cotton, nut and citrus farms that generate crops worth billions of dollars a year and help feed the country.  Fresno State political science professor Jeff Cummins says a single dominant industry like this can be a curse. JEFF CUMMINS: The value of agricultural production here is certainly a significant portion of the overall statewide economy. But I think it's not an industry that is going to lend itself to a booming economy or these spillover effects. MCEVERS: Farmers, or growers as they're called here, might make good profits from farming. But farm workers - by and large immigrants, most of them undocumented - make so little, like 9 or $10 an hour, that they don't spend any money in the local economy. CUMMINS: So if you think about those workers going out and spending their money on just ordinary everyday expenses, it's not going to be like somebody in Silicon Valley, who has a much higher salary, much more disposable income. MCEVERS: That means businesses can't survive, houses don't get built and investors stay away. None of this is to say that a farm economy is bad. In the Midwest, there is not such a big disconnect between owners and workers. And there's more ag-related business, like making tractors and processing meat, that spurs growth and investment. There are a few other industries here in the San Joaquin Valley - call centers, prisons, small manufacturing. But again, the low wages paid to workers don't spur growth in other industries. Alfredo Nolasco worked for 16 years as the team leader in the paint shop of a security camera maker just outside Fresno. He made $19. 50 an hour until. ALFREDO NOLASCO: They laid me off the 4 of January, 2013. MCEVERS: Really, why? NOLASCO: According to them, my position was no longer needed. MCEVERS: Now he's at the employment office because his benefits recently stopped. I ask Nolasco if he's ever thought about moving to a place like Silicon Valley where there are more jobs. NOLASCO: I've thought about it. But, you know, I start factoring the price of living here and there and trying to find a place to stay in the meantime. So there's just a lot of little factors that kind of deter me from doing that. MCEVERS: Recent studies suggest the reason you can have such a depressed economy like Fresno near such a booming economy like Silicon Valley is because Americans are moving less than we used to. Some economists have even proposed that unemployment payments should be higher if you move and try to find work. Nolasco says it makes sense. NOLASCO: I believe that's something to think about, yeah. MCEVERS: One thing people here point to as a way to break out of the cycle of low wages, high unemployment and a stagnating economy is a $68 billion high-speed rail project approved by California voters in 2008. The plan, portions of which are still being presented to the public in town-hall-style meetings, is to connect San Francisco to Los Angeles along a route that would run, not on the coast, but inland through the San Joaquin Valley. While the construction and maintenance of the rail might bring some jobs, people here say it could make it easier for people to commute to the coast. But that project is being fought in the courts, and even if it goes through, it's not slated to be finished until 2029. Kelly McEvers, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  OK, that's the national picture.

NPR business editor, Uri Berliner, helps us to understand business, so he decided to do some. The cash he was keeping in a savings account was not keeping up with inflation, so he bet on assets - ranging from stocks to a painting bought online. Here's his update. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: I had up to $5,000 I was willing to invest. A chunk of it would be heading to the stock market. What mattered to me was diversification and keeping my fees and expenses as low as possible. So I reached out to Miranda Marquit, a personal-finance blogger. We went shopping together for low-cost ETF's - funds that match broad portions of the market. MIRANDA MARQUIT: This has an expense ratio of . 04 percent, so that's really - that's low. BERLINER: I didn't want my basket to be filled entirely with U. S. stocks. It needed an international flavor. MARQUIT: Yeah, that one would be a good one. So you can get most of the total world stocks. BERLINER: How am I doing? Since I put together my little stock portfolio last spring, it's gone up 20 percent. What hasn't done so well is a fund I bought that invests in commercial real estate - it's up 4 percent. So that's the plain vanilla chapter of my investing story. Let's move on to a much more speculative bet - coffee futures. Last spring, coffee futures were in a rut at a three and a half year low. I went to Chicago to meet Jack Scoville. He is a futures broker and I asked him - what was keeping prices down? JACK SCOVILLE: We've had a significant uptick in production. When you look at Columbia, their production's increased. And Brazil has just had a whopper year. BERLINER: But a year later, the situation has changed. The excess supply of coffee beans - it's gone, and my coffee futures fund is up 21 percent. So I check in with Jack Scoville again and ask him, what's been happening over the past year? SCOVILLE: What's really sent prices higher is a draught in Brazil, which is threatening to really curtail the production there. BERLINER: My next investment is a lot more tangible than the future price of coffee. It filled up an entire shopping cart at Costco. BERLINER: All right, toothpaste, pecans, big bag of onions - we're getting my items run up here. My strategy - bulk buying. Buying in bulk is cheaper than purchasing items one at a time. And if prices are rising, those bulk purchases can be a good hedge against inflation. Last year, I asked economist Russ Roberts to come along while I shopped at a Costco in Washington DC. RUSS ROBERTS: So it's certainly true that cash, if you can spare it, to convert your cash into real goods, whose price is rising, that's not a bad idea. BERLINER: A little more than a year later, I put the idea to the test. Here I am at Costco. This is round two, the update. Again, my bet only pays off if the prices on last year's bulk purchases are now higher. OK, last year I bought 3 pounds of pistachios for 14. 89, his year they're 18. 99 - a lot more expensive. Pistachio inflation - I never would have guessed that. How about a four-pack of toothpaste? So last year this toothpaste went for 12. 99. This year, 8. 99 with a rebate. So it's a lot cheaper. And so it goes. Trash bags are up in price but tuna fish is cheaper. All told prices from last year's haul have climbed only around 1 percent, making my hedge against inflation a bit of a bust. For my last investment, I took to the Internet - all the way to Vilnius, Lithuania. An artist named Vladimir Kryloff had put his work on Saatchi online, an art marketplace. I liked his colorful painting called Flower Study 14. So I bought it over the website for $450, plus $139 for shipping. That painting has been on my bedroom wall ever since, until I wrap it in a beach towel and bring it to be appraised. JEAN PIERRE DAN DINO: I checked the back that I noticed it was signed and dated. BERLINER: That's Jean Pierre Dan Dino, an art appraiser in Washington. He measures and photographs the painting, and then scans it with an ultraviolet light. DAN DINO: It will show if there are any repairs or any damages or any condition problems. BERLINER: Then Dan Dino does some research on the artist and comparable works in the same style, the verdict - $900. That's the market value, what Dan Dino calls a fair asking price. So theoretically I could make more than $300 by selling. But I'd need to find a buyer. And that could take a lot of time. Dan Dino senses my uncertainty. DAN DINO: You could ask for 900 and give them - if they pay all cash upfront - a 10 percent discount. BERLINER: Or. . . DAN DINO: Maybe you could donate it to a not-for-profit institution and get a tax write-off, which you could get for $900 right now. All good suggestions. But in the end, I decided the painting isn't a financial investment, it's an emotional one. I enjoy it. So I'm keeping Flower Study 14 at home, hanging on the wall. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

BERLINER: That's Jean Pierre Dan Dino, an art appraiser in Washington. He measures and photographs the painting, and then scans it with an ultraviolet light. DAN DINO: It will show if there are any repairs or any damages or any condition problems. BERLINER: Then Dan Dino does some research on the artist and comparable works in the same style, the verdict - $900. That's the market value, what Dan Dino calls a fair asking price. So theoretically I could make more than $300 by selling. But I'd need to find a buyer. And that could take a lot of time. Dan Dino senses my uncertainty. DAN DINO: You could ask for 900 and give them - if they pay all cash upfront - a 10 percent discount. BERLINER: Or. . . DAN DINO: Maybe you could donate it to a not-for-profit institution and get a tax write-off, which you could get for $900 right now. All good suggestions. But in the end, I decided the painting isn't a financial investment, it's an emotional one. I enjoy it. So I'm keeping Flower Study 14 at home, hanging on the wall.

Some are buying for investment purposes. Prices are positively cheap compared to the market in Beijing or Shanghai, while others are putting down roots for a life in the United States. As Miles Bryan reports, that's got some home-sellers using a new sales pitch - location, location and chi. MILES BRYAN, BYLINE: Leave Los Angeles on interstate ten and head east. In about 40 miles, you'll run into a quintessentially suburban phenomenon, the opening of the College Park subdivision. The lawns are bright green, the DJ is spinning classic rock, and a lot of the conversations are in Mandarin. Among those looking for a house is Eddie Yung. EDDIE YUNG: Yes, I am living in the center of China. Yeah, starting and - do some business in China, but for my baby girl we're going to move in California. MARK TORRES: Out here at College Park, about 72 percent of our market share is an Asian buyer-profile. BRYAN: Mark Torres is a division president for Lennar Homes, the company that's building College Park. The number of Chinese buying homes in the US has more than doubled since 2007, with most of those sales here, in Southern California. Torres says that marketing to Chinese buyers has meant learning about what his customers want in a house's design. TORRES: We consider feng shui element in all our designs. Everything from the water, fire elements and making sure that we don't have those types of conflicts - designing the entry of the homes to keep all the positive energy in the home. BRYAN: Just a few miles from College Park is the town of Chino Hills. That's where Lisa Dutton lives. Her house has feng shui problems. It's had them since she bought it from a Chinese seller 15 years ago. LISA DUTTON: And so as he was moving out, he told us the reason he was moving is because the house didn't have good chi. Well, we had no idea what chi was, you know, I had no idea whatsoever. So we bought the house. BRYAN: Dutton's house had been on the market for two and a half years, but gotten nothing but lowball offers. DUTTON: At first I was offended because I thought, wow, my house is beautiful. What's wrong? Why is somebody just walking right out the door? JESSIE KIM: I do recommend you opening both of the doors. If you have a double door, you open. . . BRYAN: Jessie Kim is a feng shui consultant. Standing in the foyer at Lisa Dutton's house, she points out the problem. KIM: When you open up the front door, and then you have a stairway coming right at you things like to go to the lowest point. BRYAN: For a lot of Americans, a big, fancy staircase is a status statement. If you're buying a five bedroom, why not go for the \"Gone With The Wind? \" But if you're in to feng shui, Kim says that's a nonstarter. KIM: So you don't want all the energy that are upstairs being rushed out to the front door. So you don't want those things lining up. BRYAN: Kim put a red rug below the stairs to channel the energy back up. She installed a fountain in the lawn to balance the water element and put a big welcome mat outside the front door to invite in positive energy. KIM: It should be very welcoming. None of those, wipe your paws, or, don't come in here - you know, those funny doormat sayings? You don't want to do that. BRYAN: Then the offers started rolling in. Dutton says she's just closed on a deal with a Chinese couple, worth almost $100,000 more than her previous best offer. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Chinese spoken). BRYAN: Back at the grand opening of College Park, Eddie Yung is taking a break from walking through model homes and taking advantage of the complimentary lo mein. He says he's looked around in other LA suburbs, but he likes the house he saw here. He really likes it. YUNG: I'm going to send a deposit. So. . . BRYAN: Wow. YUNG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. BRYAN: So you're going to get it. YUNG: Yeah, yeah, yeah. BRYAN: Congratulations. YUNG: Yeah, thank you very much. (Laughter). BRYAN: That was the fourth home sold at College Park, before noon. When the chi is flowing in the right direction, the money will too. For NPR News, I'm Miles Bryan.

The idea is this - make our financial system safer by getting rid of banks. Here's Jacob Goldstein of NPR's Planet Money. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: There is this weird thing about banks - it's not a secret, it's been going on for hundreds of years - but it is strange. The money in your bank account is not actually in the bank. The bank takes your money and lends it out to someone else. MARTIN WOLF: This fragility that is at the heart of our financial system - 'cause we think the bank has our money but actually it doesn't. GOLDSTEIN: This is Martin Wolf, a columnist at the Financial Times. In good times, he says, it helps the economy when the bank lends your money out - money that would otherwise be sitting idle lets people buy houses or start businesses. WOLF: But in bad times, and there are lots of them, it generates huge financial crisis. GOLDSTEIN: Loans go bad, banks get bailed out - it's a familiar story at this point. WOLF: I think of it as capitalism's Faustian bargain - Faustian bargain is a deal with the devil. GOLDSTEIN: And so Martin Wolf says, what if we did things completely differently? What if we got rid of banks and replaced them basically with virtual vaults? When you put a dollar in the bank, it would stay there. You'd pay a fee to use the virtual vault, but no bank would ever go bust. One downside - if you made just this change, you would destroy the entire economy because banks do this essential thing - they lend out all that money in our accounts. In a post-bank world, you'd need some new way for people to get loans. As it happens, in just the past few years, the Internet has created a new option. FONG TRINH: So I go online and I just literally type in - I think maybe less than ten pieces of information. GOLDSTEIN: This is Fong Trinh (ph), he recently applied for a $15,000 loan. He did not use a bank. He borrowed through a company called Lending Club. Lending Club and similar companies are like dating websites, but instead of matching people who are looking for a date, they match people who have money to invest with people who are looking for a loan. It's called peer to peer lending. Fong entered that basic information online - his income, his debts, how much he wanted to borrow - someone from the company called him to confirm a few details, and soon after that he got an e-mail saying the loan came through. TRINH: It was super-duper fast, like literally I could've just done that whole thing in my bathrobe, you know, instead of getting in a pants and shirt and walking down to a bank. GOLDSTEIN: Remember, Fong didn't get this loan from a bank, he got a loan from someone who had extra money and chose to lend it out. Do you know who loaned you the money? TRINH: I do not, that's anonymous. GOLDSTEIN: Do you want to know? TRINH: Eh. GOLDSTEIN: So in a world without banks, who would be lending to people like Fong? CHRIS WINTERS: My name is Chris Winters (ph). GOLDSTEIN: In 2010, Chris took a few thousand dollars out of his savings account and lent it out through Lending Club. He got more interest than he was getting at the bank, but he took a lot more risk. WINTERS: There were some loans that went bad on me, and I kind of took it personally. Like, you know, Lending Club sent them an email and they didn't respond, or they called them and the person said they were going to pay and then they didn't. Like who is this unreliable person that I've lent the money to and why they lying to the collections people? GOLDSTEIN: In the world we live in now, all this risk and stress is hidden in the banks. If you get rid of banks, people like Chris are going to have to deal with it. Peer to peer lending is growing fast. Retirement funds and hedge funds are starting to get in on it, but it's still insignificant compared to the banking system. A few billion in loans versus trillions lent out by the banks. Peer to peer lending is not going to replace banks anytime soon. And Martin Wolf, the Financial Times columnist says, yeah, ending banks as we know them would be complicated. It would create lots of new problems. WOLF: It's clearly a bold experiment and it would have knock-on consequences. And there are real issues about how this would be structured. It is indeed radical. GOLDSTEIN: Still, a recent IMF paper said, at least in theory, it could work. And for decades, some economists, including a few Nobel laureates, have suggested different versions of this plan. WOLF: We have to ask ourselves very seriously, do we want to live with these sorts of massive blowups every 10, 15, 20 years or so - which is quite possible. The costs are absolutely enormous. So having a more stable financial system than the one we have inherited from the past, given the scale of the crisis we've been experiencing, seems to be rather desirable. GOLDSTEIN: Wolf says this big idea is not going to happen now. But he says if there's another financial crisis in the next several years, people might consider it. Jacob Goldstein, NPR News.

Rising sea levels have made flooding a regular part of life there. Scientists say coal-burning power plants are a leading cause of climate change, and Virginia is a major coal-producing state. NPR's Brian Naylor reports from a region at the frontlines of the climate change debate. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Skip Stiles stands on the edge of a small inlet, known as The Hague near downtown Norfolk. The Chrysler Museum of Art is nearby, as are dozens of stately homes - all threatened by the water. SKIP STILES: We've got these - lots of old buildings around here. This apartment building, that church over there - been around since the turn of the last century. And you can sort of mark where the storms have come over the years, and you can see the progress of these storms as they come farther and farther up onto these buildings. NAYLOR: Stiles is Executive Director of Wetlands Watch, a Virginia environmental group. The church over there, he mentioned, is the Unitarian Church of Norfolk - likely one of the few houses of worship in America with a link to a tide chart on its website. The Reverend Jennifer Slade is the minister. REVEREND JENNIFER SLADE: People literally cannot get to church or may decide not to come because high tide's going to be at a certain time, and they may not be able to get out. NAYLOR: Needless to say, this has caused the church and its members some problems. No one has been stranded yet, but Reverend Slade says a memorial service over the weekend was carefully planned. SLADE: We actually had to time the memorial service and the reception to make sure that the service and the reception could happen before high tide. NAYLOR: The Unitarian Church is considering moving to a new building. There are a number of reasons, but a big one is the flooding. Repeated high water forced the art museum to move its heating and cooling systems out of the basement onto an upper level. Larry Atkinson is co-director of the Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Initiative at Old Dominion University - says the problems the church and the museum are facing are repeated throughout the region. LARRY ATKINSON: When there's a higher high tide and there's a heavy rainstorm, there's just no place for water to go. So there's been a lot of storm-water management, a lot of roads being raised - downtown Norfolk - there's a big sea wall with tide gates to protect the downtown financial district. NAYLOR: Not all of the Hampton Road's flooding problems can be blamed on climate change. Atkinson says the region is also slowly sinking, making the low-lying areas that much more vulnerable to flooding. But there's also no doubt that sea levels in the area have been rising - as much as a foot over the last 80 years or so. And the Virginia Institute of Marine Science report predicts another foot and a half rise over the next 50 years. The government says the region, historically dependent on the sea for centuries, is the most vulnerable to sea level rise on the East Coast. Along with the world's largest naval port, Norfolk is also home to the hemisphere's biggest coal terminal, where long trains full of coal from throughout Appalachia empty their loads into waiting ships for export around the world. This promotional video was produced by the terminal's owner, Norfolk Southern. (SOUNDBITE OF PROMOTIONAL VIDEO). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Pier 6 opened in 1962 as the hemisphere's largest, fastest and most efficient coal trans-loading facility. In short, it is a pier without peer. NAYLOR: Puns aside, it also makes Norfolk the nexus of the debate between coal and climate. Skip Stiles of Wetlands Watch. STILES: There is a bit of an irony that Norfolk has the largest coal export facility in North America, and we've also got the highest rate of sea level rise on the East Coast - can't escape that irony. NAYLOR: The irony, in fact, isn't going away. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia says his state has to protect the jobs coal producers while it deals with the harm caused by putting carbon into the air. SENATOR TIM KAINE: We're going to continue to use coal. I mean, nobody is saying just throw a brake on the 35 or 40 percent of American energy production that's coal. So in Virginia, we have coal to worry about. We also have sea level rise to worry about. NAYLOR: In Tidewater Virginia, that worry is a day-to-day thing. The city of Norfolk is considering a multi million dollar plan to erect new flood barriers, but it's unclear where that money will come from. Brian Naylor, NPR News.

Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Seattle recently approved a plan to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour. It will be phased in over time, in part to allow businesses time to adjust to this. Those businesses might look at San Jose, California for an idea of what to expect. In 2012, voters there approved a $2 hike in the minimum wage with annual adjustments for inflation. The minimum wage in San Jose is now $10. 15 an hour. And although it is still a little early to assess the broad economic impact of the increase, NPR's Kirk Siegler visited two businesses to get their perspectives. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Both of these businesses we're about to meet are in food service - one big, one small - both dealt with the minimum-wage increase the same way, they passed the costs onto their customers. First, meet Chuck Hammers, owner of Pizza My Heart, on bustling San Carlos Street. CHUCK HAMMERS: We're in downtown San Jose. We're a half a block from San Jose State - very heavy foot traffic area with lots of students and such. SIEGLER: Pizza My Heart does a brisk business. There's a line out the door most days. About 50 pizzas come out of this brick oven every hour. Like many business owners in town, Hammers oppose the ballot initiative and was bracing for the worse when the minimum wage law took effect last March. HAMMERS: There's that little bit of a panic for a business owner, you know, is the sky going to fall, and you're nervous. It's a 20 percent increase in what's really one of your biggest costs. SIEGLER: That was a 20 percent increase in labor cost for Hammers. HAMMERS: After looking at it, I kind of stepped back and realized, well, it's going to happen to everyone. It's going to be a fair playing field. We just need to increase prices a little bit. SIEGLER: So he did. Slices went up by a quarter, pies by a dollar. Sales held steady and Hammers says customers didn't seem to notice. Pizza My Heart is a franchise. Hammers owns 24 of them. Only four are actually here in San Jose, but he decided to raise everyone's wages, across the board, at all his stores. He was worried he might lose some of his workers at his franchises outside the city, where the minimum wage is lower. HAMMERS: And the employees like it. They're sticking around longer, we're getting very little turnover now in employees, which is really good. SIEGLER: In fact, Hammers is currently expanding - opening more Pizza My Heart's. He still bristles at the suggestion that he's a booster of raising the minimum wage. But at the same time, Hammers says he understands that it's almost impossible to live on eight bucks an hour in a city where the average two-bedroom apartment goes for more than two grand a month. CHARLIE MAJOR: Charlie's Cheesecake Works, this is Charlie. SIEGLER: Charlie's Cheesecake Works sits in a strip mall near San Jose's southern city limit. It's a lot smaller than Pizza My Heart. There are only four employees, including Charlie Major, the owner. He pays one minimum wage, the others slightly more. And around the time that the minimum wage increase took effect, his sous chef got another job and moved on. MAJOR: I did not replace her. I decided that, you know, in light of what was going on, with the change in stuff, and just until we saw how it really played out. It was, you know, I can do the job that she did. So that's what I've done. SIEGLER: Like at Pizza My Heart, Charlie Major also raised his prices by about 5 percent. Most of his products are sold whole-sale to the local Costco and Whole Foods. Where he says he makes his profits are walk-up customers at this store - the people who come in to buy cake or a couple boxes of his popular cheesecake, Mini Popper's. MAJOR: What are we picking up? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was 70 poppers, sirSIEGLER: Profits here in the store have dropped by 7 percent since the law took effect. It's been a big enough hit that Major says he's actually shelved plans to expand the space. And he's actively thinking about selling or retiring if things don't get better in the next year. MAJOR: It hits small business right where it hurts. And if you want to encourage small business, it's tough. SIEGLER: So we have two different food businesses - one with four employees, the other with 500 spread across 24 restaurants. Both raise their prices by about 5 percent. One's doing fine, one's hurting a little. I laid this out for UC-Berkeley economist, Michael Reich, he runs the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, and is very interested in what happens when cities and counties raise the minimum wage. MICHAEL REICH: Yeah, the basic story is the sky didn't fall. San Jose is still doing well. SIEGLER: Reich says it's a little easier for a larger business like Pizza My Heart to absorb a minimum wage increase than a Charlie's Cheesecake Works. But he says long-term, things tend to even out. REICH: A lot of employers are afraid about this ahead of time 'cause they know they can't raise their price when their competitors do not. But here you have a policy that affects all the restaurants, simultaneously. SIEGLER: Before I showed up, Reich crunched his latest numbers for restaurants in San Jose. Across the board he found that operating costs rose by about . 25 percent in the past year. And prices for customers rose a little under 1 percent, on average. Reich says there's one big caveat here - the economy in San Jose, in the Silicon Valley, is incredibly strong. REICH: It's easier to have higher minimum wages in areas that are booming than in areas that are falling apart economically. SIEGLER: Then again, Reich points to Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city with an economy that's long struggled. He says a minimum wage hike there appears to have had little effect on businesses so far. One things for sure, economists like Reich are about to get a lot more data to study. Dozens of cities and counties are now considering joining San Jose, Seattle and others in increasing their local minimum wage. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

The leaders of that campaign announced today they've done it a month before their deadline. As NPR's Pam Fessler reports, the effort involved hundreds of communities, the federal government, nonprofits and businesses across the U. S. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Most of those housed in what's called The 100,000 Homes Campaign were chronically homeless. Today they're in a place that many of them thought they'd never see again. MALLYVEEN TEAH: What's the right word I'm trying to think of? It's just. . . FESSLER: Mallyveen Teah is one of them. TEAH: It feels like I'm a normal person again, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. And I haven't felt this way for quite some timeFESSLER: He's 53 and was homeless or couch-surfing on and off for the past 25 years. Now Teah is walking from his job at a construction site in Arlington, Virginia, to his new home - a one-bedroom apartment nearby. TEAH: Something as simple as giving a person a set of keys to their own place makes a huge difference in terms of their outlook on life, the world. FESSLER: Teah says he used to spend his nights drinking, sometimes using drugs and wondering where he was going to sleep. (SOUNDBITE OF KEYS UNLOCKING DOOR)FESSLER: But now he worries about things like what he'll make for dinner. TEAH: All right. Here we are. FESSLER: Do you want me to take my shoes off? TEAH: Yes, sure. FESSLER: I ask because his shoes are lined up on a towel by the door. The apartment is small, but spotless. He says he has no intention of returning to his old, chaotic way of life. ANITA FRIEDMAN: By virtue of being sheltered and in a permanent place, a lot of the stress and acting out that people have to the environment goes away. FESSLER: That's Anita Friedman, deputy director of the Arlington County Department of Human Services. She says the county joined the campaign despite some skepticism that the long-term homeless could be helped. Many have serious substance abuse or mental health problems. FRIEDMAN: People thought, well, you see them cycle in and out of the winter shelter every year. They come in. They go back out. They come in. They go back out. So what is really the possibility of getting them housed? FESSLER: Turns out the possibility was pretty good. The county got about 100 homeless residents into permanent housing, and other communities in the campaign, like Phoenix, New Orleans and Salt Lake City, also made huge dents in their homeless populations. Now, just to be clear, not all these people are still housed. About 15 percent of the cases didn't work out for one reason or the other. But that still leaves about 85,000 people off the streets. The key, say advocates, is housing people first, then providing services like counseling and health care to make sure they stay housed. BECKY KANIS: It's not just touchy-feely, nice things to do. It's saving tons of money for taxpayers. FESSLER: Becky Kanis coordinated the campaign. She's with Community Solutions, a New York nonprofit. Kanis had volunteers go out and interview tens of thousands of homeless individuals around the country. They got their names and histories and ranked them according to who was most likely to die if left in the streets. The most serious cases were the first to be housed. KANIS: When you add up the costs of the hospitalizations and the emergency room and the cycling in and out of jails, that costs much, much more than providing someone with housing and services. FESSLER: More than $1 billion in savings a year, she says. Some people were skeptical the campaign would ever reach its 100,000 goal. Kanis on the other hand, was so confident, she had the number tattooed on her arm without the final zero. She planned to finish the tattoo when the job was done. But now she thinks she might leave it the way it is. KANIS: It's not like you ever just cross the finish line, and that's it. FESSLER: Because even with the campaign's success, there are still more than 600,000 homeless individuals in the U. S. on a given night. Pam Fessler, NPR News.

The same concern is rattling cabbies across Europe. And today, drivers in several capital cities took to the streets in protest. The threat is one that's familiar to some American cabbies - car services like Uber that let you book a ride with your cell phone. NPR's Ari Shapiro reports. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: One of the hardest tests a Londoner will ever take is called simply, the knowledge. To pass, you need a roadmap of London in your head. Nobody gets to drive a black taxi without the knowledge. EDDIE TRESIDA: I mean to me, personally, it took me two years. I mean, other drivers it takes three or four years, depends how hard you work at it. SHAPIRO: Cab driver, Eddie Tresida, is disturbed that after all his work, an Uber driver with GPS can sweep in and undercut his business. TRESIDA: If you want to be a taxi driver, then do the same as what I've done. It's hard, for two years, you know, you go without things and you have to sacrifice things in your life. But if you want to be a taxi driver, this is the best taxi service in the world, then that's what you have to do. SHAPIRO: Uber now operates in 20 European cities. It is doubling in size every six months, according to Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty. He's Uber's general manager for Western and Northern Europe. PIERRE-DIMITRI GORE-COTY: We've opened Frankfurt last week. We've opened Lille in France, which is our third city this week. We've opened Barcelona a couple of weeks ago, and there's many more cities to go. SHAPIRO: He argues that his company is simply responding to consumer demand. Unlike with many taxis, Uber passengers can pay by credit card, order a ride by cell phone and rate their drivers. GORE-COTY: And so finally, seeing some sort of competition coming to the market is something that's new. And even on the protest today, what I'm seeing is taxis are trying to bring cities to a standstill while on the opposite, Uber is focused to kind of help as many people as possible move around cities. (HONKING)SHAPIRO: The protests began in the early afternoon in major cities all across Europe. In France, they called it operation escargot. Taxi drivers inched along at a snail's pace, refusing to take passengers. In Germany, 64-year-old Barbara Novak joined other cabbies at Berlin's central station for their slow-drive protest across the city. (German spoken)SHAPIRO: These apps don't offer proper, decent, quality transportation, she says. Climb it's one of those and you might as well say, mug me. In Madrid, cabbies complained that they paid a fortune for a taxi license, only to be undercut by Uber drivers. Maria Eugenia Hernaz is 37 years old. MARIA EUGENIA HERNAZ: After three years, I bought my own license -137,000 euros. It's more than my house. So I need work and I have to work 16 hours per day to do it. SHAPIRO: Many cabdrivers argue that Uber should be forced to follow the same licensing and fare rules as taxis. Uber believes those rules should not apply because the company says Uber is more like a car hire service. Ben Edelman of Harvard Business School says new innovations replace old companies all the time, but he says Uber is taking some important shortcuts. BEN EDELMAN: If there's a medallion to be purchased, they're not purchasing it. If there's commercial driver's insurance to be purchased, again, nope they're not doing that either.

The Big Three automakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - have put down some serious financial muscle to help save the Detroit Institute of Arts, the DIA - $26 million to be exact. That could help save the city from having to sell the art to satisfy creditors. It's not just art admirers who are keeping their eye on this deal. People, from retirees worrying about their pensions to the creditors Detroit owes, could be affected by this. We wanted to find out more, so we've called Rochelle Riley once again.

QUINN KLINEFELTER: Well, it's something that's trying to prop up the pension system that has really been in trouble in Detroit and is one of the cruxes, actually, in the bankruptcy proceeding - and as you say, try to save the artworks from the Detroit Institute of Art, which are very lucrative and which a lot of the creditors of the Detroit owes money to as it goes through the bankruptcy proceedings - they say you ought to sell that and help try to pay us off. This agreement between the state and some private foundations came together to say, well, we will soften the blow to these pensioners and therefore you won't have to sell the artwork to try to soften the blow through that. And so the car companies are putting in this money as a portion of that. It's a portion of the art - the museum itself - it has to raise part of this so-called grand bargain - it's 800 plus million dollars. Also, the state's got some money in that they just had approved through the votes in the legislator that was a little bit contentious for a while, but then they all came together at the end. And so it's all trying to come together to preserve this art and people were praising it. Although, you know, it is really a fairly small amount compared to how much the overall bankruptcy is. But in terms of what it can mean for the artwork and for the pensioners, it's very sick. MARTIN: Rochelle Riley, we've been coming to you from time to time to just get the temperature of things, of how people are reacting to these various moves. Give us your sense of how this is being received. ROCHELLE RILEY: Well, as we always talk about, there are two Detroits. And the Detroit that wants this to work are celebrating that everybody's participating. Everybody's sort of putting some money in. As Quinn said, the audio industry donation is only $26 million. To put 'only' in front of 26 million sounds terrible, but when you're talking about $816 million, it's a small amount. But it signifies that they're a part of it, so there's this coming together. But then you've got the actual pensioners - some of whom are living week to week - who don't like this deal. They do not think that the bargain is a bargain for them, and a lot of them don't plan to vote for it. And it does have to be approved by two classes of pensioners, the police and fire pensioners who are in one class and the general retirement pensioners - the other city employees - former city employees- in another class. And both of those groups of people have to approve this. So we're a long way from done. MARTIN: Does this, Rochelle - does this do anything to intervene in this narrative of feeling as though all is lost? When we last spoke with you, there was just a lot of sadness, as you would imagine, around so many of these issues. And it just seemed like the bad news was unrelenting. Does this intervene in that at all? Does it give people any sense of hope, even if it is a relatively - it sounds big - but it is actually a fairly small amount in the big scheme of things? RILEY: It actually does. I can tell you what a difference several months makes. There's a new mayor, Mike Duggan, who has made a lot of changes in the city that have helped to not just appease but to provide some sense of relief for residents who have felt very put upon. You know, there were 25 parks that were being maintained, you know, six months ago, and there's now more than 200. And some of the lights are on in the city where, as you know, a lot of the lights were off and it was dark at night. So there are some very practical things that are happening. And quite frankly, for some of the pensioners - they were initially talking about cuts as high as 25 percent of their pensions. And it is much lower now because of this. And Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr has made it clear that the deal is not going to get better than this. The people who are holding out hope that it might be, you know - there might be more money somewhere. There might be something better if they do reject this. He's made it clear that it's not. So for some folks - they really are glad that they did change that cut so that it's not, you know, a quarter of their pension and them having to make a decision between medicine and food, but something much smaller. So the grand bargain has brought in a lot of money that didn't exist. MARTIN: Quinn, take the last word here if you would and just give us a concluding thought - whatever you think we should be thinking about next as we watch this, you know, important story unfold. What's coming along? KLINEFELTER: Well, two aspects probably - the first is there will be a confirmation hearing, which just got delayed until mid-August, with the creditors where they will bring up all their reasons that they oppose this happening, and a lot of problems that they see with it. They stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars - the people that loaned money to Detroit, and they're not going to get it back. The pensioners are pretty much up against it, although there are a fair amount of unions that say they are going to try to fight the deal as well because they don't think that it's really going to help them. And then, as Rochelle says, the city, in very many ways, is kind of two cities. And there are people in the outer ring neighborhoods that say they don't feel the investment coming into the downtown or midtown areas. And they fear that they're being left behind. And along with all that, there's other cities teetering on bankruptcy or being crushed by similar pension obligations that are watching what happens in Detroit and seeing if that's what the path can be that they can follow to get out from under their obligations. MARTIN: That was Quinn Klinefelter. He's the senior news editor from member station WDET. Also with us, Rochelle Riley, columnist for the Detroit Free Press. It's good to talk with both of you once again. Please keep us posted. Thank's for joining us. RILEY: Thank you. KLINEFELTER: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Let's turn now to Detroit where the city's effort to come back from bankruptcy just got a boost. The Big Three automakers - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - have put down some serious financial muscle to help save the Detroit Institute of Arts, the DIA - $26 million to be exact. That could help save the city from having to sell the art to satisfy creditors. It's not just art admirers who are keeping their eye on this deal. People, from retirees worrying about their pensions to the creditors Detroit owes, could be affected by this. We wanted to find out more, so we've called Rochelle Riley once again. She's a writer and columnist with the Detroit Free Press - with us from WU Michigan. Also with us, Quinn Klinefelter, senior news editor for WDET - with us from their studios.

I'm Arun Rath. The mortgage crisis that devastated the economy has received endless attention but it's not just homeowners who have suffered badly in this economy. As of 2012, 35 percent of American households are rentals. Their numbers are growing, reversing a decades-long uptake in homeownership. And in the last 50 years, the percentage of income they're spending on the rent has increased dramatically. A quarter of renters are spending more than half their income on rent. We wanted to spend some time with the family that has to apply that math to their lives. The rental crisis is our cover story today. A few days ago, Imelda Alvarez gave us a tour of her tiny one- bedroom apartment just east of downtown Los Angeles and a neighborhood called Boyle Heights. (Speaking Spanish. )RATH: The tour takes all of 40 seconds. The front living room has been converted into a bedroom for Imelda and her husband. There's a tiny kitchen attached to the room with tables and chairs crammed in. And there is the recomerita (ph) - that's the little room in back with a bunk bed for her kids. : (Through translator) There is me and I have two daughters and my husband. So four in total. RATH: Imelda and her family are paying a thousand dollars a month for this tiny place but they don't have other options. Her husband, Antonio, can't land full-time work - let alone a job that could pay for a better apartment. He's been stringing together part-time work at a school nearby. Bringing home biweekly checks of 5-or-$600 a time. : (Through translator) Most checks would be $600, so he would make around $1,200 a month and that would only be enough for the rent and some bills. RATH: Imelda says they spend so much on rent they have to cut back in other areas. : (Through translator) Sometimes we have to start to think about what else we can cut back on to make ends meet. I always think about the rent first, then about food. If it's not enough we have to cut back on food. RATH: It's not like they're paying a thousand dollars a month for a tiny apartment in a trendy area. Boyle Heights is a poor part of town. There's a lot of crime and most of the schools are struggling. It's hard to accuse the Alvarez's of living beyond their means when you see the state of their apartment. Sagging ceilings, leaky faucets, doors that don't lock and pests - cockroaches and rats. The bathroom floor is wet because. . . (Speaking Spanish. )RATH: The toilet has come loose from the floor. Imelda had been staying home to watch their own youngest daughter, who has an intellectual disability. But she's been with looking for work now and can't find anything. And now that school is out for the summer for the next couple of months they'll be deprived even of Antonio's part-time income. : (Through translator) You know how we made ends meet this time? With our tax return. Everything was overdue and it wasn't until our taxes came back that I could pay everything. I have nothing to pay with. RATH: Across the city families like the Alvarez's are struggling. But why is it so tough to find affordable housing in the city as big as Los Angeles? We asked reporter Ben Bergman of member station KPCC to find out. BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: The reason rent is so high here in LA is that lots of people want to live here. It's almost always Sunny. You can go to the beach. But there aren't enough places to live. BEVERLY KENWORTHY: I think in simple terms, it's an issue of supply and demand. BERGMAN: Beverly Kenworthy is head of the California Apartment Association. KENWORTHY: If we really want to address this housing crisis - because it is a crisis - we have to really be much more forward thinking and we have to embrace development. We have to embrace the growth that's happening. BERGMAN: Kenworthy says developers have to navigate a city zoning code that is almost 70 years old. All but the biggest, best funded builders have simply given up. KENWORTHY: I have members of my organization who - some of them build and some of them look to build here in LA. I have others who just simply won't do it anymore - because it's just too hard and too uncertain and it's too costly. CARL LAMBERT: We call it brain damage. BERGMAN: Carl Lambert says that's the phrase developers like him use to describe the agony of getting a project approved. Lambert says before he could break ground on a recent building he needed 33 separate sign offs. It's not uncommon for it to take three years from when he buys a piece of land to when he can start construction. LAMBERT: Now I've experienced all this wonderful pain over the years and I am now open. And you think I'm going to want to just go out and give everybody deals? or give them a $600 a month apartment with an ocean view? No, it's going to be fair market value. BERGMAN: And there in lies the problem. Apartments are being built in LA - at levels not seen since before the recession. But most are top-of-the-line. When it comes to affordable housing, there's a shortfall of almost half a million units in LA County and it's only getting worse. That's because there is a half billion dollars less available in state and federal funding for affordable housing in the county than there was before the recession. LA Councilman Gil Cedillo finds that troubling. GIL CEDILLO: We focus on creating jobs here in Los Angeles for people who live outside of the city. And we don't focus on building housing for people so that they can live near where they work. BERGMAN: In April, Cedillo lead a renter's day to highlight the problem of affordability. There was a modestly attended rally - but as for action, that will have to wait. In New York, Mayor Bill de Balsio recently announced an $8. 2 billion plan to build and maintain 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade. Cedillo says as much he'd like to do something similar here with the city trying to balance it's budget, there's simply no money available. CEDILLO: You know, I really appreciate and admire those people do in New York because they really move aggressively on these problems. We don't have those types of resources to commit to housing. BERGMAN: Cedillo has been lobbying for a state bill that would raise $500 million a year for affordable housing by charging a fee on real-estate transactions. But the measure's passage seems unlikely. That means for now, for the first time in three decades, there are virtually no state funds available for affordable housing in California. For NPR News, I'm Ben Bergman in Los Angeles. RATH: As Ben just said, renters looking for affordable housing aren't getting much relief in Los Angeles - which is one of the most expensive rental markets in the country. But the problem is not just in California. Across the country, rental prices have risen as wages have stagnated. Chris Herbert is the Director of Research at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Just last December, they released a report on the rental housing in the country. He says the situation is bad everywhere. It's just a question of how bad. CHRIS HERBERT: You know, it's a little bit about trying to separate the miserable from the awful when you try to break it down. It is worse along the coast. I mean, areas where San Francisco, LA, New York, Boston - where you have very high housing costs. But the same time it's bad in the heartland too. And it's bad in the heartland not so much because housing costs are so high - but because incomes are so low. RATH: Are there any places in the country where it's not a problem? HERBERT: You know, I'm hard-pressed to come up with one where it isn't. The - nationally about 50 percent of renters are paying more than 30 percent of their income for a monthly housing cost. And that's the standard measure, what people ought to devote out of their monthly budget and still have enough left over to meet life's necessities. When we look across the country, at different metropolitan areas, there are very few less than say 35 percent of people who are struggling too make their ends meet that way. So it's - I can't point to any place where it's not an issue. RATH: Your study talks about those who are rent burdened and those who are severe rent burdened. Can you break down that distinction? HERBERT: So the standard measure of housing affordability has been whether people are spending more than 30 percent of their income for housing - which is an old rule of thumb. That it should be a weeks wages for your monthly rent. But over time, what's happened is that so many people were failing to meet that standard that the - a new standard was introduced. That was referred to as a severe rent burden - where people are spending more than 50 percent of their income for housing. There's not necessarily a rule of thumb that would suggest that that is an appropriate level of spending but it's just one that had become so common that it became a new measure of saying, well how severe is this extent of this problem? So if you look back over time and say 1970, roughly a quarter of households were spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Well, last count more than a quarter of households were spending more than 50 percent of their income for housing. So we're really on a new level of affordability than we've ever been before. RATH: Can you talk about why it's a problem in terms of when people are spending this much more on their rent? HERBERT: Well, you know, it's such a big part of the household budget. If you're spending 50 percent of your income on housing - and we're talking about before tax income - it doesn't leave a lot left over for life necessities. We find that they spend 39 percent less on food. They spent 65 percent less on health care. They also spent less on retirement savings. And so the trade-offs that people are making are not trade-offs between going to the movies or going out to eat - but basically basic nutrition, basic healthcare and saving for their future. So these are really important trade-offs people are making in trying to find affordable housing. And that's not to mention what they also do in terms of housing quality. So when we look at people who are facing a choice of trying to find housing that they can afford. One of the ways they make that trade-off is they settle for lower quality housing. And they're more likely to in dangerous neighborhoods where crime is more prevalent. RATH: That's Chris Herbert of Harvard. Chris, thank you. HERBERT: My pleasure. RATH: What Chris just said describes Imelda Alvarez and her family exactly. Back in Boyle Heights they're out of options. Even if they could find a cheaper apartment, they wouldn't be able to move. : (Through translator) We don't have enough for a deposit or rent. And we don't really want to leave because we have our roots here. The girls have their school here. It would be something hard for them. But it's mostly about money. It costs more to move. RATH: It looks like more people will be experiencing what the Alvarez's have gone through. The Harvard study projects that around 4 -to-5 million more people will start renting over the next decade.

HERBERT: So the standard measure of housing affordability has been whether people are spending more than 30 percent of their income for housing - which is an old rule of thumb. That it should be a weeks wages for your monthly rent. But over time, what's happened is that so many people were failing to meet that standard that the - a new standard was introduced. That was referred to as a severe rent burden - where people are spending more than 50 percent of their income for housing. There's not necessarily a rule of thumb that would suggest that that is an appropriate level of spending but it's just one that had become so common that it became a new measure of saying, well how severe is this extent of this problem? So if you look back over time and say 1970, roughly a quarter of households were spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. Well, last count more than a quarter of households were spending more than 50 percent of their income for housing. So we're really on a new level of affordability than we've ever been before. RATH: Can you talk about why it's a problem in terms of when people are spending this much more on their rent? HERBERT: Well, you know, it's such a big part of the household budget. If you're spending 50 percent of your income on housing - and we're talking about before tax income - it doesn't leave a lot left over for life necessities. We find that they spend 39 percent less on food. They spent 65 percent less on health care. They also spent less on retirement savings. And so the trade-offs that people are making are not trade-offs between going to the movies or going out to eat - but basically basic nutrition, basic healthcare and saving for their future. So these are really important trade-offs people are making in trying to find affordable housing. And that's not to mention what they also do in terms of housing quality. So when we look at people who are facing a choice of trying to find housing that they can afford. One of the ways they make that trade-off is they settle for lower quality housing. And they're more likely to in dangerous neighborhoods where crime is more prevalent. RATH: That's Chris Herbert of Harvard. Chris, thank you. HERBERT: My pleasure. RATH: What Chris just said describes Imelda Alvarez and her family exactly. Back in Boyle Heights they're out of options. Even if they could find a cheaper apartment, they wouldn't be able to move. : (Through translator) We don't have enough for a deposit or rent. And we don't really want to leave because we have our roots here. The girls have their school here. It would be something hard for them. But it's mostly about money. It costs more to move. RATH: It looks like more people will be experiencing what the Alvarez's have gone through. The Harvard study projects that around 4 -to-5 million more people will start renting over the next decade.", "section": "National", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

S. That's how economists describe the fact that fewer people are striking out on their own to find places to live. A surprising number of Americans in their twenties and early thirties are still living with family or with several roommates. And the latest numbers out this week, show that's continuing to hurt the recovery in the housing market. NPR's Chris Arnold has more. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: A year ago, the housing market was looking like it was finally recovering. Sales and prices were picking up. But then, home sales fizzled. They're now down about 7 percent from last spring, and a big reason for that is that younger Americans are having an especially tough time since this recession. MARISSA SZABO: We would love to buy a house right now, but we just don't have anything saved up currently. ARNOLD: Marissa is 26-years-old. She works in the state auditor's office in Boston, and on her lunch break she's come outside the statehouse, here, with its big golden dome of a roof. Schoolkids on a field trip stream out of the building. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Stay together. ARNOLD: The kids happily head back to get packed into a crowded school bus, and Marissa Szabo doesn't have much more space than that in the apartment she's renting in Boston. Like many twenty-somethings, she's living with a lot of roommates. SZABO: The most I've had - five. I currently have three. And, yeah, I've never even been able to consider getting a place by myself, just because of how high the rent is. ARNOLD: The high cost renting is one of the things that's made life tougher for Szabo and other millennial's. And now she's ready to settle down and move in with her boyfriend. He's 28. They're talking about getting married, having kids, and they're kind of done with the roommate thing. SZABO: We're starting our lives together. We wanted it to be together, not together plus eight or three or however many. ARNOLD: But those high rents combined with student debt and stagnant wages mean, for young people right now, it is just very tough to save money for a down payment to buy a house. And Marissa Szabo and her boyfriend were getting frustrated as they looked for an apartment, even just to rent by themselves. SZABO: Some places were asking for first, last, security and then a broker's fee, too. So that's five months rent, right upfront. And we both just sat down and said, all right, are we willing to take all of our money and light it on fire? ARNOLD: So when you're in your twenties and you have no place else to turn, what do you do? Szabo and her boyfriend have decided to move in with her mother who, it turns out, has an extra bedroom. So that way they can save up a down payment and buy a house in a year or two. SZABO: And my mom has been so awesome and supportive about it. She doesn't want rent or anything like that. We'll help with the utilities, and we'll do some repairs around the house for her, and she'll be happy, she says. So I think it's just a win-win situation for us. ARNOLD: That's cool, yeah, I think a lot of parents - you know, as long as you don't stay too long. SZABO: Exactly, exactly - right now she's like, yeah you're back. I'm like, for a little while, mom (Laughing). ARNOLD: For a few years, now, economists have looked at all these millennials living with parents or roommates, and they've said, that has to be pent-up demand. And soon, as young people finally move out on their own, that'll mean more first-time homebuyers. It'll create more job. It'll help the whole economy. The only problem with that scenario is that it's still not actually happening yet. DAVID CROWE: That's right. The first time homebuyer is really absent from the market. ARNOLD: David Crowe is the chief economist for the National Association of Homebuilders. He says only 16 percent of new home sales are going to first-time homebuyers. That's half of normal. And in terms of the numbers of new homes that are actually getting built. . . CROWE: We're not even halfway back. ARNOLD: It's actually remarkable just how stunted home construction still is. The country hasn't been building this few homes since World War II, and things aren't getting much better. New numbers out this week from the Commerce Department show that construction of new single-family homes fell about 6 percent in May, compared to the month before. Mortgage applications were down this week, too. Still, Crowe expects that the market will keep recovering - just very slowly. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

But there's a movement now among some corporations to create, not only profit, but also a tangible benefit to society and the environment. They're called benefit corporations. And as Jack Rodolico reports, they have caught the attention of lawmakers across the country. JACK RODOLICO, BYLINE: Before I tell you what a benefit corporation is, let's just visit one. In the tiny town of Gilsum, New Hampshire, you'll find the headquarters of W. S. Badger, Inc. The company makes all-natural cosmetics marketed under the name Badger Balm. When CEO Bill Whyte founded the company in 1994, the staff was lean. BILL WHYTE: Early on, I started making soup on Friday. And I loved what happened to the company, seeing everybody sit down at the same time. RODOLICO: That sense of togetherness extends to the company's seventy employees today. Whyte took me on a tour. WHYTE: We have a gym right here. And down at the other end, we have a yoga room. This is the mixing room. RODOLICO: Smells like sunscreen and bug spray - smells good. WHYTE: I think that'd be citronella, lemongrass, geranium -would probably be the signature smells. RODOLICO: The cubicles at Badger are naturally lit and lined with wood. You can bring your baby to work or leave your three-year-old at the company day care center up the road. So it's a nice place for the employees. And that seems to pay off for the business. Badger has doubled in five years, expanding their market to 26 countries. Badger is a good example of what's called a benefit corporation. This is a type of company certified as being motivated by more than just the hunger for profit. Think of it this way. The USDA certifies organic foods, and Good Housekeeping puts its seal of approval on quality products, like washing machines and skillets. And since 2006, a nonprofit organization called B Lab has been certifying entire corporations. It deems to be concerned about their communities and the environment. Erik Trojian, the director of policy, says B Lab measures just about everything the company does. ERIK TROJIAN: Supply chain - their interaction with the community - the environment. So that's one way that they signal to the consumer that they're a different type of company - all the way from Badger in New Hampshire, Patagonia, Ben and Jerry's. But another way to do that is to bake your morals and your missions into the DNA of your company. RODOLICO: Many consumers want to do business with companies that have that kind of DNA. But how can you tell which ones are the real deal? In 27 states, legislatures have created a legal status for benefit corporations. The bill in New Hampshire originated with Badger. So why would a company want a law? It's extra work, and there are no tax breaks. POLINA PINCHEVSKY: There's so much green washing going on out there. There's so many companies claiming to care and to do the right thing. TIM FRICK: And it's all being part of a larger global movement of, you know, making sure that business is being used as a force for good and not for evil. RODOLICO: That was Polina Pinchevsky at RoundPeg Communications in Maryland and Tim Frick from MightyBytes, a tech company in Chicago. They also point out there are legal protections when a state signs on. A shareholder can't sue a benefit corporation for valuing the environment as much as profit. So basically, a state can create a legal framework for a benefit corporation to work in. Then the company and the stakeholders can hash out what benefit the corporation will provide. Erik Trojian says B Lab, headquartered northwest of Philadelphia, will continue certifying companies with their more rigorous standards. And he points out there are problems because of the patchwork nature of state laws. For example, in Nevada, the state's incorporation document clearly lists benefit status as an option. And 236 companies signed up in only four months. That's a very different experience from New Jersey. TROJIAN: Unfortunately, on the state's website, you can't find their information. And you can't find stuff about benefit corporations. RODOLICO: And New Jersey and some other states don't count how many companies have registered, so it's tricky to know how many there are. But we can count at least 750 benefit corporations from the states that do count. Despite the differences from one state to the next, the overall movement is gaining momentum. As many as nine states may take it up next year. For NPR News I'm Jack Rodolico in Concord, New Hampshire. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  Corporations generally exist for one reason, to make money.

I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Aside from its other effects, climate change endangers the U. S. economy. That's the conclusion of a new study. The study presents no new climate science. INSKEEP: But it makes dire predictions about jobs, farms, energy production and more. The study says if nothing is done, crop yields will fall by more than 70 percent in the Midwest. Billions of dollars worth of property will go underwater on the East Coast. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The audio of this story incorrectly states that crop yields \"will\" fall by more than 70 percent in the Midwest; it should have stated that crop yields \"could\" fall by more than 70 percent in the Midwest. ]MONTAGNE: To be clear, that doesn't mean the mortgage is too big. It means underwater. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The title of this study is Risky Business, and the driving force behind it is a bipartisan group of prominent former businessman and public officials - their former entrepreneur and New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, hedge fund manager Thomas Stier and Henry Paulson, a former Wall Street titan and treasury secretary under George W. Bush. Paulson acknowledges many in his party are skeptical of the science of climate change and want more research. Paulson says his new study suggest that business and investment community need to take action. HENRY PAULSON: And it's going to increasingly be difficult for anybody regardless of party to say there isn't a problem. YDSTIE: Paulson says he hopes the study can influence the business community by applying a major business tool - the science of risk management. PAULSON: The more we can talk about risk management, which is part and parcel of the free enterprise system in a conservative principle, I think we will make some headway. YDSTIE: Here's an example of what the study concludes. It says there's a better than even chance that as much as $23 billion worth of existing Florida property will be underwater by the middle of the century. But it goes on to estimate something investors call a tail risk, a low probability but extremely high cost event that pushes the losses far above that $23 billion. For Florida property, the tail risk is that there's a one in 100 chance that by the end of the century, as much as $681 billion worth of property will be submerged. Robert Rubin, another Wall Street veteran and former treasury under President Clinton, is also involved in the Risky Business study. He says the threats are widespread across the economy. ROBERT RUBIN: Agricultural yields could fall by 50 percent or more in some parts of the country. You could have temperatures that prevented people from working outdoors for some part of the years in certain parts of the country. All this has massive effects and all this is a very realistic projection of what is likely to happen if we don't act. YDSTIE: Paulson proposes a tax on carbon emissions that scientists say are causing climate change. To provide an incentive to wean the economy off carbon-based fuels. RUBIN: A carbon tax is one way of putting a price on this pollution. One way of letting the market operate. YDSTIE: But there's virtually no chance a carbon tax will pass Congress anytime soon. Rubin suggests an interim step that doesn't need congressional approval. It would be a requirement by the SEC and Financial Accounting Standards Board that companies disclose the risks that climate change poses to their assets and profits. RUBIN: I think we've got to act on all possible fronts 'cause I really do think that life on earth as we know it is at stake here. YDSTIE: That's former treasury secretary Robert Rubin.

Aside from its other effects, climate change endangers the U. S. economy. That's the conclusion of a new study. The study presents no new climate science. INSKEEP: But it makes dire predictions about jobs, farms, energy production and more. The study says if nothing is done, crop yields will fall by more than 70 percent in the Midwest. Billions of dollars worth of property will go underwater on the East Coast. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The audio of this story incorrectly states that crop yields \"will\" fall by more than 70 percent in the Midwest; it should have stated that crop yields \"could\" fall by more than 70 percent in the Midwest. ] MONTAGNE: To be clear, that doesn't mean the mortgage is too big. It means underwater. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The title of this study is Risky Business, and the driving force behind it is a bipartisan group of prominent former businessman and public officials - their former entrepreneur and New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, hedge fund manager Thomas Stier and Henry Paulson, a former Wall Street titan and treasury secretary under George W. Bush. Paulson acknowledges many in his party are skeptical of the science of climate change and want more research. Paulson says his new study suggest that business and investment community need to take action. HENRY PAULSON: And it's going to increasingly be difficult for anybody regardless of party to say there isn't a problem. YDSTIE: Paulson says he hopes the study can influence the business community by applying a major business tool - the science of risk management. PAULSON: The more we can talk about risk management, which is part and parcel of the free enterprise system in a conservative principle, I think we will make some headway. YDSTIE: Here's an example of what the study concludes. It says there's a better than even chance that as much as $23 billion worth of existing Florida property will be underwater by the middle of the century. But it goes on to estimate something investors call a tail risk, a low probability but extremely high cost event that pushes the losses far above that $23 billion. For Florida property, the tail risk is that there's a one in 100 chance that by the end of the century, as much as $681 billion worth of property will be submerged.

And New York's new mayor was in the thick of it. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  At his inauguration six months ago, Bill de Blasio told the crowd we are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities that threaten to unravel the city we love. Now, he's heading a task force to tackle the issue at the local level. And we reached Mayor de Blasio at his office at City Hall. Welcome to the program. BILL DE BLASIO: Thank you so much, Renee. MONTAGNE: When this task force was announced earlier this week, the mayor of Dallas - which, of course, is a city famous for its wealth - he said that income disparity is costing his city millions of dollars. How so exactly? Not just for Dallas, obviously, but for any city. DE BLASIO: What it means when talks about the cost factor is as families slip farther down and are unable to afford the basics, it all keeps falling to the public sector to catch people when they fall. And it's become really dysfunctional. If a forward moving country - as we saw in substantial degree for several decades in the '50s, '60s, '70s - is a country where middle class is growing, where people can support themselves or wages and benefits are going up. We've been in the reverse dynamic for years now, but federal policies have not responded in a meaningful way and that's not healthy. And so a lot of us are going right at wages, benefits, fundamental rights to things like pre-k and childcare - the things that really affect the day-to-day lives of families and their bottom line. MONTAGNE: Though let me put this to you - why do you and other mayors who are pushing for higher minimum wages at the city level - you've already succeeded in getting most workers there in New York more paid sick leave - why do you think that's the way to go even though critics point out that it does come out of the pockets of taxpayers and businesses? DE BLASIO: Look, you could argue that if a company pays a fair wage, some companies might raise the cost of their products. I don't think that's always true. I think a lot of companies - we obviously have seen with CEO compensation and a lot of other realities of companies - that they have plenty of resources to draw on that they can use to pay a decent wage and provide decent benefits. So it's not a given that that gets passed along to the consumer. But even if - to some extent - there's a consumer impact, it's still worth it to create a more functional society. Here in New York City, when I ran last year, I said we were living a tale of two cities because we saw a city government report come out a year ago that said 46 percent of New Yorkers were at or near the poverty level - an astounding statistic. If we don't get to the root cause - which is wage levels and benefits levels - we're kidding ourselves. MONTAGNE: But let me ask you about the pressure you will be getting in return. When you are pursuing universal pre-kindergarten, your big proposal was raising taxes on the wealthy. That was shot down not just by Republicans, but by New York's Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo. Does that reveal some - in one way - the limits of what cities can do? DE BLASIO: By definition, cities can't do everything we need to do unless we have cooperation from the federal government and from our state capitals. I thought it was fair to tax the wealthiest New Yorkers so we could provide pre-k for every child. Our legislator in Albany, our governor, didn't happen to agree. They found another way - a different way - to provide us with the exact same amount of money. So we got there. Are there still some places around this country where our leaders don't understand the extent of the crisis and aren't supporting cities? Yes, that's entirely true. And that's why cities are banding together to try and change the debate and change the politics around urban issues. MONTAGNE: Much of your city's economy - New York City's economy - is fueled by Wall Street, which many people would point to as a driver of income inequality. Is it possible in New York City to battle income inequality without declaring class warfare on Wall Street? DE BLASIO: Of course. You know, when I proposed taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers, obviously a lot of those individuals are connected to Wall Street. By the way, my proposal had immense popular support. It was one of the reasons I got elected and ultimately got elected with 73 percent of the vote in the general election. I know some individuals on Wall Street didn't like it, but I think broadly speaking, there was an understanding in the financial community that this was about improving our school system and ultimately that's in the interest of the city and in the interest of our society. By the way, when you talk to business people from all over, one of the things they care about when choosing a location is the quality of the schools. I don't think in any way, shape or form, that's class warfare. I think that's acknowledging real needs and acknowledging a serious way of paying for it and sometimes saying hey, folks who've done well should pay a little more. Really, the fight against inequality is as important as any other element in terms of our national security and our national future. And I think there are more and more people - even among the wealthy, even among the business community - who recognize that something's really gone awry here and has to be addressed. MONTAGNE: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is chairman of the Cities of Opportunity Task Force. That's a group of mayors working on income inequality. He spoke to us from the mayor's office in New York. Thanks very much. DE BLASIO: Thank you. MONTAGNE: And this is NPR News.

I'm Arun Rath. President Obama would like to raise the national minimum wage but he hasn't been able to get Congress on board since 2009 when it was raised to $7. 25 an hour. But did you know there's another minimum wage for tipped workers - the majority of whom work in restaurants - it's just $2. 13 an hour which makes sense, right? The money from tips should make up the difference and then some. But according to a White House report tipped workers are more than twice as likely to be below the poverty line as other workers and their minimum wage hasn't gone up in 23 years. How can tipped workers make a livable wage? That's our cover story today. Under federal law if tips don't bring employees up to the level of the standard minimum wage employers are required to make up the difference. But Saru Jayaraman, founder of the labor advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, says it often doesn't work out that way. SARU JAYARAMAN: Enforcement is not just difficult - it's practically impossible. For employers to have to count hour by hour to make sure that tips make up the difference for every worker for every hour they've worked - even if employers ensured that tips made up the difference. That essentially creates a system in which these workers are not living on a wage from their employer. They are absolutely living completely off the mercy and largess of customers. They are living almost entirely off their tips. RATH: Saru Jayaraman's group advocates eliminating the federal minimum tipped wage so tipped workers earn the same as workers in other minimum wage industries. But Scott DeFife of the National Restaurant Association says that's far too much and could cost thousands of restaurant jobs. SCOTT DEFIFE: There are consequences for taking the minimum wage and rising it up to a point that it's the standard wage for everyone. You will limit opportunity for young people and for people who are coming from difficult circumstances and need an opportunity to get a restart. RATH: DeFife thinks the heavy hand of federal legislation is not the answer. DEFIFE: Most people believe that state governments should be setting more appropriate wage levels for their local economy than one size fits all at the national level. RATH: That's exactly what's happening right now. Some states have a tipped minimum wage higher than the federal standard of $2. 13. And seven states have laws requiring tipped workers receive the same wage as other workers. The Secretary of Labor, Thomas Perez, says those states have demonstrated that you can raise wages for tipped workers without hurting the economy. THOMAS PEREZ: If my friends in the Restaurant Association are correct then it would stand to reason that every time I fly to the state of Washington or if I fly to California it stands to reason that, you know, I should bring a bag lunch because restaurants are going to be very hard to find because they would have gone out of business as a result of having to pay this higher minimum wage. But in fact in the state of Washington which has had the highest minimum wage in the country over the last 15 years you look at job growth and it has been above the national average and payrolls at the state of Washington's restaurants and bars have expanded by 21 percent. And so it's hard for me when we have this actual controlled experiment across America. RATH: Scot DeFife says the National Restaurant Association's own data tell a different story. DEFIFE: We have some studies and research that show in Washington and Oregon that there are fewer employees per establishment than across the rest of the country. RATH: It's pretty clear whose side the Obama Administration is on. But the administration can't act unilaterally. A democratic bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $10. 10 an hour and peg the tipped wage to 70 percent of that was struck down in Congress this spring. But Secretary Perez says the issue is still on the table. PEREZ: If at first you don't succeed we try, try again. That's really the mantra of the labor rights movement and the civil rights movement. And this president is persistent. And we're not going to give up because this is really an issue of fundamental fairness. RATH: While the issue remains stalled at the federal level it's not just states that are making up their own rules. On Friday I had dinner at a restaurant that's trying something different. They have eliminated tipping entirely. Brand 158 is an upscale restaurant and the city of Glendale. You can't miss the notices on the menu - no tipping. Gabriel Frem is the owner. GABRIEL FREM: I feel that our industry, legally, we abuse the labor. It's very abusive. When you actually take a person who is making so little and tell them, you know what you sink or swim on your own. RATH: But Frem's approach isn't just about a feel-good philosophy. He says it works for his bottom line. FREM: The savings you get as a business from paying the minimum end up costing you more in productivity, stability. And our experience has been the guests overall love it and the employees that we hire love it. RATH: At Brand 158 a waiter takes our order on a tablet that wirelessly sends our selection and table number to the kitchen. Wait people barely need to leave the floor. There's no possessiveness over tables and tips. So any wait person can go to any customer who needs service. At least four people helped us over the course of our meal. Frem admits it's a leap to assume this model could work anywhere. Say in a less upscale area. Workers at his restaurant are paid $15 an hour, about $6 more than is California's minimum. But in a state where the bottom wage is at the federal minimum of $2. 13 an hour - that could be a much bigger strain. But Frem thinks the approach makes sense no matter what your bottom line is. FREM: When you have a stable staff, and you have a productive staff, and you have a consistent staff that all yields to savings. If you think you're just being a lower wage per hour but every three weeks you have a new staff - people are always leaving on slow shift peoples don't make their rent, they're distressed, it's going to translate to more cost. RATH: Tess Marie Hudson is a bartender here. TESS MARIE HUDSON: I mean I get stability here which kind of gives me more freedom outside of work, which is nice. I can plan my life accordingly. I can travel and know when I get back I'm going to work on a Monday and still make as much as as I would on a Saturday. So that - that's nice. RATH: Customer Melody Cutolous (ph) was at Brand 158 for the third time and she brought along a friend. MELODY KUTULAS: I love it. I think it's great and that's why I brought her here. I said, it's great. I said that it might be a little bit higher but you're not worrying about tips. RATH: It feels a little strange to most people, not doing that calculation that involves both math and morality at the end of a nice meal. But trust me - it's very easy to get used to.

Meanwhile, new home construction remains stubbornly low. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: In recent years, many homebuyers have been throwing down cold hard cash for the entire purchase. Some are baby boomers who sold a bigger house and they're downsizing. Some are investors. Other buyers are from outside the U. S. Daren Blomquist is the vice president of RealtyTrac, which has a study out about these cash buyers. DAREN BLOMQUIST: The top of the list, in terms of cash sales in the first quarter, was Florida with 64 percent of all sales going to cash buyers, followed by New York - 59 percent, Alabama - 56 percent. ARNOLD: Actually, though, many housing economists think that those numbers in that study are overstated, which suggests that even some of the experts aren't really certain about just what's happening with this housing market. CHRIS HERBERT: Where are we in this recovery is a key question. ARNOLD: That's Chris Herbert. He's the research director at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, which just released its own big report on the overall state of the housing market. HERBERT: Housing really traditionally plays a really strong role in driving the economy out of a recession. And here we are six years later and still yet to do that. And the economy, as a result, I think, is still not really on very strong footing. ARNOLD: So where we are is a key question. But that's been much harder to figure out in this recovery. HERBERT: Over the past year, I would say that the housing market threw us a kind of double head-fake. ARNOLD: The first head-fake was last spring and summer. Interest rates had fallen to very low levels. And that helped to juice up the market. Sales were picking up. Home prices were rising. And it finally looked like the housing recovery that the economy had been waiting for. HERBERT: And I think that led to expectations that maybe housing really was starting to find another gear and play that role. ARNOLD: But then interest rates rose a bit, and things cooled off. And then the second head-fake - Herbert says, the long cold winter really put a damper on housing and made things look even more dismal than they actually were. And now Herbert thinks the market's settling back into it's better-than-dismal but still disappointingly long and slow slog back towards something like normal. HERBERT: The steady, slow recovery - the key thing for the housing market is jobs. Jobs translate into growth in the housing stock. It's still pretty anemic. And so I think as long as the economy follows that path, so will the housing market. ARNOLD: Also speaking at the event at Harvard, where the report was released, was Mike Calhoun. He's the president of the Center for Responsible Lending. He thinks another thing holding back the housing market is that credit is still too tight. Lenders are being too cautious. He thinks that that's keeping a lot of first-time home buyers out of the market. And at a time when, with interest rates still pretty low, owning a home, he says, in most places, is affordable. MIKE CALHOUN: And so one of the ironies is it's a good time for people to buy houses, but they can't get the credit. ARNOLD: And some people who put in an offer on a house but then are waiting to get approved for the mortgage, they're losing out to those people who can just put down cash and buy the house outright. And that's doubly frustrating for people who want to buy but who are being forced to rent because the cost of renting has been going up in recent years. Meanwhile, incomes have been stagnant. Lisa Sturtevant is with the D. C. -based Center for Housing Policy. LISA STURTEVANT: So what we used to think about affordability as something that affected low-income families, it's really moving up the economic ladder where middle-class families are having a hard time finding housing they can afford. ARNOLD: The report found that half of all renters in this country now pay what the federal government considers unaffordable rents - more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing. And more than a quarter of all renters are paying more than half their income on rent. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston. DON GONYEA, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Don Gonyea.

I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Here's a troubling reality in parts of the U. S. The unemployment rate for young people is twice the average. It's a problem we're focusing on all this summer. In a moment, Steve Inskeep digs into the challenges for people ages 16 to 24 - first, to Nevada and Will Stone from Reno Public Radio. WILL STONE, BYLINE: Earlier this year, 22-year-old Patty Sanchez took several days off from her work at a call center while her young daughter had foot surgery. But there was a mix-up, and she was ruled as a no-show. So she lost her job. PATTY SANCHEZ: I've been work - looking for a job since then. And it's just - it's hard. It's hard. STONE: Sanchez sits nervously in the corner of an unemployment office in Reno. She's held down a job since her early teens, even when she was in foster care herself. SANCHEZ: Yeah, I've done from call centers to casinos to customer service - everything. STONE: The high school graduate has sent out dozens of resumes, posted on career websites and gone from store to store, asking about work. Meanwhile, she has four children under the age of five and was recently evicted from her apartment. SANCHEZ: How would I explain it? - I feel like it's a hole that I can't seem to get myself out of even though I'm trying. And I try to stay positive about it. MARK PINGLE: Historically, Nevada's been a place where, without an education, you could make good money parking cars at a casino, for example. STONE: But that's no longer the case, says Mark Pingle, an economist at the University of Nevada, Reno. The downturn hit this state hard, and Pingle says it's been a double whammy for young adults. In Nevada, the unemployment rate for that group shot up to over 20 percent during the peak of the recession. It's since come down to around 17 percent and remains high across the country. Pingle says young adults can't just rely on a high school degree anymore. PINGLE: So you need more so an education in Nevada than in the past. You need to get skills. STONE: That's what 23-year-old Alexandria Roberts had in mind when she majored in political science at the University of Nevada, here. The recent grad strolls through the campus sporting a cowboy hat and points to a small balcony, one of her old haunts. ALEXANDRIA ROBERTS: It's definitely the place that I used to go to just, like, sit and think, and it was quiet. Nobody would bother me. STONE: Those days are over now. At first, Roberts thought she'd work on a political campaign. That never panned out, and for months, she's been sending her resume to all sorts of places. ROBERTS: Human resources position - any kind of office management - things like that. And so we apply for these jobs - I applied for these jobs, and it's just the opportunity is not there. STONE: Roberts had a post-graduation plan - work for a couple of years, pay off some loans, go to law school and then join the military. But she says that may not be realistic anymore. ROBERTS: I have a bachelor's degree, which doesn't get you anywhere, but it's catch 22. It doesn't get you anywhere, but everybody thinks that you're overqualified for things. STONE: For now, she's picking up an odd shift as a waitress. Unless she finds something permanent soon, Roberts will go right into the military and then eventually pursue law school. ROBERTS: Which takes me out into my life a lot farther than I was anticipating it would. STONE: Another route for young people in search of work is vocational training. When Alex Contreras finished high school, he realized he needs some kind of specialty. So he moved away from home and enrolled in Job Corps, a one to two-year federal program for young people who are economically disadvantaged. He was trained as a security guard there, but when he graduated, the job market was still thin. ALEX CONTRERAS: I had to find work, like, right away but I couldn't. No one - didn't call me or anything like, oh, you want a job? Yeah, they never called. STONE: The 20-year-old recently did find some part-time work, and that's helped. But he's moving to Las Vegas in the fall to be with his family and will start his search over again there. He's noticed older people are often going after the same entry-level positions as he is. CONTRERAS: You maybe have all those certifications, but what about the other person? He maybe has the same certifications, but he has probably done it more than I have. STONE: Contreras is motivated to work and upbeat about his prospects. He hopes to be a police officer one day, but for now, he and his peers are faced with a tough economy made more difficult by their age. For NPR News, I'm Will Stone in Reno. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Let's talk about this more now with Elisabeth Jacobs. She's with the Center for Equitable Growth, which studies income inequality here in Washington. Welcome to the program. ELISABETH JACOBS: Thank you so much for having me. INSKEEP: You know, it makes perfect sense, actually, that more young people would be unemployed. You're figuring out your life going, in and out of school - but there's a suggestion in that report that things are worse now. Are things worse now than in the past? JACOBS: I think they are, yes. I mean, the youth unemployment rates - so unemployment for people ages 16 to 25 - is twice the national unemployment rate. So that means about 13 percent of young people are looking for a job and can't find one. There are even more young people who have thrown up their hands and given up looking for a job. And so they're neither in school nor looking for work. And that's a different situation than we've seen in the past. INSKEEP: Giving up at age 19 or 23. JACOBS: (Laughing) I'd like to think that some of  those people are taking a break as opposed to having completely given up, But it's pretty dispiriting. I mean, that's 5 million young people who are neither connected to school nor work. And that's a big deal. I mean, that's a whole cohort of Americans who are at the very beginning of their careers and are pretty dispirited. INSKEEP: Well, let me ask about what works here because we just heard this report in which we heard from a young person who did the right thing - went and got an education - another young person who did the right thing, theoretically - went and got some job training - didn't work for either of them. JACOBS: Yes. And this is the kind of thornier problem. You know, there's some research suggesting that, since about 2000, there's been kind of a cruel game of musical chairs going on in terms of what happens with work. And so there was an increase up until about 2000, in terms of the number of jobs, that demanded really creative cognitively advanced skills - so the reasons, in theory, that you go to college - to really be able to take on kind of more demanding jobs. And we saw that plateau - or at least there's research suggesting that that plateaued in 2000. And since then, there've been fewer jobs like that, and so you have college-educated folk taking the less demanding jobs - quote, unquote \"less demanding\" - for example, like a Starbucks barista kind of job that, actually, to me, seems very demanding 'cause keeping track of all those coffee orders seems like. . . INSKEEP: Sure. Sure. JACOBS: . . . A lot of work. But you don't imagine getting a college degree to go to work at Starbucks. Increasingly, that's what's happening, in terms of, at least, a first job because those kind of complicated jobs are less available. But as a result, you know, when the music stops, you have all the college's grads have taken all the Starbucks jobs. And so if you're a less educated person who in the past, a job like that might have been kind of your go-to first job. The chairs just aren't available for them. INSKEEP: What happens if your first first job out of school is at Starbucks instead of some professional job like you thought it would be or if your first job is nothing? JACOBS: Well, I mean, we see long-term wage affects. So your first job matters a whole lot in terms of what happens to your career trajectory. It's not just the lost earnings and, you know, not  bring home a paycheck for that six weeks to a year to two years that you're unemployed as a young person. Even once you do find a job, we see, you know, for 20 years, wage effects where it's really hard to catch up and see your. INSKEEP: Why would that be? JACOBS: I think, in part, it's because, you know, you kind of hop on a career ladder with that first job. So that impacts your way trajectory because you, you know, start kind of off on a lower rung. INSKEEP: Your next step up is also. . . JACOBS: Your next step up. INSKEEP: . . . Going to be lower than it would have been. JACOBS: Exactly. So I think that's one of the reasons. And the other reason is that if you've had a long unemployment spell, even if it's the beginning of your career, employers don't like that. So to start your career with that kind of black mark on your record - it follows you for a really long time for a variety of reasons. INSKEEP: Let's flip this around here because we've been talking about how this affects individuals. When you have millions of individuals affected in this way, how does it affect the economy? JACOBS: We risk really having this lost generation of workers. I mean, if you've got this whole cohort - and I mentioned earlier that we have 5 million young people who are attached to neither work nor school -and what that means in terms of the economy's ability to innovate and compete when you've kind of wasted the talents of - of some substantial portion of a generation is really - it's alarming. INSKEEP: Five million people is like the population of a medium-sized state. JACOBS: And I think - I mean, it's - it's one of the things I really liked about the Nevada pieces is that it was a young mother. I think, sometimes, when people hear about youth unemployment, they think about teenagers who aren't able to get the life-guarding job at the pool, and, you know, these youth unemployment figures capture people ages 16 to 25. And so we're talking about a lot of American parents who are struggling. This isn't the story of people who can't get a job at the mall. It's about people who are trying to support their families. INSKEEP: Elisabeth Jacobs with the Center for Equitable Growth. Thanks for coming by. JACOBS: Thanks so much for having me. GREENE: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

SONYA HARPER: Been living here my whole, entire life. SCHAPER: In fact, the 32-year-old outreach manager for a near-by urban farm has very deep roots here. HARPER: This is my father's house. This used to be my grandmother's house where I primarily grew up. The house next-door to that is my aunt's house. My cousins live there now, and my mom and dad actually met on this street. So my mother's - which is her mother's house - is actually down there. And I reside out of that house down there. SCHAPER: But most of those previous generations are gone. And Sonya Harper says this part of Englewood on Chicago's South Side has changed over the years. Older neighbors have passed or moved away, most of the decent jobs have left the area, too. And as poverty and unemployment increased, many more people lost their homes to foreclosure. Left behind were abandoned homes, many of which the city has torn down, leaving vacant lots here and all across Englewood, including several on Asiaha Butler's block a mile or so away. ASIAHA BUTLER: I just want to make my block nicer. SCHAPER: Butler says some of the lots get so overgrown that toddlers can get lost in them. They often become mini garbage dumps or sometimes are taken over by drug dealers or gang members. The city of Chicago, which owns about half of the estimated 4,000 vacant lots in the Englewood neighborhood alone, is supposed to clean up and maintain them. But Butler says the city doesn't always stay on top of it. BUTLER: So, like, right now, like, the kids over there are just playing in a lot. They're just running. Our hope that it could be somewhere they feel a little more safe, a little more secure, that's a little more beautified than what we see currently. SCHAPER: Butler and Harper want to buy vacant lots on their blocks and repurpose them. And under a new program, the city of Chicago is selling vacant lots to homeowners who live on the same block for $1, so long as the buyers do not owe back taxes, parking tickets or other debts to the city. BUTLER: So this is the lot that I applied for. SCHAPER: Butler's idea is to put public art, such as murals, on her lot and maybe concrete chess tables, a barbecue pit and even areas for dogs. Harper has already started a small community garden and wants to expand it into adjacent lots. And both see their vacant lots as serving an even greater purpose. Here's Sonya Harper. HARPER: We want to be a block club. It turns from, we care about gardening and food and nature and open space, and, yes, this is all brand-new to us - to, what's going on down the street? Oh, look at that vacant lot over there. Should we do something about that? Oh, Ms. Thompson needs help cutting her grass. Let's go see if she needs help. SCHAPER: Chicago and many other cities have struggled with what to do with the growing number of vacant lots in the wake of the foreclosure crisis. Efforts to develop affordable housing or urban farms have had some mixed results. Phil Ashton, a professor of urban affairs at the University of Illinois, Chicago, says the program selling vacant lots for a buck taps an underutilized resource. PHIL ASHTON: Existing homeowners are sometimes some of the best assets that these neighbors - neighborhoods have. These are people who have long-term commitments to the neighborhood. They have a lot of energy. I mean, these are people who are fully invested in their neighborhoods. SCHAPER: But Ashton says some of these kinds of efforts in other cities have waned after a couple of years. So the big questions is, what else can be done to sustain revitalization? ASHTON: There's got to be something more, really, otherwise we're sort of facing this very pragmatic tool being just a drop in the bucket. SCHAPER: The city of Chicago is working on other neighborhood development tools, but officials say the initial response has been so strong to the $1-lot program that it's expanding it to another neighborhood on the city's West Side. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And I'm David Greene. Chicago is practically giving land away. The city is selling some vacant lots for a dollar each, but there is a catch here. You must already own a home on the same block.

And President Barack Obama celebrated that today, as he visited a group of start-up companies in Washington, D. C. . (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We just got the jobs report today, showing that we've now seen the fastest job growth in the United States, in the first half of the year, since 1999. ARNOLD: And it wasn't just the president who liked this jobs report. Just about every economist weighing in said something along the lines of. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IAN SHEPHERDSON: Well, overall, it's great. I'm very happy to see the 288 number. I'm very happy to see a pretty broad-based spread, with job growth in most of the key sectors looking pretty solid. ARNOLD: That's Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He says something else that's encouraging - for years, small businesses have been the missing link to a real jobs recovery. And Shepherdson's now seeing signs that more small businesses are finally starting to hire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHEPHERDSON: This really has been the missing link. And it's been what I've been waiting for, for the last five years, before I could argue with a straight face that the economy as a whole was going to repair itself properly - because remember, small companies employ about half the workforce. So we're in a position where, finally, they're starting to move. And this, really, potentially makes an enormous difference. ARNOLD: The report also revised upwards the numbers for the prior two months. David Kotok is chief economist at Cumberland Advisors. DAVID KOTOK: There's a trend of gradually healing and improving employment in the United States. And it's now a trend sufficiently in place. So we can say this is not just a blip. ARNOLD: One area that's less encouraging, though, is wages. Real wages have been stagnant or worse for middle-class Americans for years. There was some slight wage growth last month, but not much. And the president acknowledged that. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: We still have not seen as much increase in income and wages as we'd like to see. A lot of folks are still digging themselves out of challenges that arose out of the Great Recession.

ARNOLD: But, she says, another less bright spot. . . LYNCH: You know, it's July. Everybody's thinking about the summertime, Fourth of July festivities, but also - teenage summer jobs. We still have 1 in 5 teens who's looking for a summer job can't find it. So that's really high. ARNOLD: And there's still a lot of people who are underemployed or working part-time when they'd like to be working full-time. Still, Ian Shepherdson says, after the slowdown during that long, cold winter, this report puts that slowdown behind us.

I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Good morning. We begin this hour with more positive signs about the nation's economy. The Labor Department this morning said the U. S. unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in nearly six years last month, and employers added some 288,000 jobs to their payrolls. Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The job growth was spread across the economy in business services, retail trade, manufacturing and even government hiring. Not only did June job growth go up at a robust pace, but the Labor Department also raised its estimate of the number of jobs created in April and May. Douglas Handler is chief U. S. economist at IHS Global Insight. DOUGLAS HANDLER: We've averaged about 248,000 over the past five months, and then this month, the quality of the jobs really is noteworthy in the report. So we're on our way to labor market health for sure. ZARROLI: The report also said that the overall unemployment rate fell again, from 6. 3 percent in May to 6. 1 percent. That was the lowest it's been since September 2008, the month when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the U. S. economy went into a tailspin. In recent years, such a big drop often took place for the wrong reasons. People grew so discouraged about finding work that they stop looking and fell off the unemployment rolls. But Ryan Sweet of Moody's Analytics says that wasn't the case this time. Household employment actually rose, and the overall labor participation rate was stable. RYAN SWEET: It seems like people were getting - re-engaging back into the labor force. So I think the job and unemployment rate is encouraging. I think the jobless rate has come down much more quickly than many economists anticipated. ZARROLI: At the same time, people who have had the most trouble finding jobs are finally getting hired. The number of long-term unemployed is dropping, too and is now half what it was three years ago. The report suggests that the big dip in growth last winter, when the U. S. economy contracted by 2. 9 percent, did only temporary damage to the job market. If there was a downside to the report, it was in the number of people working fewer hours than they wanted. Again, Ryan Sweet. SWEET: The number of people working part-time for economic reasons increased in June, and, you know, that may catch the Fed's attention a little bit and kind of temper their enthusiasm about the strength of the job market. ZARROLI: In fact the report will give Federal Reserve officials plenty to think about. The June report shows wages grew at 2 percent over the preceding 12 months, and that suggests that inflation remains a distant threat. At the same time, the continued growth in the job market will have to give Fed officials pause. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero for more than five months. It also buys up billions of dollars' worth of bonds every month. The rate of bond purchases has been slowing considerably. The strength of this morning's report suggests that Fed officials may have to pull back on the purchases more quickly and prepare for the day when extraordinary measures to help the economy are no longer needed.

S. Census says 46 million Americans live in poverty. Back in January, President Obama announced that a new program would target five areas across the country where poverty persists. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We call these communities Promise Zones. They're neighborhoods where we will help local efforts to meet one national goal - that a child's course in life should be determined not by the zip code she's born in, but by the strength of her work ethic and the scope of dreams. MCEVERS: The five promise zones are in Philadelphia, San Antonio, southeastern Kentucky, the Choctaw nation of Oklahoma and right here in Los Angeles. The idea is to basically carpet bomb urban neighborhoods and rural areas with programs, like afterschool classes, job-training, ESL, GED, parenting classes, computer training, infrastructure charter schools - all to turn these areas. It's our cover story today - tackling poverty in place. MCEVERS: This week, we headed out to the Los Angeles Promise Zone, which covers parts of central LA - one of the densest parts of the city, with a mix of people of Latino, Korean, Thai, Armenian and African-American heritage. The decision to designate this part of LA as a promise zone has been controversial here. Why not pick other parts of LA, where poverty is more entrenched? We went to the Family Source Center to find out. It's run by the Youth Policy Institute. That's the main organization that's already gotten federal funding to tackle poverty. Now that it's in the promise zone, it stands to gain more. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY SOURCE CENTER)SERGIO MORALES: Good afternoon. Thank you for your patience. MCEVERS: There's a long line outside. Dozens of people have been waiting for hours just to get a $6 to $10 discount on a monthly bus pass. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY SOURCE CENTER)MORALES: Please stand in line. You need to make sure that you have proof of income, proof of address and an ID. MCEVERS: Sergio Morales helps runs the institute's community centers. He tells people waiting outside they'll eventually have to come inside and wait for their name to be called. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY SOURCE CENTER)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Carlos Sandoval. MCEVERS: Morales says the bus pass program is a great way to access people in the zone. They come in for their pass, then sign up for things like tutoring or housing assistance or a baby massage class with a caseworker like this one. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Spanish spoken). MCEVERS: Dixon Slingerland heads the Youth Policy Institute. We asked him to show us the zone and explain how the institute's work will change now that it's in the zone. He started by explaining how the center is situated in East Hollywood. DIXON SLINGERLAND: Right at the corner of Santa Monica and Western in Hollywood - the real Hollywood. This is probably the busiest intersection in all of LA - bus traffic, foot traffic, car traffic. So we're really in the heart of things here. MCEVERS: You say the real Hollywood. What do you mean? SLINGERLAND: I mean the Hollywood where poverty rates reach 50 percent in the census tracts - where families are living together in very dense, high-poverty conditions and the schools are not achieving as well as they could. And there's a lot of challenges. Across the country, peopling think about Hollywood. They have a certain image. That's not this Hollywood. MCEVERS: So we head out into the real Hollywood. Slingerland says the reason this neighborhood was chosen is that organizations like his already have secured lots of federal grants and shown they can use that money by actually helping people. SLINGERLAND: And it's not just the money. It's more about the fact that you've already proven that you've got the right folks at the table. You know what you're doing. You're focuses on data. You've got the public sector partnering with you. MCEVERS: So not just about money? It's like awarding the most likely to succeed. SLINGERLAND: I suppose you could say that - yeah. MCEVERS: So here's how the promise zone designation works, Slingerland says. A federal grant is announced for something like an art center. Slingerland's organization applies for it. Because it's in the zone, it will get preferential treatment. Since the designation, he says, his organization already has gotten two and a quarter million dollars for a fitness program, and they've applied for $50 million more. The hope is that other neighborhoods can replicate this one's success. Fifteen more Promise Zones across the U. S. are said to be designated over the next three years. Of course, Slingerland says, LA is different from the other promise zones. SLINGERLAND: All five of us are going to look very different in terms of our strategies and approaches, but we're all getting at the same fundamental outcomes. We're all trying to combat poverty in our communities. MCEVERS: So how did we get here? Who decided the place-based approach is the right one? It all goes back to the settlement houses - basically community centers with a wide range of services that federal government built in poor neighborhoods starting a century ago. Then came the now famous Harlem Children's Zone which targeted that part of New York City with programs from birth to graduation, says Margery Turner of the Urban Institute. MARGERY TURNER: It focused very explicitly on children, and they didn't invent the intervention all at once. They plugged away at it over several decades. MCEVERS: Since then, Turner says, the place-based thing has taken off. TURNER: Indeed, we have been through lots of different promises, opportunities and zones. MCEVERS: We asked Turner to explain why we should tackle poverty in place. TURNER: The argument is that when people live in deeply poor, severely distressed neighborhoods, conditions in those neighborhoods really undermine people's chances of success. And if we don't tackle those conditions, other strategies we use that supplement income or provide educational opportunities or work opportunities - they're going to be less effective. MCEVERS: Turner says there are other approaches to tackling poverty, like handing out cash to poor people in places like Mexico and New York City. TURNER: The key, I think, is not to look for a single silver bullet. Persistent interracial poverty is a complicated problem. There are a lot of big forces that are perpetuating it. So cash benefits, certainly, are a really important part of a solution. For families in these severely distressed neighborhoods, that will be helpful. It's not enough. MCEVERS: Turner says, for the more comprehensive place-based programs to be enough, the one thing they need is time. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  Think about this - the U. S. Census says 46 million Americans live in poverty. Back in January, President Obama announced that a new program would target five areas across the country where poverty persists. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We call these communities Promise Zones. They're neighborhoods where we will help local efforts to meet one national goal - that a child's course in life should be determined not by the zip code she's born in, but by the strength of her work ethic and the scope of dreams. MCEVERS: The five promise zones are in Philadelphia, San Antonio, southeastern Kentucky, the Choctaw nation of Oklahoma and right here in Los Angeles. The idea is to basically carpet bomb urban neighborhoods and rural areas with programs, like afterschool classes, job-training, ESL, GED, parenting classes, computer training, infrastructure charter schools - all to turn these areas. It's our cover story today - tackling poverty in place. MCEVERS: This week, we headed out to the Los Angeles Promise Zone, which covers parts of central LA - one of the densest parts of the city, with a mix of people of Latino, Korean, Thai, Armenian and African-American heritage. The decision to designate this part of LA as a promise zone has been controversial here. Why not pick other parts of LA, where poverty is more entrenched? We went to the Family Source Center to find out. It's run by the Youth Policy Institute. That's the main organization that's already gotten federal funding to tackle poverty. Now that it's in the promise zone, it stands to gain more. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY SOURCE CENTER) SERGIO MORALES: Good afternoon. Thank you for your patience. MCEVERS: There's a long line outside. Dozens of people have been waiting for hours just to get a $6 to $10 discount on a monthly bus pass. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY SOURCE CENTER) MORALES: Please stand in line. You need to make sure that you have proof of income, proof of address and an ID. MCEVERS: Sergio Morales helps runs the institute's community centers. He tells people waiting outside they'll eventually have to come inside and wait for their name to be called. (SOUNDBITE OF FAMILY SOURCE CENTER) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Carlos Sandoval. MCEVERS: Morales says the bus pass program is a great way to access people in the zone. They come in for their pass, then sign up for things like tutoring or housing assistance or a baby massage class with a caseworker like this one. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Spanish spoken). MCEVERS: Dixon Slingerland heads the Youth Policy Institute. We asked him to show us the zone and explain how the institute's work will change now that it's in the zone. He started by explaining how the center is situated in East Hollywood. DIXON SLINGERLAND: Right at the corner of Santa Monica and Western in Hollywood - the real Hollywood. This is probably the busiest intersection in all of LA - bus traffic, foot traffic, car traffic. So we're really in the heart of things here. MCEVERS: You say the real Hollywood. What do you mean? SLINGERLAND: I mean the Hollywood where poverty rates reach 50 percent in the census tracts - where families are living together in very dense, high-poverty conditions and the schools are not achieving as well as they could. And there's a lot of challenges. Across the country, peopling think about Hollywood. They have a certain image. That's not this Hollywood. MCEVERS: So we head out into the real Hollywood. Slingerland says the reason this neighborhood was chosen is that organizations like his already have secured lots of federal grants and shown they can use that money by actually helping people. SLINGERLAND: And it's not just the money. It's more about the fact that you've already proven that you've got the right folks at the table. You know what you're doing. You're focuses on data. You've got the public sector partnering with you. MCEVERS: So not just about money? It's like awarding the most likely to succeed. SLINGERLAND: I suppose you could say that - yeah. MCEVERS: So here's how the promise zone designation works, Slingerland says. A federal grant is announced for something like an art center. Slingerland's organization applies for it. Because it's in the zone, it will get preferential treatment. Since the designation, he says, his organization already has gotten two and a quarter million dollars for a fitness program, and they've applied for $50 million more. The hope is that other neighborhoods can replicate this one's success. Fifteen more Promise Zones across the U. S. are said to be designated over the next three years. Of course, Slingerland says, LA is different from the other promise zones. SLINGERLAND: All five of us are going to look very different in terms of our strategies and approaches, but we're all getting at the same fundamental outcomes. We're all trying to combat poverty in our communities. MCEVERS: So how did we get here? Who decided the place-based approach is the right one? It all goes back to the settlement houses - basically community centers with a wide range of services that federal government built in poor neighborhoods starting a century ago. Then came the now famous Harlem Children's Zone which targeted that part of New York City with programs from birth to graduation, says Margery Turner of the Urban Institute. MARGERY TURNER: It focused very explicitly on children, and they didn't invent the intervention all at once. They plugged away at it over several decades. MCEVERS: Since then, Turner says, the place-based thing has taken off. TURNER: Indeed, we have been through lots of different promises, opportunities and zones. MCEVERS: We asked Turner to explain why we should tackle poverty in place. TURNER: The argument is that when people live in deeply poor, severely distressed neighborhoods, conditions in those neighborhoods really undermine people's chances of success. And if we don't tackle those conditions, other strategies we use that supplement income or provide educational opportunities or work opportunities - they're going to be less effective. MCEVERS: Turner says there are other approaches to tackling poverty, like handing out cash to poor people in places like Mexico and New York City. TURNER: The key, I think, is not to look for a single silver bullet. Persistent interracial poverty is a complicated problem. There are a lot of big forces that are perpetuating it. So cash benefits, certainly, are a really important part of a solution. For families in these severely distressed neighborhoods, that will be helpful. It's not enough. MCEVERS: Turner says, for the more comprehensive place-based programs to be enough, the one thing they need is time.", "section": "National", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

Land banks offer one solution; those are public institutions that help fund the renewal of dormant properties. WNYC's Ilya Marritz takes us to Newburgh, New York, a small city on the Hudson River, to see one land bank in action. ILYA MARRITZ, BYLINE: Newberg is just 60 miles straight north of Manhattan, but its economy can feel worlds away. Sneakers hang in bunches from telephone lines, people push shopping carts loaded with bottles and cans. The town's industrial base of pocketbook factories disappeared long ago. It's a jungle of decay, and it's Madeline Fletcher's job to fix it up. MADELINE FLETCHER: This building is old; this is, like, from the 1850s. This building is a mess, and it's been very empty for long time. MARRITZ: Fletcher is executive director of the Madeline Fletcher Community Land Bank. The state-backed bank acquires properties that have been abandoned or failed to pay taxes. Walking these streets with Fletcher is like going through a gallery with a wealthy art collector. FLETCHER: I'm actually looking at acquiring this. MARRITZ: And, hey, look over there; another tax delinquent property, which the land bank may also take. The goal is to tear down or redevelop buildings that no private investor will touch. In New York, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has funneled more than $12 million into land banks. The money comes from a cash settlement with financial institutions over abuses in the foreclosure process. And in Newburgh, the focus is on a grid of streets in the middle of town where a quarter of the homes are vacant. Most were built before World War II, and Fletcher says almost all of them can be repaired. FLETCHER: What you find here, actually, is that, you know, masonry buildings were built to last a very, very long time. So in spite of the neglect, you can save them. MARRITZ: Buildings like the old Brutus Hodge funeral home. FLETCHER: OK, it's a little dark in here. MARRITZ: You can see that much of the plaster that should be on the ceiling is now on the ground, rainwater drips from the roof. It'll cost half a million dollars just to make this building fit for humans again. One of the biggest expenses is something you can't even see, lead and asbestos. FLETCHER: I guess there was some period of time were plaster had asbestos in it, and it just happens to coincide with when a lot of these buildings were built. MARRITZ: It'll be $75,000 to clean. But making repairs is in some ways the easiest part of the land bank's job. A bigger challenge right now is untangling the ownership of neglected buildings, like on Lander Street, with its quaint but crumbling brick homes. FLETCHER: This is our big row of work. MARRITZ: It's tricky. The land bank owns most of the abandoned buildings here, but not number 52, a two-story with plywood over the bay windows. FLETCHER: Fifty-two was sold in a batch sale by Fannie Mae. So now it's owned by some kind of random fund in Redondo Beach, California. MARRITZ: Fletcher wants to buy the building, but she hasn't been able to find a phone number or email address. FLETCHER: I'm actually just sending them a letter with an offer. MARRITZ: Does that work? FLETCHER: I don't know yet. MARRITZ: Running a land bank means doing a certain amount of detective work. FRANK ALEXANDER: The nature of abandoned properties is such that the owners don't want to be found. MARRITZ: This is Frank Alexander, a law professor at Emory University who spent the last two decades helping cities and states set up land banks. He says American laws and culture tolerate abandonment, but for cities it means lost tax revenue and a drag on property values. ALEXANDER: What we are saying when we create land banks is that vacant and abandoned properties are a form of litter, and it's simply time to change the laws to stop littering. MARRITZ: Right now the Newburgh land bank has about 25 properties and $2-and-a-half million dollar in grant money from the state attorney general's office. FLETCHER: Hi, how are you doing? DEBORAH FORD: That's my building over there. MARRITZ: Which one? FLETCHER: I know, we met, 54 right? FORD: Oh, yeah, yeah, somebody. . . . MARRITZ: During our walk down Lander Street, a woman pulls up in a minivan. Deborah Ford is wearing leopard-print frames and a headscarf. Three years ago, she and her husband took a chance and bought the house next-door to number 52. They got it in good enough shape to take tenets. FORD: Mine's is renovated. I'm in the makings, like, doing the gardening and stuff. MARRITZ: Ford thinks this could be a good neighborhood in a few years time. For NPR News, I'm Ilya Marritz in New York.

And one Ohio county has shifted its anti-poverty efforts to address that fact directly. As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, Richland County is trying to teach family-building skills, even when families don't live together. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: In a cramped public housing apartment in Mansfield, Ohio, Brittiny Spears is getting her daughter and her three cousins outside for some fresh air. BRITTINY SPEARS: OK, calm down. You all want to race? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Yeah. SPEARS: OK, on your marks, get set, go. LUDDEN: Spears is 26, a single mom like just about all her friends, she says. In fact, among women without a college degree, more than half of births are now outside marriage, though this is nothing new for Spears. Her own father had a number of children with different women. SPEARS: I just knew of his name. I never met him ever in my life. He died before I could even meet him. LUDDEN: Back inside, as her niece scoots around on a red tricycle, Spears says she's not alone for a lack of offers. SPEARS: I've been proposed to three times. I just haven't accepted the engagement. LUDDEN: The last one was from the father of her four-year-old. Spears says it's sad her daughter barely knows her dad. But she wasn't die-hard in love with him. Plus, he had no job, she says, no ambition. SPEARS: He wasn't trying to do any helping with the kids. He just still wanted to go out and party and be a little boy. And I wasn't wanting that. I already had one kid to take care of. I didn't want to take care of a grown kid, too. LUDDEN: Understandable. And yet, children of single women are five times as likely to be poor as those of married couples. Spears dropped out of college when she was pregnant. She can't afford to pay back student loans. It's been two years since her last job. SPEARS: Well, right now I get food stamps to take care of my food. And this is HUD housing so the rent is free. And I get a utility check to pay my bills and it's electric and gas. JENNIFER JENNETTE: We're seeing the same people come year after year and in some cases, generation to generation. And so then you think, why is that happening? LUDDEN: Jennifer Jennette is with The Community Action Commission of Erie, Huron and Richland Counties. She says financial assistance alone isn't changing people's lives. What could, she says, is family. At the least, more supportive, stable relationships, even if couples aren't together. So Community Action overhauled its approach this year. JENNETTE: Now the shift in the focus has turned more to helping people learn a new way of thinking - for that person to look inside themselves as to why their behavior might be the way it is based on how they were raised, and how therefore they can change their mindset to change their behavior. LUDDEN: That effort has started here - a minimum-security rehab center. Mothers struggling with drug and alcohol addiction meet twice a week for classes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hey, hey, hey. LUDDEN: Five women gather around a table in the library. Four are white, one biracial - all but one, single mothers. KaTrece Lee of Community Action leads the group. KATRECE LEE: What do you see your children lacking without having a father in their lives? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: Self-respect. Self-esteemLUDDEN: Lee writes answers on a chalk board and adds more. LEE: Their low performance in school. They also usually have behavior issues. LUDDEN: They're also more likely to abuse drugs, commit crimes and, of course, be poor. The discussion then turns to conflict and how to handle it. Research shows chronic conflict between parents, even if they live apart, can harm children's mental health. The women share stories of simmering resentments and shouting matches. MELISSA STUTZMAN: We were arguing and my eight-year-old daughter goes, you guys don't have to love each other but can't you just like each other a little bit? LUDDEN: The conversations can be brutally honest. The class feels like group therapy. The women say they love coming here. Melissa Stutzman is a divorced mother of three. STUTZMAN: I was always a finger pointer. You did this. You didn't do that. Now I'm starting to think well, maybe I had some things to do with it. And maybe I got to look on the inside instead of looking out. Work on me first and worry about him less (Laughing. )LUDDEN: The county has classes for fathers, too. Organizers say they're not exactly about promoting marriage. The second Bush Administration spent a lot of time and money on that. But studies found the effort largely failed. Jennifer Jennette of Community Action says simply educating parents on how their relationship impacts their child can make a difference. JENNETTE: If they're not together the goal is better communication. I don't maybe like him. I am maybe not with him anymore. But it's not about me or him, it's about my child. And how do we want to make his life better? LUDDEN: And if children's lives are better - more emotionally secure, if not financially so, she hopes that can help stop the cycle of poverty for the next generation. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Labor tensions are high at the largest port complex in the country - Los Angeles and Long Beach - which handles nearly half of all the cargo coming into the U. S. Short-haul truck drivers are striking. The relatively small strikes come as the shipping companies are also in negotiations with dockworkers over a new contract. If that labor dispute isn't resolved soon, NPR's Kirk Siegler reports a much bigger disruption could be looming on the West Coast. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: As an independent contractor hauling containers from the ships to warehouses across Southern California, truck driver Santos Lopez works long hours - some days ten, others 14. But not this week - this week he's picketing, a long line of semis waiting to enter this container truck. SANTOS LOPEZ: (Spanish spoken). SIEGLER: We plan to strike indefinitely, he says, as long as it takes for the trucking companies to recognize us as regular employees with benefits. Right now, Lopez and an estimated 10,000 more independent short-haul truckers at this port have to pay their own way - gas and maintenance for their trucks, insurance, parking fees. Santos has a wife and three daughters to support at home. LOPEZ: (Spanish spoken). SIEGLER: My family and I have agreed that going on strike and not getting paid will be hard, but we believe it will pay off in the end, he says. Next to Lopez, a cop stops traffic as the line of picketers walks out in front of the trucks. A few times this week, there have been work stoppages. And at least three terminals have briefly closed down as some dockworkers with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union stopped working in a show of support for the truckers. Plenty of people think the timing of this week's trucker strike is more than coincidence. JOCK O'CONNELL: It's a great opportunity for them to take advantage of the fact that a lot of people around the country are getting increasingly anxious about negotiations between the ILWU and the Pacific Maritime Association. SIEGLER: That's the dockworkers and the shipping companies who are working on a new contract. Jock O'Connell is an international trade expert with Beacon Economics. O'CONNELL: So this, you know, should give them a leg up in their efforts to negotiate. SIEGLER: The negotiations between the dockworkers and the cargo industry are set to resume tomorrow morning. Tony Scioscia is a retired shipping executive and former board member of the Pacific Maritime Association. TONY SCIOSCIA: The bigger picture here is that the West Coast doesn't want to lose any more market share. They want to negotiate, get this contract done without a disruption. SIEGLER: When Scioscia says disruption, he means something a lot bigger than this week's trucker strikes. That is, a dockworker strike that could shut down the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That would cost the U. S. economy an estimated $2 billion a day and would come at a critical time for the U. S. retail sector, which is gearing up for the back-to-school season. SCIOSCIA: Negotiations, I know this from the outside, that they have been civil, they've been very positive, they have been constructive. Of course, they can go the other way very quickly. SIEGLER: Analysts say that's more of a concern now given the tense atmosphere at the ports this week. Back at the ports, a midday rally at a park in the shadow of three giant container cranes drew leaders from across Los Angeles and the nation. UNIDENTIFIED PICKETER: We want the truck drivers to know that we will be here today, we'll be here tomorrow and any day, as long as. . . SIEGLER: The leaders see their fight as part of a much larger struggle. Unions have been losing members and influence as the ports have moved toward mechanization, and the truck drivers - if they became regular employees, than they could form a union. FRED POTTER: We're going to show them how they can achieve their rights, get justice, be properly classified and have the rights that so many employees take for granted. SIEGLER: That's Fred Potter, senior vice president for the Teamsters who flew in from New Jersey. He says the unions will be here backing the truckers and the dockworkers for the long haul. Kirk Siegler, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. Labor tensions are high at the largest port complex in the country - Los Angeles and Long Beach - which handles nearly half of all the cargo coming into the U. S. Short-haul truck drivers are striking. The relatively small strikes come as the shipping companies are also in negotiations with dockworkers over a new contract. If that labor dispute isn't resolved soon, NPR's Kirk Siegler reports a much bigger disruption could be looming on the West Coast. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: As an independent contractor hauling containers from the ships to warehouses across Southern California, truck driver Santos Lopez works long hours - some days ten, others 14. But not this week - this week he's picketing, a long line of semis waiting to enter this container truck. SANTOS LOPEZ: (Spanish spoken). SIEGLER: We plan to strike indefinitely, he says, as long as it takes for the trucking companies to recognize us as regular employees with benefits. Right now, Lopez and an estimated 10,000 more independent short-haul truckers at this port have to pay their own way - gas and maintenance for their trucks, insurance, parking fees. Santos has a wife and three daughters to support at home. LOPEZ: (Spanish spoken). SIEGLER: My family and I have agreed that going on strike and not getting paid will be hard, but we believe it will pay off in the end, he says. Next to Lopez, a cop stops traffic as the line of picketers walks out in front of the trucks. A few times this week, there have been work stoppages. And at least three terminals have briefly closed down as some dockworkers with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union stopped working in a show of support for the truckers. Plenty of people think the timing of this week's trucker strike is more than coincidence. JOCK O'CONNELL: It's a great opportunity for them to take advantage of the fact that a lot of people around the country are getting increasingly anxious about negotiations between the ILWU and the Pacific Maritime Association. SIEGLER: That's the dockworkers and the shipping companies who are working on a new contract. Jock O'Connell is an international trade expert with Beacon Economics. O'CONNELL: So this, you know, should give them a leg up in their efforts to negotiate. SIEGLER: The negotiations between the dockworkers and the cargo industry are set to resume tomorrow morning. Tony Scioscia is a retired shipping executive and former board member of the Pacific Maritime Association. TONY SCIOSCIA: The bigger picture here is that the West Coast doesn't want to lose any more market share. They want to negotiate, get this contract done without a disruption. SIEGLER: When Scioscia says disruption, he means something a lot bigger than this week's trucker strikes. That is, a dockworker strike that could shut down the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. That would cost the U. S. economy an estimated $2 billion a day and would come at a critical time for the U. S. retail sector, which is gearing up for the back-to-school season. SCIOSCIA: Negotiations, I know this from the outside, that they have been civil, they've been very positive, they have been constructive. Of course, they can go the other way very quickly. SIEGLER: Analysts say that's more of a concern now given the tense atmosphere at the ports this week. Back at the ports, a midday rally at a park in the shadow of three giant container cranes drew leaders from across Los Angeles and the nation. UNIDENTIFIED PICKETER: We want the truck drivers to know that we will be here today, we'll be here tomorrow and any day, as long as. . . SIEGLER: The leaders see their fight as part of a much larger struggle. Unions have been losing members and influence as the ports have moved toward mechanization, and the truck drivers - if they became regular employees, than they could form a union.

That strong economy has also helped ensure the government stays in power. And a big part of China's economic growth is real estate. The real estate market in China has been booming for years, but now it's starting to retreat. A major survey found prices fell last month in 79 out of 100 cities. Land sales have dropped as well. NPR's Frank Langfitt traveled one of China's struggling cities. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: So I'm driving into Wuxi on a rainy night. And I've just passed, like, five or six new apartment towers that must be 30 stories tall, and I could only see a handful of lights on. Wuxi is a city of nearly 5 million in eastern China's Jiangsu province, about an hour's bullet train ride from Shanghai. It's one of many midsized, provincial cities where the real estate market is anemic. Huang Jiqiang works as an agent with Central Plains Real Estate here. He says supply and demand are completely out of whack. HUANG JIQIANG: (Through translator) There's nothing you can do. Now all the new housing complexes are dropping their prices and doing promotions because there are just too many homes. After all, there aren't that many buyers, and the pool of buyers is getting smaller and smaller. Homes are still under construction out there. LANGFITT: Huang says prices have already dropped 15 to 20 percent this year. He estimates it would take nearly two and a half years to sell off all of Wuxi's current housing stock. In private comments leaked online, an official with one of China's biggest developers, Vanke, estimates the city's unsold inventory was actually double that - almost five years' worth of empty apartments. By all accounts, the culprits are overbuilding, inflated prices and almost no local demand. JIQIANG: (Through translator) Every local family has at least two or three apartments, so they already have enough space to live. And if an outsider wants to buy a new apartment, they cannot afford it. A 970 square-foot apartment, on average, costs more than $116,000. The way they see it, that's a lot of financial pressure. LANGFITT: Especially in a city where the average annual salary is just $8,200. Wuxi's been trying to lure in people from elsewhere to prop up the market. Buy a 650 square-foot apartment, and the government will throw in a much-coveted local residency permit, which entitles your children to public schooling among other benefits. So far, Huang says, that's not enough. JIQIANG: (Through translator) Many clients are still waiting and seeing and hoping there will be further price cuts from the current levels. OLIVER RUI: Since the beginning of this year, there's a kind of switch of the mood. People become more cautious, and it never happened before. LANGFITT: Oliver Rui teaches finance at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. He says the housing glut is driven by a political system that has rewarded local officials for economic growth over everything else. RUI: If they want to be promoted in the next level of political hierarchies, they have to show the GDP growth rate is better than their neighbors'. What is the easiest way to increase the GDP growth? Is through the investment, OK, is through the real estate. LANGFITT: Even if that real estate doesn't actually sell. RUI: They think the people from the rural area eventually can't help to digest all those inventories. That's the hope. LANGFITT: Do you believe that? RUI: I don't believe so. LANGFITT: Rui says that's because, on average, it would take a Chinese person 15 years of earnings, without spending money on anything else, to pay for a home. That's at least double the international standard. SAM CRISPIN: Hello, everyone. I'm Sam Crispin. I've been living and working in Shanghai for 20 years now, covering the China real estate sector. LANGFITT: Neither Crispin nor Rui expect the market to crash. Rui says the government has many tools, from cutting interest rates to lifting restrictions on home purchases, that can prevent free-fall. Crispin expects prices to gradually drop and people, eventually, to buy. He cites Shanghai's Pudong New Area, which had huge vacancy rates in the 1990s. CRISPIN: The whole of Pudong was a bit of a basket case 15 years ago. Not many people wanted to make the move. But now we see some of the most expensive, most desirable real estate here in Pudong. It's been a massive success for Shanghai. LANGFITT: Of course, Shanghai is a prestige, coastal city and a magnet for the wealthy and ambitious - dramatically different from Wuxi. As for Crispin, earlier this year, he moved home to England for family reasons. He says no one should read too much into this, but he sold all but one of his properties in China. He's looking for better rent revenue. CRISPIN: I could see that capital growth was slowing, and it was time to go and invest elsewhere where there may be better income. LANGFITT: It seems like a good time to diversify. Frank Langfitt. NPR News, Shanghai. INSKEEP: We're glad you're with us here on MORNING EDITION, keeping your ear on the world. There's more ahead.

I'm Terry Gross. Visit the town of Basset in Southern Virginia and you'll find some of the downtown streetlights are dark. The lamps, maintained by the once prosperous Bassett Furniture company are now funded by voluntary contributions from residents and businesses when they can afford it. Bassett is just one of many towns and cities in Virginia and North Carolina where scores of furniture making plants have closed in the past 20 years, mostly due to competition from China and other foreign countries. Our guest, Beth Macy, has a new book which documents the collapse of the American furniture industry and its human cost and profiles one determined owner who fought back against the foreign onslaught - both by filing anti-dumping charges against Chinese firms with the U. S. International Trade Commission and by making his own company more competitive. Beth Macy worked for years as a reporter for the Roanoke Times and she's also written for national magazines. She's received several national awards, including Nieman Fellowship at Harvard. She spoke to FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies about her book \"Factory Man: How One Furniture Maker Battled Offshoring, Stayed Local And Helped Save An American Town. \"DAVE DAVIES, HOST: Beth Macy, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, this is a story of - a remarkable story of reporting. But it's clear you feel a personal connection to it in a lot of ways. Tell us a little bit just about your parents, your background, your childhood. BETH MACY: Sure. I grew up in a factory town - Urbana, Ohio. I was the fourth of - by a long shot - of my parents and my mom worked in the airplane light factory called Grimes. And my dad was a house painter. He was often unemployed by the time I came along. And he was an alcoholic and my mom really kept the family together by working in the factory when the economy was good. You know, this is like the '70s and when the economy wasn't good, she would get laid off and so I, you know, I know what that felt like to some of the conversations around the dinner table about, you know, whether our gas might be cut off or, you know, how the bills were going to get paid. So when I became a journalist, I gravitated to those kinds of stories of what I call outsiders and underdogs. I didn't, like, intentionally gravitate to them but after about 15 years, it hit me that, you know, those were the stories I wrote the best. DAVIES: Now, the man at the center of this story, John Bassett III, is a descendent of a long established family of Virginia and North Carolina furniture makers - that is to say factories that made furniture's. Tell us a little bit about the Bassett company - kind of what it made him - what kind of relationship it had with its employees over the decades. MACY: Sure. It began in 1902. It was started by John D. Bassett Sr. and they came out of the Civil War sort of cash poor and land rich. He was a very kind of wily saw-miller. He had a lot of land, a lot of trees on the land. And he decided when he heard the railroad was coming through Henry County, that he would open a sawmill so he could sell the railroad the ties for the land. And he built a little store and had a boarding house where the railroad workers could stay and buy their food and whatnot. I mean, he was always kind of one step ahead and as, you know, the railroad was built, he realized that hey - why are we sending all of our lumber up to the furniture companies in New York and Michigan? I think we could do that ourselves. And actually he and his wife were on a buying trip in, you know, 1900 - the family lore is that it was actually his wife Miss Pokey's idea to kind of poke around and see how the factory there was organized and come back and try to do that in their own front yard. And as it turned out, they built a factory in their front yard. DAVIES: Right, Miss Pokey - short for Pocahontas - which was her name. And so he runs the factory for decades and there are other factories and they are run by descendants of this family for decades. And there's the town of Bassett. What was its relationship with the company? MACY: Right. The town of Bassett was never incorporated. So it's a classic company town, built to support the company. I mean, they had to bring workers in from the countryside to work in the factories and they had to provide housing - so they built houses. The rent was deducted from their paychecks. And, you know, there wasn't a town Council - there was Bassett Furniture industries. And you actually paid your power bill up until the '70s, I think it was, at Bassett Furniture industries. The company ran everything. DAVIES: They ran the church, right, the post office? MACY: (Laughing) There were two churches. The family started out Baptist but they quickly realized if they were bringing all these people in from the hillside, that they better branch off and have Methodist too, just to give them a little variety. So C. C. went off and started the Methodist church and J. D. Bassett started Pocahontas Bassett Baptist Church and, you know, just for a little variety. DAVIES: And these weren't owners that lived far away and clipped coupons. I mean, they were very much involved in the industrial process, knew workers' names, right? MACY: Exactly. One of my favorite stories is during the depression, a lot of the North Carolina furniture makers were going out of business and one of the things that J. D. Bassett vowed to do was not to lay anybody off - and he didn't. And he knew these workers. And one of the things he did was he went around to all of the factories because he knew he had to cut people's hours back, but he didn't want to do it willy-nilly. So he found out how many people were in your family, so he cut back your hours according to that so you could still make a living and, you know, eke out an existence. You could still have a job and when the economy came back, you know, they were all ready for, you know, the postwar boom. Then they could really take off. But, you know, during the depression, instead of bonuses, everybody got a ham. DAVIES: Wow. So they were tough people but they did care about their folks - resolutely opposed to unions and kept them out. MACY: Right, right. There's some good shenanigans stories in the book about that. And, you know, sort of agreeing with the competitors down the road. If somebody's picketing at Stanley Furniture, then, you know, quietly shipping it in the middle of the night over to Bassett where it can be made because they realized that if the unions got a strong foothold, then everybody's wages are going to go up. DAVIES: Now, the industry grew up here in the Jim Crow South. What was the company's practice when it came to hiring blacks? MACY: Yeah, this was really interesting to me. There's a local historian here named John Kern who had did some work interviewing old black Basset Furniture workers. And he had put together that - one of the astonishing things was that right from the very beginning, J. D. Bassett hired African-Americans. His competition in North Carolina were sort of relegating them to saw-milling and sharecropping but he hired them to come in, which was - you know - it was better than sharecropping. It was better than working out in the fields. It was work indoors and it paid money. And he paid them at the beginning, according to the research, paid them half as much as the white workers made but it was - it was more than they had made before. And as a lot of people - a lot of the older black people in Henry County today will tell you, you know, it wasn't sharecropping, it was something and it allowed me to send my kids to college. DAVIES: The heart of this story, of course, is about the competition that these furniture manufacturers felt from overseas, particularly China. And that begin in the '80s I guess, as of course the Chinese Communist Party adopted a different posture towards capitalism and entrepreneurial activities in China. And when these Chinese firms started competing with these furniture manufacturers in Virginia and North Carolina, you ran across some folks that said that the American manufacturers let them into their plants and that's how they learned what to do - I mean, what consumers wanted, how the factories ran, even videotaped it in some cases. Was there a lot of that? MACY: I'm told there was. I mean, anecdote after anecdote - if you talk to just the regular people and the line workers - you know - one of my favorite quotes early on is Naomi Hodgmuse's (ph) mom coming home from work one day at Bassett and saying Naomi, what were all those little people doing at work today? You know, they were Chinese middle-managers. They were taking pictures of the line and trying to figure out how to replicate it back at home. DAVIES: And the American manufacturers let them in, why, because they were thinking there might be business with them? MACY: Well, yeah, they let them in - yeah - they let them in because - especially the finishing process, which is what separates a low-end from a medium and a high-end, you know, the more coats - they did need some expertise on that end. And it just became sort of this slippery slope. Once they let them in, once they started making it and then once the companies got sort of dependent on this cheaper product, that sort of made the furniture they were still making domestically - it made it less cost-effective. It made them less competitive all around. And then it just became sort of this tipping point, where what was once early on a blended strategy, all of a sudden, you know, then they're closing factories and they're making very little. DAVIES: When you say a blended strategy, you mean some manufacturers would both make and sell the furniture they make as well as buy - import Chinese furniture - and then sell it as their own, right? MACY: Correct, yes. DAVIES: But just back up a second - this furniture was coming in - it was cheaper, I assume, in great part because labor costs were much cheaper. They were underselling the American manufacturers. And how did the American manufacturers respond to the competition as it got really intense in the '90s? MACY: As it got really intense, I mean, you could look at Bassett Furniture. Their biggest store account JC Penney and they sold $80 million worth of furniture per year. And that was their hugest account and they had won a Supplier of the Year award in 1999 from them. But then their orders started decreasing and one of the things that Bassett did is they reengineered their furniture so they could make it cheaper. They actually cut their costs by a third to keep up with the deflation that was going on in the industry. And as they did that, the orders still kept disappearing. DAVIES: Now, as the Chinese got better and better at marketing their stuff in the United States, what was the effect on production in Virginia and North Carolina? How many factories closed? MACY: Yeah, so an estimated 300,000 workers lost their jobs in furniture and related industries. And if you look at Henry County alone, they basically - they all closed. There's one assembly plant that Bassett Furniture runs, where they manage to sort of build pieces - part of the components that come in that are imported and they - they'll do the finishing there. But it's basically gone. If you drive down Bassett today, all of the factories - just about all of the factories have been torn down. Some of them burned - some were burned because people were desperate. People were trying to steal the copper white wiring out to resell on the black market. And they're basically all gone. I mean, it's kind of ghost town now. DAVIES: Martinsville is a place you write about a lot. It's a city probably not many people know about. Tell us about it at its heyday and what became of it as these changes. . . MACY: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . Came about. MACY: In the '60s, they used to say of Martinsville that it had the most millionaires per capita in the country. And it was textile-based and furniture based. It was booming. I mean, it had the lowest unemployment rate maybe in the whole country. It was like 1 percent or lower. In fact, one of our favorite reporters at the Roanoke Times had gone down and done a series in 1963 that I unearthed and, you know, the lead was - you know - can't find somebody to serve food in the diner - what we really need is some unemployment. And it all just gradually went away - first the textiles and then the furniture. The last big factory to close was Stanley Furniture in 2010. And that's really when I started kind of looking into this. DAVIES: Yeah, this is a town very near the North Carolina border in southern Virginia. After all of these factories close - what was the impact on Martinsville? What was the level of unemployment? MACY: It's had the highest unemployment rate in the state for the last 10 years. At one point, it was almost up to 20 percent unemployment. But I asked the mayor of Martinsville - I said - you know - because the unemployment rate doesn't count the people who stop looking for work and whose benefits have run out. I asked and she was very - she wasn't very - she was a bit defensive. She was kind of used to everybody coming up and beating on poor Martinsville and I wanted to be fair. She said don't make us look like tumbleweeds or - you know - blowing through town. It's not that. I promise I didn't see a single tumbleweed. But when I asked her without - I said what do you think the true unemployment rate is? Without hesitating, she said one-third. And so then you go and you say what does that look like? You go to the food pantries and you see the people, you know, lining up two hours before it opens and you talk to them and they're former textile workers and former furniture workers. And, you know, those are the people - their unemployment's run out, maybe they're getting a little bit of Social Security. Maybe they're getting a little bit of food stamps but you don't have to go very far to see a real sort of palpable example of this unemployment rate. DAVIES: You've done a lot of ground-level reporting about the human impact of this industrial collapse. MACY: Yeah, yeah. I was looking into TAA, which is Trade Adjustment Assistance, from one of the early newspaper articles that I wrote about this issue. And I was looking at kind of why was it that only 30 percent of the people who qualified for TAA - and that's a long, decades-old federal government program that's supposed to help people get retrained - but only 30 percent, or maybe a little bit more, even actually take the TAA benefit. DAVIES: Beth Macy's book is \"Factory Man. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us our guest is writer Beth Macy. Her book about the decline of furniture manufacturing in Virginia and North Carolina and one man who fought against it is called \"Factory Man. \"The \"Factory Man\" from the title of your book is John Bassett the Third. A descendent of this, you know, Basset furniture family which of course operated for decades in this area he actually was in a story that you tell us in the book was muscled out by some of the relatives and had a different company - Vaughan-Bassett. But he responded to this competition in different ways. Tell us just a little bit about this guy. He's a fascinating character. MACY: Sure. The first time I heard about him I was having breakfast with my neighbor who happens to own a furniture store in that region and I just knew I was going to have to get deeply immersed into furniture. So it took him out to breakfast, not to interview him so much, but just to kind of learn what he knew about furniture and he tells me, you know, he tells me the whole story about globalization over two hours. But halfway through he goes, well, you know, there's still somebody making furniture and he's in Galax, Virginia, and he works at Vaughan-Bassett Furniture. I said, Bassett? And he said, yeah he's from the Bassett furniture family. Because I hadn't heard of Vaughan-Bassett furniture at the time - it's not a huge company - and it hadn't been hugely in the news in our paper. And he said, yeah he's still making furniture in America and when China came on the scene, you know. He said, things like the bleeping chai calms aren't going to tell me how to make furniture. I thought, woah, this is a character I really want to learn more about. And, you know, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and then once I heard that, you know, he was from Bassett originally and that there was also this sort of juicy family feud that had resulted in he who was born to run the whole business as a child being booted out in middle-age and landing at this much smaller, more privately held company and that was the perch that he took to take on China, you know, this little mountain hamlet better known for bluegrass and BBQ. You know, thought, wow - there's really a good story there. And then once I met him, you know, he's just an amazing sort of character out of Faulkner. He's just completely who he is. He's very confident, he's got this amazing accent and he's got that sort of like dumb-like-a-fox way of saying something that sounds really simple but it's just super smart, too. And so I got him to just kind of one interview at a time peel back the layers on how he had done it. DAVIES: One of the fascinating things about John Bassett the third, you write, is that he actually wanted to go to China and find the people that were copying the bedroom furniture - the Louis Philippe style bedroom furniture - that he'd done so well with, they were making it in China. He sends his son and somebody else they figured - well, why don't you tell the story. He ends up over there face-to-face with the guy. MACY: Sure. There's a dresser that's just come on the scene in the American market and it's a Louis Philippe Dresser. It's wholesaling for 100 bucks and he can't figure out how the heck they're able to sell it. They can't be making money, he says, he his engineer take it apart and deconstruct it piece by piece and price out the pieces and he knows they have to be dumping - which means selling it for the less than the price of the materials. So he sends his son Wyatt who's kind of his head business guy, he sends him and a Taiwanese translator who's a family friend to Dalian, because the sticker on the back only says Dalian China. It doesn't say exactly which factory it's from. And he sends them off to do sort of this secret spy mission - they're pretending that they're looking to buy but what they're really looking for is that one particular dresser and they find it. And, you know, after days and days of searching they finally end up in this remote section of the province almost to the border of North Korea and they find it there - and John says, you know, John has told him don't come home until you find it. And so then once they find out that there's this law on the books that could allow them to file an antidumping petition he says, I want to get eyeball to eyeball with the guy running Dalian Wafun (ph) which was the company. And so then they travel back there a second time and because he's the CEO of the company, the gentleman running Dalian Wafun actually meets with him and he has this sort of very chilly one-on-one dialogue with him that's all translated but the guy says, basically - close your factories - he's got three factories left at the time - close your three factories and let me make all your furniture for you. DAVIES: And this guy who was determined to close these American factories and quite blunt about it was also a Chinese Communist Party official, right? He was planning to build this huge complex and just saying, we're going to eat you alive. MACY: Right. And that we consider it the translated word, and John remembered it very well, was tuition. He just said it out loud. This is the tuition of us being able to capture your market share, we're going to sell it so cheap and with government subsidies we're going to be able to make all of your furniture for you. And then they ended up driving him out to this furniture industrial park out in the country - and there's just stacks and stacks of timber. And Wyatt said, you know, you didn't quite know whether to believe it was just a giant billboard expansion where they've got the billboard up and they say this huge thing is coming - but when he saw all that Russian timber there laid out they knew they were serious and they knew, like, whoa they were going to war. GROSS: Beth Macy will continue her interview with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in the second half of the show. Her new book is called \"Factory Man. \" I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Beth Macy, author of the new book \"Factory Man. \" It looks at America's industrial collapse by focusing on one family-owned furniture company in Virginia. Unlike the scores of furniture companies that closed in Virginia and North Carolina because of competition from China, John Bassett's family-owned company has managed to stay afloat. When we left off, Beth Macy was explaining that a dresser manufactured by Bassett was copied by a Chinese factory that was selling it below cost. When Bassett confronted the manager of the Chinese factory, the manager told Bassett, close your factory and let us make all your furniture. DAVIES: So John Bassett the Third decides he's going to fight back. And there are legal avenues he can pursue. Anti-dumping provisions - this can get a little technical, but what. . . MACY: It sure can. DAVIES: But what did he do? What did he have to prove, and what did he do? MACY: First, he had to get 51 percent of his industry together to join this coalition to present this case to the Department of Commerce. And then they would decide whether the case would go forward. Just to get 51 percent of his industry to agree that we're going to put some money down for lawyers to help with this - that was hard in itself because by that point, many of these companies were already importing a lot of furniture. And, you know, they were doing a blended strategy we talked about. And why would they support the petition because that would just result in them having to pay more? So there was that issue. And then, some people that jumped in early then backed out once some of their retailers dropped them because they were also selling imported furniture. So it became this very divisive thing in the industry. DAVIES: And just to be clear, what we're talking about - we're talking about him convincing the Commerce Department to investigate whether the Chinese were unfairly subsidizing this cheap furniture. And the result might ultimately be tariffs - right? - payments that would raise the cost. MACY: Not tariffs, but duties, actually. There's a difference. The result would be duties that would be added retroactively to the price of the furniture. But the first hurdle he had to reach - and it was huge - was that he had to convince 51 percent of the bedroom furniture makers to sign on board because the Commerce Department wouldn't even consider it until he had that much on board. And he had a really hard time. And what I'm trying to get at here is that when he puts his mind to something, he just does it. I mean, he was on the phone for days and days and days. And he loves to play hardball. So for instance, he calls his nephew Rob Spilman, who's the CEO of Bassett and says, you know, sure would hate to see people picketing Basset when they find out that there was a remedy for this the might of helped you keep more of your factories open. I mean, that's his nephew. That's the kind of hardball he plays. And he was able to get more than 51 percent. And then they had to raise all this money for the lawyers. And then, once the Commerce Department decided there was a case to go forward - then it got really ugly. And people took sides, and, you know, there was - the retailers were very upset about because they said, you know, we've been playing by the rules. We didn't see why they should change. We've invested a lot of money in this importing. And the same with, you know, the furniture companies that were now heavily, heavily invested. Every month, more and more companies were importing more because it was cheaper and they could make more profit on it. And the prices were going down, too. And they - a lot of them - they were in kind of tight spots. Like, I mean, Bassett would tell you, look, we're not a social experiment. We have shareholders that have to get profits. And if this is the only way we can do it, we've got to keep our company alive. That's their side of it. DAVIES: Right. They had a lot of these companies, like Bassett, that had been making furniture. They went to importing it and then retailing it and made profit that way. MACY: Right. DAVIES: So did it work? Did he get some duties imposed? Did they get revenue from this? MACY: (Laughing) Yes. They got duties imposed eventually. The U. S. ITC - International Trade Commission - voted in favor of the coalition in 2005 and again in 2000 because the lawyers convinced them that the Chinese were dumping and that it was harming American workers. DAVIES: But this happened after scores of factories had already closed, right? And the duties weren't the kind of thing that were going to completely turn around these struggling companies. It helped, but wasn't transformative, right? MACY: Right, right. It helped people like John Bassett who were totally committed to staying a domestic manufacturer. He - at one point, he was importing eight to 10 percent of his goods, and now he's importing zero. And it's helped him keep his factory going. It's helped him - he's taken the millions that he's gotten through those duties and reinvested them into really high-tech Italian- and German-made equipment. And he has been able to kind of reconstruct his factory in many ways. Every little corner gets kind of re-engineered all the time, always with an eye toward efficiency and, you know, keeping the prices low to compete with the imports. He's been able to succeed - not hugely successfully, but he's been able to keep his nose above the water. And he's got a lot of pride and a lot of legacy in it, but he's also worked really hard. He's done a lot of other things, too. DAVIES: So he did all of these innovative things, but we should also note he didn't take a salary for all of these years, right? And when times got tough, he would ask his salespeople to kind of trim their commissions. He would ask suppliers to give him breaks. He really worked hard to keep it all going. How many people is he employing in manufacturing? Do we know? MACY: He employs 700 people now. And he has promised the town that they're going to be hiring more people. Just last year - maybe it was in '12 - they reopened a vacant plant next door and christened it Vaughan-Bassett II. And they're trying to get ready. The housing market still hasn't come back up from the recession. I mean, it's kind of been the last thing to come back. And, you know, he was telling me this week that he had just read something - that wasn't really going to come fully black till 2017. Last year, he broke even. This year, I think he's a little bit behind, but as he points out, we have a ballot sheet at the rock of Gibraltar. You know, he's been very frugal. He's - he calls it Bassett 101 - you know, the techniques he learned from his father and his grandfather, in terms of, you know, having a lot of money in the bank and being very careful with his investments. And he's just determined he's going to keep that factory going because when the economy does come back and housing starts to improve, he's going to be poised to be what he calls the last girl standing on the desert island. You know, he's going to out-wait everybody. He's going to be the last guy. And he's going to get the business because no matter how good-looking you are, it doesn't matter. If you're the last one standing, you are going to get the business. DAVIES: Beth Macy's book is \"Factory Man. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. DAVIES: We're speaking with Beth Macy, her book is called \"Factory Man. \" So, looking at the big picture here, John Bassett the Third has managed through, you know, dent of lawsuit and an enormous kind of effort and innovation to keep 700 people employed in furniture manufacturing. How does that fit into the overall picture? Is most of the furniture industry gone now? MACY: Most of the industry is gone, yes. As far as jobs there just isn't much there. DAVIES: When you look at this region of Virginia and North Carolina where all of these furniture plants were so, so active and employed so many people, you know, they took the business from Michigan which had had it in the mid-turn-of-the-century and the folks in Michigan took it from Boston. And the people from Boston took the business from England before them and, you know, in every case the folks who won the jobs were folks who made products that were better and cheaper for consumers who benefited and in every case the folks left behind experienced, you know, the suffering of unemployment. And I guess it raises the question of - can you have the benefits of a market economy without experiencing some of this kind of pain? MACY: Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say, well, they just move elsewhere to a community where there's more work. But a lot of them don't have the money to move elsewhere. And maybe they take care of an elderly relative and they don't have those kind of options to leave that you and I would just think, well, certainly why wouldn't they moved to Roanoke and work there? They don't have those options by and large. DAVIES: So is it a matter of, you know, government doing a better job of taking care of those who are going through these terrible wrenching transitions, providing the kind of assistance they need? Or is it just a matter you telling these stories? MACY: (Laughing) I think it's both. I do argue that the T. A. A. - trade adjustment assistance program - could be redone in a way that would fit better with these worker's lives. I went to one of the training sessions and I was just appalled by it by, you know, I remember they were describing the rules, like, if you're taking this T. A. A. money we don't want to call you and find out you've gone on vacation instead of going to school. And the woman sitting next to me went - vacation? I'm worried about I'm about to lose my house. You know, there just seemed to me a real disconnect. And the other point I wanted to make, Dave, was that when there was all of this debate in the late '90s and President Clinton and economists and business schools were saying, you know, we should let China join the WTO because it won't result in job losses, it'll result in, you know, gains because we'll be able to export more goods for the growing consumer class in China. It just didn't materialize because of some of the issues that we talk about in the book - because of the dumping, because of the Chinese subsidies, because they're playing by different rules than we are in terms of EPA and OSHA and it just never happened. DAVIES: So free trade has to be based on fair competition. MACY: Legal trade, I mean, I think one of the things we could do is take a hard look at a manufacturing policy in this country the way China and Japan and Germany have done to, you know, they have big government offices that really promote keeping jobs in their countries. Their wages are higher than ours, they have double the manufacturing that we have in Germany because they've realized that if you're not making something, it's hard for your overall economy to be strong. You know, they say every dollar spent by a factory worker you can multiply it by a factor of seven and you could argue that, you know, this really hit big in the '90s and we haven't been on a huge growth spurts since the furniture factory started closing down. It's better for the economy when we make things. DAVIES: Well, Beth Macy congratulations on the book. Thanks so much for speaking with us. MACY: Thank you so much, really appreciate it. GROSS: Beth Macy spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who's also senior reporter at WHYY. Macy's new book is called \"Factory Man. \" You can read an excerpt on our website freshair. npr. org. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Visit the town of Basset in Southern Virginia and you'll find some of the downtown streetlights are dark. The lamps, maintained by the once prosperous Bassett Furniture company are now funded by voluntary contributions from residents and businesses when they can afford it. Bassett is just one of many towns and cities in Virginia and North Carolina where scores of furniture making plants have closed in the past 20 years, mostly due to competition from China and other foreign countries. Our guest, Beth Macy, has a new book which documents the collapse of the American furniture industry and its human cost and profiles one determined owner who fought back against the foreign onslaught - both by filing anti-dumping charges against Chinese firms with the U. S. International Trade Commission and by making his own company more competitive. Beth Macy worked for years as a reporter for the Roanoke Times and she's also written for national magazines. She's received several national awards, including Nieman Fellowship at Harvard. She spoke to FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies about her book \"Factory Man: How One Furniture Maker Battled Offshoring, Stayed Local And Helped Save An American Town. \" DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  Beth Macy, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, this is a story of - a remarkable story of reporting. But it's clear you feel a personal connection to it in a lot of ways. Tell us a little bit just about your parents, your background, your childhood. BETH MACY: Sure. I grew up in a factory town - Urbana, Ohio. I was the fourth of - by a long shot - of my parents and my mom worked in the airplane light factory called Grimes. And my dad was a house painter. He was often unemployed by the time I came along. And he was an alcoholic and my mom really kept the family together by working in the factory when the economy was good. You know, this is like the '70s and when the economy wasn't good, she would get laid off and so I, you know, I know what that felt like to some of the conversations around the dinner table about, you know, whether our gas might be cut off or, you know, how the bills were going to get paid. So when I became a journalist, I gravitated to those kinds of stories of what I call outsiders and underdogs. I didn't, like, intentionally gravitate to them but after about 15 years, it hit me that, you know, those were the stories I wrote the best. DAVIES: Now, the man at the center of this story, John Bassett III, is a descendent of a long established family of Virginia and North Carolina furniture makers - that is to say factories that made furniture's. Tell us a little bit about the Bassett company - kind of what it made him - what kind of relationship it had with its employees over the decades. MACY: Sure. It began in 1902. It was started by John D. Bassett Sr. and they came out of the Civil War sort of cash poor and land rich. He was a very kind of wily saw-miller. He had a lot of land, a lot of trees on the land. And he decided when he heard the railroad was coming through Henry County, that he would open a sawmill so he could sell the railroad the ties for the land. And he built a little store and had a boarding house where the railroad workers could stay and buy their food and whatnot. I mean, he was always kind of one step ahead and as, you know, the railroad was built, he realized that hey - why are we sending all of our lumber up to the furniture companies in New York and Michigan? I think we could do that ourselves. And actually he and his wife were on a buying trip in, you know, 1900 - the family lore is that it was actually his wife Miss Pokey's idea to kind of poke around and see how the factory there was organized and come back and try to do that in their own front yard. And as it turned out, they built a factory in their front yard. DAVIES: Right, Miss Pokey - short for Pocahontas - which was her name. And so he runs the factory for decades and there are other factories and they are run by descendants of this family for decades. And there's the town of Bassett. What was its relationship with the company? MACY: Right. The town of Bassett was never incorporated. So it's a classic company town, built to support the company. I mean, they had to bring workers in from the countryside to work in the factories and they had to provide housing - so they built houses. The rent was deducted from their paychecks. And, you know, there wasn't a town Council - there was Bassett Furniture industries. And you actually paid your power bill up until the '70s, I think it was, at Bassett Furniture industries. The company ran everything. DAVIES: They ran the church, right, the post office? MACY: (Laughing) There were two churches. The family started out Baptist but they quickly realized if they were bringing all these people in from the hillside, that they better branch off and have Methodist too, just to give them a little variety. So C. C. went off and started the Methodist church and J. D. Bassett started Pocahontas Bassett Baptist Church and, you know, just for a little variety. DAVIES: And these weren't owners that lived far away and clipped coupons. I mean, they were very much involved in the industrial process, knew workers' names, right? MACY: Exactly. One of my favorite stories is during the depression, a lot of the North Carolina furniture makers were going out of business and one of the things that J. D. Bassett vowed to do was not to lay anybody off - and he didn't. And he knew these workers. And one of the things he did was he went around to all of the factories because he knew he had to cut people's hours back, but he didn't want to do it willy-nilly. So he found out how many people were in your family, so he cut back your hours according to that so you could still make a living and, you know, eke out an existence. You could still have a job and when the economy came back, you know, they were all ready for, you know, the postwar boom. Then they could really take off. But, you know, during the depression, instead of bonuses, everybody got a ham. DAVIES: Wow. So they were tough people but they did care about their folks - resolutely opposed to unions and kept them out. MACY: Right, right. There's some good shenanigans stories in the book about that. And, you know, sort of agreeing with the competitors down the road. If somebody's picketing at Stanley Furniture, then, you know, quietly shipping it in the middle of the night over to Bassett where it can be made because they realized that if the unions got a strong foothold, then everybody's wages are going to go up. DAVIES: Now, the industry grew up here in the Jim Crow South. What was the company's practice when it came to hiring blacks? MACY: Yeah, this was really interesting to me. There's a local historian here named John Kern who had did some work interviewing old black Basset Furniture workers. And he had put together that - one of the astonishing things was that right from the very beginning, J. D. Bassett hired African-Americans. His competition in North Carolina were sort of relegating them to saw-milling and sharecropping but he hired them to come in, which was - you know - it was better than sharecropping. It was better than working out in the fields. It was work indoors and it paid money. And he paid them at the beginning, according to the research, paid them half as much as the white workers made but it was - it was more than they had made before. And as a lot of people - a lot of the older black people in Henry County today will tell you, you know, it wasn't sharecropping, it was something and it allowed me to send my kids to college. DAVIES: The heart of this story, of course, is about the competition that these furniture manufacturers felt from overseas, particularly China. And that begin in the '80s I guess, as of course the Chinese Communist Party adopted a different posture towards capitalism and entrepreneurial activities in China. And when these Chinese firms started competing with these furniture manufacturers in Virginia and North Carolina, you ran across some folks that said that the American manufacturers let them into their plants and that's how they learned what to do - I mean, what consumers wanted, how the factories ran, even videotaped it in some cases. Was there a lot of that? MACY: I'm told there was. I mean, anecdote after anecdote - if you talk to just the regular people and the line workers - you know - one of my favorite quotes early on is Naomi Hodgmuse's (ph) mom coming home from work one day at Bassett and saying Naomi, what were all those little people doing at work today? You know, they were Chinese middle-managers. They were taking pictures of the line and trying to figure out how to replicate it back at home. DAVIES: And the American manufacturers let them in, why, because they were thinking there might be business with them? MACY: Well, yeah, they let them in - yeah - they let them in because - especially the finishing process, which is what separates a low-end from a medium and a high-end, you know, the more coats - they did need some expertise on that end. And it just became sort of this slippery slope. Once they let them in, once they started making it and then once the companies got sort of dependent on this cheaper product, that sort of made the furniture they were still making domestically - it made it less cost-effective. It made them less competitive all around. And then it just became sort of this tipping point, where what was once early on a blended strategy, all of a sudden, you know, then they're closing factories and they're making very little. DAVIES: When you say a blended strategy, you mean some manufacturers would both make and sell the furniture they make as well as buy - import Chinese furniture - and then sell it as their own, right? MACY: Correct, yes. DAVIES: But just back up a second - this furniture was coming in - it was cheaper, I assume, in great part because labor costs were much cheaper. They were underselling the American manufacturers. And how did the American manufacturers respond to the competition as it got really intense in the '90s? MACY: As it got really intense, I mean, you could look at Bassett Furniture. Their biggest store account JC Penney and they sold $80 million worth of furniture per year. And that was their hugest account and they had won a Supplier of the Year award in 1999 from them. But then their orders started decreasing and one of the things that Bassett did is they reengineered their furniture so they could make it cheaper. They actually cut their costs by a third to keep up with the deflation that was going on in the industry. And as they did that, the orders still kept disappearing. DAVIES: Now, as the Chinese got better and better at marketing their stuff in the United States, what was the effect on production in Virginia and North Carolina? How many factories closed? MACY: Yeah, so an estimated 300,000 workers lost their jobs in furniture and related industries. And if you look at Henry County alone, they basically - they all closed. There's one assembly plant that Bassett Furniture runs, where they manage to sort of build pieces - part of the components that come in that are imported and they - they'll do the finishing there. But it's basically gone. If you drive down Bassett today, all of the factories - just about all of the factories have been torn down. Some of them burned - some were burned because people were desperate. People were trying to steal the copper white wiring out to resell on the black market. And they're basically all gone. I mean, it's kind of ghost town now. DAVIES: Martinsville is a place you write about a lot. It's a city probably not many people know about. Tell us about it at its heyday and what became of it as these changes. . . MACY: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . Came about. MACY: In the '60s, they used to say of Martinsville that it had the most millionaires per capita in the country. And it was textile-based and furniture based. It was booming. I mean, it had the lowest unemployment rate maybe in the whole country. It was like 1 percent or lower. In fact, one of our favorite reporters at the Roanoke Times had gone down and done a series in 1963 that I unearthed and, you know, the lead was - you know - can't find somebody to serve food in the diner - what we really need is some unemployment. And it all just gradually went away - first the textiles and then the furniture. The last big factory to close was Stanley Furniture in 2010. And that's really when I started kind of looking into this. DAVIES: Yeah, this is a town very near the North Carolina border in southern Virginia. After all of these factories close - what was the impact on Martinsville? What was the level of unemployment? MACY: It's had the highest unemployment rate in the state for the last 10 years. At one point, it was almost up to 20 percent unemployment. But I asked the mayor of Martinsville - I said - you know - because the unemployment rate doesn't count the people who stop looking for work and whose benefits have run out. I asked and she was very - she wasn't very - she was a bit defensive. She was kind of used to everybody coming up and beating on poor Martinsville and I wanted to be fair. She said don't make us look like tumbleweeds or - you know - blowing through town. It's not that. I promise I didn't see a single tumbleweed. But when I asked her without - I said what do you think the true unemployment rate is? Without hesitating, she said one-third. And so then you go and you say what does that look like? You go to the food pantries and you see the people, you know, lining up two hours before it opens and you talk to them and they're former textile workers and former furniture workers. And, you know, those are the people - their unemployment's run out, maybe they're getting a little bit of Social Security. Maybe they're getting a little bit of food stamps but you don't have to go very far to see a real sort of palpable example of this unemployment rate. DAVIES: You've done a lot of ground-level reporting about the human impact of this industrial collapse. MACY: Yeah, yeah. I was looking into TAA, which is Trade Adjustment Assistance, from one of the early newspaper articles that I wrote about this issue. And I was looking at kind of why was it that only 30 percent of the people who qualified for TAA - and that's a long, decades-old federal government program that's supposed to help people get retrained - but only 30 percent, or maybe a little bit more, even actually take the TAA benefit. DAVIES: Beth Macy's book is \"Factory Man. \" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us our guest is writer Beth Macy. Her book about the decline of furniture manufacturing in Virginia and North Carolina and one man who fought against it is called \"Factory Man. \" The \"Factory Man\" from the title of your book is John Bassett the Third. A descendent of this, you know, Basset furniture family which of course operated for decades in this area he actually was in a story that you tell us in the book was muscled out by some of the relatives and had a different company - Vaughan-Bassett. But he responded to this competition in different ways. Tell us just a little bit about this guy. He's a fascinating character. MACY: Sure. The first time I heard about him I was having breakfast with my neighbor who happens to own a furniture store in that region and I just knew I was going to have to get deeply immersed into furniture. So it took him out to breakfast, not to interview him so much, but just to kind of learn what he knew about furniture and he tells me, you know, he tells me the whole story about globalization over two hours. But halfway through he goes, well, you know, there's still somebody making furniture and he's in Galax, Virginia, and he works at Vaughan-Bassett Furniture. I said, Bassett? And he said, yeah he's from the Bassett furniture family. Because I hadn't heard of Vaughan-Bassett furniture at the time - it's not a huge company - and it hadn't been hugely in the news in our paper. And he said, yeah he's still making furniture in America and when China came on the scene, you know. He said, things like the bleeping chai calms aren't going to tell me how to make furniture. I thought, woah, this is a character I really want to learn more about. And, you know, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and then once I heard that, you know, he was from Bassett originally and that there was also this sort of juicy family feud that had resulted in he who was born to run the whole business as a child being booted out in middle-age and landing at this much smaller, more privately held company and that was the perch that he took to take on China, you know, this little mountain hamlet better known for bluegrass and BBQ. You know, thought, wow - there's really a good story there. And then once I met him, you know, he's just an amazing sort of character out of Faulkner. He's just completely who he is. He's very confident, he's got this amazing accent and he's got that sort of like dumb-like-a-fox way of saying something that sounds really simple but it's just super smart, too. And so I got him to just kind of one interview at a time peel back the layers on how he had done it. DAVIES: One of the fascinating things about John Bassett the third, you write, is that he actually wanted to go to China and find the people that were copying the bedroom furniture - the Louis Philippe style bedroom furniture - that he'd done so well with, they were making it in China. He sends his son and somebody else they figured - well, why don't you tell the story. He ends up over there face-to-face with the guy. MACY: Sure. There's a dresser that's just come on the scene in the American market and it's a Louis Philippe Dresser. It's wholesaling for 100 bucks and he can't figure out how the heck they're able to sell it. They can't be making money, he says, he his engineer take it apart and deconstruct it piece by piece and price out the pieces and he knows they have to be dumping - which means selling it for the less than the price of the materials. So he sends his son Wyatt who's kind of his head business guy, he sends him and a Taiwanese translator who's a family friend to Dalian, because the sticker on the back only says Dalian China. It doesn't say exactly which factory it's from. And he sends them off to do sort of this secret spy mission - they're pretending that they're looking to buy but what they're really looking for is that one particular dresser and they find it. And, you know, after days and days of searching they finally end up in this remote section of the province almost to the border of North Korea and they find it there - and John says, you know, John has told him don't come home until you find it. And so then once they find out that there's this law on the books that could allow them to file an antidumping petition he says, I want to get eyeball to eyeball with the guy running Dalian Wafun (ph) which was the company. And so then they travel back there a second time and because he's the CEO of the company, the gentleman running Dalian Wafun actually meets with him and he has this sort of very chilly one-on-one dialogue with him that's all translated but the guy says, basically - close your factories - he's got three factories left at the time - close your three factories and let me make all your furniture for you. DAVIES: And this guy who was determined to close these American factories and quite blunt about it was also a Chinese Communist Party official, right? He was planning to build this huge complex and just saying, we're going to eat you alive. MACY: Right. And that we consider it the translated word, and John remembered it very well, was tuition. He just said it out loud. This is the tuition of us being able to capture your market share, we're going to sell it so cheap and with government subsidies we're going to be able to make all of your furniture for you. And then they ended up driving him out to this furniture industrial park out in the country - and there's just stacks and stacks of timber. And Wyatt said, you know, you didn't quite know whether to believe it was just a giant billboard expansion where they've got the billboard up and they say this huge thing is coming - but when he saw all that Russian timber there laid out they knew they were serious and they knew, like, whoa they were going to war. GROSS: Beth Macy will continue her interview with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in the second half of the show. Her new book is called \"Factory Man. \" I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Beth Macy, author of the new book \"Factory Man. \" It looks at America's industrial collapse by focusing on one family-owned furniture company in Virginia. Unlike the scores of furniture companies that closed in Virginia and North Carolina because of competition from China, John Bassett's family-owned company has managed to stay afloat. When we left off, Beth Macy was explaining that a dresser manufactured by Bassett was copied by a Chinese factory that was selling it below cost. When Bassett confronted the manager of the Chinese factory, the manager told Bassett, close your factory and let us make all your furniture. DAVIES: So John Bassett the Third decides he's going to fight back. And there are legal avenues he can pursue. Anti-dumping provisions - this can get a little technical, but what. . . MACY: It sure can. DAVIES: But what did he do? What did he have to prove, and what did he do? MACY: First, he had to get 51 percent of his industry together to join this coalition to present this case to the Department of Commerce. And then they would decide whether the case would go forward. Just to get 51 percent of his industry to agree that we're going to put some money down for lawyers to help with this - that was hard in itself because by that point, many of these companies were already importing a lot of furniture. And, you know, they were doing a blended strategy we talked about. And why would they support the petition because that would just result in them having to pay more? So there was that issue. And then, some people that jumped in early then backed out once some of their retailers dropped them because they were also selling imported furniture. So it became this very divisive thing in the industry. DAVIES: And just to be clear, what we're talking about - we're talking about him convincing the Commerce Department to investigate whether the Chinese were unfairly subsidizing this cheap furniture. And the result might ultimately be tariffs - right? - payments that would raise the cost. MACY: Not tariffs, but duties, actually. There's a difference. The result would be duties that would be added retroactively to the price of the furniture. But the first hurdle he had to reach - and it was huge - was that he had to convince 51 percent of the bedroom furniture makers to sign on board because the Commerce Department wouldn't even consider it until he had that much on board. And he had a really hard time. And what I'm trying to get at here is that when he puts his mind to something, he just does it. I mean, he was on the phone for days and days and days. And he loves to play hardball. So for instance, he calls his nephew Rob Spilman, who's the CEO of Bassett and says, you know, sure would hate to see people picketing Basset when they find out that there was a remedy for this the might of helped you keep more of your factories open. I mean, that's his nephew. That's the kind of hardball he plays. And he was able to get more than 51 percent. And then they had to raise all this money for the lawyers. And then, once the Commerce Department decided there was a case to go forward - then it got really ugly. And people took sides, and, you know, there was - the retailers were very upset about because they said, you know, we've been playing by the rules. We didn't see why they should change. We've invested a lot of money in this importing. And the same with, you know, the furniture companies that were now heavily, heavily invested. Every month, more and more companies were importing more because it was cheaper and they could make more profit on it. And the prices were going down, too. And they - a lot of them - they were in kind of tight spots. Like, I mean, Bassett would tell you, look, we're not a social experiment. We have shareholders that have to get profits. And if this is the only way we can do it, we've got to keep our company alive. That's their side of it. DAVIES: Right. They had a lot of these companies, like Bassett, that had been making furniture. They went to importing it and then retailing it and made profit that way. MACY: Right. DAVIES: So did it work? Did he get some duties imposed? Did they get revenue from this? MACY: (Laughing) Yes. They got duties imposed eventually. The U. S. ITC - International Trade Commission - voted in favor of the coalition in 2005 and again in 2000 because the lawyers convinced them that the Chinese were dumping and that it was harming American workers. DAVIES: But this happened after scores of factories had already closed, right? And the duties weren't the kind of thing that were going to completely turn around these struggling companies. It helped, but wasn't transformative, right? MACY: Right, right. It helped people like John Bassett who were totally committed to staying a domestic manufacturer. He - at one point, he was importing eight to 10 percent of his goods, and now he's importing zero. And it's helped him keep his factory going. It's helped him - he's taken the millions that he's gotten through those duties and reinvested them into really high-tech Italian- and German-made equipment. And he has been able to kind of reconstruct his factory in many ways. Every little corner gets kind of re-engineered all the time, always with an eye toward efficiency and, you know, keeping the prices low to compete with the imports. He's been able to succeed - not hugely successfully, but he's been able to keep his nose above the water. And he's got a lot of pride and a lot of legacy in it, but he's also worked really hard. He's done a lot of other things, too. DAVIES: So he did all of these innovative things, but we should also note he didn't take a salary for all of these years, right? And when times got tough, he would ask his salespeople to kind of trim their commissions. He would ask suppliers to give him breaks. He really worked hard to keep it all going. How many people is he employing in manufacturing? Do we know? MACY: He employs 700 people now. And he has promised the town that they're going to be hiring more people. Just last year - maybe it was in '12 - they reopened a vacant plant next door and christened it Vaughan-Bassett II. And they're trying to get ready. The housing market still hasn't come back up from the recession. I mean, it's kind of been the last thing to come back. And, you know, he was telling me this week that he had just read something - that wasn't really going to come fully black till 2017. Last year, he broke even. This year, I think he's a little bit behind, but as he points out, we have a ballot sheet at the rock of Gibraltar. You know, he's been very frugal. He's - he calls it Bassett 101 - you know, the techniques he learned from his father and his grandfather, in terms of, you know, having a lot of money in the bank and being very careful with his investments. And he's just determined he's going to keep that factory going because when the economy does come back and housing starts to improve, he's going to be poised to be what he calls the last girl standing on the desert island. You know, he's going to out-wait everybody. He's going to be the last guy. And he's going to get the business because no matter how good-looking you are, it doesn't matter. If you're the last one standing, you are going to get the business. DAVIES: Beth Macy's book is \"Factory Man. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. DAVIES: We're speaking with Beth Macy, her book is called \"Factory Man. \" So, looking at the big picture here, John Bassett the Third has managed through, you know, dent of lawsuit and an enormous kind of effort and innovation to keep 700 people employed in furniture manufacturing. How does that fit into the overall picture? Is most of the furniture industry gone now? MACY: Most of the industry is gone, yes. As far as jobs there just isn't much there. DAVIES: When you look at this region of Virginia and North Carolina where all of these furniture plants were so, so active and employed so many people, you know, they took the business from Michigan which had had it in the mid-turn-of-the-century and the folks in Michigan took it from Boston. And the people from Boston took the business from England before them and, you know, in every case the folks who won the jobs were folks who made products that were better and cheaper for consumers who benefited and in every case the folks left behind experienced, you know, the suffering of unemployment. And I guess it raises the question of - can you have the benefits of a market economy without experiencing some of this kind of pain? MACY: Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say, well, they just move elsewhere to a community where there's more work. But a lot of them don't have the money to move elsewhere. And maybe they take care of an elderly relative and they don't have those kind of options to leave that you and I would just think, well, certainly why wouldn't they moved to Roanoke and work there? They don't have those options by and large. DAVIES: So is it a matter of, you know, government doing a better job of taking care of those who are going through these terrible wrenching transitions, providing the kind of assistance they need? Or is it just a matter you telling these stories? MACY: (Laughing) I think it's both. I do argue that the T. A. A. - trade adjustment assistance program - could be redone in a way that would fit better with these worker's lives. I went to one of the training sessions and I was just appalled by it by, you know, I remember they were describing the rules, like, if you're taking this T. A. A. money we don't want to call you and find out you've gone on vacation instead of going to school. And the woman sitting next to me went - vacation? I'm worried about I'm about to lose my house. You know, there just seemed to me a real disconnect. And the other point I wanted to make, Dave, was that when there was all of this debate in the late '90s and President Clinton and economists and business schools were saying, you know, we should let China join the WTO because it won't result in job losses, it'll result in, you know, gains because we'll be able to export more goods for the growing consumer class in China. It just didn't materialize because of some of the issues that we talk about in the book - because of the dumping, because of the Chinese subsidies, because they're playing by different rules than we are in terms of EPA and OSHA and it just never happened. DAVIES: So free trade has to be based on fair competition. MACY: Legal trade, I mean, I think one of the things we could do is take a hard look at a manufacturing policy in this country the way China and Japan and Germany have done to, you know, they have big government offices that really promote keeping jobs in their countries. Their wages are higher than ours, they have double the manufacturing that we have in Germany because they've realized that if you're not making something, it's hard for your overall economy to be strong. You know, they say every dollar spent by a factory worker you can multiply it by a factor of seven and you could argue that, you know, this really hit big in the '90s and we haven't been on a huge growth spurts since the furniture factory started closing down. It's better for the economy when we make things. DAVIES: Well, Beth Macy congratulations on the book. Thanks so much for speaking with us. MACY: Thank you so much, really appreciate it.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Twice a year the head of the Federal Reserve is required to report to Congress on how the U. S. economy is doing, and for the last several years the people who listen in on this testimony have strained their ears for any hint of whether interest rates might be going up. Well, today, more straining, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee that despite some recent brightening in the economy, the benchmark rate won't be going up anytime soon. Here is NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Fed policymakers have held the federal funds rate near zero since 2008, trying to spur economic growth. And Yellen said progress has been made. She noted that over the past six months, job growth has averaged 230,000 a month. And she said the economy is making progress towards the Fed's goals of full employment and inflation of around 2 percent. But, she said, it's still too soon to begin raising rates. JANET YELLEN: We need to be careful to make sure that the economy is on a solid trajectory before we consider raising interest rates. YDSTIE: Yellen reminded lawmakers that the economy has had several false starts when many were convinced it was picking up steam, only to see it slow again. Still, senators like Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho pressed Yellen for a date when the Fed might move. SENATOR MIKE CRAPO: When do you currently anticipate this first rate hike to occur? YDSTIE: Yellen said Fed officials have not agreed on a time frame, however, she pointed to forecasts made by Fed policymakers that show most expect rates to start rising sometime in 2015. New York Democrat Charles Schumer counseled Yellen not to move too fast. CONGRESSMAN CHARLES SCHUMER: To me, the greatest problem this country still faces is lack of good paying jobs, decline of middle-class incomes. YELLEN: I certainly agree and tried to emphasize that while we're making progress in the labor market, we haven't achieved our goal. YDSTIE: After all, Yellen said, unemployment remains elevated at 6. 1 percent, and some of the unemployed continue to drop out of the workforce because they can't find jobs. While Schumer and other Democrats urged Yellen to keep rates low, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma represented the Republican view that extremely low rates are dangerous and are starting to create bubbles in financial markets. SENATOR TOM COBURN: Zero interest rate policy is tending to make people reach for a yield now and is an impetus toward bubble creation in certain asset classes. YELLEN: Well, it can be, and that's why we're watching very carefully. YDSTIE: But, Yellen said, raising interest rates is not the answer because that could stall the recovery. In fact, the Fed is doing more than just watching for bubbles. Yellen used her testimony today to highlight concerns the Fed has that some smaller firms in the social media and biotech sectors are overvalued. That took the wind out of a morning rally in the stock market, particularly on the NASDAQ exchange where tech stocks are concentrated. Yellen did reiterate that so far the Fed doesn't see a bubble in the broader financial markets. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

Today across 43 states, the District of Columbia and several territories, people wager more than $56 billion a year on lotteries. The take for state governments is about a third of that. In many states, lottery revenues exceed revenue from corporate income taxes. As Steve Tripoli reports, the big winners in that equation include politicians who gets money for government services without having to raise taxes and another big winner - the non-gambling public. STEVE TRIPOLI, BYLINE: The machine spitting out lottery betting slips is busy this midday Monday at Santo Domingo Liquors in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The store has two cash registers. Only the lottery register has a line when I arrive. Elizabeth Correia, eight months pregnant, is running that register with her mother. Her family owns the store. ELIZABETH CORREIA: We do this seven days a week, seven days a week. My mom - sometimes she'll do it open to closing. TRIPOLI: Santo Domingo Liquors took in $1,237,000 in lottery bets last year. It's Lawrence's fifth largest lottery vendor. With 77,000 people, this mostly poor city has 78 lottery outlets - one for every thousand residents. In convenience stores, liquor stores, gas stations, bars and restaurants. CORREIA: (Spanish spoken). TRIPOLI: Ay ay ay, you again, Elizabeth Correia jokes as she rings up a lottery regular. He's an elderly man who speak Spanish and won't give his name to a guy with a microphone. I ask how often he plays. (Spanish spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Spanish spoken). TRIPOLI: (Spanish spoken). Seven days a week. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Spanish spoken). TRIPOLI: He allows that he's just want $200. Correia says that may explain why he didn't want to give his name. But now he's turned $44 of his winnings into new bets. Correia says that's not uncommon for winners. She points to a table where gamblers fill in their numbers or scratch their scratch tickets. CORREIA: They buy it. They go over there. They scratch it. They come back over here, cash it in, we - you know, and then we sell them some more and they go back, scratch it, come over here, cash them, buy more. TRIPOLI: Constant re-betting cuts the payback from lotteries significantly, and the official payback rate's not that good. Massachusetts returns, on average, about 73 percent of every bet - the highest of any lottery but still dramatically worse than the 90 plus percent payback of most casino games. Why would anyone play such bad odds? With thousands of outlets in each state - Massachusetts has 7,400 - economists say the sheer availability of lotteries gives them a decisive market edge. Cornell University economics and management professor David Just offers another reason why gamblers bite. DAVID JUST: What appears to be happening is that they really believe that there's going to be a return on this investment. TRIPOLI: Just and his colleagues crunched lottery data from 39 states. He says many people, especially the less educated, simply don't understand how abysmal their chances are. Even if everyone did understand, Just says his research shows why some still might play. JUST: It's the desperation play. People don't treat it like entertainment. Instead, those - particularly those who are poor are treating this more as an investment opportunity. It's their hail-mary pass to try and make it big. TRIPOLI: Lottery officials around the country insist that for most players, lotteries really are just entertainment. And with play involuntary, no one's targeted. That may be true, but Just says one other thing jumped out from his research. JUST: To me, the astounding thing was looking at how much the prevalence of people down around the poverty rate - particularly people who are on different forms of welfare - that those really did correlate so tightly with lottery play. TRIPOLI: Studies from the Carolinas to California, Illinois and Connecticut echo that. At least some lotteries acknowledge their market indirectly. An Ohio marketing plan once suggested that lottery ads be timed to coincide with the receipt of government benefits. Lottery advertising - and in many states there's a lot of it - favors friendlier themes. This TV spot from Oregon soothingly tells the services lottery profits by. (SOUNDBITE OF TV AD)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Introducing Cottonwood Canyon, funded in part with 13 million lottery dollars, providing recreational adventure for generations of Oregonians to come. The Oregon Lottery - it does good things. TRIPOLI: Lottery revenues do fund good things - recreation, education and public safety. And the majority who hardly ever gamble get those services without paying full cost. For the gamblers, opportunities are multiplying. Under competitive pressure, the people who run state lotteries keep launching new games, new advertising, new price points and juiced-up payouts. Back at Santo Domingo Liquors, a display case holds an array of 44 scratch tickets. There's one for every budget - $1, $2, 5, 10, 20. Owner Elizabeth Correia pulls out another one. CORREIA: We got the $30 ticket. TRIPOLI: Say that again. CORREIA: $30 ticket. TRIPOLI: Is that new? CORREIA: Yes. TRIPOLI: How new is that? CORREIA: About - what? - two, three weeks - less than a month. TRIPOLI: The $30 world-class millions scratch ticket is the state's newest. Massachusetts is simply keeping up with the six other states that have rolled out $30 tickets in recent months. Every state lottery website has a link to counseling for problem gamblers, but the flow of cash from these games raises questions about whether state governments are becoming a different sort of gambling addict.

TRIPOLI: Studies from the Carolinas to California, Illinois and Connecticut echo that. At least some lotteries acknowledge their market indirectly. An Ohio marketing plan once suggested that lottery ads be timed to coincide with the receipt of government benefits. Lottery advertising - and in many states there's a lot of it - favors friendlier themes. This TV spot from Oregon soothingly tells the services lottery profits by. (SOUNDBITE OF TV AD) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Introducing Cottonwood Canyon, funded in part with 13 million lottery dollars, providing recreational adventure for generations of Oregonians to come. The Oregon Lottery - it does good things. TRIPOLI: Lottery revenues do fund good things - recreation, education and public safety. And the majority who hardly ever gamble get those services without paying full cost. For the gamblers, opportunities are multiplying. Under competitive pressure, the people who run state lotteries keep launching new games, new advertising, new price points and juiced-up payouts. Back at Santo Domingo Liquors, a display case holds an array of 44 scratch tickets. There's one for every budget - $1, $2, 5, 10, 20. Owner Elizabeth Correia pulls out another one. CORREIA: We got the $30 ticket. TRIPOLI: Say that again. CORREIA: $30 ticket. TRIPOLI: Is that new? CORREIA: Yes. TRIPOLI: How new is that? CORREIA: About - what? - two, three weeks - less than a month. TRIPOLI: The $30 world-class millions scratch ticket is the state's newest. Massachusetts is simply keeping up with the six other states that have rolled out $30 tickets in recent months. Every state lottery website has a link to counseling for problem gamblers, but the flow of cash from these games raises questions about whether state governments are becoming a different sort of gambling addict.

I'm Michel Martin. We'd like to start the program today by talking about part-time jobs, and how they are working or are not working for millions of Americans. Now for years, part-time work has been touted as a way for young people to get income while going to school or for seniors to supplement their retirements or for working parents to handle family responsibilities. More recently, though, millions of workers are working part-time because full-time work is not available. The part-time workforce is bigger than ever - some 27. 4 million Americans. And since 2007, the number of part-timers who say they'd rather have full-time work has doubled to 7. 5 million. And now there is a new focus on the burdens of part-time work as workers say unpredictable schedules are creating more economic and personal hardships for workers who cannot plan childcare, class schedules or even budget how much money they'll have at the end of a week. Now some members of Congress are taking notice. They want to change that with the Schedules That Work Act. It's legislation that would require service sector employers to provide steady schedules to the employees. We wanted to talk more about all of this, so we've called Steven Greenhouse. He is labor and workplace reporter for the New York Times, and he's been writing about this recently. Also with us is NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax, here with us once again in our Washington, D. C. studios. Welcome to you both. Thank you for coming. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi. STEVEN GREENHOUSE: Nice to be here. MARTIN: So Steven Greenhouse, you report on workplace issues. And you recently wrote a story on this topic. And you got so many responses that you had to do - you chose to do a follow-up story only a couple of days later. Can you just give us an idea of what kinds of challenges workers are facing and give us - just tell us maybe one story that really stood out for you? GREENHOUSE: So last Wednesday, I had a front-page story about the unpredictable, erratic, herky-jerky scheduling that makes life very difficult for a lot of workers, especially female workers. And I wrote about this woman, Mary Coleman - 60-year-old woman in Milwaukee, who has a job at Popeyes. So she commutes an hour each way to her Popeyes restaurant. And Mary told me that about two weeks ago she showed up one afternoon after her hour-long bus ride, and her boss said sorry, we don't need you today. Go home. Don't even clock in. We have enough workers already. And this is even though Mary was scheduled to work that day. So Mary just headed back home. She didn't get paid a cent that day. And, you know, there were over 440 readers who wrote in in response to my story. And one of them - and the second most highly recommend comment on the New York Times website - said, you know, this should be criminal. You know, she paid for the bus. She spent two hours of her time going back and forth. And she wasn't paid a cent. And this reader wrote that this seems Dickensian, right out of the 19th century. MARTIN: Well, not only that, one of the other things you reported on was the fact that when workers said - like you wrote about, like, for example, one comment was for a teacher who had been laid off from a job and was shocked to find out that when he told people, look, I need to go back to school as well, that they either cut his hours or, in one instance, walked him out of the interview and said, you have to leave now because if you're not willing to be available for this entire period of time - say six days a week, all day long - when we call you, we won't even talk to you. Or workers who did ask for more regular schedules were sometimes had their hours cut. How common was that? GREENHOUSE: It's quite common, Michel. I think there are several forces at work that have made work schedules much more erratic, herky-jerky, unpredictable. One is, you know, work, you know, the unemployment rate has been fairly high. Workers are much more insecure and, I think, employers therefore feel they can kind of push their workers more, you know, jerk them around the schedules. There's this phenomenon now called on-call work. And I interviewed this retail employee in New York City who said she was scheduled for one regular shift in a week and four on-call shifts, meaning every morning, she had to call in first thing in the morning to see whether they needed her at the store that day. So she wasn't able to plans that day, wasn't able to, you know, schedule lunches with friends or whatever. And, you know, there's this rise in on-call scheduling. A second factor - there's been this development, this sophisticated scheduling software that many retailers and restaurants use that kind of keeps hour to hour computation of how many workers you need at any moment. So, you know, there are restaurants - fast food restaurants that say well, we need, you know, eight workers for the morning - for the breakfast shift then, you know, we want our workers to clock out from 9 a. m. to 11 a. m. , and then we want them to clock back in for the lunch shift. And workers feel really jerked around. They feel it's unfair that they have to clock out those two hours and sometimes have to stay around the restaurant. So this teacher I wrote about, you know, who was laid off after 20 years teaching because the school district didn't have enough money. So he, you know, he needed money to support his family. So, you know, here's a guy who's used to being - you know, he has a master's degree. He's used to being treated with respect. He applies for some retail jobs, and they say, we're not going to hire you for more than 29 hours a week. And you have to be scheduled - as you said, Michel - you know, 24/7. And he said, well, you know, can you just schedule me like from 9 to 2 for this job so I could, you know, look for a second job. And they said, if you're not going to be able to be available 24/7, forget it. This interview's over. Get out of here. I mean, it's pretty shocking. MARTIN: Get out of here. Marilyn Geewax, you know, as we've mentioned, a number of employers have traditionally touted the flexible schedule as way to kind of live your life and accomplish other goals as well. Has something changed? I mean, Steve Greenhouse started talking about this. What's changed in recent years that are leading to these kinds of complaints, or are people just more willing to voice complaints? GEEWAX: Well, I think one of the big things that's changed is probably in your pocket. It's the mobile phone. You know, when I was working in retail in college, if I had a schedule and it was set, I knew that's when I was supposed to be there. If my boss wanted to change it, she had to call my house, make the phone ring, and I had to answer it. And you didn't have the expectation that workers would absolutely answer the phone and know to come out. Now a lot of employers expect you to have a mobile device of some sort so that they can text you, instant message you. They want you to be on call literally all the time. So the ability to reach your workers for last-minute scheduling changes has really had an impact. Also, our social norms have changed. Again, you know, when I was younger, if I wanted to see the latest adventures of the Huxtables, I would have to be home on Thursday night at eight o'clock because that's when the networks were going to show it. But, you know, now everything is on-demand. I watch TV when I feel like it because I can time-shift. Well, everyone has sort of gotten used to this idea that things are very flexible, that it's all on-demand. So there's kind of a social change in the way employers see workers. They now view them more as inventory than human beings. You know, you're supposed to be on the shelf ready to be used when needed. And all I have to do is text you, and you'll show up. So it's a different way of looking at workers. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, we are talking about the impact of unpredictable schedules on part-time workers and growing complaints about that. Our guests are NPR's Marilyn Geewax and Steven Greenhouse of The New York Times, who recently wrote about this. So, Steven Greenhouse, one of the points that a lot of people made, though, is that how do you plan childcare around something like that? - because kids aren't human spackle. You can't just, like, you know, put them on the shelf and take them off the shelf. So I see that members of Congress are taking note of this. What are they suggesting? And what has been the response to that? GREENHOUSE: So there was a news conference yesterday on Capitol Hill where George Miller, the senior Democrat on the House Education Labor Committee, Rosa DeLauro, you know, another, you know, senior Democrat from Connecticut, Elizabeth Warren and Tom Harkin, Democrats in the Senate - they're pushing a bill that would - you know, that calls for two weeks advance notice for your work schedule, that if your work schedule is changed 24 hours before you have to go to work, they have to pay you an extra hour that day. I told the story about this woman Mary Coleman in Milwaukee, who showed up for work. They said, sorry, we don't need you now; go home. Under these proposals, you'd have to pay someone at least for four - a minimum of four hours just for showing up for work on a scheduled day. Even if you send them home after three hours, you still have to pay them four hours because you want to - the idea is if workers schedule their day so they have, you know, to show up at work and they do so, you've got to pay them for at least four hours that day. I think Marilyn made a good point before - just I wanted to add one other thing. This, you know, terrific professor I interviewed at University of Chicago, who's really the nation's foremost expert on scheduling, Susan Lambert, said, remember, employers, you know, store managers, restaurant managers are under huge pressure to hold down costs. They don't have a lot of power to hold down wages, to hold down benefits. But one way they could easily reduce, you know, what they spend on labor is cutting employee hours. I think that's another reason that we're seeing a lot of employers telling people like Mary Coleman or other workers, well, you know, we don't need you. You can go home after three hours. Business has slowed down. And Marilyn was absolutely right. That's made much, much easier now because people have mobile phones. And your employer can text you and say, you know, maybe we don't need you to come in today because it's raining or business is slow. MARTIN: Marilyn, one of the other people who commented on Steven's piece, obviously, were employers whose attitude was, you should be glad you have a job, or who do you think you are to be making these kinds of demands? - that this is the way the market works, and you just have to adapt to the current environment. So you have to assume that that point of view is kind of present as well. You're here in Washington, and you talk to members of Congress all the time. Is there any - we've mentioned that there's some growing interest in this. But does that interest have traction? What's the growing sentiment here? We have about a minute and half left. GEEWAX: It's complicated because there are some things that are very popular with voters. For example, raising the minimum wage is actually extremely popular. There's almost unanimity. Polls are anywhere from 80 to 90 percent of Americans of think that $7. 25 an hour is too low. So it's not hard to get people on board with this in terms of the voters. But actually getting something through Congress at this time is very difficult because Congress is quite divided. The idea that this kind of legislation would get through especially the Republican-controlled House seems very unlikely right now. But, you know, it is something that, at the very least, it's now a topic of conversation in a way that we were not hearing four or five years ago. At the worst of the recession, actually, there was a sentiment that any work is better than no work. But the further we get into this more technologically sophisticated workplace, the more these work - flexible schedules are happening, there's almost a rebellion among people. A lot of workers are very frustrated about this. And it's becoming a political issue, especially a lot of women are affected by this. But in terms of specific legislation passed in Congress, I think that's quite unlikely, at least for the foreseeable future. MARTIN: Marilyn Geewax is NPR's senior business editor. Steven Greenhouse is labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. GEEWAX: Oh, you're welcome. GREENHOUSE: Great to be here. Thanks.

But the nation's workforce development system hasn't always succeeded in matching the training to the work. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports on efforts underway to change that. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Something pretty remarkable happened yesterday. President Obama signed a new law, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It streamlines and updates the nation's job-training programs and was 11 years overdue. The bill got overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Folks in Congress got past their differences. And they got a bill to my desk. So this is not a win for Democrats or Republicans. It is a win for American workers. KEITH: The act aims to better match training to employer needs and encourages more apprenticeships and on-the-job training. The measure of success will no longer be just how many people sign up for training but how many get jobs. At the same time Congress was working out the details of the bill, Vice President Joe Biden was traveling around the country looking at what works and what doesn't. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: My pleasure. Nice to meet you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1: Good to see you. How are you doing? KEITH: Back in March, he visited New Hampshire where an innovative on-the-job training program has helped nearly 700 people get new jobs since 2010. He stopped into XMA Corporation, a small manufacturer which has hired about half a dozen people so far using the program. And Biden was clearly impressed. BIDEN: We're trying to replicate what you're doing all over the country. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: It works. It works. BIDEN: It does work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: For a small to medium sized company like ours and others, having this program is excellent for bringing in good talent. KEITH: The program targets the long-term unemployed and pays up to 90 percent of the employee's salary while a company trains them to fill an opening it has. While he was there, Biden met Brian Alexander, a design engineer with a big scruffy beard and a story that probably sounds familiar. The company where Alexander worked for more than a decade was taken over by a larger corporation. BRIAN ALEXANDER: And I got laid off. They eliminated my position was what I was told. KEITH: He had 40 years of experience, and eight months after losing his job, he was still unemployed. ALEXANDER: You know, I was basically almost ready to retire. KEITH: Alexander was a skilled engineer, but he wasn't up to date on the latest design software. Through the state program, he applied for a job at XMA Corporation. Marc Smith is the company's CEO. MARC SMITH: A lot of times, it's hard to get good talent. And this - that's why this program has been so good because we can find people like Brian - he lives 10 minutes from here. I would've never found him, you know. And if I did find him, I wouldn't be sure if he was a good fit or not. So we brought him in, only to find out it was a home run. KEITH: While the state paid a portion of his salary, Smith says XMA helped get Alexander trained on the software he needed to do the job. SMITH: Did you use Solidworks before you came here? ALEXANDER: No, I didn't know Solidworks. SMITH: So there you go. So there's part of the whole training program where the guy's really a magnificent RF engineer - but as far as the mechanical tools of Solidworks or 3-D modeling, it's new. KEITH: Within months of coming on board, Alexander was named employee of the month and had a nickname, the big tuna. His story made an impression on the vice president. BIDEN: So what Brian had - He had all of these degrees and all this skill, but he needed a different programming knowledge. And so it took just a little bit of training, and the guy - boom. And he was excited. KEITH: Brian Alexander is among the 95 percent of people who participated in the New Hampshire program still employed, most of them, with the same employer. It's become something of a national model, and its influence is apparent in a report Biden released yesterday, the culmination of six months of fact-finding. It calls for engaging employers and encouraging on-the-job training. BIDEN: So it really is connecting an individual with an opening and the skill required to fill that opening. It's that basic, but it's hundreds of thousands of jobs available. KEITH: That's exactly what the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act aims to do. With House officials say Biden's work gives the administration a head start in implementing the act. Virginia Foxx is a North Carolina Republican and a former community college president. She was instrumental in writing the new law. VIRGINIA FOXX: Job training is so yesterday. Workforce development and skills development is tomorrow. KEITH: Foxx stood next to the president and the vice president yesterday, wearing a bright pink suit and smiling as Obama signed the bill. Afterward, Biden said she told him he was starting to sound like a Republican. Tamara Keith, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Anyone in America who has lost a job or is in a dead-end job might look to a government program to train for a new job, especially in a field where workers are in demand. But the nation's workforce development system hasn't always succeeded in matching the training to the work. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports on efforts underway to change that. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Something pretty remarkable happened yesterday. President Obama signed a new law, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It streamlines and updates the nation's job-training programs and was 11 years overdue. The bill got overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Folks in Congress got past their differences. And they got a bill to my desk. So this is not a win for Democrats or Republicans. It is a win for American workers. KEITH: The act aims to better match training to employer needs and encourages more apprenticeships and on-the-job training. The measure of success will no longer be just how many people sign up for training but how many get jobs. At the same time Congress was working out the details of the bill, Vice President Joe Biden was traveling around the country looking at what works and what doesn't. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: My pleasure. Nice to meet you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1: Good to see you. How are you doing? KEITH: Back in March, he visited New Hampshire where an innovative on-the-job training program has helped nearly 700 people get new jobs since 2010. He stopped into XMA Corporation, a small manufacturer which has hired about half a dozen people so far using the program. And Biden was clearly impressed. BIDEN: We're trying to replicate what you're doing all over the country. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: It works. It works. BIDEN: It does work. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: For a small to medium sized company like ours and others, having this program is excellent for bringing in good talent. KEITH: The program targets the long-term unemployed and pays up to 90 percent of the employee's salary while a company trains them to fill an opening it has. While he was there, Biden met Brian Alexander, a design engineer with a big scruffy beard and a story that probably sounds familiar. The company where Alexander worked for more than a decade was taken over by a larger corporation. BRIAN ALEXANDER: And I got laid off. They eliminated my position was what I was told.

S. economy has yet to fully recover. Policymakers have long debated why, whether the government's response to the crisis was adequate or excessive. Now, in their new book \"House Of Debt,\" two economists assert the real problem is that consumers remain constrained by debt they took on when times were good. And they say Washington has largely failed to address the problem. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In the volatile months after the subprime crisis, the Bush and Obama administrations put a lot of energy into stabilizing the financial system. The idea was to keep the banks healthy so they'd lend more. In a sense, the policies worked. The banks gradually recovered, but the economy remained sluggish for a long time. To understand why, says Princeton economist Atif Mian, you have to look at debt. Household debt doubled between 2000 and 2007, and much of it was taken on by working and middle-class people whose incomes were flat or even falling. ATIF MIAN: So you had a situation where even though people were getting poorer in terms of their real wages, they were taking on more and more debt. ZARROLI: Mian says a big part of the problem is that so much of the debt went into mortgages and home equity loans. He says mortgages are inherently risky for borrowers. When house prices fall, the borrowers quickly lose whatever equity they've built up, but they still have to pay the bank what they owe. And he says by late 2007, prices were falling, and a lot of people were in over their heads. MIAN: When that realization sets in, what is going to happen with the borrowers? Well, they are going to try to cut back on their spending and save. ZARROLI: And Mian says that's what a lot of people have done. In their book, \"House Of Debt,\" Mian and his co-author Amir Sufi, of the University of Chicago, looked at economic data in different zip codes across the country. And they've documented something that a lot of people have long suspected; debt has a corrosive effect on the economy. Atif and Mian found that in places where housing prices were flat, such as Texas and the Midwest, consumer spending has been pretty stable. But in places where housing prices fell the most, consumer spending plummeted. They're places such as Paterson, New Jersey, a faded industrial city west of New York. JOHN SUSANI: Foreclosure. Foreclosure. Foreclosure. ZARROLI: Real estate broker John Susani takes me down a street where every third house seems to be abandoned or boarded up. During the boom years, money flooded into Paterson. SUSANI: The banking industry allowed everyone to be a homeowner. They gave mortgages to people that were breathing. ZARROLI: So how much did prices go up during the boom years? SUSANI: Oh, in some cases, as much as 50 percent. The problem is now those homes are not worth that 50 percent. We've seen a massive reduction in property values. ZARROLI: Many Paterson homeowners were wiped out. They cut back on spending. And a lot of local businesses failed. SUSANI: So now, if you were a local grocery store, a little mom-and-pop operation, that obviously took money from your sales for the year. And you see that in different parts of the community. ZARROLI: And what happened in places such as Paterson has happened many times before, all over the world. Mian says periods of very high, household borrowing, such as the U. S. in the 1920s or Japan in the 1980s, have often been followed by steep downturns. MIAN: We have seen this over and over again, where a rapid rise in private debt, household debt, is very often followed by a deep and long recession. ZARROLI: Mian says when this happens, demand falls. And it's hard to revive it, even when the Fed lowers interest rates to the floor. \"House Of Debt\" argues that the Obama administration should've worked harder to help struggling homeowners pare down their debt, even if it meant forcing banks to forgive part of their loans. Former administration official Larry Summers argued in a recent op-ed that such measures would simply have never gotten through Congress, and economist Christopher Mayer of Columbia Business School agrees. But Mayer, like Summers himself, has plenty of praise for the book. CHRISTOPHER MAYER: I think one of the things that Mian and Sufi have done really well is push us back to thinking about the role of consumers in the economy. And, you know, I think that that's a really important contribution. ZARROLI: Until now, he says, much of our understanding of the downturn has centered on the role played by banks and the collapse of big financial houses such as Lehman Brothers. \"House Of Debt\" says the seeds of the downturn were planted much earlier, when consumers were encouraged to borrow so much. And the impact of that borrowing is still being felt today. Jim Zarroli. NPR News, New York. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   Six years after the subprime mortgage crisis sparked the Great Recession, the U.

S. economy is back on track after getting stuck in a snowy ditch at the beginning of the year. Today the government reported that during April, May and June the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 percent. The news came as Fed policymakers were wrapping up a two-day meeting in Washington. But as NPR's John Ydstie reports that better number didn't prompt any significant change in Fed policy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There's no doubt Fed policymakers welcomed the news of faster growth. In the statement they released after their meeting they said the economy has the underlying strength to support continued job growth. BLU PUTNAM: The economy is pretty healthy out there. YDSTIE: That's Blu Putnam, managing director and chief economist for the CME group. He says the 4 percent growth rate for the second quarter is confirmation that the U. S. economy is back on track. And despite the Fed's generally stand pat statement today, Putnam believes there's consensus forming at the Fed that it's time to normalize policy. PUTNAM: I'm just suggesting that there's a core group in the Fed that I think is getting larger that just wants to exit anything that you might think of as an emergency policy. Because we're five years into this expansion, you really don't really need to be in emergency mode. YDSTIE: The Fed statement indicated it is continuing to do that by winding down its stimulative bond buying program. It said it will reduce its bond purchases to $25 billion a month in August down from fly. But Putnam thinks a consensus is forming among Fed officials that it should also end its emergency zero interest rate policy sooner than previously planned. Right now the markets and most analysts expect the first rate hike to come sometime around the middle of next year. PUTNAM: I'm more in the camp that they start to push rates higher early next year. YDSTIE: And, says Putnam, the recent stronger job growth provides the Fed with a justification for raising rates sooner. PUTNAM: But at the end of the day, if we're creating 200,000 plus jobs a month the economy's getting healthier every month. YDSTIE: But while Fed officials acknowledge the improving labor market in their statement, they also introduce this new language, quote, \"a range of labor market indicators suggest there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. \" There's little doubt Fed chair Janet Yellen was instrumental in inserting that cautionary line into the statement. Yellen has been clear, says John Canally of LPL Financial, that she is looking beyond overall job growth and the unemployment rate to measure the health of the labor market. JOHN CANALLY: She looks at things like the amount of full-time workers to part-time workers - still way more part-time workers than average for this time in the business cycle. She looks at things like the median duration of unemployment - still way higher than it was before the downturn. YDSTIE: These indicators lead Canally to believe the Federal Open Market Committee won't move faster to raise short-term rates. CANALLY: The majority of the members of the FOMC are probably in the same mode that Janet Yellen's in which is probably lower for longer. YDSTIE: And the statement from policymakers today said again that they will likely keep their target interest rate at its current level, essentially zero, for a considerable time.

Those are the words today of the court-appointed mediator who's been trying to broker an agreement between Argentina and its creditors. With a midnight deadline looming, the parties walked away without a deal late today. Argentina has been waging a protracted legal battle with a small number of bondholders who want to be paid in full for bonds they purchased years ago. NPR's Jim Zarroli is following the story and he joins us now. And, Jim, bring us up to date on what happened today. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: You know, it looked early in the day as though there might be a resolution to this, this dispute. We heard that the two sides had actually met face-to-face yesterday for the first time. Then there were also published reports today that Argentina's banks had come up with a last-minute proposal to end the stalemate. This morning the two sides showed up at the office of the court-appointed mediator in Manhattan. They stayed there for several hours, but the day dragged on and there was no resolution. By the middle of the afternoon, Standard and Poor's, the rating agency, said it was placing Argentina in selective default, which means it has paid some of its debts but not all of them. And then government officials left the talks without any resolution and said they were heading back to Argentina. CORNISH: What have you learned about what caused the talks to break down? ZARROLI: Well, the economy minister, Axel Kicillof, spoke to reporters as he was leaving today. He basically said a lot of the things he's been saying all along - calling the creditors vulture funds. He said Argentina had made them an offer, they rejected it. Argentina defaulted for the first time back in 2002, and it was able to get a lot of bondholders to take less money than they were owed. But there were these holdouts who were demanding to be paid everything they were owed. And they're the ones Argentina's been fighting with. And Kicillof said, as he has before many times, the country cannot legally pay 100 percent of what it owes to one group of bondholders without paying the others the same thing, it can't afford it. CORNISH: So what is the impact likely to be from a default? ZARROLI: It's a big question now. The court-appointed mediator, Daniel Pollack, says the consequences of the default are not predictable but they're certainly not positive. This is a country that's been having some economic problems, this is going to compound them. It's been frozen out of the debt market since the 2002 default and it's likely to stay that way. It's also going to have a big impact on the value of Argentina's currency. It's going to push interest rates higher for businesses. And of course it will hurt a lot of those individual bondholders. CORNISH: Finally, Jim, who are the bondholders and how will they be affected? ZARROLI: You know, a lot of them are institutional investors, hedge funds, pension funds, people who bought - investors who bought the bonds years ago because they were selling at a big discount after the first default, but a lot of individual investors too, some of them retirees who bought the bonds because the interest rates were very high. A lot of Italian pensioners were in the group. Many of these people took a big hit. After the first default, they were required to accept less money than they thought they were getting, and now they're going to get even less than that. So a lot of people are hurt by this, but the real impact should play out, I think, over the next few days. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli on Argentina's failure to avoid defaulting on billions of dollars of bonds. Jim, thank you. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

It's also going to have a big impact on the value of Argentina's currency. It's going to push interest rates higher for businesses. And of course it will hurt a lot of those individual bondholders. CORNISH: Finally, Jim, who are the bondholders and how will they be affected? ZARROLI: You know, a lot of them are institutional investors, hedge funds, pension funds, people who bought - investors who bought the bonds years ago because they were selling at a big discount after the first default, but a lot of individual investors too, some of them retirees who bought the bonds because the interest rates were very high. A lot of Italian pensioners were in the group. Many of these people took a big hit. After the first default, they were required to accept less money than they thought they were getting, and now they're going to get even less than that. So a lot of people are hurt by this, but the real impact should play out, I think, over the next few days. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli on Argentina's failure to avoid defaulting on billions of dollars of bonds. Jim, thank you.

Over the last couple of decades, many of the state's pharmaceutical industry jobs have dried up or moved elsewhere. And that has left millions of square feet sitting empty in buildings that used to house laboratories, office space and warehouses. WNYC's Dan Tucker looks at the prospects for these vacant properties. DAN TUCKER, BYLINE: The corporate campus of the Swiss drug-maker Roche sits on 116 acres in Nutley, New Jersey, 10 miles west of midtown Manhattan. There are dozens of buildings. In fact, there are enough bio and chem labs, offices and auditoriums to fill up the entire Empire State Building. But since December, all of that space - 2 million square feet of it - has been vacant. The laboratories dark and the sidewalks deserted. DARIEN WILSON: When this was a thriving site, this sidewalk would have been busy with folks walking up and down. TUCKER: That's spokesperson Darien Wilson, one of just 38 Roche employees still working at the site as the company tries to sell the property. During the good times, Roche was a self-contained campus with lots of ways to keep workers happy. WILSON: We had great amenities for people like on-site childcare, you had dinners to-go where you could order food by lunch and take it home with you at night if you were working late. We had dry cleaning. TUCKER: Five years ago, Roche acquired Genentech, moved its management to San Francisco and started to slowly withdraw from New Jersey. That's a pretty typical story for what's been happening in the state. In the last 20 years, New Jersey went from having more than 20 percent of U. S. pharma manufacturing jobs to less than 10 percent. James Hughes is the dean of the school of public policy at Rutgers. JAMES HUGHES: Essentially, every time there's a merger or one company acquires another company, there's a reduction in force. And there's been furious mergers and acquisitions in the pharma industry, particularly over the past 10 years. TUCKER: In 2009, Merck bought Schering-Plough, and Pfizer bought Wyeth. This year, Pfizer tried to purchase the British drug-maker AstraZeneca. And the list goes on. Business professor Erik Gordon from the University of Michigan says cutting-edge research isn't being done on closed campuses in the suburbs anymore. ERIK GORDON: Innovation in biotech and genomics is happening elsewhere. It's happening in places where there are graduate educational institutions that have research faculty doing that, and New Jersey really doesn't have that. TUCKER: That's something Roche is acutely aware of as it looks for a buyer. Tom Stanton is a managing director at Jones Land LaSalle, the real estate firm marketing the site. TOM STANTON: What really sets the site apart is its location. TUCKER: Stanton is showing me the campus. It's so big that we're driving around in a minibus. As we loop through a parking lot with thousands of empty spaces, Stanton stresses how close we are to Manhattan, Newark's airport and public transit. STANTON: Hiring young, talented people is really important to these companies and that population of upcoming talent, you know, is more into the city life. TUCKER: But even though it's only a good bike ride from Manhattan in a straight line, the Roche campus can feel far away from the city's pulse. Stanton says finding even a single tenant has been difficult. So far, he's shown the campus to 35 companies and no deal yet. Are you able to tell us whether there have been any bids for the property yet? STANTON: We're just not comfortable talking about those things. TUCKER: The situation may be even worse for the Merck World Headquarters. It's about 50 miles from Manhattan, making its one million square feet of space harder to fill. But there may be an answer. The state's biotech firms are growing fast and they may be the future tenets for these big pharma campuses. But so far, they've only been leasing small portions of space. Stanton says that could work for something like Roche's building 123, a six-story structure with a lot of lab space. STANTON: That building would cost $600 million to recreate today. TUCKER: Young companies would love to get some of its lab space, but they don't need and can't afford the whole building. Stanton just has to find a way to carve it up and then get some companies to bite. For NPR News, I'm Dan Tucker. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  And New Jersey used to be known as the nation's medicine chest.

Now seven months into his term, the mayor's administration has signed off on a building plan that allows a new luxury high-rise to have a separate entrance for low-income residents. And that's not going over well many New Yorkers, as Janet Babin from member station WNYC reports. JANET BABIN, BYLINE: The 33-story tower butts up against Manhattan's western edge, next to the Hudson River, and will offer some tenants expansive, waterfront views. About 20 percent of the units will be reserved for low- and middle-income residents. But they'll have to enter through a separate door and that sparked outrage among some New Yorkers. HELEN ROSENTHAL: This developer must go back, seal the one door and make it so all residents go through the same door. It's a disgrace. BABIN: That's City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal. She's demanding an end to what some here have dubbed the poor door. Civil rights attorneys say a significant number of tenants in the subsidized apartments could be minorities. Lawyer Randolph McLaughlin says that makes the poor door more than disgraceful and possibly illegal. RANDOLPH MCLAUGHLIN: To commit developers or encourage them to create separate and unequal buildings and take tax credits and benefits from the city - I think that's a constitutional violation. BABIN: McLaughlin's referring to the building's design, which groups all the affordable units in one area with that separate entrance. The developer defends the two doors saying he's simply complying with city zoning laws. City Hall blames the prior administration for creating those laws and approving the deal. Alicia Glen is the deputy mayor for housing and economic development. ALICIA GLEN: The plans for this building were submitted and construction commenced on the project in 2013, prior to the new mayor being elected. BABIN: The company building the skyscraper is Extell Development. Its president Gary Barnett says the zoning law is aimed at creating more affordable housing. In this building, he says the affordable units will rent for about $15 a square foot, whereas market rate units will fetch five or six times that. GARY BARNETT: Would you rather not have the affordable housing? Ask anyone of the thousands of people who are applying for that and they don't give a damn. They want to have a beautiful apartment in a beautiful neighborhood at a, you know, super price. BABIN: But some New Yorkers aren't persuaded by that super price, like this caller on WNYC's \"The Brian Lehrer Show. \"(SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE BRIAN LEHRER SHOW\")BRIAN LEHRER: Robert in Queens, you're on WNYC - hi Robert. ROBERT: Hi. Once again, we're putting segregation right up front. And we're making it legal to segregate people. BABIN: On city streets near the new building, it was hard to find a resident who would mind a separate entrance, in exchange for a sweet, cheap rental. Roman Golubov himself lives in a subsidized apartment. ROMAN GOLUBOV: I definitely understand why people would be upset, but I wouldn't take it too personally. If I got an opportunity to live in a skyscraper and they made me walk to the poor door, I'd get over it. BABIN: Meanwhile, City Hall is trying to get over the controversy.

Some U. S. hedge funds have been demanding that Argentina repay, in full, bonds they purchased years ago. The fight's been led by billionaire Paul Singer. He's the founder of Wall Street hedge fund Elliott Management. We reach Forbes writer Agustino Fontevecchia to learn more about the strategy of Singer and other hedge funds. AGUSTINO FONTEVECCHIA: They look at companies that are not doing well, and they look at countries that are not doing well. And in some cases, like the Argentina one we're talking about, the country essentially went into bankruptcy early in the 2000s, so that's called default. And what Singer did is that he went in and he scooped up a bunch of the debt when it was really cheap because, as we know, when someone's in bankruptcy, you can buy the assets at fire sale prices. And then what he did is that he litigated. He took them to court in order to try to extract full payment. CORNISH: So this time he sues Argentina, and he wins the battle in court. But Argentina still doesn't pay up and defaults. So now what does he do? FONTEVECCHIA: All right. Well, the thing is, in other cases I think he hasn't dealt with a country that is a G20 nation. So it's relatively large economically even though, you know, next to the U. S. , it's very tiny. When it comes to countries, there aren't strict rules as to what happens when they go bankrupt. At the end of the day, if they decide to break with the rule of law which they agreed to, the country can just kind of say, like, OK, I'm just going to give my back to the rest of the world. And for Argentina, the problem is that now while most countries can finance themselves by appealing to global markets in terms of debt by issuing bonds, Argentina hasn't been able to do that. They've suffered the lack of dollars for imports and other things like that and that's fed inflation. And it's harmed the welfare of the people in the nation. Now hypothetically, Argentina could just never pay. The problem is Argentina will be eternally out of the global markets. And that's not something they want. CORNISH: Now funds like Elliott Management, they're often described as vulture investors - a name that I understand Paul Singer's not fond of. But they do understand the risk here. Has he overplayed his hand? FONTEVECCHIA: You know, that's an argument that can be made. When you talk about a vulture fund, it's definitely not a nice way to say it, but it does kind of go to the point. Now it would be bad to blame them as an absolute horrible, you know, ethical person because that's not what they are. They are just very smart at looking at the market, at finding opportunities and at working their legal strategy. So why are they called vultures? It's because they are going after nations that are bankrupt, generally because of incompetent leadership that took on too much debt. And they're essentially extracting payment that, hypothetically, could be money that the country really needs to grow its economy. Now at the same time, the vulture funds, including Singer's, they do provide a certain positive thing that is they act as sheriffs to a certain extent. They police people. They force some of these nations to make sure that they're not, you know, just taking out all the debt they want and then defaulting and then not caring. By knowing that there are people like Singer out there, countries have to be more careful. CORNISH: Can you tell us a little bit more about Singer himself? I understand that there is also kind of political ideology at play. FONTEVECCHIA: Yeah, most definitely. So Singer is well-known to be a Republican backer. He has very strong opinions. He doesn't like the Federal Reserve. He's more of a person that likes less taxes and less government intervention. So when you oppose that to some countries like Argentina, which kind of espoused the opposite ideals - Argentina's more of a, you know, government-run economy to certain extent. There's a lot of intervention. So, you know, a little bit of this could have to do with Singer trying to say look, we want to show that contracts have to be enforced and the sanctity of contracts and of property. But at the end of the day, Singer wants to get paid. At the same time, Argentina's a country with a history of sort of rebelliousness, of sort of default, of thinking they can take on the world. And, you know, I personally am from Argentina. And all Argentines - we don't agree with the things that we've done, but I think we all agree that there is a very strong ego or personality in sort of our national feeling of ourselves, which makes this sort of a perfect enemy for Singer. But both sides kind of hate each other, if you will. CORNISH: Agustino Fontevecchia is a writer with Forbes.

Welcome to the show. TOM PEREZ: Always a pleasure to be with you, Ari. SHAPIRO: So all in all, a good unemployment report, but 6. 2 percent unemployment is still higher than we would expect to see in a healthy economy. Is this the new normal, or how much farther is there still to go? What's the baseline that you're looking for? PEREZ: Well, this isn't the new normal but it's important for listeners to appreciate that we've come a long way. The last two months of the Bush administration we lost 1. 5 million jobs total. We now have six months in a row of growth over 200,000 jobs. That hasn't happened since 1997. You look at where the growth is - the industry cluster that has seen the most growth in the last year has been professional and business services. These are architects, engineers - well-paying jobs. Manufacturing is continuing to see very solid growth. So we have broad-based growth, but we still have work to do. And one area where we have work to do is to make sure we're growing wages because too many people are working hard but falling behind. SHAPIRO: One weak spot in this latest job report is part-time workers who want full-time work and can't find it - more than 7 million Americans are in that position. What can be done for the group of people? PEREZ: Well, the number of Americans who are working part-time and want to work full-time has actually gone down by about 600,000 in the last year, but it's still too high. And, you know, an example of something I want to see moving forward, and I watch very carefully, is in the manufacturing sector because right now we have 42 hours a week on average in the manufacturing sector. In other words, folks on average are working overtime. What I want to see happen is I want to see that number come down to, say, 40 hours because what that means is that people are hiring more folks because they have a confidence that they can take on a full-time employee. And when that happens, then more part-time workers will move up to full-time work. SHAPIRO: What percentage unemployment rate does that start to happen? We're at 6. 2 percent now. When do you expect to start seeing the kind of changes you're talking about? PEREZ: Well, I think it's going to happen and it is happening in various sectors. But, you know, different sectors have a different level of robustness right now. And so, you know, the construction sector for instance - we've had a good last year, but we've only recovered roughly 30 percent or so of the jobs that were lost in the great recession. So we have work to do. So there are too many construction workers that are out of work. That puts downward pressure on wages. In other sectors we've recovered quite a few more. And in the manufacturing sector, as a result of our investments in things like apprenticeship, we're building that cadre of middle-class jobs that are paying a middle-class wage right now. SHAPIRO: Your administration colleague, Jason Furman, who runs the Council of Economic Advisers gave a speech couple of weeks ago where he said the fact that the African American unemployment rate is 87 percent of the way back to it's prerecession level is of little comfort when that prerecession level averaged 9. 8 percent. Does the government have a duty to target job creation measures specifically for those demographic groups that had higher unemployment rates before the financial crisis hit? PEREZ: Well, I think we want to get a job for everybody, and that's been our focus. And what we need to understand is you take the job-seeker as you find them. And by that I mean there are some people that walk into an American job center, and they have a college degree, and they need a little help dusting off their resume - getting a few job leads. There are other people who walk in and they have other barriers. In 1950 the labor force participation of young African-American men - that's aged 16 to 24 - 65 percent were working. In 2012 that figure was 37. 3 percent. That's unconscionable. And. . . SHAPIRO: Why is that? PEREZ: Because public policy has created a subclass here in so many cases where you see the public policy that's resulted in the unnecessary incarceration of African American men. You see the K-12 education system has failed communities of color. SHAPIRO: So this is obviously a much broader conversation than just jobs. But from your position, as the Secretary of Labor, do you think the government has an obligation to target job creation measures specifically to these groups? PEREZ: Well, we target our job creation measures to have an acute appreciation for what the barriers are. So for instance, the My Brother's Keeper Initiative is expanding opportunity for so many people by, for instance - you know, when you address the crack-powder disparity as Congress did in a bipartisan fashion, you help a broad array of people but you disproportionately help African-Americans and Latinos because their incarceration rates are so high. Through these targeted investments, I think we're going to grow our economy. And it's a demographic imperative because we can't leave African-American kids and Latino kids and Asian kids and kids who reside in rural America - we can't leave them at the side of the road. SHAPIRO: Labor Secretary Tom Perez, thanks very much. PEREZ: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  And we're joined now in the studio by Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Welcome to the show. TOM PEREZ: Always a pleasure to be with you, Ari. SHAPIRO: So all in all, a good unemployment report, but 6. 2 percent unemployment is still higher than we would expect to see in a healthy economy. Is this the new normal, or how much farther is there still to go? What's the baseline that you're looking for? PEREZ: Well, this isn't the new normal but it's important for listeners to appreciate that we've come a long way. The last two months of the Bush administration we lost 1. 5 million jobs total. We now have six months in a row of growth over 200,000 jobs. That hasn't happened since 1997. You look at where the growth is - the industry cluster that has seen the most growth in the last year has been professional and business services. These are architects, engineers - well-paying jobs. Manufacturing is continuing to see very solid growth. So we have broad-based growth, but we still have work to do. And one area where we have work to do is to make sure we're growing wages because too many people are working hard but falling behind. SHAPIRO: One weak spot in this latest job report is part-time workers who want full-time work and can't find it - more than 7 million Americans are in that position. What can be done for the group of people? PEREZ: Well, the number of Americans who are working part-time and want to work full-time has actually gone down by about 600,000 in the last year, but it's still too high. And, you know, an example of something I want to see moving forward, and I watch very carefully, is in the manufacturing sector because right now we have 42 hours a week on average in the manufacturing sector. In other words, folks on average are working overtime. What I want to see happen is I want to see that number come down to, say, 40 hours because what that means is that people are hiring more folks because they have a confidence that they can take on a full-time employee. And when that happens, then more part-time workers will move up to full-time work. SHAPIRO: What percentage unemployment rate does that start to happen? We're at 6. 2 percent now. When do you expect to start seeing the kind of changes you're talking about? PEREZ: Well, I think it's going to happen and it is happening in various sectors. But, you know, different sectors have a different level of robustness right now. And so, you know, the construction sector for instance - we've had a good last year, but we've only recovered roughly 30 percent or so of the jobs that were lost in the great recession. So we have work to do. So there are too many construction workers that are out of work. That puts downward pressure on wages. In other sectors we've recovered quite a few more.

Today, the government's monthly report showed that 209,000 jobs were added in the last month. We're going to talk about employment and unemployment with the Secretary Of Labor, Tom Perez but first, NPR's John Ydstie explains the numbers. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The unemployment rate rose a 10th of a percent to 6. 2 percent in July, but not because the economy was losing jobs rather, says economist Doug Handler it's because more people came back into the labor force looking for work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DOUG HANDLER: The economy is strong enough to bring people back into the labor force looking for jobs. That's a good thing. YDSTIE: As for job growth in July, Handler of IHS Global Insight says it was good - though not a blockbuster like the June number which was revised up to nearly 300,000. But Jason Furman, head of the President's Council Of Economic Advisers says the July gains continue the significant progress that's been made in recent months. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JASON FURMAN: We've now seen six straight months of employment growth of 200,000 jobs or more. That's the first time we've seen job gains at that pace since 1997. YDSTIE: Dean Baker of the Center For Economic Policy And Research says the July performance adding 209,000 jobs is pretty good. But he says it's way below the nearly 280,000 average rate for the previous three months. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HANDLER: So it's considerably slower but it's not a bad rate. The only caution I make is that given how many jobs we have still to makeup not a great number. YDSTIE: Indeed, five years into the economic recovery there are still 9. 7 million Americans looking for a job and can't find one. There are another seven and half million Americans with part-time work who would like to be full-time. And average wage growth has barely kept pace with inflation. Doug Handler says one encouraging thing in the July report was that job creation was broad-based across sectors. He's particularly encouraged by the addition of 58,000 new jobs in the goods producing industries - mining, manufacturing, and construction. HANDLER: Manufacturing and construction were sectors that have been lagging in some of the recent months here so we are hopeful that that is beginning of a positive trend. YDSTIE: Lots of economists and investors were looking closely at wage growth in this report. After data released yesterday showed worker compensation up sharply in the second quarter. There was concern more rapidly rising wages could prompt the Fed to hike interest rates sooner than planned. But Handlers says there was no wage acceleration in this report. HANDLER: There's no real new news for the Fed to act on based on the data here. YDSTIE: Yesterday, the stock market sold off sharply amid these fears. The decline continued today but was less severe.

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 30 percent over a 25-year period. NPR's Jeff Brady attended one hearing in Pittsburgh. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Coal had a big presence here this week. Miners marched through the streets of downtown Pittsburgh. And there was a coal industry rally that started with a prayer. JOEL WATTS: If you will bow your heads. God of creation and life abundant. BRADY: Joel Watts with West Virginia Coal Forum read the prayer. Referring to God-given coalfields, he took aim at the White House and EPA. WATTS: Give us the strength to stand strong against those who lied to us and hide behind their laws. BRADY: After amen, there was applause. (APPLAUSE)BRADY: Coal has much to lose under the EPA's proposed rules. They're designed to reduce greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide. The EPA has options for states to choose from such as conserving electricity or building more wind and solar projects. Coal produces about 40 percent of the electricity in the U. S. , but it has been losing market share to cleaner burning natural gas in recent years. That doesn't leave much room for the life Kathy Adkins of Madison, West Virginia knows. She's a nurse, and her husband is a retired coal miner. KATHY ADKINS: If you shut coal down, you lose minors. Minors lose money. They can't go out and they can't shop so it affects other businesses. That affects your community. BRADY: As the EPA's public hearing began Thursday morning, West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant was among the first to testify. NATALIE TENNANT: There is no reason to pit clean air against good paying jobs. West Virginia can lead the country in developing coal technology that supports both. BRADY: Tennant wants more federal investment in research for technologies to capture carbon before it can get up into the atmosphere. But among those who want to replace coal plants, they see opportunity at an event organized by environmental groups. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called for a new energy economy. MAYOR BILL PEDUTO: And we're not being dismissive of our brothers and sisters that are part of the older energy economy. We want to bring them along and give them good jobs and opportunities in the new economy. But we can't be shackled to the way that things were. BRADY: At the hearing, Kathy Dahlkemper spoke in favor of the EPA's proposed rules. She's the county executive in Erie, Pennsylvania. KATHY DAHLKEMPER: It's those who are marginalized that will feel the full brunt of climate change as its effects become more pronounced in the coming decades. The price of food will likely increase. And the poor are almost always the hardest hit when we have harsh, weather-related to disasters. BRADY: Hearings also were held this week in Washington, D. C. , Atlanta and Denver.

It's a marriage made in cheap plastic goods heaven. Dollar stores were doing brisk business throughout the recession but now the economy is recovering. Yesterday the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report for the month of June. For the first time since 1997, the economy added more than 200,000 jobs for six months straight. Though, the jobless rate remains stuck stubbornly mediocre, at 6. 2 percent. People are still worried. That's clear at a Dollar tree in LA County where there are still a lot of people looking to stretch their dollar. Latonya Wright has an armful of silver insulated bags. She's shopping for her son's frozen dessert business. LATONYA WRIGHT: You take each day at a time. Some days I have money, some days I don't. WESTERVELT: Can I ask about the economy too? For you, how do you feel about the economy right now? WRIGHT: You know what? It's hard to tell because you listen to the news and they say the economy's bad and stuff. But when you go to the malls or drive past any stores, you see people shopping, so. WESTERVELT: She's right. Yesterday the Commerce Department announced consumer spending has grown by two and a half percent this quarter. But at the same time, federal statistics show that the poorest Americans are earning less than they did a decade ago. And it's not just the lowest-income folks shopping here; more than half of American shoppers have been to a dollar store in the last month. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: And I got these. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Fake mustache. WESTERVELT: Sebastian Garcia-Vinyard is here shopping with his wife and two sons. SEBASTIAN GARCIA-VINYARD: It's a low-cost treasure hunt is what it is, right? Because they can pick anything out and it's a buck. WESTERVELT: Can I ask you how you guys feel about the economy - in general, just in terms of your own feeling? GARCIA-VINYARD: Neutral? Yeah, I don't see it moving for me sharply in any one direction. So I would say, status quo. WESTERVELT: In fact, almost most everyone I talk to here said the same thing - the economy doesn't seem to be getting any better or really any worse. I asked Zoe Chace of NPR's Planet Money why people still feel like the recovery is stuck in low gear? ZOE CHACE, BYLINE: So the big story out of the jobs numbers this week probably is about wages. So wages aren't really going up. People aren't getting a lot more money as the months are going by. And the reason for that is that there's actually still a lot more room for hiring. The unemployment rate is not back to, sort of, a full employment level where employers would really be looking around and trying desperately to hire people, a lot of competition for jobs because so many people are working. That's not the case. Until the unemployment rate, you know, gets a little bit lower and employers are really competing to hire people, wages are going to stay kind of where they are. And that's what we're seeing now and that's what we'll probably be seeing for the next couple months. WESTERVELT: Zoe, what do you think some of the factors are on why companies are holding back a little on hiring more? CHACE: You know, something that we really see is that companies are reporting pretty high profit margins. You know, companies are doing really well. You can kind of see that in how the stock market is doing. And then these earnings reports come out and companies seem to be making a lot of money. But a lot of the reason that they're making a lot of money is because the recession kind of shocked them. Companies got leaner, they started to kind of do more with less. Also invested in automation, basically, you know, robots instead of people to make them, sort of, more productive. The thing is though, the companies are maybe more profitable but they are kind of sitting on the money. They're not really spreading it around the economy. You can see a lot of uncertainty out in the world still and companies want cash on hand, in case there's another shock to the economic system. WESTERVELT: So what are economists and market watchers like yourself thinking about, you know, when things might get better for average folks in the U. S. ? CHACE: You'll probably continue to see, you know, good headline numbers about the economy. But the thing to really watch is wage growth, people actually getting more money in their pockets. When you see wage growth, it shows that there's real competition out there among companies to hire workers. Workers are going to have more money in their pockets, which means they're going to be spending more which creates a sort of virtuous cycle. Basically, companies see more demand, they want to expand more, hire more workers. Workers get paid more; more money in their pockets. That's when things start kind of humming along and everybody starts to feel better. WESTERVELT: Here's to the virtuous cycle. Planet Money's Zoe Chace. Thank you. CHACE: Thank you.

I'm Eric Westervelt. Heavy fighting continued in Gaza today. Israel's prime minister said, his country will continue its military operation as long as needed to stop Hamas attacks. In spite of that conflict, and those raging elsewhere around the globe for much of this year, the stock markets have been steadily rising. But they may now be showing a few signs of weakness. Yesterday, the major markets in the U. S. , Europe and Asia all ended down. It was the Dow's worst week since January and the worst week in two years for the S and P 500. Erin McCarthy is a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. I asked her if dip in the markets had anything to do with those global conflicts. ERIN MCCARTHY: It might. There was actually a lot of confusion about the drop on Thursday and Friday. People were sort of scratching their heads about it. Some analysts attributed the drop to some of these geopolitical conflicts. Others pointed to disappointing earning results out of Europe and out of companies in the U. S. And some of the other thoughts were longer-term; people are looking at the Federal Reserve and when they might be raising interest rates, which is still pretty far down the road, but given some positive U. S. economic data this week people are wondering, when is that going to happen? And that will obviously have a big impact on markets. WESTERVELT: Right. So the stimulus programs from central banks around the world have been pumping money into the market, and the U. S. Federal Reserve is part of that punch bowl. But that's going to slowly go away. The taper, as they call it. You know, what happens when our economy is strong enough that the Fed ends its assistance? MCCARTHY: Well it's - people are still pretty confident that markets will have a good level of support, even when the bond-buying program ends - which people are saying will probably happen in October - but even when that finishes up, interest rates in the U. S. are really, really, really low. And that's been another pillar of support for markets since the financial crisis. So even when the tapering wraps up there's still going to be a pretty good amount of support for the markets. WESTERVELT: So what's your take? The dip Thursday and Friday in the market was a bit of an anomaly. I mean, the markets have been doing pretty well since January in spite of all of this global conflict, correct? MCCARTHY: Yeah. They've been doing really great. You know, for the past five months it's been just on an upward trajectory. But one of the things a lot of analysts have been saying is, you know, given that it's been rising so steadily it's due - or it has been due a little bit - for a pullback. People might be taking a step back, taking profits, looking at the market, looking at the geopolitical situations, corporate earnings and taking the opportunity to close out some of their positions. WESTERVELT: So what's your take? What would it take to really rattle global markets? I mean, there's  no oil in Gaza. And it was surprising to some that even the Ukraine fighting hadn't rattled markets that much either. MCCARTHY: It has been surprising. I think one of the things, like you mentioned, is the oil market. So far, there haven't really been any disruptions to oil production globally. So for now that's not a huge impact. If in some way oil production was disrupted, I think that could have a spillover effect into other markets. Other factors could be if the U. S. got more involved in some of these geopolitical conflicts. So far, you know, they've had largely a diplomatic role. If that changed, I think that could get markets a little more worried. WESTERVELT: Always seems to come back to oil and whether the U. S. is going to put boots on the ground. MCCARTHY: Yeah, absolutely. That's a big factor. And people are also looking at the Federal Reserve, the U. S. Central Bank, and how they're gauging the situation. And so far, the Fed hasn't really signaled a lot of concern about these geopolitical issues and their economic impact. So while the Fed seems not super concerned, markets will also take that as a cue that maybe they shouldn't be. WESTERVELT: That's Erin McCarthy. She's a reporter with the Wall Street Journal.

I'm Arun Rath. CLAIRE SHROUT: The difficulty would happen when unexpected expenses would arise - you know, your transmission fails or if your child needs to go to the emergency room. Or, you know, there's some big unexpected expense. People with credit debt don't have savings accounts. So when something like this happens, what do you do? You get out another credit card. RATH: Claire Shrout is a registered nurse and the mother of two boys. What Claire and her husband went through is familiar to a lot of Americans. The average household with a credit card carries more than $15,000 in credit card debt. More than a third of those with debt have been reported to collection agencies, according to a study this past week from the Urban Institute. Today, we'll hear one story pulled from those cold statistics. Claire Shrout is our Sunday conversation. SHROUT: I'd say it was in 2010, and that was after we had our second baby. It was after my husband's second bout with cancer. I hadn't been able to work 'cause of maternity leave. He hadn't been able to work because he was ill. And that was really when our debt was at its highest point. And when you have too little sons, and you're thinking about the college accounts that you want to establish for them - you know, that's when it was really like, OK, there's no windfall coming. There's no inheritance. There's no lottery winnings. Like, you realize there's nothing coming along to bail you out. RATH: And can you talk about the emotional toll because I especially think in your situation - I know you're hit by illness in your family and also having to deal with this financial situation at the same time. SHROUT: Yeah. And there's a tremendous amount of shame associated with having credit card debt. And it's very frightening when you already have a debt issued to begin with, and then these medical bills start coming in. The fortunate thing is my relationship with my husband is very strong. We had a lot of faith that things would get better. We've had a good few years where we've been healthy, we've been able to work, and we've made tremendous progress with our credit card debt. And that's been like a - like a personal achievement every month - something that he and I feel really, really good about. RATH: And you talk about the shame of this. I know for a lot of people living in debt, defining what's essential - you know, the things you pay for can be painful because things that seem like an indulgence could be things that you need to, say - to look professional at work or go for a job interview - that kind of thing. SHROUT: Oh, certainly - because that's a huge part of living with debt - is feeling guilt and shame over purchases, even if, you know, it's important for your marriage to have a weekend away. And it's important for your job to have your clothes look a certain way or to, you know, have a certain level of professionalism. So the whole thing gets very, very murky. RATH: Did you ever, at any point when things were really bad, consider filing for bankruptcy? SHROUT: You know, I did. I briefly considered filing for bankruptcy, but we decided it was not the right choice for us. It seemed like, you know, we knew what we were doing, even though we had illness and we had hardships and we had missed work. And we really felt strongly like we got ourselves into this, and we can get ourselves out. We can do that. And it feels better to be paying this off with our own hard work and not just because it all got wiped away. RATH: And you said that you've - you have been turning things around. At what point did you start to climb out of that hole of debt? SHROUT: I would say in 2010 is when we really started to climb out. And it's been a combination of luck - we've been blessed with good health. I have a very steady, secure job, and I've been able to pick up overtime shifts. And we've really been successful at paying at least 1,000 to 2,000 extra dollars per month towards our debt. And we've done that by keeping our lifestyle very modest. You know, we have one car that is paid off. Instead of buying a second car, we bought some bicycles. And we've been able to cut our debt by two-thirds, and we're going to continue. We're hoping to be debt-free - besides our mortgage - this spring. RATH: So the end is in sight for you. SHROUT: Oh, yes. Yes. And it's awesome. It's really awesome.

[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The audio introduction to this story incorrectly states that developers want to build a casino on the eastern edge of the Grand Canyon as part of a new development project. In fact, a casino is not part of the project. ]LAUREL MORALES, BYLINE: At the end of a long dirt road about 100 miles north of Flagstaff, you come to a precipice where the land drops away 3500 feet to the place where the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers meet, at the floor of the Grand Canyon. Developer Lamar Whitmer took one look at this stunning view and saw opportunity. He envisions a gondola ride, two hotels, a restaurant, cultural center, amphitheater and elevated walkway along the river's edge. Whitmer believes the project would keep Navajos from moving off the reservation to find jobs. LAMAR WHITMER: If they're going to sustain their people and preserve their culture, they have to create some jobs. Fifty percent of the Navajos are living off the reservation now. The ones that stay have one of the most impoverished, if not the most impoverished, place in the state. MORALES: The Grand Canyon Escalade proposal, as they're calling it, promises the tribe 3,200 jobs - a road, infrastructure and at least 8 percent of gross revenues. The trade-off: 420 acres of land considered holy by many tribal members. But Whitmer says it is not a documented sacred site. WHITMER: The Navajo and the Hopi in their litigation with the federal government have spent significant time - 50, 60 years - cataloging significant sacred sites. There are no significant sacred sites within the 420 acres. RENAE YELLOWHORSE: I'm not going to accept it. MORALES: Renae Yellowhorse has been actively protesting the development. YELLOWHORSE: For people to come in and say - outside people - to tell me where I pray and where my grandparents have prayed, where my great-grandparents have prayed - that to tell me that it is not sacred - they can't tell me that. MORALES: On a recent breezy morning, Yellowhorse sends her prayers out to the wind, which she says carries them to her ancestors at the place where the two rivers meet, the confluence. YELLOWHORSE: (Navajo spoken) where the waters come together, that's where life comes from. And then when we go back after we finish our life journeys, that's where we go back to. These are clan stories. These are not stories that are in any books. MORALES: In addition to the Navajo, the Zuni and Hopi also believe the site is sacred. The Hopi Tribal Council, led by Chairman Herman Honanie, has passed a resolution opposing the development. HERMAN HONANIE: Right now as I'm looking at it - at the confluence - it's just surreal. It's just majestic. It's - why would anybody want to alter it in any state whatsoever, minute or grand? This belongs to the people. And I feel in some way that's why it was created. MORALES: But a former Navajo president is in favor of the development along with many other tribal members, including Brian Kensley. He says this portion of the Navajo Nation has been neglected for too long. For five decades, the federal government prohibited development on this land. Now that the freeze is lifted, Kensley sees Escalade as a chance for a better life. BRIAN KENSLEY: Of course it's a majestic area. It's an origin area, an oral tradition area. It's the seventh wonder of the world in our backyard. But I would like to share that sacredness with other outside people.

And over those 50 years, television has played a big role in shaping what Americans perceive about those without much money to their names. NPR's Elizabeth Blair has this look at who's poor on TV. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: Poor is a relative term - in life and on TV. Take breakfast. (SOUNDBITE OF REALITY TV SHOW, \"HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO\")ALANA THOMPSON: Big girls like to eat, honey. BLAIR: Honey Boo Boo likes to microwave. (SOUNDBITE OF REALITY TV SHOW, \"HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO\")THOMPSON: Sausage and pancakes mixed together, uh-huh. BLAIR: For a child in the Baltimore ghetto on \"The Wire,\" breakfast was a juice box and a bag of chips. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE WIRE\")EMILY HARRIS, BYLINE: (As Avon Barksdale) No man, he ain't getting no two. Come on man, quit being greedy. Take your chip. BLAIR: In the 1970s, in the Chicago projects on \"Good Times\" it was healthier. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GOOD TIMES\")JIMMIE WALKER: (As James \"J. J. \" Evans, Jr. ) You try some of that oatmeal. If you make it through the bowl, then I'll try some. BLAIR: J. J. 's sister Thelma made the oatmeal. She was played by Bern Nadette Stanis. BERN NADETTE STANIS: (As Thelma Evans) If you poor, it goes a long way and it's pretty cheap. (SOUNDBITE OF TV THEME SONG, \"GOOD TIMES\")JIM GILSTRAP AND BLINKY WILLIAMS: (Singing) Temporary layoffs, good times. Easy credit rip-offs, good times. Scratching and survivng. BLAIR: Even though it was a comedy, \"Good Times\" did tackle some of the bad times facing poor communities, like drug addiction and gangs. Esther Rolle played the mother. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"GOOD TIMES\")ESTHER ROLLE: Controlling those kids is up to the parents. (APPLAUSE)ROLLE: Now we wouldn't have any gangs if parents took responsibility for their own kids. BLAIR: \"Good Times\" was one of the highest rated shows on TV in the mid-1970s, but it was also criticized for giving the impression that being poor isn't so bad as long as there's love. But Bern Nadette Stanis says that's true. STANIS: I too was raised in the projects in Brooklyn and Brownsville. And I lived in a two bedroom apartment with my mom and dad and five children. So it was seven of us. But we also were very rich in education and in love. BLAIR: \"Good Times\" went on the air in the midst of a recession - many people were struggling. Norman Lear, who coproduced \"Good Times\" says above all, they wanted to make people laugh. But they also wanted storylines that resonated. He says before the 1970s, TV pretty much ignored poor people. NORMAN LEAR: The biggest subjects in television comedy were the the roast is ruined and the boss is coming to dinner, or mom dented the car and how do the kids and mom keep dad from finding out? There were no political problems, there was no poverty. That was the total message wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling. BLAIR: There's a lot of debate about the subject of entertainment TV's depiction of poverty. Do audiences empathize with the poor people they see or look down on them? Take one of the most recognized and reviled of today's reality TV shows - \"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\" on TLC. (SOUNDBITE OF REALITY TV SHOW, \"HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO\")JUNE SHANNON: The Redneck Games - it's an annual event here in Georgia. It's all about Southern pride, similar to the Olympics. But with a lot of missing teeth and a lot of butt cracks showing. BLAIR: Overweight, crude, obsessed with child beauty pageants - one critic in the Washington Times called Honey Boo-Boo's family stupid, lazy and hopeless. Another in Salon said it's an example of reality TV's endless carnival of the impoverished on display. But journalist Nona Willis Aronowitz, who covers education for NBC, disagrees with the charges that the family is exploited. NONA WILLIS ARONOWITZ: I see them being very playful with each other and being very unapologetic about their circumstances. DAVID SIMON: I hate reality TV. I can't get a handle on anything that's human. BLAIR: David Simon thinks reality TV caters to stereotypes. He says he tries to explore the human condition with his TV shows. Simon's HBO credits include \"Treme,\" set in post-Katrina New Orleans. And before \"The Wire,\" set in Baltimore. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WAY DOWN IN THE HOLE\")TOM WAITS: (Singing) If you walk through the garden, you better watch your back.

SIMON: We were about the America that got left behind. We were saying something legitimate about that portion of the country that doesn't have a lot of television shows made about them. BLAIR: \"The Wire\" was critically acclaimed. It was used at Harvard in a course on urban inequality. But \"The Wire\" was never a ratings winner. David Simon believes most Americans aren't interested in watching TV shows where the main characters are poor. SIMON: You know, they want to watch shiny, pretty people, you know, there's currencies in television and the two main currencies are sex and violence and then the third on is laughs. And to the extent that poor people can suit those currencies, great. BLAIR: Sex and laughs are the currencies on the CBS sitcom \"2 Broke Girls. \" Two beauties - Max, who's been poor her whole life, and Caroline, who's newly poor now that her Bernie Madoff type dad is in jail.

Tens of billions of dollars of development is in the works along the Gulf Coast, the Midwest and the Great Plains. But construction workers are few and far between. Right now there are about 20 percent fewer skilled workers in the industry than there were in 2008. Trade apprenticeships are helping to ease the shortage. But as Miles Bryan of Wyoming Public radio reports, it may be too little too late. MILES BRYAN: Jeremy Smith is the business manager for a school district in Northern Wyoming. It's a beautiful day and he's excited to show me the new Tongue River Elementary School - or at least the plot of land where the school should be. JEREMY SMITH: What you're going to see when we get up here a little bit closer is you're going to just see pasture. BRYAN: The school was supposed to be under construction by now but last month state officials said, they didn't have the money. SMITH: I think we did everything right in this case. We didn't redesign a whole new school. We went and found one that was built twice already in the state. BRYAN: The district plans to keep its costs down by borrowing the design for its new school from one that had been built last year in a nearby town. That school. . . SMITH: Was built about $211 a square foot. When we opened bids on this same school it was $280. BRYAN: In other words, the new Tongue River would cost about a third more than the same school designed last year, just 30 miles away. It's a problem of supply and demand. This year there's almost as much construction work in energy boom states like Wyoming as there was in 2008. But back then, there were about 6 million Americans working in commercial construction. Now there's only about four and half million. RON KAISER: Usually there's people waiting and willing to come to work. I've been with the business since '99 and it's the worst I've seen. BRYAN: Ron Kaiser is the vice president of Mike's Electric. One of the contractors that bid high on the new school. He's so busy I had to catch up with him at a job site on the other side of town. He says, he's had to raise benefits to attract enough workers. KAISER: What's really strange, you go in to an interview and they're actually interviewing you instead of you interviewing them. MIKE GLAVIN: If you're a very highly skilled welder you can pretty much write your own ticket. BRYAN: Mike Glavin is a senior manager with the Associated Builders and Contractors. He says, that after construction took a nosedive six years ago, a lot of skilled workers left the business and they haven't come back. And many of the workers that did stay were older and now they're starting to eye retirement. GLAVIN: That's another concern that a lot of contractors are looking at five to 10 years from now, where the folks that they have are going to be leaving the industry and they don't necessarily see a  replacement for those folks. BRYAN: One possible replacement is Michael Swanson. He's an apprentice electrician currently working a summer job, rewiring the University of Wyoming's engineering building. Swanson actually studied engineering at college for a year but he says, it was because he felt like he had to. MICHAEL SWANSON: They almost made it seem like you either go to college or you amount to nothing, coming from teachers, from parents, from other kids. It's just pretty much either you go to school or you end up working at McDonald's. BRYAN: Swanson says, being an electrician is really satisfying both intellectually and financially. SWANSON: I can take time off when I need. I don't have to work overtime without being paid like I would a salary job, like an engineer. BRYAN: And Swanson says, as an apprentice he's making $26 an hour. SWANSON: I mean, I'm already - I'm saving up for a house, I plan on buying soon because of this job. BRYAN: But there needs to be a lot more young people like Swanson in the near future to meet demand. In Wyoming and all around the U. S. Swanson says, that when he started his apprenticeship program it could hold 60 students, but only 20 enrolled and only 12 graduated. The Associated Builders and Contractors estimates the construction industry is facing a shortage of almost 2 million skilled workers by the end of the decade. For NPR News, I'm Miles Bryan in Laramy.

On average, they make less money and have far less job security than previous generations. We have a story now about one of those men. For the last three decades, he has worked hard, but somehow it hasn't been enough, as NPR's Kelly McEvers reports. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: His name is Lynn - Lynn Eldredge. And in 1985, he got married and joined the Air Force. After five years of active duty, the plan was the same as it was for a lot of men - get a job and slowly move up the ladder. LYNN ELDREDGE: And then I went to job service here in Wichita. And they said, oh, come back Tuesday or a certain day, and we'll - we have a special program for veterans. And I said, no, I need a job today. MCEVERS: It was 1991, and for high school graduate like Lynn, the job was at a factory, making small tractors called skid-steer loaders for a company called Case. Do you remember what the starting pay was? ELDREDGE: Twelve dollars and one cent. MCEVERS: That's $21 an hour in today's money, plus overtime. ELDREDGE: This is our old house right here, where these people are. MCEVERS: Oh, yeah. We're driving around Wichita, checking out Lynn's old life. When he got the job at Case, he had two kids and a small two-bedroom house in a humble middle-class neighborhood. ELDREDGE: I wish my house payment was still $400 a month. (Laughing). MCEVERS: We head to the outskirts of Wichita, to the factory where Lynn used to work. ELDREDGE: I haven't driven this way to work in 15 years. Let's see how well I do. MCEVERS: We park the car, and Lynn tells me how he loved putting on steel-toed boots and safety glasses every day and going to work. ELDREDGE: You had the raw steel coming in one door and brand-new machines going out the door next to it, ready to ship around the world. MCEVERS: Lynn says, it was satisfying to make something, to come home covered in grease and sweat. But it was also about being with the guys. ELDREDGE: Working at night, we'd have lunch - a half-hour lunch - and we'd go out in the parking lot. My friend would bring his telescope, and we'd look at stars at night for a half-hour. MCEVERS: Lynn eventually got promoted, worked days, made a salary. He had two more kids, moved to a bigger house in a better part of Wichita. Then a relative died suddenly, and Lynn went out-of-state for the funeral. ELDREDGE: And when we got back, my manager called me into his office - I think he waited a couple of days, but I was still pretty emotional - and got the paperwork. And it was a generous severance package. MCEVERS: The manager said, Case was being bought by a company called New Holland Construction. Lynn and hundreds of other people were laid off company-wide. ELDREDGE: I remember driving home with tears in my eyes. It's making me sad right now. MCEVERS: Now it's time to leave Wichita and go to Cedar City, Utah. Since he got laid off, Lynn has had six different jobs, and let's just say he has not necessarily been moving up that ladder. First, he got a job at a company selling the same skid-steer loaders he made in the Case factory. That job lasted 10 months. Then he worked for a cell phone company, a soymilk plant, a nail file factory and now he manages facilities at five fast food restaurants in southern Utah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All right. Now I can go? MCEVERS: We're inside one of the fast food joints, climbing a ladder to the roof so Lynn can change the filters on the air conditioner. ELDREDGE: Most AC problems have nothing to do with the Freon or the coolant. It's taking good care of it. MCEVERS: Lynn says, he still likes his work. He likes coming home and telling his wife about a problem he solved. Thing is - he makes about $50,000 a year - the same amount of money in real dollars he was making when he got laid off 14 years ago. At 50 years old, he has no benefits and no retirement. His wife went back for a degree and now teaches elementary school. She recently started a retirement plan. Two of the kids are going to college next year. Lynn and his wife can't help with tuition. Back inside, Lynn says, it's sad sometimes when he realizes he's not the provider he was before. ELDREDGE: It's hard when the end of the month comes and you have to say, sorry, we can't go out to dinner. We need to just get through this weekend, and we'll be all right. I mean, things are tight. MCEVERS: In some ways, Lynn's life is like a checklist of what's happening to most American men who are not working high-paid white-collar jobs. Wages stayed the same or got a little worse - check. Benefits disappeared - check. Debt went up - check. Wife head to start working - check. Kids have their own debt now - check. MCEVERS: Here's the thing, though. Lynn and his wife are happy. They love each other. They love their kids. They have a nice place to live. The future's not totally certain, but Lynn still has big plans, like one day working for charity and helping people. The only real thing that's changed when he thinks about the future, Lynn says, is that it's a future with less then he imagined. Kelly McEvers, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:   So as we just heard, for men working blue-collar jobs, it's become harder to get ahead. On average, they make less money and have far less job security than previous generations. We have a story now about one of those men. For the last three decades, he has worked hard, but somehow it hasn't been enough, as NPR's Kelly McEvers reports. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: His name is Lynn - Lynn Eldredge. And in 1985, he got married and joined the Air Force. After five years of active duty, the plan was the same as it was for a lot of men - get a job and slowly move up the ladder. LYNN ELDREDGE: And then I went to job service here in Wichita. And they said, oh, come back Tuesday or a certain day, and we'll - we have a special program for veterans. And I said, no, I need a job today. MCEVERS: It was 1991, and for high school graduate like Lynn, the job was at a factory, making small tractors called skid-steer loaders for a company called Case. Do you remember what the starting pay was? ELDREDGE: Twelve dollars and one cent. MCEVERS: That's $21 an hour in today's money, plus overtime. ELDREDGE: This is our old house right here, where these people are. MCEVERS: Oh, yeah. We're driving around Wichita, checking out Lynn's old life. When he got the job at Case, he had two kids and a small two-bedroom house in a humble middle-class neighborhood. ELDREDGE: I wish my house payment was still $400 a month. (Laughing). MCEVERS: We head to the outskirts of Wichita, to the factory where Lynn used to work. ELDREDGE: I haven't driven this way to work in 15 years. Let's see how well I do. MCEVERS: We park the car, and Lynn tells me how he loved putting on steel-toed boots and safety glasses every day and going to work. ELDREDGE: You had the raw steel coming in one door and brand-new machines going out the door next to it, ready to ship around the world. MCEVERS: Lynn says, it was satisfying to make something, to come home covered in grease and sweat. But it was also about being with the guys. ELDREDGE: Working at night, we'd have lunch - a half-hour lunch - and we'd go out in the parking lot. My friend would bring his telescope, and we'd look at stars at night for a half-hour. MCEVERS: Lynn eventually got promoted, worked days, made a salary. He had two more kids, moved to a bigger house in a better part of Wichita. Then a relative died suddenly, and Lynn went out-of-state for the funeral. ELDREDGE: And when we got back, my manager called me into his office - I think he waited a couple of days, but I was still pretty emotional - and got the paperwork. And it was a generous severance package. MCEVERS: The manager said, Case was being bought by a company called New Holland Construction. Lynn and hundreds of other people were laid off company-wide. ELDREDGE: I remember driving home with tears in my eyes. It's making me sad right now. MCEVERS: Now it's time to leave Wichita and go to Cedar City, Utah. Since he got laid off, Lynn has had six different jobs, and let's just say he has not necessarily been moving up that ladder. First, he got a job at a company selling the same skid-steer loaders he made in the Case factory. That job lasted 10 months. Then he worked for a cell phone company, a soymilk plant, a nail file factory and now he manages facilities at five fast food restaurants in southern Utah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All right. Now I can go? MCEVERS: We're inside one of the fast food joints, climbing a ladder to the roof so Lynn can change the filters on the air conditioner. ELDREDGE: Most AC problems have nothing to do with the Freon or the coolant. It's taking good care of it. MCEVERS: Lynn says, he still likes his work. He likes coming home and telling his wife about a problem he solved. Thing is - he makes about $50,000 a year - the same amount of money in real dollars he was making when he got laid off 14 years ago. At 50 years old, he has no benefits and no retirement. His wife went back for a degree and now teaches elementary school. She recently started a retirement plan. Two of the kids are going to college next year. Lynn and his wife can't help with tuition. Back inside, Lynn says, it's sad sometimes when he realizes he's not the provider he was before. ELDREDGE: It's hard when the end of the month comes and you have to say, sorry, we can't go out to dinner. We need to just get through this weekend, and we'll be all right. I mean, things are tight.

The job market is often portrayed as a snapshot - a brief moment in time. The unemployment rate moves up or down a notch. A single month's job growth is better or worse than forecasters had predicted. But there is a long unfolding story about employment in America that often gets overlooked. It's the story of men opting out of work altogether. Here's NPR's Uri Berliner. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: After World War II, it was a great time to be an American man in the workplace. Hiring was strong for white-collar jobs and factory work. Industries like autos, aviation and steel were booming. (SOUNDBITE OF INDUSTRY CLIP FROM US STEEL PLANT)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: To Jim Robbins, making steel for America is a job with a future. Jim, planning for the future, is filled with determination to make way for tomorrow. And the industry in which he serves is also a part of that tomorrow. BERLINER: That industry clip from a U. S. steel plant expresses the optimism of the times. Nicholas Eberstadt is an economist with the American Enterprise Institute. He says if you were a man in the 1950s, you had a job. Or if you lost it, you started looking for another one. NICHOLAS EBERSTADT: If you weren't in the Army and you weren't in jail, you were very very likely working. And there was probably a good reason for why you were not seeking work and not working, if that was the case. BERLINER: But by the 1960s that started to change. Men began leaving the workforce. If they couldn't find jobs, some men simply stopped looking. And ever since, more and more men have been opting out of work. That's a fact not in dispute anywhere across the ideological spectrum. Here's Eberstadt of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. EBERSTADT: This has been going on now for just about half a century. BERLINER: And Heidi Shierholz of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: We've been seeing this just long - decades-long decline in men's labor force participation. BERLINER: That decline has been relentless, persisting through recessions and even in periods of strong growth and job creation, like the 1990s. EBERSTADT: So it's happened during good times. It's happened during bad times. BERLINER: The departure from work can't be explained away by factors like men retiring earlier or young men staying in school longer to get more degrees. Back in the 1950s, just 3 percent of men in their prime working years - that's considered 25 to 54 - were out of work and not seeking employment. Last year, that number was 12 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE BIG LEBOWSKI\")DAVID HUDDLESTON: (As Jeffrey Lebowski) Are you employed, sir? JEFF BRIDGES: (As The Dude) Employed? (Laughing). HUDDLESTON: (As Jeffrey Lebowski) You don't go out looking for a job dressed like that, do you? On a weekday? BRIDGES: (As The Dude) Is this the - what day is this? BERLINER: That's the ultimate slacker - the Dude in the movie \"The Big Lebowski. \" Obviously, an extreme case - back in the real world, as more men opted out of the workforce for whatever their reasons, women streamed in. And at the same time, they've been obtaining more education. The most recent figures show nearly 60 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the U. S. are earned by women. MIT economist David Autor says women have responded to an increasingly demanding job market by getting more education - men not so much. DAVID AUTOR: You might say well, why haven't men responded more effectively? Why haven't they educated better - more? Why haven't they moved into higher-wage occupations? And that is less clear. BERLINER: As might be expected, economists don't agree on why so many men have left the workforce. Some possible factors they cite - there's less of a stigma today if a man doesn't work. Union clout has declined. More men are in early retirement, receiving disability benefits. New technology has eliminated manufacturing jobs and competition from abroad moved others overseas. Economist David Autor says many service jobs that remain in restaurants and retail, for example, don't pay as well as the factory jobs that disappeared. AUTOR: The most important factor, I would say, behind declining male employment rates is declining wages for less educated workers. BERLINER: So what can be done? Certainly, more education and better education would make a difference, but that's long-term. Autor says a smaller fix might help. He suggests expanding the earned-income tax credit. That's the subsidy that rewards low-income workers when they find jobs and keep them. But right now, it primarily benefits women and children, not single men. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

At a meeting in New York, the U. S. Conference of Mayors released a new report on jobs and income inequality, prepared by the research firm IHS Global Insight. It finds that although the country has recovered the nearly nine million jobs lost in the recession, the jobs gained, on average, pay less - 23 percent less. We wanted to know what this means in one community, so we reached out to Nan Whaley. She's the mayor of Dayton, Ohio and she began by describing what sorts of jobs her region lost in the recession and how many. MAYOR NAN WHALEY: We lost literally thousands and not only General Motors, but also Delphi, which was the supplier that provided parts to General Motors. We had around five of those plants in the region. And they were mostly manufacturing plants. And so Western Ohio - you know, we hear a lot about Detroit, but also in Western Ohio, we saw significant job loss through the recession. BLOCK: And since then, what kinds of jobs have you seen coming back? WHALEY: Well, we've seen some manufacturing jobs but not nearly the pace compared to logistics and warehouse jobs coming. So, you know, Dayton sits on the crossroads of I-70 and I-75. So we have Payless Shoe stores, for example. Trucks come in, move those supplies to get to the next place. And the same with Procter & Gamble and Caterpillar - we're seeing a lot of that kind of logistics, which honestly, it's a job-growth area for us. We did not have logistics in Dayton before. So it's been a success, but the wages are less. And so I think that just iterates what's going on across the country, right? The wage gap is there because what - the jobs that are being replaced from the jobs lost are just lower-wage level. BLOCK: And if you're getting a manufacturing job now compared to the job you might've had before the recession, would it be paying on an adjusted scale? Would it be paying the same, better, worse? WHALEY: The manufacturing jobs are still paying very well but the difference now is - and we talk a lot about this because manufacturing is still key in Ohio - it's not your father's factory. So it requires a further degree. And so these aren't jobs in manufacturing that you can just get coming out of high school. They require at least an associates or some sort of certification. And they pay well, but there's just not as many of them. BLOCK: Mayor Whaley, you have been the mayor of Dayton since January, but you've lived there for 20 years now. How different does the city feel today compared with when you first got there? WHALEY: Well, I think that cities like Dayton and cities across the country, we see just a - a vaporization of the middle class. You know, as my parents were able to have good paying jobs that were hourly instead of salary, but still able to put me and my brother through college - that dream is getting further and further away. And so we see that every day with people struggling, having to take more than one job on, really having to make some really tough decisions about their family. And I don't think Dayton is unique in any sense than other cities across the country with that issue. BLOCK: The city commission in Dayton, I gather, has passed a resolution that would support federal legislation to raise the minimum wage to $10. 10 an hour. How do you balance getting a better wage for workers with putting too large a burden on employers - making the climate business unfriendly? WHALEY: Well, I think that study after study has shown that if you raise the minimum wage to $10. 10 that, you know, it actually creates opportunity and creates more jobs. And that's what we're trying to do. And frankly, it's right when you think about that most of the people receiving minimum wage are women and the burden of women today on taking care of their family in addition to having this really low pay. The minimum wage does not equal a wage that you can take care of yourself, much less anyone else. And so we have to be real about what's going on in our communities by saying that that minimum wage is a real fair bottom because frankly, it's not. BLOCK: I've been talking with Nan Whaley. She is the mayor of Dayton, Ohio and a Democrat. Mayor Whaley, thanks for being with us. WHALEY: Thanks. It's my pleasure.

But brick-and-mortar stores in many states say they still need an annual sales tax holiday to lure shoppers getting ready for fall classes. Kaomi Goetz of our member station, WSHU, reports. KAOMI GOETZ, BYLINE: Marcella Ryan and her 8-year-old daughter, Megan, are at a Gymboree kid's  clothing store in Stamford, Connecticut. They're looking at a black and white dress. MARCELLA RYAN: Would you wear this for school? MEGAN RYAN: Probably. GOETZ: The mother presses her soon-to-be third grader for a little more feedback. RYAN: What do you like about it? RYAN: I like that it has, like, the zipper in the back. RYAN: OK. Do - you can wear this. This is not too short, right? RYAN: I don't think so. RYAN: OK. GOETZ: The Ryan family is visiting from Virginia. The week before, they also shopped during their own state's back-to-school sales tax holiday. Like Connecticut, Virginia is 1 of 17 states that have an annual tax-free shopping event before the start of school. Each state had its own rules and tax rates. The holidays can last one weekend to a full week, with some starting in late July and others holding off until September. Shopper Marcella Ryan says she's a fan even if stores are more crowded. RYAN: I think tax holidays are a good idea because you're saving at the end of the day. And you're able to buy more. GOETZ: Back-to-school shopping is a $26 billion a year business nationwide. This year, the National Retail Federation says families will spend an average of $670. That's up 5 percent over last year. Craig Shearman is with the NRF. He says with sales tax rates at 5 to 10 percent, a temporary break doesn't compare to a typical store promotion of 20 or 30 percent off. But it's still effective because customers appreciate the help. CRAIG SHEARMAN: They love it. There's a psychological impact that goes far beyond the amount of money involved. GOETZ: And brick-and-mortar stores say having a tax-free holiday helps them better compete with online retailers, many of whom don't have to collect state taxes. But a lot of economists are skeptical. Liz Malm with The Tax Foundation, a research group, says the tax holidays don't make a difference. LIZ MALM: Many studies find that consumers are buying what they would have bought anyway but just doing it at a different time. GOETZ: The first sales tax holidays began in the 1980s. Malm says they've stuck around because they're politically popular but support may be eroding. North Carolina ended its back-to-school sales tax holiday this year as part of an overall tax reform. Republican state representative John Szoka was one of the bill's sponsors. He says for a dozen years, taxpayers were basically subsidizing retailers advertising. This is the first year without the holiday. He says retailers in his town of Fayetteville are still offering huge discounts. REPRESENTATIVE JOHN SZOKA: You know, a sales tax incentive on top of the sales like that isn't really going to urge somebody to go buy something. GOETZ: Instead, Szoka says lawmakers were able to use that $13 million to reduce other taxes. Holiday supporters say the repeal just sends shoppers across the state line to South Carolina during that state's holiday. HERLEN LUCIEN: That's cute. I need a whole outfit. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Then get the pants if you don't like. . . LUCIEN: But you know I'm not - I'm not paying full price though. GOETZ: Back in the shopping mall in Connecticut, Herlen Lucien is school shopping for her daughter who's about to start kindergarten. LUCIEN: I usually come right here to these two racks that says 60 percent off. GOETZ: Lucien says she doesn't give her state's tax-free holiday much thought. She saves money by buying off-season throughout the year. LUCIEN: For people that, like, wait to the last minute, I think it might be helpful for them. But I don't wait until the last minute. GOETZ: Connecticut's tax-free holiday is among the most generous. The state forgoes taxes on clothes and shoes priced up to $300. Lucien says that might convince her to buy a more expensive item, like a pair of sneakers or boots. For NPR News, I'm Kaomi Goetz.

GOETZ: The Ryan family is visiting from Virginia. The week before, they also shopped during their own state's back-to-school sales tax holiday. Like Connecticut, Virginia is 1 of 17 states that have an annual tax-free shopping event before the start of school. Each state had its own rules and tax rates. The holidays can last one weekend to a full week, with some starting in late July and others holding off until September. Shopper Marcella Ryan says she's a fan even if stores are more crowded. RYAN: I think tax holidays are a good idea because you're saving at the end of the day. And you're able to buy more. GOETZ: Back-to-school shopping is a $26 billion a year business nationwide. This year, the National Retail Federation says families will spend an average of $670. That's up 5 percent over last year. Craig Shearman is with the NRF. He says with sales tax rates at 5 to 10 percent, a temporary break doesn't compare to a typical store promotion of 20 or 30 percent off. But it's still effective because customers appreciate the help. CRAIG SHEARMAN: They love it. There's a psychological impact that goes far beyond the amount of money involved. GOETZ: And brick-and-mortar stores say having a tax-free holiday helps them better compete with online retailers, many of whom don't have to collect state taxes. But a lot of economists are skeptical. Liz Malm with The Tax Foundation, a research group, says the tax holidays don't make a difference. LIZ MALM: Many studies find that consumers are buying what they would have bought anyway but just doing it at a different time. GOETZ: The first sales tax holidays began in the 1980s. Malm says they've stuck around because they're politically popular but support may be eroding. North Carolina ended its back-to-school sales tax holiday this year as part of an overall tax reform. Republican state representative John Szoka was one of the bill's sponsors. He says for a dozen years, taxpayers were basically subsidizing retailers advertising. This is the first year without the holiday. He says retailers in his town of Fayetteville are still offering huge discounts. REPRESENTATIVE JOHN SZOKA: You know, a sales tax incentive on top of the sales like that isn't really going to urge somebody to go buy something. GOETZ: Instead, Szoka says lawmakers were able to use that $13 million to reduce other taxes. Holiday supporters say the repeal just sends shoppers across the state line to South Carolina during that state's holiday. HERLEN LUCIEN: That's cute. I need a whole outfit. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Then get the pants if you don't like. . . LUCIEN: But you know I'm not - I'm not paying full price though. GOETZ: Back in the shopping mall in Connecticut, Herlen Lucien is school shopping for her daughter who's about to start kindergarten. LUCIEN: I usually come right here to these two racks that says 60 percent off. GOETZ: Lucien says she doesn't give her state's tax-free holiday much thought. She saves money by buying off-season throughout the year. LUCIEN: For people that, like, wait to the last minute, I think it might be helpful for them. But I don't wait until the last minute. GOETZ: Connecticut's tax-free holiday is among the most generous. The state forgoes taxes on clothes and shoes priced up to $300. Lucien says that might convince her to buy a more expensive item, like a pair of sneakers or boots. For NPR News, I'm Kaomi Goetz.", "section": "Business", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

The state ranks fourth in the country for generating power from wind. Still, wind developers in the northeast corner of the state are facing stiff opposition from an unlikely pair of allies - environmentalists and the oil industry. Joe Wertz of StateImpact reports. JOE WERTZ, BYLINE: Its bison breeding season in Oklahoma. The males are rowdy. The females are frisky. Bob Hamilton says this is the time when horns lock and fur flies. BOB HAMILTON: What that big guys doing is he's telling everybody this is my girl. Stay away. WERTZ: Hamilton is the director of the Nature Conservancy's Tall Grass Prairie Preserve which has been fighting to block construction of a 68 turbine wind farm. HAMILTON: It's a real estate issue. Location - location - location. So where you put industrial wind development can be a tremendously critical decision, especially, if you're talking about at-risk species and ecosystems that are at risk. WERTZ: Hamilton says a wind farm, even if it's miles away, could destroy the habitats of birds and grouse, like the greater prairie chicken and fragment the wide-open prairie. JOE BUSH: They talk about fragmenting prairie and such, but it doesn't fragment the Prairie any worse than oil will fragment. WERTZ: Landowner Joe Bush has already leased out land for two wind farm projects, including the one nature preserve is fighting. Bush says no other landowner should be able to tell him what to do with his property. BUSH: Stay on your side of the fence. That's not how we do things in America. It's capitalism. It's America - private property is our heritage. WERTZ: Wind farms are common in western parts of the state, but they're new to this region. There's always been some local resistance from residents who don't want their views ruined by spinning turbines. But Oklahoma's wind energy debate is most magnified in a Osage County, the slice of prairie that Joe Bush and the nature preserve share. Osage county is also home to a powerful opponent of wind farm developments. Everett Waller is a tribal leader with the Osage Nation. EVERETT WALLER: The side is the problem. It's not the alternate energy, the wind energy - anything of that fact. WERTZ: While the tribe is worried that wind farm construction could hurt wildlife and disturb native remains and artifacts, one of its biggest concerns is oil. While many nontribal residents like Joe Bush own land in Osage county, the tribal members own most of the mineral rights. Waller says wind farms above ground could block drilling and pumping the oil and gas belowground. WALLER: I have a job, as chairman of the Minerals Council, to protect my shareholders. This is a business. We're in the oil business. WERTZ: Oklahoma isn't the only state trying to balance an economically vital oil and gas industry with the promising wind industry. Texas is the country's number one producer of oil and wind energy. Rod Wetsel, an attorney professor at the University of Texas who wrote the book on Texas wind law, says property rights in petroleum states were written with the oil and gas industry in mind. ROD WETSEL: That's a doctrine that's really hard to explain to wind companies that are from Europe or being financed by lenders in New York - that hey, you better watch out because these oil companies might be able to interfere with your building of the project. WERTZ: Right now, state regulators have started discussing whether Oklahoma should have stricter rules for wind projects. But Wetsel says even oil and gas states have resisted regulating the wind industry because, ideally, they'd like to find room for a turbine and an oil well.

Is it time to back off the policy of monetary stimulus - which has held the Fed's benchmark interest rates near zero percent for almost six years? And have those very low interest rates made fixed interest securities, bonds so unattractive that investors have put too much money into equity stocks. In other words, is that 17,000 Dow evidence of a bubble and an omen of bad things to come or is it confirmation of a stronger economy in which companies are earning more money, which naturally pushes up the value of their stocks? Well, we're going to put those questions now to Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton, who is a former vice chairman of the board of governors of the Fed, and he is in Jackson Hole. Welcome to the program once again. ALAN BLINDER: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: Are equities now in a bubble? BLINDER: Well, you know, a lot of people are asking that question and the truth is nobody knows. I mean, some of this is surely due to the super low interest rates which can't last forever, although they will I believe last for a little while longer, and part of it is definitely due to the performance of U. S. companies. As we all know profits are way up and stock markets are supposed be discounting profits. So it's not very surprising that it's high right now. SIEGEL: But bubbles burst. I mean, would you be astonished if one day the Dow dropped by you know, a thousand points? BLINDER: A thousand would be - I would be astounded, but if it dropped 350 in a day I wouldn't be - no, but I'd be alarmed. Stock markets do trend upwards over long periods of time, but there are dips for sure. I guess I would call attention as Janet Yellin did in the testimony - there is a corner of the stock market, which at least to me looks very bubbly, but maybe it's because I'm an old guy and that's some of these tech stocks. SIEGEL: Well, let's say that the voices calling for the Fed to change course prevail sometime soon. Would the Fed be able to sell off all of those treasury bonds it's been buying for years in some kind of gradual, orderly way or is the exit strategy terra incognita and potentially a very difficult time? BLINDER: It is technically terra incognita. The Fed has never had a portfolio anything remotely close to this size. But I don't think it's that complicated. Think about how the Fed got all these assets - how did it get them? Well, it when out in the open market and it bought them. So when it decides it needs to unload large amount, and that time is not with us yet by the way, but when it does the Fed's going to go out there and sell. So you know, I think a reasonable way to think of it is doing in reverse what they've already done. SIEGEL: What they've been doing for several years, does that mean they'd be doing the other for several years? BLINDER: Well, they may take several years. You know, actually the Fed party line to which I don't subscribe is - they won't have to sell any at all - that it'll just run off by natural maturity. You know, two year bonds take two years and they pay off. And the Fed is claiming that that'll be enough and they won't actually have to go actively selling. I frankly, don't believe that, but I don't think they're going to be selling a $1 trillion in a short period of time. SIEGEL: I'm just curious - when you say that now is not the time, this is not the time that the Fed is going to reverse course - what are the indicators out there? What are the numbers that make it so clear to Janet Yellin and to you as well, that this is not the time? BLINDER: Well, I think you start, as Janet Yellin always does, by looking at the labor market. And we've got a 6. 2 percent unemployment rate, which is a lot better than it was, but still high. Secondly, you look at the GDP and while we had a nice quarter last quarter, we had a horrific quarter the previous quarter. And the first half of this year we had very, very slow growth. You look at the rate of inflation, you look at the rate of wage increases, and they're all turning up a bit but not dramatically and in particular, the inflation measure that the Fed favors is still well below the Fed's target.

They are attending Kansas City Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. For a preview, we turn as we often do to David Wessel of the Brookings Institution and the Wall Street Journal. David, great to talk to you again. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So you've covered the Fed's Jackson Hole conference many times before. It gets a lot of attention - is that just because it's this gorgeous mountain spot? WESSEL: Yes, that's definitely part of it. GREENE: (Laughter). OK, good. WESSEL: It's easier to get people to go to the Grand Tetons in August to say, a ballroom in Manhattan. GREENE: Yeah, I can imagine. WESSEL: And the TV cameras just love the backdrop you know, a dull looking Federal Reserve official with the mountains in the background. GREENE: (Laughter). WESSEL: It's also very exclusive. You have to be invited. The formal sessions are not live streamed or broadcast, so if you're not in a room you can't know what's going on. And on top of that, the conference has in the past been the venues of some very influential academic papers and importantly, during the financial crisis, Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, used it as a forum to send some pretty important messages about the direction of monetary policy. Now, this year the focus is on the job market. Janet Yellen, the new Fed chair, is going to talk about that tomorrow morning. But there may actually be more attention on what Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has to say given the latest round of disappointing economic news from Europe. GREENE: OK, given that context and given that jobs are big on the economic agenda - what exactly are central bankers focusing on it now? WESSEL: Well, even the titles of the papers and the academics who are giving them are embargoed until tonight. Somehow this new Fed transparency hasn't quite penetrated the Kansas City Fed yet. But there are a couple of salient issues. There's a lot of debate about how much damage the great recession did to the job market and to workers. How much we're seeing today in youth unemployment, long-term unemployment, idle middle-aged men not even looking for work, sluggish wage increases - all that stuff. How much is a long-term trend and how much can be undone once the world economy heals. As John Ydstie said, for the Fed, the big issue now is how quickly the job market is healing and thus how soon should the Fed begin to move interest rates up. You know, it's been keeping interest rates at zero since December 2008 and the signals are they're going to stay there until the middle of next year. GREENE: You mention wage increases being sluggish - I mean, even in an economy, that sounds like something the Fed be worried about. Is there anything the Fed can do to actually help in terms of wages? WESSEL: Well, you're right, the Fed is worried about it. Janet Yellin has talked about it. The Fed tracks wage trends closely in part because they're an important inflation indicator, but they're also a reflection of how close the economy is to full capacity. And also, in a well-functioning economy, wages should be rising particularly when productivity is going up. And the latest government data show average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation have not increased at all in the last year, even though we're told the economy is getting better and other wage measures show similar trends. Now the Fed can't really do anything to get wages up, what it can do is wait to raise interest rates until the job market's healthier and that's what they're debating now - should they wait a while longer? Or some people are getting restless. GREENE: David, this is the kind of place where I can imagine people you know, enjoying the outdoors, and golfing and having drinks and dinner, but a lot of actually substantive conversation going on at those things? WESSEL: That's right. The cocktail parties and the hiking and golf - people do talk about stuff. I think what they're going to talk about is how soon will the Fed raise interest rates and are the people who want to raise them sooner getting traction inside the Fed's policy committee. But I'll bet much of the conversation will be about Europe. When the bank of England would raise interest rates - they're going to probably going to move before the Fed. And how sick is the European banking system and what can the European Central Bank do to get their Eurozone economy back on track. They're really having a hard time, and they're suffering a lot from the sanctions imposed on and by Russia in connection to the Ukraine. GREENE: All right, we've been speaking with David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributor at the Wall Street Journal. David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome.

Kelly, when you are not hosting for NPR, you are covering inequality and economic diversity - a really interesting beat. What have you been working on? KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Well, this month I was interested in some reports showing that the gap between rich and poor is still getting wider. And one report by a major ratings agency that says this gap will only slow down our already sluggish economic recovery. So one question I had was whether place had anything to do with it - if where you live affects where you stand on this inequality scale. So I started off by talking to economist Enrico Moretti of the University of California-Berkeley. He wrote a book called \"The New Geography Of Jobs. \" And he told me in some U. S. cities, the economic picture is actually pretty great. ENRICO MORETTI: These are cities like San Francisco or Seattle, Boston or Raleigh-Durham. MCEVERS: Cities that are what he calls innovation hubs - places where IT, software, science research, finance and marketing companies drive economic growth. In other cities, like former manufacturing hubs, the picture is not so good. MORETTI: Detroit, Flint, Cleveland - where wages are falling and populations are shrinking. MCEVERS: Moretti says the differences between the winning cities and the losing cities are pretty startling. MORETTI: If you are a waiter, you can make twice as much in Austin relative to Flint. And the same is true if you are an architect, a real estate agent or pretty much any other job. Salaries are different. MCEVERS: It's a difference that's only getting worse, he says. One we simply didn't have a half a century ago when there were thriving industries, like steel, that supported a big middle class across the country. And when it seemed like wages would always be rising. It was in this period, the 60s, when David Breedlove graduated from Stanford University with a degree in industrial engineering. He got a job at a company that made business forms with carbon paper inside and moved to a nice little town next to Stanford. DAVID BREEDLOVE: We owned a house in the premium good area of Menlo Park in a little two-bedroom house that we put a $8,000 down on a $28,000 house. MCEVERS: That's $180,000 house in today's dollars. One day, in 1969, David's boss came to him and said. . . BREEDLOVE: We've got a plant down in Visalia that needs a plant industrial engineer. MCEVERS: . . . About 200 miles south and east of Menlo Park. BREEDLOVE: Do want to take a ride down there? And I said yes. MCEVERS: At the time, Visalia wasn't a whole lot different from Menlo Park and the other towns near Stanford. BREEDLOVE: It was a law-and-order town, very well-run city - still is - low crime. We congratulated ourselves for a number of years that we had done a good thing. MCEVERS: David and his wife sold the house in Menlo Park, bought a slightly bigger one in Visalia and had two kids. But then in 1977, the paper company wasn't doing all that well. BREEDLOVE: And my job sort of dissolved out from under me. MCEVERS: After that, David did all kinds of different jobs. He did some computer programming, and he ran an outfitting service in the mountains. As the years went on, the economy in Visalia got worse. It's a big agriculture town where farm owners do well, but their workers make low wages. David's daughter saw these growing disparities at school. BREEDLOVE: When she came home and told me about her teammates in junior high track and soccer, she was aware of the fact that more than half of them were from homes that barely had enough to eat. MCEVERS: By the time the kids went to college, David and his wife split. It was the 90s. And David realized that, in some ways, he regretted moving to Visalia. Back near Menlo Park, a thing called Silicon Valley was taking off. BREEDLOVE: I still think of Menlo Park and Palo Alto - that's the center of the universe. MCEVERS: After talked to David, I went to see that house in Menlo Park. (SOUNDBITE OF GPS)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE #1: The destination is on your left. MCEVERS: . . . The one he bought for $180,000 in today's dollars but then sold in 1969. So here it is. It's a double car garage, wooden front door - pretty standard two-story house - three bedrooms, one bathroom, 1200 square feet. According to the Internet real estate website Trulia, it's worth 2. 3 million dollars. Here's the thing about David's story. He didn't know it at the time, but when he sold that house and moved away from Menlo Park, he was leaving a place that would become one of the biggest economic success stories in the country. And to a place - the San Joaquin Valley of California - that now has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country. And the problem is, it's not like there's a magic formula to turn your city into an innovation hub, says economist Enrico Moretti. He says a lot of these successful cities just got lucky. MORETTI: When you look at the history of the big innovation clusters of America, you never see one that was deliberately created by a local government or a state government policy that said, hey, let's create, here, the next Silicon Valley. MCEVERS: What governments can do, Moretti says, is encourage people to move more - perhaps with incentives in their unemployment benefits. And to invest in the one thing that we know is a factor in why places succeed - education.

Arun Rath is away. I'm Tess Vigeland. The great recession officially ended in June of 2009 more than five years ago. Since then, the economy has created millions of jobs, but it's still not enough. Take a close look at employment figures, and you find that of all the people the government labels as full-time workers 6 to 11 percent of those are only full-time because they're cobbling together two or more part-time jobs. And that's the focus of our cover story today. The federal government says Stephanie Green is a full-time worker. She lives in San Diego with her four children aged 10 to 19. Two years ago, she divorced from an abusive husband, but that left her temporarily without a roof over her head. She lived in shelters until she found a job with a company that runs parking garages. STEPHANIE GREEN: And I just went and explained to them, like, this is my situation. You know, I'm currently homeless, and I'm trying to get myself on my feet for me and my kids. VIGELAND: Initially, the parking company gave her full-time hours. But it cut the entire staff down to part-time last year, citing the cost of the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act. Now, Green works three jobs - the parking company plus two jobs in security, all of which provides barely enough to make ends meet. GREEN: I do have Section 8, which does help tremendously with my rent. But they also went up at the beginning of the year. And so I can barely pay - I can pay the rent, but it's the other bills that I have that I have to struggle with. VIGELAND: She attended a for-profit school that she says provided a worthless education but left her with about $7,000 in debt. Her calendar is her lifeline. GREEN: There's been a couple of times where I have to go to one job in the morning, and I usually take my other uniforms in a backpack, change real quick, go to the other job right after. There's been days where I leave the house Sunday morning to go to one job, and I usually don't get back home till maybe Monday evening to see my kids. VIGELAND: Her older children provide childcare for the younger siblings. Douglas Hunter has one 16-year-old daughter and no one else to help care for her. He's 53, a widower, lives in Chicago and after a long career on factory floors, has spent the last five years working part-time for nine bucks an hour at a local McDonald's. DOUGLAS HUNTER: Trying to take care of my daughter, provide for her, have a roof over her head, that means I bring in like $360 every two weeks. And the rent is $775. And so it's a bit of a struggle. It's a struggle every day, all day, you know. And it's rough. VIGELAND: Hunter tells us the McDonald's job gives him 30 hours a week, sometimes 20. He fills in the gaps with odd jobs when he can get them but worries about not being home for his daughter when she's not in school. He scoffs at the notion that the economy is recovering. HUNTER: I was scrapping and scraping and stressing before the recession. I was scrapping and scraping and stressing during the recession. And I'm still scrapping and scraping and stressing. Nothing has changed for me. VIGELAND: None of this is a surprise to economist Susan Lambert of the University of Chicago, who studies how part-time jobs are affecting the economy. I asked her how the federal government determines who is a part-time worker. SUSAN LAMBERT: The Census Bureau - the Bureau of Labor Statistics both ask people how many hours do you usually work or how many hours did you work last week. And if you say 35 or more, they classify you as being a full-time worker. Now that doesn't mean that you have a full-time job, but that you're a full-time worker. If you've - report a number less than 35 hours, they ask you why. And the people give a range of reasons. And only if they say I'm working less than 35 hours because I couldn't find a full-time job or my employer cut my hours, are they classified as being what we call involuntary part-time. And, in fact, in the other studies, instead, what people are asked is a work hour preference - would you like to continue to work the same hours for the same pay, more hours for more pay, fewer hours for less pay. And when people are asked that question, a much larger proportion of people say I would like more hours for more pay. VIGELAND: Can you talk to us a little bit about what that part-time employment looks like now that maybe it didn't look like before - that there are new tactics the employers use to basically keep worker hours down? LAMBERT: So one of them is posting schedules with very little advance notice, just maybe a day or two in front of the work week. Changing schedules once posted makes it very difficult to arrange anything when you don't know when you're going to work. People will work different numbers of hours week to week, different days of the week, different shifts and so employers are turning to employees to fill in for short time slots during peak demand. And if they don't use you, they'll send you home early. They have people waiting on call more often so that you wait to call in to see if you're going to work that day. So fluctuating, unpredictable hours and then also what you mentioned before, the issue of a lot of people aren't getting enough hours. So even when they're that flexible and they're that available, they are really scrambling to get enough hours to earn a decent living. VIGELAND: What does all this mean for the overall economy when, you know, you have all these people working part-time jobs with weird hours, and no predictability, does that have a greater impact? LAMBERT: On the one hand, a lot of people are saying that any job is better than no job. And if we don't have these part-time jobs, and we concentrate the hours on a smaller percentage of workers, well, then we'll have higher rates of unemployment. On the other hand, and I tend to be in this other camp, is that I think that there is evidence to support that the way the economy is really grown is by a strong middle class. That when we have a middle-class who can afford goods, durable goods, and who are living beyond just trying to make their rent and feed their family, that that group of workers is what grows the economy in the United States. VIGELAND: Susan Lambert of the University of Chicago. And Stephanie Green, the mother of four we heard from earlier, well, she's hoping to enroll in an EMT class this fall adding to the calendar that already features three jobs. GREEN: Oh, yes, I'll find some way to do it, and I will go ahead and make it work. You know, I mean, I've struggled a lot but it's like, you know, just keep my faith up and you know, everything will work itself out. VIGELAND: As goes Stephanie Green, perhaps goes the U. S. economy.

At the time there were complaints that the government was doing more to prop up big banks than to help average people. As we're about to hear there is a government program to help homeowners save money by refinancing their mortgages. It's still available. A  million homeowners could still take advantage of it. Here's NPR's Chris Arnold. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: At a recent event at a church in Atlanta, former Congressman Mel Watt laid out the numbers. The refinancing program saves people who take advantage of it an average of $200 a month. But the program could still reach a lot more people. MEL WATT: Somebody going to give me $2,400 a year or more? And I'm going to turn it down? ARNOLD: Watt recently became the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. And so, he oversees this so-called HARP refinancing program. But he says some Americans who hear about this think it sounds kind of fishy. WATT: If you're paying your mortgage, you're current on your mortgage and somebody calls you on the phone and says you are eligible to refinance your mortgage and save $2,400 a year, what would you think? Oh, no. All these scams that we've heard about, this cannot be true. ARNOLD: But Watt says it is true. In fact about 3 million Americans so far have already refinanced through HARP. And so Mel Watt is speaking to community leaders in cities around the country to encourage more people to apply. WATT: There's 800,000 more families nationwide that would benefit from the HARP program, if they would just step forward. BOB WALTERS: Especially since interest rates have dropped some over the last number of months, it's even become that much more advantageous. ARNOLD: That Bob Walters, he's the chief economist with Quicken Loans. His company was aggressive early on trying to qualify homeowners for the HARP program back after it was launched 5 years ago. But he says there's another reason that many people aren't taking advantage of it. WALTERS: You get denied maybe once or twice and then all of the sudden you say, I can't qualify. ARNOLD: Walters says for a while the rules about who could qualify for the HARP refi program excluded a lot of people. Chris Mayer, a housing economist at Columbia University agrees. He says HARP in its first couple of years could've reached a lot more people if it was better designed. CHRIS MAYER: There've been people who lost their homes to foreclosures that were otherwise preventable. I've done calculations that would suggest that as many as 500,000 people could've stayed in their homes. ARNOLD: But that was then and now the roles are different and Bob Walters says that homeowners who want to save some money on their mortgage should give HARP a shot, even if they applied a couple years ago and couldn't qualify. WALTERS: Because the program has changed so much and has gotten so much more flexible, the opportunity for people to get approved is much higher but they don't know that. ARNOLD: Getting back to those scams that Mel Watt referred to, you should know that it doesn't cost anything to find out if you qualify for HARP. Any reputable lender can tell you that free of charge, you do need to have gotten your loan back before 2010. Meanwhile, Mel Watt is planning to visit Detroit and Miami in coming months to reach out to more homeowners. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

He says HARP in its first couple of years could've reached a lot more people if it was better designed. CHRIS MAYER: There've been people who lost their homes to foreclosures that were otherwise preventable. I've done calculations that would suggest that as many as 500,000 people could've stayed in their homes. ARNOLD: But that was then and now the roles are different and Bob Walters says that homeowners who want to save some money on their mortgage should give HARP a shot, even if they applied a couple years ago and couldn't qualify. WALTERS: Because the program has changed so much and has gotten so much more flexible, the opportunity for people to get approved is much higher but they don't know that. ARNOLD: Getting back to those scams that Mel Watt referred to, you should know that it doesn't cost anything to find out if you qualify for HARP. Any reputable lender can tell you that free of charge, you do need to have gotten your loan back before 2010. Meanwhile, Mel Watt is planning to visit Detroit and Miami in coming months to reach out to more homeowners.

Well, today the federal budget deficit seems to have faded, both as an economic issue and a political one. To find out what has changed, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, David. GREENE: So I think I know the answer to this question, but I'll ask it anyway. I mean, has a deficit problem somehow been solved here? WESSEL: No. You're right, it hasn't been. But there is some good news. The economy's been getting better. Congress raised some taxes. It's restrained spending more than some people had expected. And all that has combined to reduce the deficit for the current fiscal year. This year, revenues are expected to be 8 percent ahead of last year, but spending only 2 percent ahead of last year. So yesterday the Congressional Budget Office predicted that this year's deficit for the fiscal year that ends at the end of September will come in at around $500 billion. Now, that's a lot of money, but it's $170 billion less than last year's deficit. And it works out to 2. 9 percent of the gross domestic product. That's slightly below the average for the last 40 years, and it's a far cry from the nearly 10 percent of GDP deficits that we saw during worst of the recession. GREENE: OK. Well, what I'm getting from all that math there is pretty good news. Is there a but we should know about? WESSEL: There is a but. The problem is not today's budget deficit. The problem lies in the not-too-distant future. Look, the federal government borrowed a lot of money over the last several years, and it continues to borrow because it's spending more than it takes in. If you add up all the money the government has borrowed, the federal debt works out to be about 75 percent of the gross domestic product. That's twice what it was before the recession, higher than any time since 1950. Now, CBO says, it'll level off at that historically high level for a few years and then start to climb again as spending - particularly in health care - climbs faster than taxes under current law. So why do we worry about that? Well, in part because it means the government will have less maneuvering room if it ever wants to borrow heavily again to fight a recession or fight a war or something else expensive. So the problem isn't urgent, but it's not solved. GREENE: And part of the problem isn't the argument that many people have made that when you're borrowing a lot of money, you're  also paying a whole lot of interest. WESSEL: Exactly. This year CBO says that government will spend $230 billion - 7 percent of all federal spending - on interest. But interest rates are sure to rise over the next few years, and so by 2024 - 10 years from now - CBO says the interest tab will come close come to 800 billion, 14 percent of all federal spending, and that's money that won't be available for other things. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: You say 2024, David. I mean, we know these 10-year forecasts can always be wrong. They're revised in all sorts of ways. I  mean, hasn't a long-term outlook for the deficit been improving? WESSEL: It has been improving, largely because of a slowdown in the pace in which government health care spending has increased and because Congress has held down some other spending. But the 10-year forecasts are beginning to stabilize and the most interesting thing to me is, is something that The New York Times pointed out yesterday. A few years ago, CBO said Medicare would cost about $12,700 per beneficiary in 2019, five years from now. Today its best guess is 11 percent lower, $11,300, and with so many people on Medicare, that adds up to a lot of money. So - and also CBO now thinks interest rates in the future are going to be lower over the next decade than they previously forecasted. That also means smaller deficits than it had predicted. INSKEEP: We're also not seeing this discussed as much in the political realm. And I wonder, is that a calculation that both parties have made, that this isn't a good issue for them? Are we going to hear about the budget deficit in this fall's midterm elections? WESSEL: You know, it's kind of interesting. If you look at the polls, the public opinion polls, Americans still tell the pollsters that they worry a lot about the deficit. It usually racks right up there with jobs and the economy, though the angst is eased a bit from a few years ago. But from what I see in the campaign, the candidates seem to figure it's not a big issue. The folks who worry about the deficit still say there's worries; the folks who thought the deficit issue was overblown still think that. So it doesn't seem to be an issue. Tax and spending is likely to return to the headlines when Congress returns on September 8 because the House and Senate have yet to agree on spending bills to keep the government operating. But they're unable to agree on the big issues, how much to tax, how much to spend. So they're simply going to put those off, as they often do. INSKEEP: As they often do. Well, David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome.

And that is true of an entire city - Detroit. Its bankruptcy case is entering its final trial phase today. This decides a plan to wipe out billions of dollars in debt. Some big creditors would rather not. Michigan Radio's Sarah Cwiek reports. SARAH CWIEK, BYLINE: This trial is a big deal, but don't expect lots of courtroom drama. For one thing, we're in federal bankruptcy court here. And there's no jury. It all revolves around a document, Detroit's 400-page plan of adjustment, laying out how and how much the city plans to pay off its thousands of creditors and restructure itself going forward. Lawyers will dissect and argue the plan point by point. In the end, Judge Steven Rhodes will decide if it complies with Chapter Nine of the U. S. bankruptcy code - the chapter dealing with municipal bankruptcies. Laura Bartell teaches bankruptcy law at Wayne State University and says one of the biggest issues is whether the plan is even feasible. LAURA BARTELL: That's going to be probably the crux of the confirmation hearing. Does this plan work? Is the city of Detroit going to be viable if this plan is confirmed and implemented? CWIEK: In the months leading up to this trial, Detroit and its creditors have been working hard to hash out deals in mediation. In most cases, they've reached settlements that are now part of the plan. The biggest one is dubbed the Grand Bargain. It's a deal meant to protect the city's retirees and preserve its world-class art collection. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You see on the left the constructive use of technology in the passenger plane. CWIEK: Inside Rivera Court at the Detroit Institute of Arts, digital tablets help museum-goers decipher what they're seeing on the walls - Diego Rivera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breathtaking murals depicting scenes from Detroit's industrial heyday. They're among the biggest treasures in a museum chock-full of magnificent art, some of it purchased many years ago by a much larger, wealthier city. And some of Detroit's biggest creditors insist that the city should either mortgage or sell those pieces to pay them off. But that's precisely what the Grand Bargain is supposed to prevent. Private foundations, philanthropists and the state of Michigan have pledged more than $800 million toward the Grand Bargain to save the art. That money would be used to pay off Detroit's biggest creditor group - city retirees. In return, retirees give up any legal challenge to the plan of adjustment, and the museum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection is transferred to a charitable trust where creditors can't touch it. Most retirees will still have to take some pension cuts, but facing the possibility of much deeper ones, a majority approved the Grand Bargain. But bond insurer Syncora voted against that bargain. It stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if the plan of adjustment is confirmed. Wayne State University's Laura Bartell says in cases with dissenting creditors, the bankruptcy code requires the city to prove it doesn't unfairly discriminate against them. Bartell says the plan clearly does discriminate in favor of retirees. But the question is whether that's unfair. She doesn't think so. BARTELL: These are people who are not financial institutions. These are city of Detroit retirees. CWIEK: Other legal scholars disagree. Though at trial's end, the only interpretation that matters is Judge Rhodes's. But Detroit's bankruptcy is resonating far beyond the courtroom. And bond insurers, like Syncora, aren't the only ones arguing that the city's plan is unfair.

But hydraulic fracturing is moving into some cities and not just around the fringes - right downtown. In urban areas, fracking is raising a new set of concerns. Colorado Public Radio's Lesley McClurg has this story about a about a proposal to drill right underneath one woman's downtown home. LESLEY MCCLURG, BYLINE: Dawn Gioia is a busy stay-at-home mom. On her back porch, her 1-year-old son pounds a mini keyboard. Her 7-year-old daughter plays dress-up. DAWN GIOIA: Well, do you guys want to get your stuff ready for the pool? Will you go get your suit? Do you know where your brother's swimsuit is? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: I saw it on the counter yesterday. MCCLURG: Frequently, the family spends summer days at the nearby city waterpark. They live on a corner lot two blocks away from City Hall in Brighton. It's just north of Denver. GIOIA: Do me a favor - go downstairs, look and see if you can find your green bikini. MCCLURG: As urban residents, Gioia never expected to receive a thick envelope from Mid-Con Energy. At first she thought it was a scam. GIOIA: You can see that one of these forms asks you for all your tax information and Social Security numbers. So that was something that sort of caught me off guard. MCCLURG: The packet also included a lease for her mineral rights. The terms are a $1,200 signing bonus for every acre owned and 18 percent after that. GIOIA: So I read it over and I was like, they actually think they want to drill here, under our property. MCCLURG: She says her neighbors were also surprised to see to receive similar offers - like her mother-in-law, who owns a townhome a few miles away. GIOIA: So I don't know - do they own the land? She's really confused. MCCLURG: To find the answers, Gioia called the energy company. She says the man she reached reminded her of a sleazy car salesman. GIOIA: He was pretty much just like, sign it, sign it, sign it. MCCLURG: His pushy tone inspired her to call a lawyer and organize a neighborhood meeting. GIOIA: There's all kinds of questions that come up of how does this work? Is there going to be like, trucks driving through our neighborhood every day? What happens to the property values? I did have one neighbor say, should I sell before they start this (laughter)? MCCLURG: Is the money or the profits a potential big draw? GIOIA: No. I live on a small plot. Like, we live in a neighborhood. MCCLURG: She says in the best case scenario, the profits could be about $200 a month. Mid-Con Energy declined to be interviewed for this story, saying only, that it would be premature to discuss development plans before reaching an agreement with a mineral owner. Residents of the nearby city of Greeley - at about 100,000 people - are fighting proposals to expand drilling there. Sara Barwinski lives about 750 feet from an active drill pad. SARA BARWINSKI: And that site is also adjacent to a high school - 411 feet from a track and field, in a high-destiny residential area. MCCLURG: She clenches her hands as she describes a proposal to drill multiple wells near in elementary school. BARWINSKI: Why should we be preparing evacuation plans for a kindergartner? MCCLURG: Barwinski worries about an accident in a dense urban core. She stresses that it would be difficult to evacuate hospital patients or retirement home residents. But Barbara Kirkmeyer, a county commissioner in the area, argues that state regulations are strong enough to prevent accidents. Plus, she says, drilling is good for the economy. BARBARA KIRKMEYER: The businesses that are in town all seem to be booming. I mean, if you walk along Main Street here, it's just bustling. MCCLURG: Kirkmeyer also says the dollars extend beyond city limits. KIRKMEYER: We're all going to figure how we're going to coexist because it's extremely important to our economy. And it's not just our economy here in Weld County; it's our economy in the state of Colorado. MCCLURG: Urban drilling is also happening in midsized cities in other parts of the country, like North Texas and Southern California. And drilling is up in larger cities like Los Angeles. However, the majority of production there is not close to downtown. Back at Gioia's house in Brighton, Colorado, she and her husband are weighing the pros and cons of signing a lease. She says she recognizes the importance of oil and gas, but she worries about potential spills because Brighton's municipal water comes from shallow aquifers. Mostly, she's concerned about the future. GIOIA: I don't want to become an oil town. When the oil leaves or when it dries up, what will happen to Brighton when it's gone? Because they say, hey, it's good for the economy; you're going to bring all these workers and everyone's going to get work. But when it's dried up, then what happens? MCCLURG: Gioia predicts she'll probably be the last one on her block to decide whether to sign over her mineral rights. For NPR News, I'm Lesley McClurg in Denver. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: incorrectly says that Brighton, Colo. , residents were approached by Mid-Con Energy regarding mineral rights.

GIOIA: He was pretty much just like, sign it, sign it, sign it. MCCLURG: His pushy tone inspired her to call a lawyer and organize a neighborhood meeting. GIOIA: There's all kinds of questions that come up of how does this work? Is there going to be like, trucks driving through our neighborhood every day? What happens to the property values? I did have one neighbor say, should I sell before they start this (laughter)? MCCLURG: Is the money or the profits a potential big draw? GIOIA: No. I live on a small plot. Like, we live in a neighborhood. MCCLURG: She says in the best case scenario, the profits could be about $200 a month. Mid-Con Energy declined to be interviewed for this story, saying only, that it would be premature to discuss development plans before reaching an agreement with a mineral owner. Residents of the nearby city of Greeley - at about 100,000 people - are fighting proposals to expand drilling there. Sara Barwinski lives about 750 feet from an active drill pad. SARA BARWINSKI: And that site is also adjacent to a high school - 411 feet from a track and field, in a high-destiny residential area. MCCLURG: She clenches her hands as she describes a proposal to drill multiple wells near in elementary school. BARWINSKI: Why should we be preparing evacuation plans for a kindergartner? MCCLURG: Barwinski worries about an accident in a dense urban core. She stresses that it would be difficult to evacuate hospital patients or retirement home residents. But Barbara Kirkmeyer, a county commissioner in the area, argues that state regulations are strong enough to prevent accidents. Plus, she says, drilling is good for the economy. BARBARA KIRKMEYER: The businesses that are in town all seem to be booming. I mean, if you walk along Main Street here, it's just bustling. MCCLURG: Kirkmeyer also says the dollars extend beyond city limits. KIRKMEYER: We're all going to figure how we're going to coexist because it's extremely important to our economy. And it's not just our economy here in Weld County; it's our economy in the state of Colorado. MCCLURG: Urban drilling is also happening in midsized cities in other parts of the country, like North Texas and Southern California. And drilling is up in larger cities like Los Angeles. However, the majority of production there is not close to downtown. Back at Gioia's house in Brighton, Colorado, she and her husband are weighing the pros and cons of signing a lease. She says she recognizes the importance of oil and gas, but she worries about potential spills because Brighton's municipal water comes from shallow aquifers. Mostly, she's concerned about the future. GIOIA: I don't want to become an oil town. When the oil leaves or when it dries up, what will happen to Brighton when it's gone? Because they say, hey, it's good for the economy; you're going to bring all these workers and everyone's going to get work. But when it's dried up, then what happens? MCCLURG: Gioia predicts she'll probably be the last one on her block to decide whether to sign over her mineral rights. For NPR News, I'm Lesley McClurg in Denver.

Starting in 2016, banks of a certain size - the large ones - will have to make sure that more of their assets are liquid - able to be quickly turned into cash. And that was a big problem six years ago when the financial crisis hit. We're joined now by NPR's Jim Zarroli. Hey there, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So explain to us how these rules change things. ZARROLI: You know, banks already face capital requirements. In other words, if they're going to lend a certain amount of money, they have to have enough capital on hand to back it up. The regulations approved today apply to liquid capital. In other words, the government is saying for the first time that banks have to have a certain amount of high-quality assets on hand that they can get to as soon as they need it. And this is really what's important here - things like treasury bills and cash - assets they can sell right away if they need to. And the big banks have to have enough of these assets on hand to fund themselves for a month. Smaller banks will also have to comply, but the liquidity levels they face are lower. And this will add up to a lot of money. The banking sector will have to keep $2. 5 trillion in liquid assets on hand. CORNISH: But why are regulators so concerned about this issue specifically - about how much liquid assets banks are holding on to? ZARROLI: You know, banks, for decades, have been funding themselves by buying up a lot of very short-term debt. Sometimes the debt has to be paid back within a few hours or, you know, overnight. And this works out fine when times are good. But one of the things you saw in 2008 was that all of the sudden, the short-term debt markets shut down. The banks couldn't borrow anymore. And yet they had investors, and they had account holders that wanted to be paid off. You may remember at the time, investment banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns kept saying, you know, we're actually in good shape. We have assets. We have enough assets to cover our liability. But it didn't matter because there was this cash flow crisis. The banks couldn't sell their assets fast enough for them to be of any help. You know, something like a commercial loan qualifies as an asset on your books, but you can't cash it in right away when you need to because you have to pay off an account holder who wants money. CORNISH: So how did the big banks respond to these new requirements? ZARROLI: You know, I think most banks understand that this was a problem. They understand that they needed to hold more liquid assets. And they've already been doing this on their own in recent years to some extent. Now, as a result of these regulations that were passed today, they'll have to hold even more. And this comes at a time when regulators - global and U. S. regulators have already been imposing other kinds of capital requirements on the banks. So, you know, banks have been pretty profitable in recent years, but this is going to cut into the money that they make. You know, the banks can afford it, but it's not going to make their shareholders happy. So, you know, bottom line - I think they don't like this very much. Some of them argue that the regulators were defining liquid assets much too narrowly. If a bank holds a municipal bond, is that something that should be considered liquid? And there were other disputes, too. There was a lot of back-and-forth between the regulators and the banks. So I think the bottom line is the banks don't like the rules, but I think they've been tweaked to the point where they're are at least acceptable to them. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli.

S. economy? The jobs report out today estimates that only 142,000 jobs were created last month, way below what analysts had expected. And as NPR's John Ydstie reports, many economists think things are better than what the numbers show. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Economists from across the country's voiced skepticism about the government's report job creation in August. Carl Tannenbaum of Northern Trust in Chicago was one of them. CARL TANNENBAUM: Today's employment report represents a little bit of an interruption in a very nice string of good news we've had on the employment front. 142,000 jobs is by far the lowest that we've had so far this year but it does appear out of order with some of the readings that we've had otherwise. YDSTIE: Tannenbaum points out that data on manufacturing has been strong and surveys of hiring intentions are good and again this week first- time claims for unemployment insurance were very low. That leads Tannenbaum to believe the job creation number in today's report will be revised upward in coming months. John Silvia chief economist at Wells Fargo agrees. But he also thinks this report rightly curves a bit of growing enthusiasm about the economy's strength. JOHN SILVIA: The job market continues to improve but it's not accelerating and I think that was the disappointment some people expressed today. There's still growth but it's not accelerating. YDSTIE: Silvia does believe job growth will return to the 225 to 240,000 range for the rest of the year. But he cautions that tepid global growth, especially the recent stalling out of the Eurozone economy could be a drag. SILVIA: Certainly I think that the European situation will erode some of the growth expectations - as well as, once again delaying any move by the Fed in terms of raising the federal funds rate. YDSTIE: Today's disappointing number on job growth does support Fed Chair Janet Yellen's argument that the economy won't be ready for a Fed rate hike anytime soon. The internal data that Yellen watches, including wage growth, the level of part-time work and the level of long-term unemployment all improved somewhat in August but each needs to show more improvement before they suggest a tightening labor market. Tannenbaum says today's report bolsters Yellen's position. TANNENBAUM: There have been voices at one end of the table that are suggesting that the job market is already dangerously close to getting a little tighter. But today's evidence would seem to undermine that point of view. YDSTIE: The unemployment rate did tick down a tenth of a percent to 6. 1 percent in August. That's usually viewed as a sign of a stronger labor market but today's data showed that it declined mostly because people were leaving the labor force, which suggests the labor force still isn't providing enough jobs and some job seekers are just giving up.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says just 142,000 jobs were added to the economy in August. That is far below expectations. But this might not be the final word. The August numbers may well be revised. NPR's John Ydstie explains. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: During the past six months, the economy has been producing, on average, 244,000 additional jobs each month. So 142,000 is far below the trend. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, says today's report conflicts with other economic data. CARL TANNENBAUM: It does appear out of order with some of the readings that we've had otherwise. The manufacturing surveys are very high. Surveys of hiring intentions are pretty good.

YDSTIE: The headline job creation number actually gets revised twice by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In recent months, those revisions have almost always been positive. And August is notorious for large revisions. In the past five years, the initial August reading has been revised upward by 77,000 on average. Part of the issue, says Tannenbaum, is the end of summer vacations, when lots of people, including teachers, come back to work. The BLS tries to avoid an artificial bulge in the monthly job count through seasonal adjustments, but Tannenbaum says it's a tricky business. TANNENBAUM: The beginning of the school year has a great deal to do with the results for August as there's back-to-school shopping that's timed for the first day of school. To the degree that that floats from one year to the other, it does bedevil some of the statisticians. YDSTIE: That could be why today's report shows a loss of retail jobs that seems to run against other trends in the economy. Despite the weak job creation number from the BLS survey of businesses, the unemployment rate, which comes from a survey of households, improved. It moved down a 10th of a percent, to 6. 1 percent. But Tannenbaum says internal data that Federal Reserve policymakers watch closely, like wage growth, did not strengthen significantly. TANNENBAUM: This clearly suggests that the labor market still isn't quite at full employment. And there really isn't justification for a near-term change to interest rates.

The word recovery suggests the economy is getting better and better. But there's growing attention to a countering view which has its own vocabulary. This one suggests we're in for a long period of slow growth and lousy wage increases at best. To shed light on this, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He's with the Brookings Institution and is also a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, help us find the words to describe what's going on. Technically it is a recovery - doesn't feel like it to many people. So what is it? WESSEL: That's right. So one way to think of it is the economy had a heart attack, and now it's recovering. That's true, but there's a band of economists - the most prominent is Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary - who argue the economy is also suffering from a chronic disease that they call secular stagnation. It means that the economy is suffering from a very slow growth rate and there's - the Federal Reserve can't get interest rates low enough to get a job for everybody who wants to work. And they say that this has really been a condition the economy's been suffering for some time, but it was masked by unsustainable bubbles and borrowings before the great recession. INSKEEP: OK, secular stagnation doesn't sound too good. So what's the cause of that? WESSEL: Well, there are a lot of hypotheses. One is that all the great inventions have been made, and we're unlikely to see a quickening of the pace of technological change. Another is that the damage done by the Great Recession was so long-lasting and permanent, so many workers will never get jobs again, that we really can't recover. A third is that there's this persistent and disturbing reluctance of businesses to invest and consumers to spend, perhaps in part because so much of the recent gains have gone to the people at the top, and they tend to save more of their money than people - ordinary working people who can't afford to do that. And a fourth is that the U. S. and other developed countries are just simply paying the price for years of inadequate investment and infrastructure and education, the basic ingredients of growth. INSKEEP: OK, let me go out on a limb and speculate that secular stagnation may not actually get to be a phrase that's on everybody's lips, even though it's got that nice alliteration there, but it certainly describes real trends that people fear. So where did the phrase come from? WESSEL: Well, Larry Summers reintroduced it to the conversation late last year, but it's actually a term that dates to the Great Depression. In 1938 Alvin Hansen, then the president of the American Economic Association, used it and worried that the effects of the Depression would be long-lasting and that we'd never see enough business investment to sustain future growth. Of course he turned out to be wrong. First there was World War II with all the production and then the baby boom and all that. So some people who are skeptical of this view point out that today's advocates of secular stagnation are as myopic as he was and that in particular there's so much going on in China and other developing countries that there'll always be enough momentum to keep the global economies moving, and we just have to patient. INSKEEP: Well, it's certainly true we don't know what might happen next. But there are problems well beyond the United States right now. Aren't there? WESSEL: That's right. One of the reasons this is so disturbing is that this is not a uniquely American condition. Japan has been suffering from a decade of very slow growth. It's trying to get things going again, and Europe is in even worse shape than the U. S. The outlook there is bleaker than in the U. S. INSKEEP: You know, if you're a policymaker and you're trying to improve the economy, attack this condition, what do you do? WESSEL: Well, one implication - it's going to be hard for the Fed or its counterpart in Europe, the European Central Bank, to fight this on their own, particularly if they want to avoid blowing new financial bubbles. So the cure is more likely involve a rather familiar list of things, less preoccupation with reducing budget deficits and spending more on infrastructure, education training, other things that will create jobs now and pay dividends in the form of faster growth in the future.

INSKEEP: Well, it's certainly true we don't know what might happen next. But there are problems well beyond the United States right now. Aren't there? WESSEL: That's right. One of the reasons this is so disturbing is that this is not a uniquely American condition. Japan has been suffering from a decade of very slow growth. It's trying to get things going again, and Europe is in even worse shape than the U. S. The outlook there is bleaker than in the U. S. INSKEEP: You know, if you're a policymaker and you're trying to improve the economy, attack this condition, what do you do? WESSEL: Well, one implication - it's going to be hard for the Fed or its counterpart in Europe, the European Central Bank, to fight this on their own, particularly if they want to avoid blowing new financial bubbles. So the cure is more likely involve a rather familiar list of things, less preoccupation with reducing budget deficits and spending more on infrastructure, education training, other things that will create jobs now and pay dividends in the form of faster growth in the future. INSKEEP: David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome.

One speaker identified himself only as a representative of the unarmed 18-year-old. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Enough is enough. We're sleepless at night. I sat there and watched Mike Brown, my Mike, Big Mike, on the ground. And it wasn't him no more. It was one of my sons. It was my cousin. It was me. INSKEEP: That was the heat. Now here's the light. Council members discussed a surprising source of tension in Ferguson. It's a long-running problem that alienates the authorities from the community they're supposed to serve. The law enforcement system imposes heavy court fees. Poor people who cannot pay those fees can end up in jail. This is actually a problem across the country, as NPR's Joe Shapiro recently reported on this program. It is a modern-day version of debtor's prisons. And Joe Shapiro now tells us the attention in Ferguson could inspire change. JOSEPH SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Here are just a few of the fees the city court can bill you for in Ferguson, Missouri. There's a fee to plead guilty; that's $12. You even pay for your own arrest warrant. ALEXES HARRIS: There's charges for - the sheriff can charge you for the mileage that it costs them to serve a bench warrant. SHAPIRO: Alexes Harris got on her computer and pulled up Ferguson's municipal code. Harris is a sociology professor at the University of Washington. And she's just written a book about how, across the country, court fines and fees are used more and more to fund government but fall heavily on the poorest people. HARRIS: They should not be charged for the city government services. They should not be seen as a revenue-generating entity if they are poor. SHAPIRO: Each fee may not seem like a lot. But there are at least a dozen in Ferguson, and they add up. Plus, they're on top of court fines, which in Ferguson typically run a few hundred or even a thousand dollars. And we're talking about low-level, nonviolent offenses - mostly traffic violations or jumping on the light rail public transportation without paying for a ticket. Ferguson collected $2. 6 million dollars in court fines and fees last year. That was the city's second-largest source of income, or about 21 percent of its total budget. The city council's proposals last night could end some of those fees. Council members said they wanted to make it clear that the city is not imposing fines to harass residents or to finance the city government, but attorney Thomas Harvey says that's how it feels to people who took to the streets to protest in Ferguson. THOMAS HARVEY: Every reporter I've talked to who came here said that either the second or third thing that people told them at the protest was about interaction with the police force and the courts. And they said it wasn't like they asked some kind of hard-hitting journalistic question, you know? They just - they said, what are you out here for? I want to support Mike Brown - justice for Mike Brown. And then they would just go on and talk about the courts. SHAPIRO: Harvey is the co-founder of Arch City Defenders. It provides legal services to the poor. Last month, his group released a report that singled out Ferguson and showed why people hate those court costs - because if they don't pay, they can go to jail. And the municipal court issued a lot of arrest warrants. Last year, the city, with a population of 21,000, issued nearly 33,000 arrest warrants on traffic violations and other minor offenses. For Harvey, the council's steps to start cutting back fees was reason for hope and skepticism, too. HARVEY: Frankly, as great as this first step is, there's nothing in that proposal that discusses how they're going to address the disproportionate stopping off African-Americans in their community. SHAPIRO: Numbers from Missouri's attorney general counted vehicle stops in Ferguson. Blacks are far more likely to be stopped than whites, far more likely to be searched and twice as likely to be arrested even though whites are more likely to be caught with contraband. Still, the fact that it's Ferguson of all places that's taking first steps to limit the use of fines and fees is cause for some optimism that one day, this city will be seen as a place that became a national model for how to change court fees that target the poor.

There are roughly 1,200 indoor malls in the United States, and only about a third of them are doing well. Thanks to a variety of factors that have transformed the economy in recent years, malls across this country are in various states of distress. These dead and dying malls leave behind huge concrete carcasses, and some are being transformed into everything from medical centers to hockey rinks. Ellen Dunham Jones is a professor of architecture and urban design at Georgia Institute of Technology, and she's been following these changes in both the urban and suburban landscapes. What is a dying shopping mall in your view? ELLEN DUNHAM JONES: A dead or dying mall is a mall that is not generating enough dollars per square foot to pay for the maintenance of the structure itself. In fact you can actually often find a mall that's fully occupied, but it's occupied with shops that are paying fairly low rent and not really your class A mall. Once they're only generating less than about $300 or $250 per square foot per month, that's a real indication of trouble because the mall owner's not going to be able to maintain the roofing - really provide the kind of maintenance for the long-term life of that mall, and that usually indicates it's heading into a downward spiral. INSKEEP: What's killing malls? JONES: A variety of things. Everything from - there's the fact that we probably built too many of them. The U. S. has almost twice as much retail that's in shopping centers than anywhere else in the world, and online shopping is having some of a toll. The recession certainly took some of a toll, but also just the decline of the middle class is also really making it that much harder. INSKEEP: So if you have a dead or dying mall, I suppose there must be different stages of grief. You go into denial for little while, then you try to bargain - you try to fix the mall in some way, but at some point you must realize this is just no longer going to be a traditional mall. And it gets into the question of redevelopment, which you have been tracking. What are some of the things that people are trying to do with malls? JONES: Usually when a mall dies, there's a reason. There was too much competition from other malls or something. So it's not always the best move to just try to replace it with retail, and we find all sorts of interesting things. They're being turned into office space - Google Glass happens to now be in a former dead mall. INSKEEP: OK. JONES: They're being turned into medical centers, churches, school and universities, civic functions, some of them have played a role in disaster recovery. INSKEEP: So is there also an opportunity when a mall dies to just blow it up? JONES: Absolutely. There's over about 40 malls that have more or less bulldozed the existing mall and are now building the downtown that that suburb never had before. One example is Belmar - it's in Lakewood, Colorado, just outside of Denver - and it used to be the Villa Italia Mall, a very large, regional mall on a 100 acre just single superblock site. Today it's 22 blocks of walk-able, urban streets that connect up with the neighboring streets. At the ground floor, you get a lot of shops and then above that a lot of either offices or apartments. And at the same time, I mean, they basically tripled density on that site, but they've more than quadrupled the tax revenue that the town is receiving. And at the same time, they've actually cut traffic because so many of those people now are able to walk to their, you know, daily needs. INSKEEP: And this is the trend in real estate development, isn't it? Just as the shopping mall was the big thing a few decades ago, that mixed-use development that you're describing that's rather dense with different kinds of uses, all-in-one property. That's what development is all about right now? JONES: We're seeing a lot of it. It's often referred to as new urbanism. Is the sort of the movement that has been driving a lot of this because it makes so much sense from an economic point of view, certainly from a sort of sustainability and environment point of view, from a social sort of building more opportunities for people to get together. And it also just really makes sense in terms of our changing demographics, folks in their 20s, sometimes called the millennials or Gen Y, most of them grew up in the suburbs, and most of them have made it very clear they want to live a more urban lifestyle. They don't want to become their parents. INSKEEP: Ellen Dunham Jones, thanks very much. JONES: Thank you, my pleasure.

It's now well below $100 a barrel. That drop in price has occurred at a time of conflict in and near oil-producing regions. Normally, we expect oil prices to spike at times like these. NPR's John Ydstie explains why that has not happened. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The decline in oil prices may have already affected your pocketbook. On average, it's costing almost 10 percent less now than it was in June to fill up your car at the pump, and that's happened with conflicts flaring. The global price of oil did rise to $112 a barrel in June, when Isis first swept into northern Iraq. But since then, the price of crude has trended down, despite the U. S. decision to enter that fight and despite the conflict in Ukraine and sanctions levied against Russia, one of the roles largest oil producers. And then there's the fight between Islamist militants and the government in Libya, a significant oil producer. So why are petroleum prices falling? ROBIN WEST: There are two factors to keep in mind. One is supply and one is demand. YDSTIE: It is that basic, says Robin West, a senior advisor at IHS Energy Insights. WEST: Frankly, the global economy is slow. Demand is low. YDSTIE: The international Energy Agency made that point last week when it said, a weaker economic outlook in China and Europe is causing a remarkable slowdown in global demand growth for oil. And West says demand is declining as global supplies serge due to the energy boom in North America, including shale oil production from North Dakota and Texas. WEST: There's another 3 million barrels a day that's coming into the market and staying in the market. And this has really changed the global supply-demand balance very substantially. YDSTIE: And it's helping bring more stability to the oil market. Michael Levi, a senior fellow for energy and environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, says it is true. The surge in North American production has added significantly to global supplies. But he doesn't believe it's responsible for the decline in oil prices during the past three months. MICHAEL LEVI: I think the U. S. oil boom has helped stabilize prices over the last few years. But that's because it's been a surprise, and it no longer is a surprise. And that leads me to conclude that people are expecting too much from it, in terms of stabilizing oil prices in the future. YDSTIE: Levi says the added production from North America has lulled market participants into believing they're in an era of stability. LEVI: I think there is excessive complacency in the ability of the global oil market to absorb disruptions that we haven't seen yet. YDSTIE: Levi says there are good reasons the current conflicts haven't pressured prices higher. Serious production is minimal. Libya's has been impaired for some time. And sanctions against Russia would hurt production off in the future, not current production. LEVI: On the flipside, no one expects Vladimir Putin to cut his own oil exports in order to inflict harm because he can't sustain his spending - his state - his budget without the revenues from oil cells. YDSTIE: Fadel Gheit, managing partner and head of oil and gas research at Oppenheimer and Company, says oil prices will spike higher when severe disruptions occur. But he thinks global supply will continue to grow and keep prices in check. He says that will happen as fracking technology improves, reducing the costs of production. FADEL GHEIT: The break-even point continues to decline. I mean, yes, we needed $80 oil for the North Dakota bargain oil development to continue. Now it's about 65. Five years from now, it could be 50 or even 40. YDSTIE: Gheit argues that will lead to a long-term decline in the price of oil - a decline that we're already beginning to see.

YDSTIE: Fadel Gheit, managing partner and head of oil and gas research at Oppenheimer and Company, says oil prices will spike higher when severe disruptions occur. But he thinks global supply will continue to grow and keep prices in check. He says that will happen as fracking technology improves, reducing the costs of production. FADEL GHEIT: The break-even point continues to decline. I mean, yes, we needed $80 oil for the North Dakota bargain oil development to continue. Now it's about 65. Five years from now, it could be 50 or even 40. YDSTIE: Gheit argues that will lead to a long-term decline in the price of oil - a decline that we're already beginning to see.

Maybe you've had that experience of deciding which bill needs to be paid first; some people have that decision taken out of their hands. One out of 10 working Americans between the ages of 35 and 44 are getting their wages garnished. That means their pay is being docked, often over an old credit card debt or medical bill or student loan. That striking figure comes out of a collaboration between NPR News and ProPublica. The reporting offers the first available national numbers on wage garnishment, and we're going to talk about that this morning with NPR's Chris Arnold. Welcome to the program, Chris. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: And also with us, Paul Kiel. He is a reporter for ProPublica. Welcome to you. PAUL KIEL: Thanks. INSKEEP: So what's happening? ARNOLD: Well, Steve, for decades, wage garnishment has been out there as a way that if people get divorced and you want to make sure the father's going to pay the child support, the court will insist that the wages be garnished. So that has to happen. That still goes on. It's a big chunk of what goes on, but what's new here is that nobody understood how much this now is being used for just regular, old consumer debt, like you said - credit cards, medical debt. And even national experts, people who track this stuff, who study consumer finance, we took this to them, and they were pretty taken aback by the numbers that we turned up here. INSKEEP: So, Paul, you're saying that instead of calling you and trying to negotiate with you or urging you to pay your debt, the company gets the power to simply grab assets of yours and take them as its own? KIEL: Right. And what happens first, though, is they have to go to court - they see you in court - and during the years of the recession particularly, there was just explosion of these types of suits filed in court. And what happens most of the time is people don't show up for a variety of reasons, but once they have that judgment then, they can go and get the wages at any time. INSKEEP: Are there limits on what a company could take from you? Could they just empty your bank account, for example, or take all of your paycheck? KIEL: There are. About half the states in the country rely on a federal law - which some would say is outdated; it goes back to 1968 - it caps garnishments at 25 percent of your after-tax income. Now, for half of America who might have trouble paying to get their car fixed, 25 percent of your paycheck week after week, month after month, sometimes this goes on for years, arguably that is very tough to afford, but the ability to afford this is not something that's taking into consideration. INSKEEP: And let's make sure we're clear here - we are talking about people who have debts. There's been a court judgment in fact that it seems to be a legitimate debt, but you're saying that people may have their financial future taken away from them and not even quite realize what's happening? KIEL: Right. A lot of the people we talk to, and Paul can talk about this, too, they want to pay. It's just they're being asked to pay too much. INSKEEP: So, Paul, how did you measure exactly how many Americans are in this situation? How did you find this 1 out of 10 figure for people in their 30s and 40s? ARNOLD: Right, so there's a company called ADP, which is the largest payroll services provider in the country and also handle garnishment issues for companies. And so we approached them since they have this massive database to ask them to do an analysis. And this, you know, is particularly important because there's just no numbers on this on a national level at all. And so what they did is they looked at payroll data for 13 million employees. It was their database. It was a very large sample. And today they are releasing the report with these new numbers. KIEL: And we actually have some tape here from Ahu Yildirmaz, and she heads up the ADP Research Institute. They did the study, and here we asked her to sort of extrapolate, OK, what does this mean for all of America? AHU YILDIRMAZ: We would estimate 9 to 10 million people, employees, are being garnished today, and these employees are primarily blue-collar workers. Garnishment rates were highest among those earning between 25,000 to 40,000 per year. INSKEEP: Oh, so we're talking about people for the most part who are below the median income in this country already struggling. And, Paul, is this more people having their wages garnished than would've been true a few years ago? KIEL: Yes. It's definitely the case. We've spoken to people who've have dealt with payroll for decades, and they said there's really been a sea change in the last 10 years or so. INSKEEP: Well, Chris, I understand you've been talking to some of the people who've been in this situation. Can you tell us a story? ARNOLD: Sure. What we're going to hear today and tomorrow from some of those people - and first we're going to hear from Kevin Evans who was making about $75,000 a year as a sales manager. This was back before the recession. He lives in Missouri, and he'd been in that line of work selling office furniture for 25 years. He owned a nice three-bedroom house outside of Kansas City, Missouri. KEVIN EVANS: Not fancy or anything, but nice and middle-class and all that. And you just figure, you know, you're going to be there forever. ARNOLD: The house cost $112,000 - so affordable for Evans, but then the recession hit. And, Steve, as you might imagine nobody buys office furniture in the middle of a recession, and Evans' income dropped by half. EVANS: And at the same time, my daughter was going away to college, and so my expenses were increasing. ARNOLD: Then Evans lost his job completely. EVANS: Frankly, I never assumed much debt. ARNOLD: And he didn't want to, so he sold his house. And he showed us around his tiny apartment that he's renting these days in Springfield, Missouri. EVANS: I now live in a one-bedroom, efficiency apartment that the living room and kitchen is one. I literally have my kayak on one end in the kitchen. ARNOLD: The kayak's kind of leaning up against the stove. EVANS: In front of the stove. ARNOLD: And so, Steve, during Evans' fall from happy, middle-class life, he worked a series of low-wage jobs - at a lumber yard, at a 24-hour fitness - he never collected unemployment. But along the way, he ended up with about $7,000 on a Capital One credit card. By the end of 2009, he'd fallen behind on those payments and Capital One closed his account in 2010. EVANS: I'm not blaming my situation on anybody else. It was my debt. I want to pay it. I always did want to pay it. I thought, you know, no problem. ARNOLD: Now, as the economy's recovered, starting about a year ago, Kevin's actually getting better paying jobs again - some sales jobs. It's not what he was making, but he's sort of on his way back. And so that's when Capital One's debt collectors started garnishing 25 percent of his paycheck for that old debt, and that old debt had been ballooning in size. And credit cards tend to do this. So the $7,000 he owed in 2010, that grew to $15,000 late last year because of the interests. And the lawyers' fees, and Evans was running around, doing all kinds of stuff, trying to manage his life when he saw that he was shocked. EVANS: It's still racking up almost 30 percent interest rate, and I need to somehow come up with large quantities of money to pay this down as fast as possible so that I don't just keep getting pummeled, just beaten. ARNOLD: Capital One said in a statement to NPR and ProPublica that legal action is always a last resort and that it tried to work with Evans, but he didn't complete a payment plan that they'd agreed to. Also court records show that Kevin Evans was served with a summons to appear in court when Capital One sued him. Kevin says if it was a summons, he didn't understand that. In any case, when defendants don't show up in court, things don't tend to go their way. (SOUNDBITE OF COURT HEARING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Capital One Bank versus a fellow parolee. ARNOLD: So ProPublica's Paul Kiel and I were just in Missouri. We sat in on one of these hearings. This one was at the Clay County District Court House outside Kansas City and Associate Circuit Judge Lewis Angliss (ph) presided over a long docket of credit card companies and hospitals and other outfits suing people over debts. Most people who were getting sued didn't show up in court, but the lawyers for the plaintiffs of course did show up in court. (SOUNDBITE OF COURT HEARING)LEWIS ANGLISS: New Liberty Hospital versus Stephen Rorrick (ph) and Michelle Rorrick (ph). MAN #1: I'd ask for a default judgment. ARNOLD: It's all very clerical, actually - it's like default judgment after default judgment, papers shuffling around, but in each one of these cases, there's a person who now stands to get their wages garnished or in some cases their entire bank account seized. KARI FIOTI: You've taken everything I have. You're not just taking a portion of it. You're taking my livelihood. ARNOLD: That's Kari Fioti (ph) who lives near Omaha, Nebraska. Debt collectors seized everything in her checking account over a medical debt. She broke her wrist and says she couldn't afford the hospital bills. We'll hear from her and other people's stories tomorrow, and we're going to look at the rules governing just how much debt collectors are allowed to take from people after they get a court judgment against them. INSKEEP: Chris, thanks very much. ARNOLD: Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: That NPR's Chris Arnold. We also heard from Paul Kiel of ProPublica. Thanks to you. KIEL: Thank you.

S. poverty rate dropped slightly last year to 14. 5 percent. That's according to new figures out today from the U. S. Census Bureau. Still more than 45 million people were poor. Although employment is up, many Americans lack jobs that pay enough to meet basic needs. And this has some people questioning whether current anti-poverty programs are doing enough. NPR's Pam Fessler reports on a promising alternative. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Go around the country and people you'll hear lots of frustration about just how difficult it is to get out of poverty and more importantly stay out. Cara Russo of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania is 34 raising two daughters, ages 15 and nine. CARA RUSSO: You know, I'm thinking to myself, you know, this is ridiculous. I'm doing all the right things - I'm working two jobs, I'm taking care of two kids. You know, why isn't this getting any easier? Why is this getting harder? FESSLER: Until recently Russo could have been the poster child for one of the largest groups of poor Americans - single women with children. According to today's news figures 30. 6 percent of such families are poor. Russo no longer lives below the poverty line, which is less than $19,000 a year for a family of three, but she still struggles. She says the biggest challenge isn't being in poverty but finding the way out. RUSSO: You know, you feel like you get a step ahead and you really be 10 steps behind. FESSLER: It's a complaint you hear again and again. The more Russo earned, the less she seemed to have. Food stamps, housing, daycare assistance, health care, everything that had kept her afloat when she was barely scraping by as waitress began to disappear as she worked her way up the ladder. MEGAN SHREVE: She lost all of her benefits and would have about $40 per month to spend on food for her family. It was horrible to watch. FESSLER: Megan Shreve is executive director of South Central Community Action Programs, a nonprofit social service agency in Gettysburg. Fortunately for Russo, Megan Shreve was also frustrated when she came back to her job after four years in the private sector. SHREVE: The same people were in the same rooms, talking about the same issues they were when I left. No one was getting out of poverty, we were doing more with less. Like, you look at that and you know at some point this will break. So we started looking around to figure out what was really getting people out of poverty. . . FESSLER: . . . Which is when she came across a program called Circles - now in 23 states. It works like this, a poor family is matched up with three or four middle-class volunteers called allies. They promise to help the family become self-sufficient with everything from budgeting advice to help navigating bureaucracy to just being friends - it's a lot of handholding. Cara Russo was one of the first in the Gettysburg program. RUSSO: It wasn't like they were giving me anything to be there except for the strength to be able to move to the next week. FESSLER: Which she did week after week after week. Her allies helped, even at times picking her kids up from daycare. They also created a community food program to help those like Russo, who earn too much for food stamps but not enough to eat. Seven years later Russo is a restaurant manager, earning $55,000 a year and now she's a middle-class ally for another family trying to climb out of poverty. (SOUNDBITE OF CIRCLES MEETING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Can you stop talking please. FESSLER: Several of these families are gathered in a Gettysburg meeting room for their weekly get-together. After a dinner of macaroni and cheese and chicken, the kids are sent off to play so the adults can get down to business. SHARON MADRIGAL: I mean, I guess the goal would be which job offer you're excepting right? FESSLER: Russo and two other women have been matched with Sharon Madrigal - a mother of three. They're helping her right down the pros and cons of job offers she's just received as a nursing assistant and as a part-time teacher's aide. RUSSO: So, then you would just put the things that I guess are important to you, around those things - like benefits. MADRIGAL: Right, right. RUSSO: Salary. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Commute. RUSSO: Commute, yeah. FESSLER: Russo knows that just getting a job isn't enough - she works 65 hours a week, which isn't easy raising a family. She asks Madrigal if she's thought about day care for her son. RUSSO: Have you checked out any kind of availability for anybody to watch him or . . . MADRIGAL: No, not yet. RUSSO: . . . do you have friends or family? FESSLER: If all goes according to plan Russo will still be at Madrigal's side a year from now - even longer. Studies show that Circles participants have seen their incomes double, even triple but with so many poor people Megan Shreve admits it's a drop in the bucket. She's encouraged though that this and other more holistic approaches to fighting poverty are attracting attention, she says most current anti-poverty programs do help, but only so much. SHREVE: You're spending a great deal of money putting Band-Aids on gapping wounds and then turning and walking away. FESSLER: Even though she says, it's clear from numbers like those released today that people need something more. Pam Fessler, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  The U.

FESSLER: Even though she says, it's clear from numbers like those released today that people need something more.

On the heels of the worst recession in generations, 10 percent of working Americans between the ages of 35 and 44 are getting their wages garnished. As part of an NPR ProPublica collaboration, today we take a look at just how much money collectors can take and the impact that's having. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: When some people first hear about this, they say, whoa, I didn't think you could get your wages garnished over an old credit card debt or a dentist bill. But you can, and debt collectors can take more than you might think - in about half the states in the country, 25 percent of your paycheck and everything in your bank account. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)KARI FIOTTI: You've taken everything I have. You're not just taking a portion of it. You're taking my livelihood. ARNOLD: That's Kari Fiotti who lives in Omaha, Nebraska. We heard a bit from her in the series yesterday. She had lived in Italy for 10 years with her husband and two kids, but then she got divorced. And in 2009 she moved back here. FIOTTI: And when I came back, I fell and I broke my wrist - without insurance. ARNOLD: Fiotti says the doctor's office wouldn't accept partial payments, which is why she couldn't pay. So the debt got turned over to collectors. It was $1,640. They sued Fiotti. She didn't show up in court for the hearing about her case, and then in May of last year, suddenly. . . FIOTTI: My bank account's zero, and I'm like, whoa, what's going on? ARNOLD: What was going on is that debt collectors had seized Fiotti's bank account. She didn't have enough to cover the debt, so they took all she did have. Fiotti was doing clerical work at the time - she says around $10 an hour. She had a kid in college, no savings. So she says it was actually kind of scary and upsetting when her bank account just got totally cleared out. FIOTTI: I'm at zero, and then I have to overdraw myself to put groceries in the house for the week. That's really hard to do. I want to go just get $50 in groceries, and I have a $28 fee. And now I'm at $78-negative, and next week it's going to be the same thing, just to eat. ARNOLD: In the end, Fiotti got the debt behind her with the help of a lawyer. All this might sound like the last thing the American middle-class needs right now, but in recent years millions of Americans have had their wages garnished after being sued by debt collectors. That's according to an analysis by the payroll company ADP. Much of the time, people don't show up in court to defend themselves. That makes it easier for the debt collectors. And with medical bills in particular, people can suddenly get buried in debt. CASSANDRA ROSE: The whole side of my face just felt like it was on fire, like it was running a fever. ARNOLD: Cassandra Rose also lives in Omaha. She says a few years ago, she couldn't afford health insurance. And she resisted going to the doctor, but she was getting these crippling headaches that went on for weeks and then months. She was dizzy. ROSE: Just a lot of really scary things - and when you've had a headache for that long. CONRAD GOETZINGER: And I have a friend whose mother dropped dead of an aneurysm, and that was what was in my mind, is maybe she has something that we could see now and fix. ARNOLD: Her husband, Conrad Goetzinger, convinced her to get help. It turned out it was just migraine headaches, but doctors were concerned about a brain tumor. And the MRI and other tests got very expensive. ROSE: It started off as 20,000. It's going to take me years to pay this off. ARNOLD: Rose is now getting her wages garnished over that debt, and actually her husband's getting his wages garnished, too. Though he acknowledges his situation was probably more avoidable. He never finished paying off a laptop computer. In any case, they each make about $13 an hour, and between the two of them, Rose and Goetzinger are getting a total of more than $700 a month taken out of their paychecks. They say that just doesn't leave them enough to live on. ROSE: Haley, time for bed. You need to feed and water the cats. HALEY: OK, mom. ROSE: OK, love you. GOETZINGER: So, like, the children, we have to get caps on their teeth for some cavities, and we can't afford to get them done, you know. I don't want my daughter walking around with a big, shiny, front, silver tooth, you know. But when you have to choose between keeping the power on for the rest of the week or getting teeth done, unfortunately the teeth falls to a lower priority. ROSE: It makes you feel hopeless. It makes you feel like you're working for no reason and that you're never going to be able to succeed. WILLIAM REINBRECHT: It's a little like debtors' prison. ARNOLD: That's William Reinbrecht. He's an attorney who represents people in Nebraska who are getting their wages garnished, often at the full amount allowed under federal law; that's 25 percent of their paycheck. And he says often there are other debts waiting in line. So when one finally gets paid off, the next garnishment kicks in. REINBRECHT: It makes a subclass of people that are crushed by all of this, and they can't, no matter how they work, improve their economic position. ARNOLD: Robert Foehl is general counsel for ACA International; that's a trade association for debt collectors, who he says play an important role in the economy and sometimes. . . ROBERT FOEHL: A creditor might have no other avenue of recovering their debt except through a legal process. ARNOLD: Meaning suing people and garnishing their wages. Judges who preside over these cases also say if people would just show up in court for their hearing, they'd have a lot more options. In some cases, they can work out a deal with the creditor to avoid garnishment. In St. Louis, Associate Circuit Judge Chris McGraugh has presided over many collections cases. CHRIS MCGRAUGH: So I'll say, did you have this credit card? Yeah, I did. Did you run up this debt? Yeah, I did. Did you not pay it? Yeah, I didn't pay it. Well, you know, the law demands that you pay your debts. ARNOLD: But at the same time, Judge McGraugh says he still sees some serious problems. He says lawyers for debt collectors, if they see a debtor actually takes time off from work and shows up in court, the lawyer sometimes will ask for a delay or a continuance and will do that several times over weeks or months until the person finally gives up and doesn't show up anymore. And then the collector gets a default judgment which means that person never got a chance to actually plead their case. Judge McGraugh says he finds the payday loan cases the most unsettling. MCGRAUGH: Because you're talking about a person that ends up taking out $200 and years later, ends up with a $4,000 debt running at an interest of 200 percent interest. He'll never be able to get out from underneath it. ARNOLD: And he says when the debt collector wins a judgment against the person, the court system ends up enforcing triple-digit interest rates that the person can never escape. MCGRAUGH: I practiced law for 25 years. I had no idea, like, something like that was occurring because I see these things as egregious. ARNOLD: The U. S. Federal Reserve recently did a study that found that half of Americans said that they couldn't scrape together $400 for, say, an emergency car repair without borrowing money. So consumer advocates say that garnishment laws in most states are just requiring people to pay too much. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

S. is in the middle of an oil-drilling boom that has some rethinking the country's four-decade ban on exporting crude oil. In fact now a campaign is underway to lift the ban. But as NPR's Jeff Brady reports, backers must first win over a skeptical public. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The ban on exporting oil produced in the U. S. dates back to 1973. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"NBC NIGHTLY NEWS\")JOHN CHANCELLOR: This is \"NBC Nightly News,\" Wednesday October 17. BRADY: Anchor John Chancellor told Americans that Arab countries, upset over U. S. support for Israel, were using their oil as a political tool. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"NBC NIGHTLY NEWS\")CHANCELLOR: They will reduce oil production by 5 percent a month until the Israelis withdraw from occupied territories. BRADY: The Arab oil embargo lasted five months. Crude prices quadrupled. There was rationing and long lines at gas stations. In response, the U. S. banned oil exports as part of a plan to insulate the country against supply and price shocks. Jake Dweck began practicing as an energy lawyer in Washington, D. C. around this time. Four decades later, he's part of a campaign to lift the export ban. JAKE DWECK: Over the past six years or so, we've lived through a phenomenal oil revolution that has made the U. S. the number-one oil producer in the world. BRADY: That revolution was made possible by technologies like hydraulic fracturing, and it was unexpected. Refinery owners thought they'd be handling heavier oil that comes from other countries, not the light, sweet crude produced here. Dweck says if too much of the lighter U. S. oil stays in the country, prices will drop, and that could slow down the current boom. DWECK: And the results would be reduced production, possibly shutting productions over time and reduced economic activity for the U. S. economy as a whole. BRADY: At a gas station in Philadelphia, Stephanie Torain says she remembers the 1973 oil embargo. She understands Dweck's argument but is skeptical that lifting the ban is a good idea. STEPHANIE TORAIN: Well, if it's going to help the economy, yes, and if it's not going to benefit us, no. But I don't want us to sell all our oil so in the future we won't have none when our children get old. BRADY: Torain says she's concerned exporting U. S. oil would raise gasoline prices, but backers of lifting the ban say opening new markets would prompt the industry to drill for even more crude here. They argue it would actually decrease gasoline prices in the U. S. Nearby, Desmond Ward is filling up his SUV and says he's willing to hear out the industry's arguments. DESMOND WARD: If they can actually prove that it's not going to affect us over here, then I'm for it. BRADY: There's plenty of opposition, including the refineries that can handle the lighter crude oil produced here. Jeffrey Peck is a lobbyist representing four such refineries. He says having plenty of supply in the U. S. helps the country. Take the situation now, with turmoil in several oil-producing countries, prices are actually going down. JEFFREY PECK: There is one reason, one reason only, that consumers are not paying $5 and $6 a gallon of gas at the pump, and that's because of the oil being produced in the United States. BRADY: President Obama could end the export ban with an executive order. His former chief economic advisor, Larry Summers, says if Congress won't do it, then the president should. The White House says there's no change in policy yet. Also opposing the effort to lift the export ban are some environmental groups. Lorne Stockman is with Oil Change International, and he's concerned that ending the ban would lead to more drilling. LORNE STOCKMAN: We really need to address climate change and actually start to think about which reserves, which fossil fuel reserves we're going to leave in the ground. BRADY: At stake in the export issue are billions of dollars in profits and whatever the White House decides could determine winners and losers.

SAMANTHA WRIGHT, BYLINE: Elissa Benedek is about to head out for her morning ride from the Mystic Saddle Ranch in central Idaho. ELISSA BENEDEK: I usually start out with an hour ride to sort of get my sea legs and then go on a longer ride, and it's great. WRIGHT: Every summer, Benedek and her husband travel from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to vacation in Stanley, Idaho - the doorway to the Sawtooth Wilderness area. Wilderness means roads, logging and motorized vehicles are not allowed, and the landscape is left mostly untouched. BENEDEK: It means fresh air. It means being able to see the stars at night. It means just sort of relaxing and taking things at your own pace and enjoying yourself. WRIGHT: Congress passed the Wilderness Act in 1964. The goal was to preserve and protect lands in their natural condition. The tiny town of Stanley is surrounded by such land, both the Sawtooth Wilderness area and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness are part of the nearby landscape. Deb Bitton and her husband own Mystic Saddle Ranch, and the wilderness is their livelihood. Her 65 horses take riders deep into Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains, traveling to places few people ever see. DEB BITTON: When you get in there, there's a certain amount of grandeur and a certain amount of just awe that you don't get any other way. You know, it really is hard to describe the magnificence of the backcountry. WRIGHT: The wilderness is beautiful, but the land is not earning it's keep, says Custer County, Idaho, commissioner Doyle Lamb. COMMISSIONER DOYLE LAMB: We can't do any logging. We can't do any mining. It's hard on our economy. It really is. Wilderness is hard on our economy. WRIGHT: Lamb lives an hour away from Stanley. His county is huge - almost 5,000 square miles. But 97 percent of that is federal land, including wilderness. None of that land can be taxed, and Lamb says, that means the county is losing potential revenue. Almost 19 percent of people here live below the poverty level. Meanwhile, it's the county that pays to maintain the roads that lead to protected areas. And Lamb says, it's the county that has to respond and foot the bill when someone gets hurt in the backcountry. LAMB: Because we're strictly volunteer, and we have no paid EMS or search and rescue, so when they call us out, it's hard on the county. WRIGHT: Lamb says, most people who use the wilderness are dependent on guides and packers to get around. He says, only the wealthy can afford to venture into what he calls a rich man's playground. But back in Stanley, the town's mayor, Herbert Mumford, says, it's mostly mom-and-pop businesses that make up the backbone of the local economy. And he believes they're not doing it just for the paycheck. MAYOR HERBERT MUMFORD: It hasn't made us rich, but it certainly enriches our lives in ways that transcend money. WRIGHT: Mumford knows his town is missing out on jobs and taxes. But he says, the people in Stanley have found a balance - both living and working in the wilderness areas that surround them. For NPR News, I'm Samantha Wright in Boise. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law, putting 109 million acres of land under federal protection. For hikers, campers and rafters, the wilderness is their playground - far from roads, cars and commercial enterprise.

There are many such proposals across the country, and while similar legislation in Congress has been blocked, state and local efforts are attracting some surprising supporters - Republican candidates. Here's NPR's Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: For Democrats, a higher minimum wage is at the center of their election-year economic agenda, alongside pay equity, infrastructure investment and college affordability. President Obama talks about it a lot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Either you're in favor of raising wages for hard-working Americans or you're not. LIASSON: Sounds simple, but this is politics. In several battleground races this year, Republicans are in the midst of a subtle sea-change on this issue. As free-market conservatives, Republicans are philosophically opposed to raising the wage and republican candidates are against raising the federal minimum wage, but just listen to Bruce Rauner, running for governor of Illinois. BRUCE RAUNER: I have said on a number of occasions that it's better to have a lower minimum wage than no minimum wage. LIASSON: But Rauner says under certain conditions, if, say, the state passed tort reform and tax reform, he would support it. RAUNER: If we do those changes, we can afford to have a higher minimum wage in Illinois. LIASSON: Tom Cotton is in a tight race for Senate in Arkansas. He opposes a higher federal minimum wage, but he feels differently about a state minimum wage referendum. TOM COTTON: I'm going to vote for that initiated act as a citizen, but as Arkansas' next United States senator, I'm going to make sure that we have a healthy economy. LIASSON: And in Alaska in this Republican primary debate, senate candidate Dan Sullivan couldn't have been clearer when he was asked this question. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'd like to know how you plan to vote in November on the following initiative - an act increasing the Alaskan minimum wage to $8. 75 per hour, effective January 1, 2015. Mr. Sullivan? DAN SULLIVAN: No. LIASSON: But now, Sullivan, too, has changed his mind. Illinois, Arkansas, and Alaska all have something in common. In all three, there are minimum wage initiatives on the ballot, and they are all expected to pass by big margins. Democrats, who are hoping to use the referenda to get more of their supporters to the polls, say these Republicans have had a foxhole conversion. Ted Strickland is the former governor of Ohio. TED STRICKLAND: Most people understand that when someone embraces a policy they have previously rejected and they do it just a short time before an election, that they're acting out of political expediency rather than out of conviction and courage. LIASSON: In this case, what Republicans consider to be good policy - letting the free market work - is not good politics. Republican strategist, Sara Fagen, says this is a fight Republicans want to avoid. SARA FAGEN: A good middle ground for many candidates has been to say, I would support a state increase, but I don't support a federal increase. That allows them to be core to their economic philosophy but still be reasonable to voters who are demanding that the minimum wage be increased. LIASSON: The embrace of state minimum wage hikes is an example of how Republicans are choosing their battles more carefully this year - moving to the center on issues like contraception or the minimum wage. And that has partisans on both sides taking some unusual positions. In some states, Republican legislators voted to raise the state wage to avoid having the issue on the ballot. In Alaska, Democrats and the legislature blocked a bill so that the issue would be on the ballot this fall. Progressive activist, Brad Woodhouse, says these ballot propositions will help Democrats up to a point. BRAD WOODHOUSE: You can target drop off voters who maybe will only come out because they think it's in their economic interest. You hope that if they come out and vote to increase the minimum wage that they'll vote for the Democrat. I do think it has the potential in a close race to help decide that race, but I wouldn't put all our chips in the basket of these ballot initiatives. LIASSON: Academics who study ballot referendum say that's probably a good idea. No minimum-wage initiative has ever determined the outcome of a state race, says John Matsusaka, the director of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California. JOHN MATSUSAKA: The evidence is pretty good that ballot propositions increase turnout overall. It's not so clear, though, that ballot propositions help one party or the other. Democrats might get a bump from this but the people who've looked close at these data have a hard time finding that it makes a big difference. LIASSON: The bottom line - these initiatives are very good for people who want to raise the minimum wage, but they're less useful as a political tool for Democrats looking for help in a Republican-leaning political landscape.

For all the factories closed, all the wrenching changes in the global economy, the United States is a major manufacturer. And in the next few weeks, we'll report on how Americans are working to reinvent manufacturing. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Today, a new picture of manufacturing is coming into focus. Just so you know - that line - filled with puns. INSKEEP: Picture of manufacturing, focus. . . CORNISH: Because we're going to visit a city that was all about images. Rochester, New York, made its name as home to Kodak, Xerox and the eyecare company Bausch and Lomb. INSKEEP: Manufacturing once employed 60 percent of Rochester's workforce. Now it's under 10 percent. CORNISH: So Rochester is trying to build something new. And it's in Rochester that our colleague David Greene begins a project we call American Made. (SOUNDBITE OF WATERFALL)DAVID GREENE, HOST: Historian Carol Vacca says, if you want to understand the story of Rochester, you need to come here to High Falls, where on a bridge, there's a waterfall and a panoramic view of downtown. This is a great spot. Where are we sitting? CAROL VACCA: We are in the heart of what was the center of Rochester, historically, and is still somewhat today, out over the Genesee River that attracted settlers because of the good dirt around it. GREENE: You said, good dirt. VACCA: Yes. Yeah. When revolutionary soldiers came through the area, they were coming from New England, where the dirt basically was good for holding rocks together at that point. And here, the soil is so fertile. So they immediately recognized the value of that and went home and told people, there's a place we can get land where you can be a successful farmer. GREENE: And farmers used that good Rochester dirt to grow grain. Of course, they needed somewhere to sell it, and that spawned flour mills - so many, in fact, that Rochester became known as Flour City. That legacy faded, though. The old mills along the river closed down, but the manufacturing seed had been planted, and something else grew out of it - a landmark high-rise that looms over the river. VACCA: That's Eastman Kodak, and for decades, Rochester was Kodak. GREENE: Kodak was built on Rochester's manufacturing legacy and at its peak, employed 60 thousand people in this city. Today, it's just 2,300. It's been a painful collapse, and once again, in 2014, Rochester is trying to use its fertile soil to grow something new. VACCA: Nobody ever wants to let go, obviously - not of something like Kodak that not only was so dominant, but had such a quality brand-name. But recognizing that we have to, we've moved on and created new things - new prospects for the future - building on what we had in the past. GREENE: One thing Rochester got from Kodak was knowledge. There are former employees still a work in new places like this. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)GREENE: We've moved three miles or so downriver to the factory floor at a company called Exelis. I'm standing with Mike Ognenovski. He's the vice president of operations. And we're looking at this machine that has a giant spinning disk. Mike, this looks like a large lazy Susan that I would have on my dining room table to pass - to pass food around. What exactly is it doing? MIKE OGNENOVSKI: This is actually polishing. It's a large polisher. GREENE: The kind of polisher once used for camera lenses at Kodak, where Ognenovski worked for 27 years. Now that old expertise has found its way into new projects - huge ones. Exelis is making parts that may be in one the largest telescopes on Earth - the Thirty Meter Telescope. Once complete, it will pear out beyond the Milky Way to edge of the observable universe, 13 billion light-years away. Different scale, but same approach and even some of the same tools. But this room - I mean, I just look at it, and it makes me think that a lot the stories I read about Kodak being goneOGNENOVSKI: Right. GREENE: Demised. I mean, it's just - the tradition is there in a very real way. OGNENOVSKI: The tradition is there. It just has another name. Now we're called Exelis, right? So the Kodak heritage technology that was there - that is essentially in the bed rock of what that - of what Kodak stood for back when George Eastman build it - is still there. GREENE: All that said, this picture is far from perfect. You look at this factory, making incredible things with machines both old and new, but there's almost no one here. The factory is more than 16,000 square feet. Only 80 people were here. OGNENOVSKI: You know, you look at the folks that are on this floor right now working - they're highly skilled. And what we want to do is make the work more of a science versus an art. Where - optics in the past traditionally tends to be more art, and that's where the optician came in. So that means a lot of years of experience, a lot of manual labor, touching and feeling and just gut-feel. GREENE: Gut-feel, touching things, making things with your hands - that was American manufacturing. Today, it's less art and more science. And this is exactly the challenge. Even when a place like Rochester seems to be figuring it out, this deeper problem remains. There are very few jobs for the blue-collar worker. It's a conundrum that this man thinks about a lot. NABIL NASR: My name is Nabil Nasr. I'm the associate provost and director of the Golisano Institute for Sustainability at Rochester Institute of Technology - RIT. GREENE: Part of Nasr's work at RIT is helping manufacturers cope with the changing landscape. NASR: Manufacturing today is not what it used to be. In the past, for example, Kodak used to make very sophisticated, high-precision lens in a very primitive process that was very time-consuming. Today, we're making very sophisticated computerized equipment that can make some of this lens in a fraction of the time they used to spend making this lens before. So I think things are changing - not just here in the U. S. I think everywhere else is changing. And a lot of people who relate to manufacturing still look at it from the same lens of the old ways of doing things. GREENE: And that all takes skill. And there are students right here at RIT training for the kinds of jobs they have an Exelis. But that still leaves the question. . . . . . Where's the blue-collar worker today? What options are there for them? NASR: This is a serious issue. First of all, in terms of some of the opening that we have in manufacturing - some the, really, areas of needs - there are high paying jobs. But we don't get qualified people because they require certain expertise and education in math and algebra and a lot of things that some people don't have the foundation for. They can't pass the exams, so as a result, you can't - companies cannot train. So they weren't thinking of that when they were in schools. And they're not able or willing to actually spend that time to get there. GREENE: And this is why we're spending a few weeks thinking about manufacturing in America. There is enormous potential. The U. S. leads the way of many types of research and technology. But as we've heard about for years now, new technology means fewer jobs. And when workers are needed, companies can find them cheaper abroad. So what does all of this mean for the United States? Where does the modern factory fit into American life? Professor Nasr, for his part, says, policymakers, big companies and communities have to come up with a plan. NASR: Manufacturing is so critical. You know, I serve on an advisory board in Singapore. They want to take the best knowledge you can get to provide them with advice. Obviously, it's a small country, but it's just phenomenal to see the will and the desire to make things happen and the metrics that you develop and the partnership between the government and industry. And, of course, they have strong industrial policy. GREENE: Singapore is just one country in a global race, and we'll be hearing in the coming weeks how the U. S. is cultivating its manufacturing sector to make sure it stays competitive. CORNISH: Our colleague David Greene kicking off our American Made project with a visit to Rochester, New York. Tune in for more on the future of American manufacturing in the weeks to come. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  This next story begins with an easily overlooked truth - America still makes stuff.

And a lot of people who relate to manufacturing still look at it from the same lens of the old ways of doing things. GREENE: And that all takes skill. And there are students right here at RIT training for the kinds of jobs they have an Exelis. But that still leaves the question. . . . . . Where's the blue-collar worker today? What options are there for them? NASR: This is a serious issue. First of all, in terms of some of the opening that we have in manufacturing - some the, really, areas of needs - there are high paying jobs. But we don't get qualified people because they require certain expertise and education in math and algebra and a lot of things that some people don't have the foundation for. They can't pass the exams, so as a result, you can't - companies cannot train. So they weren't thinking of that when they were in schools. And they're not able or willing to actually spend that time to get there. GREENE: And this is why we're spending a few weeks thinking about manufacturing in America. There is enormous potential. The U. S. leads the way of many types of research and technology. But as we've heard about for years now, new technology means fewer jobs. And when workers are needed, companies can find them cheaper abroad. So what does all of this mean for the United States? Where does the modern factory fit into American life? Professor Nasr, for his part, says, policymakers, big companies and communities have to come up with a plan. NASR: Manufacturing is so critical. You know, I serve on an advisory board in Singapore. They want to take the best knowledge you can get to provide them with advice. Obviously, it's a small country, but it's just phenomenal to see the will and the desire to make things happen and the metrics that you develop and the partnership between the government and industry. And, of course, they have strong industrial policy. GREENE: Singapore is just one country in a global race, and we'll be hearing in the coming weeks how the U. S. is cultivating its manufacturing sector to make sure it stays competitive. CORNISH: Our colleague David Greene kicking off our American Made project with a visit to Rochester, New York.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Secret recordings by a former employee showed how the Fed oversaw Goldman Sachs. We heard some of those tapes on MORNING EDITION Friday. INSKEEP: In the tapes, bank examiners consider what to do about a major Goldman transaction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We're looking at a transaction that's legal, but shady. INSKEEP: Legal, but shady, the examiner says. In the end, examiners seem to do very little about it. CORNISH: Former examiner Carmen Segarra made the recordings. ProPublica reported their existence along with the public radio program This American Life. And now numerous lawmakers, largely Democrats, are calling for hearings. INSKEEP: One of them is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who once oversaw the Federal Bank bailout and has now made bank regulation a signature issue. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN: Ultimately this report tells us exactly what we already know; that the relationship between regulators and the financial institutions they oversee is too cozy to provide the kind of tough oversight that's really needed. INSKEEP: How is it too cozy? Because of course we hear the regulators on these tapes saying there's a reason that we're trying to have good relationships with banks like Goldman Sachs. We want to know what's going on. We want to get information. WARREN: Oh, golly. So, look, for me, there were two things that jumped out. The first was just a basic lack of truthful reporting. Supervisors are actually telling examiners not to report accurately the damning things they'd heard from bank executives during meetings. I mean, wow. If there's not even an accurate record of what's going on, then the regulators can't hope to do their jobs. And the second thing, look at how the Fed emphasized talk instead of action. You know, the regulators seem to think that it was a victory just to raise an issue. And that's the kind of approach that allowed banks to take on massive risks before the financial crisis. Does anyone believe that Goldman Sachs is going to give up a deal that would yield millions of dollars because someone fussed at them behind closed doors? INSKEEP: The regulators describe this particular deal that was reported on in great detail on the tapes as a transaction that was legal, but shady. It did seem to be within the rules. Does that suggest a problem with regulators or the rules? WARREN: For me, it starts as a problem with the regulators. And let me describe it this way - the cultural problem isn't just some secondary concern; it's the whole ball game. We can keep making the rules tougher and tougher, but it won't make an ounce of difference if the regulators won't enforce the rules that are there. If the regulators back down or back off whenever the banks tell them to, then it's the banks and not the regulators who are running the show. INSKEEP: Now you mentioned a cultural problem, Senator Warren. Of course way back in 2009, there was a report commissioned by the Fed that identified this cultural problem, a reluctance to speak up and a suggestion of a too-close relationship with the banks. But what can you really do about that given that you need to have regulators who perhaps have experience in the financial industry and are going to get to know the financial industry and the people in it really well? WARREN: Well, you know, the first thing we can do is expose it. I mean, that's where this really starts. That's the first step. And that's why it is I want to see oversight hearings; I want to get a complete picture of what's happened here. But we need to move on this and move quickly because the big banks are just getting bigger, and they're taking on new kinds of risks. We need to have regulators who understand that they work for the American people, not for the big banks. INSKEEP: I should mention that these allegations have been around for a while. Carmen Segarra's story has been known for a while; what is new here is the tapes. Was there something just from listening to the tapes that you learned that you did not know before? WARREN: You know, there is something about listening to those tapes. There's no more he-said, she-said, one person describes it this way and another says no. It's that you really do for a moment get to be the fly on the wall that watches all of it. And there it is to be exposed to everyone, the cozy relationship, the fact that the Fed is more concerned about its relationship with a too-big-to-fail bank than it is with protecting the American public. INSKEEP: I suppose if a Goldman official were sitting here, they might point out Goldman was complying with the law, at least according to some of the regulators. And the problem was whether they were doing something that was around the edges of the law, so to speak. WARREN: Well, yeah, but this is partly the role of the regulator. A regulator doesn't say to a big financial institution, hey, step right up here, get your toes on the line. And so long as you can make a legal argument that you have not crossed the line then, hey, we're all cool here. That's not the way regulation of large financial institutions is supposed to work. They're supposed to be using judgment. The point of these tapes is that the regulators are backing off long before anyone's in court making a legal argument about whether or not they came right up to the line or they crossed it. INSKEEP: Do you think that regulators in a situation like that could say, listen, this may be legal, but I don't like it, don't do it? WARREN: You know, I think what regulators can do is they can remind these large financial institutions that there's a lot of room in there for the large financial institutions to get themselves into trouble and to get the entire economy into trouble. I mean, look, that's what happened in 2008. The regulators had the tools to say to the big financial institutions, hey, guys, you've got to back off. You're putting the whole system at risk when you do this, and yet the regulators didn't do that. They were willful and kind of cozy relationship as the big financial institutions continued to run their operations, taking on more risk, doing what they want to do and brushing their regulators aside. INSKEEP: Senator Warren, this is something that you're clearly passionate about, but it's a complicated issue - bank regulation. What would have to happen for it to be a major campaign issue this fall or in 2016? WARREN: I think it already is a campaign issue. The way I see it is for everybody who's running right now in 2014, there's a fundamental question of, whose side do you stand on? You know, the game out there is rigged, and people across this country really get it. And Goldman Sachs' tapes just show it one more time. Little banks have to follow the rules, regular families have to follow the rules, but big financial institutions, somehow they can manage just to push their regulators aside and go forward. There's a fundamental question about who this country works for. It can't just work for those who already have lots of money and lots of power. We've got to have a country that works for everybody else. INSKEEP: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, thanks very much. WARREN: Thank you.

I'm Scott Simon. The U. S. added more jobs last month, according to yesterday's national jobs number. But the losses are still huge in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where four casinos have closed this year, a fifth teeters, and more than 7,000 people have been laid off - dealers, greeters, cooks and maids in the hotels and casinos. And that could mean a future filled with boarded windows and abandoned buildings. Back in 1976, Atlantic City bet its future on gambling. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOT MACHINES)SIMON: The city had lost glitter since its golden times in the 1940s and '50s when it was a favored summer spot with a broad beach, the Boardwalk, pastel resort hotels and the home of the Miss America Pageant. City fell into debt, crime and decrepidness by the '70s. Atlantic City bet that legalized gambling could bring back hope, glory and ka-ching. Louis Malle's 1980 film \"Atlantic City,\" he had Robert Goulet sing a ring-a-ding anthem for a time to come. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ATLANTIC CITY, MY OLD FRIEND\")ROBERT GOULET: (Singing) Be there when I bet on 10. I bet on you. Remember how they put you down. There's not an empty room in town. SIMON: Back in 1987, we interviewed Joe Wittershine with the Golden Nugget, who remembered the early days of gambling in Atlantic City. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)JOE WITTERSHINE: One of my fondest memories was of 1978, coming down to Atlantic City and standing on a boardwalk, while people lined up to get in the casino. Ten o'clock in the morning, security guards open the door. And these people with their coin cups and change ran - ran to these slot machines. And I said, what a fascinating industry this is. People are actually running to give you money. I said, I have to become part of it. SIMON: But gambling is no longer a safe bet. Thousands of casinos have opened in the United States, in major cities and on Indian reservation lands nearby, which we saw for ourselves this week in Atlantic City. With a casino like the Taj Mahal, where on the floor of it - now have lost all the day-trippers - people who get on a bus in Philadelphia or somewhere else in New Jersey or in Queens, Astoria, and to come to Atlantic City in a casino like this for a day, spend eight hours in front of a slot machine, have a couple of drinks and leave. Now they have other places to go that are a lot closer to home. MAYOR DON GUARDIAN: That $5 billion that people spent in Atlantic City on gaming is now being split by 30 casinos in Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, when just six years ago, it all belonged to Atlantic City. SIMON: Don Guardian, he's the mayor of Atlantic City. He says he has to lay off 200 to 300 city employees by the middle of next year because taxpayers can't afford to pay for city services like they were slot machines. GUARDIAN: Now we can't afford to do it, and everything came crashing down all within a six-month period. SIMON: Donald Hardrick was one of the people who was clobbered in that crash. He worked the desk at the Revel casino hotel, which closed in September. DONALD HARDRICK: It's been hard. I mean, the first week was OK, you know, hanging out, chilling. But now, it does get boring after a while. I've been looking at casino jobs - you know, I've been applying at Borgata, Golden Nugget, Tropicana, Resorts, but no callbacks yet. SIMON: And after all, more than 7,000 other people in town have lost their jobs too. HARDRICK: Seven-thousand people, and there's not 7,000 jobs, so it's hard. Only thing you can do is just apply - that's it. Just apply, apply and pray for the best. SIMON: Cindy Almonte lost her job as a dealer at one casino and has been rehired at another, but says people who had full-time work now have to accept part-time jobs that pay less. ALMONTE: People that were full time at Showboat are part-time at Caesars or part-time at Harrah's. You know, they got a transfer but it's not the same position. So it's still a struggle. SIMON: Donald Hardwick has two months of unemployment benefits let. HARDRICK: I'm going to be all right. You know, I have my mother, I have - you know, I have money saved up. But there are a lot of people I work with that have families, kids, were going to school. I'm going to be OK. I'm worried about, you know, the others that are, you know, maybe a little older, can't really just get up and leave. But, you know, I'm still relatively young, so. . . SIMON: A lot of work in Atlantic City has always been seasoned, tied to the swell of tourists drawn to the sea in the summer. Justin Garrett is a bartender at the Dusk Nightclub at Caesars. JUSTIN GARRETT: I'm always worried about the winter. The winter is always our slow season and we always take a hit in the winter. So we try to make what we can in the summer and just, you know, kind of like squirrels, we stockpile for the winter just so we can make it through. SIMON: Mayor Don Guardian can see several layers of Atlantic City history from his top floor office window. The old resort town with wedding cake-style seafront hotels and saltwater spas, many of which were left to peel by legalized gambling, and the newer, gaudy and glassy casinos that now sit dark and empty. What short speech do you give people - business people in particular - about why they should now make a bet on Atlantic City? GUARDIAN: Because we are Filene's Basement. You're not going to find the better bargain then coming to Atlantic City. Two billion, two hundred million dollars property at Revel, you're going to pick up for about $100 million. Four hundred million dollar casino that closed other than Revel, you're going to pick up for $25 million. SIMON: With the advantage of a little more than a generation of hindsight, did Atlantic City make a bad bet on gaming? GUARDIAN: If I could compare Atlantic City on a small scale to the United Arab Emirates on the big scale, these guys figured out they had oil but it was finite. And so they weren't going to have oil forever, and they needed to do something with their country and decided that having the business capital of the Mideast would make a whole lot of sense. They developed Dubai. Atlantic City had the advantage of the billions of dollars coming through with gaming to do things other than gaming in the city to fix it up, to diversify, become a cool place to visit, to become a great place to live. We didn't take advantage of that. That was our mistake. SIMON: Mayor Guardian told us about a plan of a Florida man to build a university in the Revel Casino site. But this week, a Canadian gaming company won the auction for the property. The Revel cost $2. 4 billion when it opened two years ago. This week it was sold for $110 million. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ATLANTIC CITY, MY OLD FRIEND\")GOULET: (Singing) I'm glad to see you're born again. Atlantic City, my old friend. You're back upon the map again. You sure came through.

SIEGEL: Even though this group is the best educated generation to date, here's an interesting note. Data from the Pew Research Center shows about two-thirds of people between the ages of 25 and 32 do not have a bachelor's degree. That majority is often overlooked in conversations about millennial.

She's 31, part of the same millennial generation. But she lives in a harshly different economic world than many of the elite students she serves. ANDRE: I needed the extra money. Like, I was just struggling too much so I felt like I needed something, you know, to supplement my income. KHALID: Andre works weekends here for minimum wage. That's in addition to her job Monday through Friday, where she processes authorizations for an insurance company. In some ways, Andre is very much a typical millennial. She's not married and admits she doesn't go to church as often as she did growing up. And, like most millennials, she lacks a college degree. ANDRE: I didn't have any help from my parents or anyone else helping to support me. KHALID: Andre emigrated from Haiti when she was five. ANDRE: So I felt like I needed to work full-time as opposed to going to school full-time. KHALID: Andre had wanted to become an elementary school teacher but dropped out of college before senior year. She had an academic scholarship but she still needed money for rent and other basic living expenses. Not having a college degree is true for a majority of millennials, according to the Pew Research Center. In other words, Andre's story is the norm, even though it doesn't match the popular myth. RICHARD FRY: There's been a lot of attention paid to the adversities facing college-educated millennials but generally the college-educated young adults, they're doing better than earlier generations of college-educated young adults. KHALID: Richard Fry is the lead researcher on a Pew report about the rising cost of not going to college. His study finds millennials with a four year college degree make roughly $17,500 more per year than millennials with only a high school diploma. FRY: Among the less educated, it's not simply that they're trailing behind their college-educated counterparts. It's that they're doing worse off than earlier generations of less educated young adults. ANDRE: I've been super busy lately with work and life (laughter). KHALID: Andre lives in a one-bedroom apartment in an immigrant enclave of suburban Boston. ANDRE: I picked up some shifts and stuff at my job. OK. I'll go upstairs. Leilah, say hi. LEILAH: Hi. KHALID: Andre is a single mom to her 3-year-old daughter, Leilah. Most days, she leaves her place at seven a. m. , drops her daughter off at preschool and drives another half hour to her weekday job, where she makes about $38,000 a year. ANDRE: I definitely find myself stressing a lot about money. I struggle in making ends meet at the end of the month. And I usually make it by the skin of my teeth (laughter). KHALID: But a few times, she hasn't made it. And she had to borrow money from a friend to pay rent. She says she would probably be making more money if she had a degree. ANDRE: I'd probably be teaching. I'd probably be doing something that I love, as opposed to doing something that I have to do to sustain myself, and a life for my daughter and I. KHALID: Like many of her peers, Andre wants more than a job. She wants a career. But that's not easy when you are caring for a child and working seven days a week. Still she's upbeat about her financial future. And that's true for the 85 percent of millennials who say they either have enough money to live the lives they want or they expect to in the future.

Tirole has written some highly influential books about how to make large firms more productive and what regulators should do to keep them from abusing their position. Tirole will be awarded the Nobel in Stockholm on December 7. The Nobel carries with it a cash prize of more than a million dollars. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins me to talk about more about Jean Tirole and his work. So, Jim, first off, just tell us a little bit about this economist and why he is the Nobel committee's pick this year. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: He is a professor at Toulouse 1 Capitole University in France. Together with his late partner Jean-Jacques Laffont, he wrote several books looking at how to keep large firms from abusing their positions. He's also an expert on specific industries such as telecommunications and banking that have been struggling with some of these questions especially lately. So in a way, when we're dealing with this issue of too big to fail, I mean, this is a very timely award. MARTIN: And as you say, he's worked on this issue - how to control really big companies or monopolies even. Can you talk a little bit more about how he views them and how to keep them in line? ZARROLI: He says in many cases, being a big, large company is a good thing because large companies can be more productive. We want business to flow from smaller, less-productive companies to bigger companies. But there are some industries where this is not the case -industries like railroads and utility companies - the cost of entry, the capital costs, are so high that you really can only have one, maybe two, major players. And if there are newcomers trying to get into this business, these firms can abuse their position to try and block them from entry. So the committee says Professor Tirole has used game theory to look more deeply into these issues than any economist has before him. MARTIN: So those are some of the problems. What are the solutions that Professor Tirole outlines? ZARROLI: He says 30 years ago, the answer would've been to cap the firm's profits - the big firm's profits. In other words, you'd tell that big utility company it can only make so much money, no more than that. The problem is that regulators often don't understand the markets they regulate very well. So they don't know the potential scope of improvement; they don't know how much really can be done to make the industry more productive. And the company doesn't have any incentive to tell them because it knows that if it does - it makes more profits, it will have to sacrifice it. So some companies can actually be unwilling to become more productive. So Professor Tirole has studied ways to allow some of these producers to keep more of the value that they generate, and one of the things he says is that all industries are different, some needed to be treated one way and some needed to be treated another. MARTIN: Does his framework of analysis apply to the industry of tack? I mean, which is obviously a burgeoning industry, a lot of change and there are companies in that world, like Google, that are so huge that they have this tremendous impact at a very fast rate. ZARROLI: Right. Yeah, he was actually asked about Google this morning at a press conference. He said it was an example of a two- sided market; it has two customers. One is us, the users, the eyeballs, but then another is the advertisers. And in such cases, often there's an asymmetry to the value that the customers are getting. You as a customer get quite a lot from Google, whereas the advertisers have to pay a lot to be on the site. So this is a factor that really complicates efforts to regulate companies like Google, and he says regulators really have to take this into account when they're trying to figure out how to deal with it. MARTIN: NPR's Jim Zarroli on the Nobel Prize winner for economics. Thanks so much, Jim. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

S. economy appears to be healing slowly from the Great Recession, but the European economy not. When economic officials from around the world gathered here over the weekend, there was even talk of a triple-dip recession. To learn more about this and the implications, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He's the director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent at The Wall Street Journal. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. MARTIN: OK, triple-dip recession. That does not sound like a good thing. What's happening in Europe? WESSEL: It's not a good thing. So the Eurozone, the 18 countries that share the common currency the euro, joined the United States in the Great Recession in 2008, the one provoked by the housing bust here and subsequent financial turmoil. Then, Europe stumbled into a recession of its own making in 2011, when there were doubts about whether its governments could pay their debts. And there was even doubts whether the euro itself as a currency would survive. As is so often the case in Europe, though, they muddled through, avoiding catastrophe, returned to growth in early 2013, but are struggling with such slow growth that unemployment is above 11 percent in the Eurozone and as high as 25 percent in Spain. And now with the adverse side effects of Ukraine and the blockade on Russia, some disappointing data from Germany, which is the big economy in Europe, of course, there are worries, as you said, that Europe is at risk of falling back into a recession. The International Monetary Fund marked down its forecast for Germany, France and Italy. And it puts the odds of a Eurozone recession over the next year at 40 percent, which is pretty high as these things go. MARTIN: OK, so how does Europe prevent that from happening? WESSEL: Well, the IMF has been pushing the European Central Bank, their equivalent of the Federal Reserve, to be more aggressive, to launch a big program of bond-buying like the one that the Fed did here, particularly because inflation in Europe is a very low 0. 3 percent. France wants relief from its promises to bring its budget deficit down, and Italy's applauding that. There's a very loud chorus calling on the German government to both increase public investment spending on both infrastructure and stuff like that and to maybe cut taxes to encourage more business investment there. The five major economic institutes in Germany recently said that Germany's economy was stagnating and that the government needed to worry less about debt and deficits and more about public investment. But the finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has been really not happy about those suggestions. The Wall Street Journal quotes him today as saying that there's no reason for any nervous, hysterical hyperbole, and so now they're just kind of, you know, muddling through as they often do. MARTIN: So what does this mean? We know we live in a global economy, but explain how what's happening in Europe matters here. WESSEL: Well, the Eurozone is a very big part of the world, and it accounts for about 12 percent of the world economy. So when you add up the world economy - it's Europe, the U. S. and China - you get a big chunk of economic activity. Europe is a big market for U. S. exports, particularly important for U. S. multinational companies and mostly a recession would be really bad timing because except for the U. S. and the U. K. , the rest of the world seems to be slowing down. The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, warned this week about - over the weekend about a new mediocre, where growth is low and uneven, and it's all terribly disappointing because there've been widespread hopes that finally the global economy was picking up momentum. MARTIN: New mediocre, doesn't sound like a good thing. What does all this mean for the short- and long-term here at home? WESSEL: Well, a triple-dip in Europe certainly isn't a plus for the U. S. , and the recent weakness in the stock market is one indication that these worries about the global economy are weighing on investors. But we're a very big market for our own goods and services, and our banks are healthier than Europe, our budget-deficit is coming down and we finally seem to see a little bit of momentum. We have a lot of chronic problems, but the short-term outlook looks better than it has for some time. MARTIN: We'll take that.

At one point, the Dow industrials were down 460 points, a huge drop that came on top of four consecutive days of stock market losses. The decline more than wiped out the year's gains. But then late in the trading day, stocks started to recover. And by the close, the Dow's loss was a little more than 1 percent. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, investors seem to be worried about a global economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve's next move and even the Ebola virus. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: October has sometimes been a catastrophic month for the stock market. And though this month isn't that bad yet, it sometimes felt today like disaster was lurking. Stock prices plunged sharply in the morning, came back a bit and then fell again. At one point today, the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down nearly 3 percent, and that came after several days of steep losses. But it recovered some of its lost ground by the end of the day. Randy Frederick is managing director of trading and derivatives at Schwab. RANDY FREDERICK: Given that we've seen volatility spike up to levels that we haven't seen since the fall of 2011, I would consider that there's a bit of fear out there right now. And that's something we haven't seen for a very long time. ZARROLI: Frederick says investors are growing more and more worried about how much the economy has slowed in Asia and Europe. He says Germany, for instance, largely escaped the consequences of the last downturn in 2011. FREDERICK: But we've seen recent significant declines in German GDP, we've seen sharp drops in German business and investor confidence and we see really the European Central Bank kind of in a position where they are talking of doing things but they can't seem to come to a decision on exactly what they are going to do. And I think some people are beginning to question if they have any true ammunition left to combat this. ZARROLI: Compared to Europe, the U. S. economy continues to grow at a pretty good pace. But a string of bad economic data today left a lot of investors questioning how long it will keep doing so. Retail sales plunged more than expected in September. And then there's the Ebola virus. In addition to all the other bad things it would do, an outbreak of the disease in this country could wreak havoc on U. S. trade and investment. Doug Roberts is chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research. DOUG ROBERTS: All these things are kind of hitting at one time and people are now saying, you know, I want to reduce my risk exposure very, very quickly. ZARROLI: With all of these fears mounting, investors did what they have so often done - they pulled their money out of riskier investments and into the safety of U. S. Treasury bonds. And that drove interest rates down sharply. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, believes investors may be overreacting. JIM PAULSEN: The fact that the 10-year yields broke 2 percent again in a U. S. economy that arguably is in the best shape and fastest growing in the entire recovery - I think that's a real disconnect. ZARROLI: But for now investors seem to be swamped by fears. One other looming concern is where the Federal Reserve is likely to go in the months ahead. As the U. S. economy has improved, Fed officials have gradually made clear that an interest rate hike is somewhere on the horizon. That's not likely to happen anytime soon, but it's enough to add to the market's jitters at a time when there's already plenty of other things to worry about. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  It was another stomach-churning day on Wall Street. At one point, the Dow industrials were down 460 points, a huge drop that came on top of four consecutive days of stock market losses. The decline more than wiped out the year's gains. But then late in the trading day, stocks started to recover. And by the close, the Dow's loss was a little more than 1 percent. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, investors seem to be worried about a global economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve's next move and even the Ebola virus. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: October has sometimes been a catastrophic month for the stock market. And though this month isn't that bad yet, it sometimes felt today like disaster was lurking. Stock prices plunged sharply in the morning, came back a bit and then fell again. At one point today, the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down nearly 3 percent, and that came after several days of steep losses. But it recovered some of its lost ground by the end of the day. Randy Frederick is managing director of trading and derivatives at Schwab. RANDY FREDERICK: Given that we've seen volatility spike up to levels that we haven't seen since the fall of 2011, I would consider that there's a bit of fear out there right now. And that's something we haven't seen for a very long time. ZARROLI: Frederick says investors are growing more and more worried about how much the economy has slowed in Asia and Europe.

This morning, a company that's been in business for more than a century, producing dinnerware on the banks of the Ohio River in Newell, West Virginia. Most American ceramics factories closed long ago, unable to compete with made-in-Japan or -Mexico. But the Homer Laughlin China plant is still going strong 141 years after opening, employing about 1,000 people. You might be familiar with its most famous product. It's that brightly colored pottery called Fiesta. NPR's Linda Wertheimer, who grew up with Fiesta, jumped at the chance to visit the factory. LINDA WERTHEIMER, BYLINE: My mother collected a warm yellow. My Fiesta is deep cobalt blue - just so you know where I stand. Fiesta is about half Homer Laughlin's business. The other half is dinnerware for hotels and the sturdy plates and cups you find a chain restaurants. Walk into the big, dim factory buildings - dusty and smelling of mud - and you might be back at Homer Laughlin's beginnings in the 19th century. People are sitting quietly in pools of light, carefully attaching handles to greenware, - that's not-yet-fired coffee cups - decorators are painting bands of color on glazed plates. KEVIN MANYPENNY: I'm just a hand-liner. I put lines on - the orders tell me I need to put a three-thirty-second an eighth from the edge and a three-sixty-fourth a 16th below and a three-sixty-fourth verge. WERTHEIMER: Kevin Manypenny has worked in the Homer Laughlin factory since he was a teenager. He twirls a plate, dips a brush in brown glaze and paints three delicate lines on the plate's edge. This plate is for a Boston restaurant. Manypenny finishes the plate and then tosses it onto a broad, moving belt as if he were skipping a stone across water. Who plays catcher down the other end? MANYPENNY: A younger brother. JAMES MANYPENNY: James Manypenny, I go by Jim. I'm a kiln-placer. I place ware on the kiln. It's not supposed to hit the floor. (Laughter). WERTHEIMER: He calls the ovens which fire the China kilns - spelled K-I-L-N-S, but potters don't pronounce that N. Seven out of 8 of the Manypenny siblings and their parents have worked at this factory, and there are dozens of families like theirs. Brothers founded the company - Homer and Shakespeare Laughlin - presumably a literary family. They jumped on a new fashion for whiter, more refined dinnerware. Sarah Vodrey of the area's Ceramic Museum described their beginnings. SARAH VODREY: They were the young whippersnappers in the pottery world, and they were the ones who ended up successfully firing for kilns worth of whiteware before any of the other potteries could. And then they won a prize of $5,000, and that's what launched the Laughlin brothers into pottery production on a big scale. WERTHEIMER: Around the turn of the 20th century, the company changed hands. The new team built a new plant on the West Virginia side of the river, and those long, low factory buildings are still in use today. Then in the '30s, the company created Fiesta - cheap, colorful, cheerful dinnerware. It was a hit even in the Depression. In 1948, Homer Laughlin really stepped up the production of plates and bowls. They designed and built their own machine inside the factory. Dave Conley, a longtime employee and unofficial company historian, calls it the big, flat automatic. DAVE CONLEY: This is the flat automatic jigger. You've got three machines here, and each one has two heads on it. So theoretically we could be making six different items at a time. WERTHEIMER: He said that's 3,000 dozen pieces every eight-hour shift. People who make dishes talk in dozens. You'll have to do the math. I'm giving you the history because it's all still happening - the buildings, the machine, the kilns, Fiesta and the owners are all still going. Of course, there have been improvements. Computers control the firing now. A 3-D  printer speeds the design process. Ceramic engineers found a way to make glaze shiny without using lead - all done in-house. CONLEY: The people that owned our company have always put profits back into the plant to modernize. And we've always had state-of-the-art equipment, and I call that state-of-the-art even though it's as old as it is - it's almost 60 years old. WERTHEIMER: He's talking about the big, flat automatic. It still works. By this time, we had walked the entire 37-acre factory floor and were standing on a loading dock. But inside the old buildings, on the chilly day we were there, with fog pouring off the Ohio River and drifting into the windows, we watched the ware come out of the fire, magically transformed - creamy orange, intense red, vivid turquoise, bright pottery stacked in bins and crates piled all over the place. BRUCE SMITH: I remember the first time I actually went to the facility and looking around, and I'm thinking, boy, am I back in the 1940s or what? I mean, even the office, it isn't all spruced up. It's the old look, and they're focused on making product and not being flashy. WERTHEIMER: That's Bruce Smith, head of the union representing the pottery workers. He says while nothing about Homer Laughlin is flashy, the workers do make decent money. SMITH: You know, they're good jobs, and they're making a living, being able to buy a home and raise a family and retire with some dignity. WERTHEIMER: Both management and labor consider that an achievement. ELIZABETH WELLS MCILVAIN: I'm very proud to have kept this business here in the Ohio Valley. It's very important to us. WERTHEIMER: Elizabeth Wells McIlvain is the first woman to lead Homer Laughlin and the fourth generation of her family to run the plant. Her immediate family now owns most of the business. She told us that Homer Laughlin China stopped producing Fiesta for a time in the '70s. Harvest gold and avocado green didn't sell. But in 1986, Bloomingdale's department store came calling, looking for a retro China for their stores. And Homer Laughlin made a typical, practical decision - restart an old line, revive Fiesta for retail sale, along with their existing hotel and restaurant business. MCILVAIN: We have two sides of the business. And that's helped us tremendously because it seems when one side of the business - the retail side of the business is flourishing, the hotel side is having problems, is having difficulties and vice versa. WERTHEIMER: It helps that Fiesta has a big fan base. Collectors stand in line for hours to get into the factory tent sales. Fans meet. They swap. They critique the company's color choices, and they wait for the new Fiesta color which is unveiled each March. MCILVAIN: They always have suggestions. (Laughter) The one year, they all wanted fuchsia, and they all arrived to Homer Laughlin to go on their tours dressed in whatever fuchsia they had. That was their silent-but-very-loud statement. WERTHEIMER: The folks at the factory steered us away from fuchsia as next year's color - manufacturing problems, they said. But they offered no color clues. Says Ms. McIlvain. . . MCILVAIN: That's a very deep, dark secret (laughter) not to be told. WERTHEIMER: I'm Linda Wertheimer for NPR News.

But the millennial generation is upending all of that. Fewer young adults than ever are tying the knot. Almost half of millennial women who give birth are not married. NPR's Jennifer Ludden has the latest in our series on the New Boom. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: It's lunchtime when I meet Michelle Sheridan and Phillip Underwood at their apartment in Frederick, Maryland. PHILLIP UNDERWOOD: Oh, sweetheart. LUDDEN: Two-year-old Lilliana is hungry. MICHELLE SHERIDAN: You'd think we don't feed you. LUDDEN: This is not Michelle's first child. Eight-year-old Logan's at school. His dad left before he was born. She got pregnant again a year after she and Phillip had moved in together. Like half of all pregnancies in the U. S. , it wasn't exactly planned. SHERIDAN: But it wasn't really like a bad time or - I don't know. It just seemed like an OK thing to do. UNDERWOOD: I stared at the pregnancy test for 10 minutes waiting for it to change. SHERIDAN: He did stare at the pregnancy test for 10 minutes. But then he got really happy. It was actually really cute. LUDDEN: Decades ago, an oops would've meant a rush to the altar. But older millennials are children of the 1980s - the decade of the nation's highest divorce rate. Phillip's dad walked out when he was a baby. Michelle's parents stayed together but fought a lot. SHERIDAN: That was hard to watch. I don't want to go through that. I don't want my kids to see it. LUDDEN: So even though she's 28 and he's 32, they say the pregnancy never prompted thoughts of marriage. If anything, the opposite. SHERIDAN: It changes the dynamic of the household. I had a friend who put off her marriage, got pregnant and she's like, let's just wait 'cause we don't know if we're going to be able to make it through this. We don't know if this is going to change who we are. We don't know if this is going to change the stress level and we'll be able to adjust to that. LUDDEN: One big stressor - money. Michelle spent years as a restaurant server, then pizza delivery driver. She got pregnant just as she had managed to start college full-time with federal aid. Phillip's a car technician, but he'd been through a rough patch work wise. UNDERWOOD: It was so sporadic, and it would go from full-time one week to 20 hours the next. LUDDEN: Their apartment is government-subsidized. Things were so tight at one point, they shared a cell phone. But isn't that the time-honored way? Marry young and poor and work your way up? SHERIDAN: No, that seems terrifying at this point. Like, it's hard enough to work up just on your own. Trying to work up as a couple seems, like, so. . . LUDDEN: She sighs at a loss for words. ARIELLE KUPERBERG: Fifty years ago, when people graduated high school, they could go out and get a manufacturing job and have a pretty good wage - you know, some benefits. LUDDEN: But Arielle Kuperberg of the University of North Carolina Greensboro says those wages have been falling since the 1970s. The unemployment rate for high school grads today is double that for those with a college degree. It's not that lesser educated couples don't want to wed, she says. Kuperberg studied the labor market in 20 cities. KUPERBERG: In cities that had better labor markets for people with less education, there was actually a smaller gap in marriage rates. LUDDEN: Kuperberg worries this changing economy is making marriage almost a luxury - something for only the better off. DIANA BLACK: And so here's a picture of our groomsmen and Dave. LUDDEN: In Harrisonburg, Virginia, Diana Black shows me her wedding album from last year. DIANA BLACK: Getting ready. Here's my mom. LUDDEN: She and her husband, Dave, started dating in college. They now have graduate degrees and budding careers. Dave waited to propose until he got a handle on his student loans. DAVE BLACK: I had the bulk of them paid off at that point. And I felt like I was in a decent place to shell out the additional money for the ring. LUDDEN: They were the first in their circle to get engaged. But at 27, neither feels ready for children just yet. DIANA BLACK: For me, parenthood is such an enormous responsibility. And the longer I give myself, I feel like the better prepared I'll be. LUDDEN: That doesn't mean they're not planning. Dave and Diana take me to see the four-bedroom house they recently bought - big yard out back, good schools nearby and upstairs, a perfect child's room complete with secret passage. DIANA BLACK: This door here goes to the attic. So for a kid, that would feel very Harry Potter-tastic, I think. LUDDEN: Two different stories, two couples who each say they're acting in the best interests of their children. But researcher Arielle Kuperberg says this marriage divide could mean more inequality in the next generation. The problem, she says, is not that people are having kids without being married - it's that, on average, unwed couples are far more likely to split up by the time their child is 5. KUPERBERG: And we know that that leads to other problems, at least to some behavioral problems. It could lead to academic problems. It just leads to kind of less of a sense of stability, which hurts their chances later on. LUDDEN: Of course, it doesn't always happen that way, and not it seems for the first family we met. SHERIDAN: Come here, sweetie pie. UNDERWOOD: Come here, sweetie pie. LUDDEN: Earlier this year, Phillip landed a steady job as a car technician at Wal-Mart. He says that made him think differently about proposing to Michelle. UNDERWOOD: I know every week I will be working 40 hours. I'm not making the most money in the world, but we're not financially tight. SHERIDAN: We have diapers, and everybody eats. UNDERWOOD: Yeah. DIANA BLACK: (Laughter) And we can drive when we need to drive somewhere. UNDERWOOD: And there's a roof. LUDDEN: By the end of his first month on the new job, he'd bought a ring. She said yes. Since we spoke, Phillip's moved to an even better job, and they've set a date, next June. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.

Dave and Diana take me to see the four-bedroom house they recently bought - big yard out back, good schools nearby and upstairs, a perfect child's room complete with secret passage. DIANA BLACK: This door here goes to the attic. So for a kid, that would feel very Harry Potter-tastic, I think. LUDDEN: Two different stories, two couples who each say they're acting in the best interests of their children. But researcher Arielle Kuperberg says this marriage divide could mean more inequality in the next generation. The problem, she says, is not that people are having kids without being married - it's that, on average, unwed couples are far more likely to split up by the time their child is 5. KUPERBERG: And we know that that leads to other problems, at least to some behavioral problems. It could lead to academic problems. It just leads to kind of less of a sense of stability, which hurts their chances later on. LUDDEN: Of course, it doesn't always happen that way, and not it seems for the first family we met. SHERIDAN: Come here, sweetie pie. UNDERWOOD: Come here, sweetie pie. LUDDEN: Earlier this year, Phillip landed a steady job as a car technician at Wal-Mart. He says that made him think differently about proposing to Michelle. UNDERWOOD: I know every week I will be working 40 hours. I'm not making the most money in the world, but we're not financially tight. SHERIDAN: We have diapers, and everybody eats. UNDERWOOD: Yeah. DIANA BLACK: (Laughter) And we can drive when we need to drive somewhere. UNDERWOOD: And there's a roof. LUDDEN: By the end of his first month on the new job, he'd bought a ring. She said yes. Since we spoke, Phillip's moved to an even better job, and they've set a date, next June. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.", "section": "New Boom", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

S. unemployment rate has been falling steadily for the past few years. In September it reached 5. 9 percent. That's getting close to what the economists call the natural unemployment rate. It's the normal level of joblessness you'd expect in a healthy economy. But a lot of economists are asking whether the old rules about full employment still apply. NPR's Jim Zarroli explains. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It might seem counterintuitive, but there is always going to be some unemployment. People are always out there looking for work, says former Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner. RANDALL KROSZNER: Even in the best of times you're going to have some positive unemployment rate. There's always going to be some churning in the labor market. That's actually a sign of health. ZARROLI: But how much unemployment is too much? It's not a question people asked much three or four years ago when the unemployment rate was obviously painfully too high. But now that it's dropped so much the question is coming up again. For a long time, it was conventional wisdom that the unemployment rate should be around five and a half percent. Former Fed Governor Alan Blinder. . . ALAN BLINDER: The problem is you can't sustain an unemployment rate that's super low without some other bad things happening, principally, a rise in inflation. ZARROLI: If the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent, economists fear there'd be a scarcity of workers. Employers would have to raise wages, and prices would go up. Then in the 1990s something baffling happened. Unemployment actually dipped below five and a half percent and then kept dipping below five percent, even below four percent with no significant uptick in inflation. Blinder says. . . BLINDER: First thing to say is it was a big surprise to most economists. ZARROLI: How can unemployment fall so low without a significant surge in inflation? Economists have lots of theories. John Canally of LPL Financial says wage pressures have eased in part because of globalization. JOHN CANALLY: In the mid-70s if you went to your boss and said hey, boss, I need a raise. The boss would go yeah, there's probably not anyone else around who could do your job so yeah, OK, I'll give you a raise. Today if you go to your boss, in a lot of jobs the boss goes you know what? Someone in India can do it for half your price and do it twice as fast. OK, so you're fired. ZARROLI: Whatever the explanation, economists were forced to reassess their notions of full employment. And today they disagree about just what the natural unemployment rate is. The disagreement extends to the Federal Reserve, says Randall Kroszner. KROSZNER: Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee have said well, we're very close to our goal, our long-run goal of the unemployment rate being close to the mid-five. ZARROLI: Even though inflation remains very low, these Fed members worry that it could resurface. But the new Fed Chair Janet Yellen has made clear she sees things differently. The 5. 9 percent unemployment rate, she says, masks an unusual amount of hidden weakness in the economy. There are millions of people working part-time who want to work full-time. And there are the much discussed discouraged workers who have simply given up looking for work and aren't counted on the unemployment rolls. Again, Alan Blinder. BLINDER: Janet Yellen's view, also my view and the view of many economists - but not all - is that for a variety of reasons - some understandable and some mysterious - the unemployment rate is kind of out-of-step relative to other indicators of the state of the labor market. ZARROLI: And that's important because Fed officials will have to decide soon when to begin raising interest rates. And that will depend on how close the U. S. economy is to full employment. That means they'll have to decide just how relevant the jobless rate is and whether old notions of full employment still apply. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   The U.

As the U. S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker recently put it to Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, let's not waste a good crisis. Secretary Pritzker reportedly said that these times of stress and change can hasten reforms that will encourage companies to do business in Ukraine. After Ukraine, she was off to Poland, then on to Turkey on a tour of what's called commercial diplomacy. Secretary Pritzker joins us from her office in Washington, D. C. Thanks so much for being with us. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE PENNY PRITZKER: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: Secretary Pritzker, explain to us the - if that's what it is - the kind of dance you have to go through between talking to people in Ukraine or Turkey. Or for that matter, I would imagine you have to spend some time with the American businesspeople to say, look, this might not seem like a stable environment, but there's opportunity here. PRITZKER: Well, the first step is for leaders like President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yaksenyuk to recognize that they need to create an environment where businesses want to come and do business. Now obviously Ukraine is in a real transition at this moment. But what I was trying to say with the idea of don't waste the crisis is do the things that, you know, where your parliament can take action. Begin to address the fundamentals so that as the military crisis recedes, which we're hopeful that that happens, you're setting yourself up to where more businesses - and we hope American businesses - will come and be present in Ukraine. SIMON: You met with President Erdogan of Turkey. I think a lot of Americans may wonder, given the sensitive nature of the relationship United States and Turkey have at the moment, does anybody say or does anybody need to - you help us out with this action we're undertaking an ISIS, and we can help you out with your business questions? PRITZKER: Well, we talk in general about the breadth of the relationship. I'm not going to suggest there are specific trades. But the existence of both countries, both on a military, diplomatic and economic standpoint, are intertwined. And what was particularly helpful in our conversations was a number of the issues that our American businesses were raising with the Turkish leadership are the same issues the Turkish businesses are raising with their own government. And my view is you're working together as partners that it can be beneficial both to the companies but also to U. S. -Turkish policy. And that's really commercial diplomacy at work. SIMON: You're headed to Japan and South Korea. A lot of commercial relationships obviously between United States in those two countries. What's your message there? PRITZKER: Well, our messages is that we have terrific relationships with both countries and they're great allies. But the question is, you know, our trade relationship is not growing at the kind of the rate that we would like to see it. You know, you have Prime Minister Abe who is trying very hard to rejuvenate Japan's economy. And we want, as one of Japan's closest allies, if not the closest ally, we want to participate in helping see both Japan welcome foreign direct investment and welcome our exports. But also we want to welcome the Japanese to investing here in the United States - all of which are good for both economies. SIMON: U. S.

At one point, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index dropped to a level almost seven and a half percent below its record high posted just a month ago. Panic investors sent the Dow Industrials down 460 points briefly on Wednesday before the market turned around with major indexes up between one and two percent on Friday. NPR's economic correspondent John Ydstie joins us. John, thanks so much for being with us. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: My pleasure, Scott. SIMON: Can we say what caused the market sell off? YDSTIE: Well, a lot of things came together this week that unsettled investors - a big drop in the price of oil, for one, growing concern about a slowdown in Europe, worries about the Fed ending its bond-buying stimulus program at the end of the month. And then it was topped off by this sense of panic, I think, over the Ebola cases in the U. S. SIMON: And let me ask you about that. We're talking about a handful of cases. Is it a real concrete threat? What's the concern here? YDSTIE: Well, I don't think it's a threat to the economy unless the situation changes in a very dramatic way. There was some pressure on U. S. Airline stocks when it was discovered that one of the affected nurses had flown with the fever, but, you know, the number of cases outside of West Africa are tiny. And the countries there that are really suffering from the crisis have such small economies that they hardly register globally. SIMON: I want to ask you about the fall in the price of oil because ordinarily you'd see that as being good - right? - for the economy? People pay less for gasoline, they have more disposable income in other areas. YDSTIE: Well, generally it is good. But, you know, the answer has become a bit more complicated now. Remember U. S. oil production has shot up dramatically in recent years because of fracking. That's been a bright spot for the economy. And if oil prices were to fall another $10 or so and stayed there, it could actually hurt the U. S. industry. What was more important to investors was that the rapid drop in oil this week, which was down near $80 a barrel before recovering a bit, is that it was one more signal that the global economy is weaker than we thought it was just a couple months ago. And less demand for oil reflects that. SIMON: How do we estimate how much a global slowdown is going to hurt the U. S. economy? YDSTIE: Well, it will be a drag, but, you know, despite our complaints about the U. S. underachieving economically, we're actually doing better than any other major economy. The U. S. added nearly a quarter of a million jobs in August. Company profits continue to rise. And, you know, most economists are still predicting a growth rate near three percent for the last half of this year. U. S. stocks have been at record highs. Many analysts argue they were priced for perfection. And some unsettling news brought them closer to reality. SIMON: So John, at the end of the week what put the brakes on the slide and pumped the market higher? YDSTIE: Well, a lot of people are crediting the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, James Bullard, who suggested on Thursday that given the situation, the Fed might not want to end its bond-buying stimulus program at the end of the month. Now I'd be surprised if it were extended, but it was reassurance to investors that the Fed is still committed to keeping the economy on track. SIMON: NPR's John Ydstie, thanks very much.

Lynn Good is one of the rare ones. She heads one of the largest electric power companies in the U. S. And we're going to meet her now as part of our series \"The Changing Lives Of Women. \" NPR's Yuki Noguchi spoke with Lynn Good about - among other things - being the face of a company grappling with some very public challenges. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The first time I meet Lynn Good, it's by accident - crammed behind the hotel entrance doors the day before our schedule interview. She was waiting calmly after the fire alarms had gone off. It occurs to me later it was a fitting introduction to a woman whose corporate ascent has been marked by some emergency detours. LYNN GOOD: There's nothing about Lynn Good at age 30 or age 35 that would've said, I am setting my sights on being a CEO. NOGUCHI: But at age 55, she is - at Duke Energy, the nation's largest utility, based on market value. She's at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Conference to speak even though. . . GOOD: . . . I don't think of myself as a powerful woman. NOGUCHI: Good grew up in Ohio - the daughter of two educators. It was her math-teacher father who encouraged her, she says, to take an unconventional path for women. GOOD: He actually sat with me on the college catalog and helped me pick something that was the equivalent of computer science. I had never programmed anything. I had never seen a computer when I went to college. NOGUCHI: Good is used to being the lone woman. She was one of the first in the Midwest to make partner at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. GOOD: I've had plenty of mentors but not many women. So I am generationally probably on the early part of the ascent of women into leadership roles. NOGUCHI: Her two-decade career at Andersen came to an abrupt end after a criminal charge against the firm effectively shut it down in 2002. Good found her footing becoming Duke's finance chief in 2009. Then, 15 months ago, her predecessor left as part of a settlement with regulators over the company's handling of a merger. As CEO, she's surrounded by male peers. GOOD: It doesn't make me uncomfortable. I don't even think about it, to be honest with you. NOGUCHI: But, she says, she thinks women tend to focus on communication, relationships and connecting, and that that is an asset with the spotlight on her. GOOD: I become the face of the company. And that's a responsibility. NOGUCHI: Especially now as Good deals with her latest challenge - a toxic spill of pollutants that happened just months after she took office. A burst pipe dumped tens of thousands of tons of coal ash waste into the Dan River, a source of drinking water for over 50,000 people in southern Virginia. It's Good's toughest test yet. The company faces lawsuits and a federal grand jury investigation. (SOUNDBITE OF VARIOUS NEWS BROADCASTS)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Today, a federal grand jury convened to hear evidence. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Six weeks - that's how long it took federal prosecutors to convene a grand jury in the investigation. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Protesters say Duke Energy has been acting like babies with its coal ash clean-up. FRANK HOLLEMAN: I don't think Duke has ever had its reputation in North Carolina so damaged. NOGUCHI: Frank Holleman is a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is suing Duke Energy. Holleman says Duke is a major community force and says Good, who was relatively unknown to the public, could make a difference. HOLLEMAN: If she could get out in front of this issue - make a definitive, clear decision, she could create an identity for herself and for her company very quickly. NOGUCHI: But so far, he says, that hasn't happened. Last month, the company announced a $10 million fund that will be used to promote clean water across five states. Holleman calls the move both deeply underfunded and hypocritical. HOLLEMAN: Yeah, it was almost like physician heal thyself. It was an embarrassing public relations effort. NOGUCHI: For her part, Good denies she's prioritized image - hers or Duke's - over dealing with the damage. GOOD: My focus has been in ensuring Duke is doing the right thing, we have the right resources, we're making the adjustments, we're addressing the issue. NOGUCHI: Goods says her worst days on the job so far have come when she's felt Duke has been accused of wrongdoing. GOOD: I think about trust and confidence as something that you earn every day. And we will keep at it, earning it every day. And I hope that a year from now or two years from now, we're not talking at all about Dan River, but we're talking about the great service that Duke delivers to its customers and the commitment we have to the communities. NOGUCHI: That will be put to the test. Duke says it is cooperating with the ongoing federal grand jury investigation. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

She was waiting calmly after the fire alarms had gone off. It occurs to me later it was a fitting introduction to a woman whose corporate ascent has been marked by some emergency detours. LYNN GOOD: There's nothing about Lynn Good at age 30 or age 35 that would've said, I am setting my sights on being a CEO. NOGUCHI: But at age 55, she is - at Duke Energy, the nation's largest utility, based on market value. She's at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Conference to speak even though. . . GOOD: . . . I don't think of myself as a powerful woman. NOGUCHI: Good grew up in Ohio - the daughter of two educators. It was her math-teacher father who encouraged her, she says, to take an unconventional path for women. GOOD: He actually sat with me on the college catalog and helped me pick something that was the equivalent of computer science. I had never programmed anything. I had never seen a computer when I went to college. NOGUCHI: Good is used to being the lone woman. She was one of the first in the Midwest to make partner at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. GOOD: I've had plenty of mentors but not many women. So I am generationally probably on the early part of the ascent of women into leadership roles. NOGUCHI: Her two-decade career at Andersen came to an abrupt end after a criminal charge against the firm effectively shut it down in 2002. Good found her footing becoming Duke's finance chief in 2009. Then, 15 months ago, her predecessor left as part of a settlement with regulators over the company's handling of a merger. As CEO, she's surrounded by male peers. GOOD: It doesn't make me uncomfortable. I don't even think about it, to be honest with you. NOGUCHI: But, she says, she thinks women tend to focus on communication, relationships and connecting, and that that is an asset with the spotlight on her. GOOD: I become the face of the company. And that's a responsibility. NOGUCHI: Especially now as Good deals with her latest challenge - a toxic spill of pollutants that happened just months after she took office. A burst pipe dumped tens of thousands of tons of coal ash waste into the Dan River, a source of drinking water for over 50,000 people in southern Virginia. It's Good's toughest test yet. The company faces lawsuits and a federal grand jury investigation. (SOUNDBITE OF VARIOUS NEWS BROADCASTS) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Today, a federal grand jury convened to hear evidence. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Six weeks - that's how long it took federal prosecutors to convene a grand jury in the investigation. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Protesters say Duke Energy has been acting like babies with its coal ash clean-up. FRANK HOLLEMAN: I don't think Duke has ever had its reputation in North Carolina so damaged. NOGUCHI: Frank Holleman is a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is suing Duke Energy. Holleman says Duke is a major community force and says Good, who was relatively unknown to the public, could make a difference. HOLLEMAN: If she could get out in front of this issue - make a definitive, clear decision, she could create an identity for herself and for her company very quickly. NOGUCHI: But so far, he says, that hasn't happened. Last month, the company announced a $10 million fund that will be used to promote clean water across five states. Holleman calls the move both deeply underfunded and hypocritical. HOLLEMAN: Yeah, it was almost like physician heal thyself. It was an embarrassing public relations effort. NOGUCHI: For her part, Good denies she's prioritized image - hers or Duke's - over dealing with the damage. GOOD: My focus has been in ensuring Duke is doing the right thing, we have the right resources, we're making the adjustments, we're addressing the issue. NOGUCHI: Goods says her worst days on the job so far have come when she's felt Duke has been accused of wrongdoing. GOOD: I think about trust and confidence as something that you earn every day. And we will keep at it, earning it every day. And I hope that a year from now or two years from now, we're not talking at all about Dan River, but we're talking about the great service that Duke delivers to its customers and the commitment we have to the communities. NOGUCHI: That will be put to the test. Duke says it is cooperating with the ongoing federal grand jury investigation.

S. economy and some big news expected this week. The Federal Reserve is likely to announce an end to a policy known as quantitative easing. It's a policy the Fed launched six years ago, buying trillions of dollars in bonds and mortgages in an effort to revive our faltering economy. Let's turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. David, good to have you on again. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So quantitative easing, what is it? WESSEL: Well, at the end of 2008, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates to zero and realized that wasn't nearly enough to get the economy moving again, so it embarked on a huge monetary experiment. First it bought a few hundred billion dollars of mortgages to unfreeze the housing market. And then it turned to buying long-term government bonds, often called treasuries. Over the ensuing six years, it ended up printing money to buy more than three-and-a-half-trillion dollars of bonds and mortgages. That's huge; it's far more than anybody inside or outside the Fed expected when this all began in 2008. GREENE: OK, so the Fed's buying all of this stuff. How exactly is that supposed to help a troubled economy? WESSEL: Actually, there's some dispute about the experts about all this. Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, once said that quantitative easing works in practice but not in theory. Basically, the challenge to the Fed came when it cut the short-term rates to zero, the ones that are charged on overnight loans between banks. And then they tried something else, this quantitative easing. One school views it as a way to push down long-term interest rates - the ones that we pay for mortgages, for instance. And taking mortgages and treasury bonds out of investor hands was meant to push those people to put money into other things - stocks and corporate bonds - and that was supposed to help to get business going. Another school of thought said, that's not how it worked. It basically - by buying so many long-term bonds, the Fed was sending a very big signal that it was serious about keeping credit easy for a long, long time. Now, it probably worked through both channels, and it worked well enough that the European Central Bank is now considering something like what the Fed did. Fed officials and most, though not all, economists think QE did give the economy a boost when it needed it most, although there is some disagreement about how big that effect was. GREENE: I love that phrase from Bernanke - it works in practice but not in theory. But there are some economists who don't even think it works in practice, right? WESSEL: That's right. So one school says it doesn't work, doesn't do much good, or maybe it was OK, the first dollop of it in 2008-2009, and the rest of it was just wasted. Another view is that all this money sloshing around the economy is bound to create unwelcome inflation, although the fact that inflation is still running below the Fed's 2 percent target six years later has weakened this argument a lot. A third crew says, oh, it was fine while it lasted, but now that we're at the cusp of the exit - the Fed is going to announce on Wednesday that it's cutting this off - we're going to see that we got hooked on this, and withdrawal's going to be hard. And then a fourth argument is that this is creating a whole lot of pockets of financial excess or bubbles, and we're got to get right back to where we were before. There are a few instances of that already, and the Fed assures us that it's going to be more careful this time. GREENE: So why is this the moment when the Fed believes, you know, it's time to cut this off and to end it? WESSEL: Well, the Fed has been gradually reducing the size of its purchases over the last several months, and it hasn't seen much adverse effect on the economy or the markets, at least not yet. Some Fed officials - a minority - have been itching to curtail this for a long time 'cause they never liked the idea. But even though the economy's not fully back to health and there's still less inflation than the Fed would like, most officials basically think the economy's strong enough to be weaned off this medicine. Though they're still worried enough that they tell us they're going to keep these short-term interest rates near zero well into 2015. And there are a few who think the Fed is ending this prematurely. I particularly like the line from Julia Coronado. She's an economist at Graham Capital. She wrote what she called an epitaph to QE; here lies QE, hated by its attracters, misunderstood, taken for granted. It lived a turbulent life and died before fulfilling its mandate. GREENE: All right, David. Thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome. GREENE: David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution.

The state wants to knock the houses down. The empty land would act as a buffer to the ocean. Two years after Superstorm Sandy, Jim O'Grady, of member station WNYC, revisits a homeowner who already made his decision. O'GRADY: I first met Drimalas outside his house in the working-class neighborhood of Ocean Breeze, where he was talking to good Samaritans who'd shown up with a station wagon full of supplies. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Blanket - you need another blanket? STEPHEN DRIMALAS: No, I'm fine. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You, sure? DRIMALAS: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Toothbrush - anything like that? DRIMALAS: A brush I can use. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah, all right. O'GRADY: He lived in a bungalow not far from the beach and he barely escaped Sandy's floodwaters with his life. DRIMALAS: I had to speed out of here. Another minute or two and I wasn't getting out. O'GRADY: Really? DRIMALAS: Yeah, that's how fast it came in. O'GRADY: He'd been folding laundry before he fled. And when he came back the next day, there were the clothes on top of his bed, but his bed was floating in water. He slept in his car on cold nights - before the FEMA check showed up - because he couldn't afford a motel room. He fought with his insurance company and when that money finally came through, he rebuilt his severely damaged home. A year after Sandy, it sounded like he'd be staying. DRIMALAS: This was a freaky thing that happened. It was a super storm. It was a perfect storm. So I don't think we'll ever get another one again in my lifetime. O'GRADY: But a third of his neighbors never came back and when the city condemned and tore down several homes, his block started looking gap-toothed and forlorn, and he wondered what if I want to move? Who'd pay money for a house in a flood zone? And Drimalas was still spooked about the night the storm rushed in. DRIMALAS: You know what happened, a couple weeks ago, we had bad weather. And you hear the wind howling and everything like that. Then you start thinking uh oh, is the water coming again, you know? It goes through your mind now 'cause, you know, it's in your head. O'GRADY: Then New York State offered to buy his home as part of a program to get people out of dangerous areas that are likely to flood again. Drimalas thought it over and then took the deal. In the past two years, he cycled through all the emotions of the victim of disaster - grief, fear, anger, defiance - but now there's a new one - contentment. DRIMALAS: Everything's working out well. The state's giving me a nice price. I'm happy with it. O'GRADY: He won't say on tape how much he's been offered but it's enough to cover the mortgage on his 900-square-foot home and the mortgage on a condo he owns in Florida. About 500 of his Staten Island neighbors have joined Drimalas in the buyout pipeline. DRIMALAS: And little by little, they're moving out. You'll start seeing more and more U-Haul trucks here. People just want to go. O'GRADY: New York State will spend about $200 million to purchase land Ocean Breeze and two other Staten Island neighborhoods. That's about 550 acres of waterfront property in New York City that now face an extremely unusual fate - permanent abandonment. BARBARA BRANCACCIO: We are going to demolish the homes. Essentially, they go back to nature. O'GRADY: That's Barbara Brancaccio, the spokeswoman for Governor Andrew Cuomo's Office of Storm Recovery. BRANCACCIO: We didn't bring this possibility to the community. The community came to us and said we want to go. O'GRADY: A handful of people are planning to stay. But Brancaccio says a year from now, those holdouts can expect their neighbors to be rabbits, raccoons and wild turkeys. Drimalas says it's happening already. DRIMALAS: You know what I seen in my yard the other day? O'GRADY: What? DRIMALAS: A muskrat. O'GRADY: Drimalas is preparing to relocate to his Florida condo. It's two miles inland and 30 feet above sea level. So right now he's selling or giving away his stuff, including a really big barbecue grill. DRIMALAS: My family's going to come take whatever they want first, whatever they need. And then I'll just sell the rest. You interested in anything? (LAUGHTER)O'GRADY: For all he's been through, Drimalas is one of the lucky ones. Two of his neighbors, both in their 80s, drowned in Sandy's floodwaters. Drimalas may be saying goodbye to his home but he gets to start again. For NPR News, I'm Jim O'Grady.

S. was in recession in 2008. Back then, she was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Now in her role as Fed chair, Yellen has made waves with her recent speech about widening income inequality. We're going to talk now about how Janet Yellen may shape Fed policy going forward and for that, I'm joined by Neil Irwin. He's senior economic correspondent with The New York Times. Neil, thanks for coming in. NEIL IRWIN: Thanks for having me. BLOCK: And this was a lengthy speech that Janet Yellen gave in Boston this month, all about growing income inequality and an even more unequal distribution of wealth in this country. Let's listen to how she framed the issue. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)JANET YELLEN: I think it's appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them, the high-value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity. BLOCK: So when Janet Yellen is talking there about American values, what do you think this speech tells us about her economic view and how it might shape her time as Fed chair? IRWIN: Well, it tells us that she's very much concerned about how this recovery is affecting middle-class, lower income Americans. She's not - you know, like all economists, she's worried about what happens to GDP and the unemployment rate, but it's a sign that she's really particularly concerned about whether the benefits of this expansion really start to accrue to the middle class and poor people. And that talk about distribution is not normally what Fed chairmen do. BLOCK: Well, it's interesting because critics immediately accused her of being too political. Some called her a partisan hack. Is this really uncharted territory for a Fed chair to venture into? IRWIN: You know, it is. If you look at a speech that Ben Bernanke gave in 2007 on inequality when he was chairman, he laid out some of the theoretical evidence out there, but basically said this is a political question and not something it would be appropriate for me to weigh in on and really give a strong opinion on. It's clear Janet Yellen is more concerned about this set of issues. Part of that's her personally - her background - she is the first Democratic appointee to be Fed chair since 1987 when Paul Volcker retired, and this is part of her philosophy. This is how she thinks. BLOCK: Isn't there an argument, though, Neil, that Fed policy - the policy of quantitative easing, the policy of keeping interest rates near zero - actually serve to deepen income inequality? In other words, people with money - people who could invest - have done very well. People on fixed incomes haven't really benefited. IRWIN: Yeah, it's a tough thing. Part of what the Federal Reserve has been doing is buying bonds - pumping money into the financial system. And there's a lot of effects of that, but one of the most direct is to prop up asset values. And we've seen this enormous run-up in the stock market and other financial markets over the last five years, and Fed policy is a big part of the reason. Now, if you have a lot of assets - if you have a big stock portfolio, that's great news. If you don't have much in the way of assets - if you're like most Americans and you have maybe a retirement account but not a whole lot in savings, that doesn't directly benefit you. The question, though, for the Fed is so what you do, you know? Do you use the tool you have to try and make the economy grow or do you sit on your hands? And Janet Yellen and the Fed have been saying we're going to do what we can to try and help the economy grow. BLOCK: Would there be specific things you would imagine Janet Yellen might be proposing to help - in particular, help with unemployment? I mean, are there specific policies that the Fed could put into place that would have a direct impact on that? IRWIN: You know, the truth is the tools that the Federal Reserve has are pretty blunt instruments. They can't go in and send money to one state or one labor market or one industry. That's not what they're here for. So for now, Janet Yellen's talk about this is really symbolic and conveying concern rather than something about a policy choice. BLOCK: Does it indicate anything about where the Fed might be going moving forward? IRWIN: I don't think so. I think the path is becoming clear. The Fed, just today, they ended their quantitative easing program. They're done with bond buying for now, and they've signaled they're probably going to raise interest rates sometime next year. Now, the big choice for Janet Yellen is when should that day be? Should it be early next year? Should it be delayed even further to 2016 or beyond? And those are the choices that are going to be the defining choices of her early time as Federal Reserve chair. BLOCK: Janet Yellen was the number two at the Fed for a stretch of time to then chair Ben Bernanke, and you described her, at the time, as her own thinker - her own intellectual force, not Bernanke's emissary. How would you say she diverges from Bernanke, or for that matter, from Alan Greenspan before him, in terms of how she sees the Fed's role and her place within the Fed? IRWIN: It's funny, you know, analytically, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke agreed on a lot. She was a strong supporter of the quantitative easing programs that are really the signature of the Bernanke Fed and his era in charge. That said, they come at these things through slightly different philosophical frameworks. I mean, one piece of evidence - Ben Bernanke was appointed by a Republican, George Bush. Janet Yellen was appointed by a Democrat, Barack Obama. She served in the Clinton White House. He served in - Bernanke served in the Bush White House. They have different philosophical starting points, and they also have temperaments that have a lot of similarities but also some differences. And we're seeing Janet Yellen be willing to go out there and give that speech on inequality and say this is a concern for the U. S. economy and I'm going to use my bully pulpit to state my views on it. BLOCK: Neil Irwin, thanks again for coming in. IRWIN: Thank you. BLOCK: Neil Irwin is senior economic correspondent with The New York Times. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  The woman leading the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, was the first Fed official to acknowledge the U. S. was in recession in 2008. Back then, she was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Now in her role as Fed chair, Yellen has made waves with her recent speech about widening income inequality. We're going to talk now about how Janet Yellen may shape Fed policy going forward and for that, I'm joined by Neil Irwin. He's senior economic correspondent with The New York Times. Neil, thanks for coming in. NEIL IRWIN: Thanks for having me. BLOCK: And this was a lengthy speech that Janet Yellen gave in Boston this month, all about growing income inequality and an even more unequal distribution of wealth in this country. Let's listen to how she framed the issue. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) JANET YELLEN: I think it's appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our nation's history, among them, the high-value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity. BLOCK: So when Janet Yellen is talking there about American values, what do you think this speech tells us about her economic view and how it might shape her time as Fed chair? IRWIN: Well, it tells us that she's very much concerned about how this recovery is affecting middle-class, lower income Americans. She's not - you know, like all economists, she's worried about what happens to GDP and the unemployment rate, but it's a sign that she's really particularly concerned about whether the benefits of this expansion really start to accrue to the middle class and poor people. And that talk about distribution is not normally what Fed chairmen do. BLOCK: Well, it's interesting because critics immediately accused her of being too political. Some called her a partisan hack. Is this really uncharted territory for a Fed chair to venture into? IRWIN: You know, it is. If you look at a speech that Ben Bernanke gave in 2007 on inequality when he was chairman, he laid out some of the theoretical evidence out there, but basically said this is a political question and not something it would be appropriate for me to weigh in on and really give a strong opinion on. It's clear Janet Yellen is more concerned about this set of issues. Part of that's her personally - her background - she is the first Democratic appointee to be Fed chair since 1987 when Paul Volcker retired, and this is part of her philosophy. This is how she thinks. BLOCK: Isn't there an argument, though, Neil, that Fed policy - the policy of quantitative easing, the policy of keeping interest rates near zero - actually serve to deepen income inequality? In other words, people with money - people who could invest - have done very well. People on fixed incomes haven't really benefited. IRWIN: Yeah, it's a tough thing. Part of what the Federal Reserve has been doing is buying bonds - pumping money into the financial system. And there's a lot of effects of that, but one of the most direct is to prop up asset values. And we've seen this enormous run-up in the stock market and other financial markets over the last five years, and Fed policy is a big part of the reason. Now, if you have a lot of assets - if you have a big stock portfolio, that's great news. If you don't have much in the way of assets - if you're like most Americans and you have maybe a retirement account but not a whole lot in savings, that doesn't directly benefit you. The question, though, for the Fed is so what you do, you know? Do you use the tool you have to try and make the economy grow or do you sit on your hands? And Janet Yellen and the Fed have been saying we're going to do what we can to try and help the economy grow. BLOCK: Would there be specific things you would imagine Janet Yellen might be proposing to help - in particular, help with unemployment? I mean, are there specific policies that the Fed could put into place that would have a direct impact on that? IRWIN: You know, the truth is the tools that the Federal Reserve has are pretty blunt instruments. They can't go in and send money to one state or one labor market or one industry. That's not what they're here for. So for now, Janet Yellen's talk about this is really symbolic and conveying concern rather than something about a policy choice. BLOCK: Does it indicate anything about where the Fed might be going moving forward? IRWIN: I don't think so. I think the path is becoming clear.

QE3 - not a fancy ocean liner, but the Fed's giant bond-buying stimulus program known as Quantitative Easing. And that program has officially come to an end. Confirmation came in a statement today from the Fed. NPR's John Ydstie has been asking economists whether the 6-year, 2. 7-trillion-dollar program was a success or failure. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Quantitative Easing was a desperate move when the Fed launched it during the dire days of the financial crisis. The housing market was imploding, banks wouldn't lend money for mortgages and investors wouldn't buy mortgages. So the Fed stepped in and did what investors wouldn't. In its first round of QE, the Fed bought $500 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities. ALLAN MELTZER: It prevented a failure of a financial system, a run on banks, collapse of the payment system. YDSTIE: That's Allan Meltzer, a Fed scholar and professor at Carnegie Mellon University. That first round of QE was a success, he says. But in his view, the second and third were a mistake. That's partly because the goal broadened for the second and third rounds of QE. The Fed believed that by pumping money into the financial system through its massive bond-buying, it could lower long-term interest rates, boost lending by banks and in that way, stimulate the shaky economy. Former Fed vice-chairman Alan Blinder says the central bank did succeed in lowering long-term interest rates by 1 to 1-and-a-half percentage points. But he says its QE program failed to ignite lending. ALAN BLINDER: I'm certainly shocked and I imagine the Fed is shocked that here we are, late in 2014, very far after the trauma of the financial crisis, and banks are still not expanding lending very much. YDSTIE: To understand why it's shocking, you have to understand how the Fed pumps money into the financial system. Under QE, the Fed bought its trillions of dollars-worth of bonds mostly from banks and paid the banks by depositing the money in their accounts at the Federal Reserve. Banks were then free to lend the money, but Blinder says even as those trillions piled up, banks decided not to lend most of it. BLINDER: If you talk to bankers, they say there's no demand for loans. If you talk to small business people and people looking for mortgages, they say credit is tight and they can't get loans. To me, that's the deepest mystery of what's going on in the economy right now. YDSTIE: But Professor Meltzer, who's also a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says it's no mystery to him. He says banks didn't lend because the Obama administration created an unfriendly environment for business and investment. He says big fines against Wall Street banks dampened their desire to lend, and he says the massive overhaul of financial regulation after the crisis made it harder to make loans. MELTZER: The regulations may be useful, desirable, socially necessary, but putting them all on at once is discouraging to business investment. YDSTIE: Even after the QE bond buying ends this month, the trillions of dollars in reserves will be there for banks to lend. Meltzer fears that at some point, banks will put that money to work and supercharge growth, sparking inflation, or a recession if the Fed pulls the reserves back too quickly. Blinder thinks the Fed has the tools and the skill to manage the situation without serious repercussions. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Here's a sample of what $7 million sounds like.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: As an environmentalist and geologist, I am asking you to not be fooled by Measure P. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Speaking Spanish). CHRIS WRATHER: We're bombarded with no on Measure P messages, whether they be on the air or, you know, driving down the road. I mean, it's overwhelming. SIEGLER: Chris Wrather is with the group Yes on Measure P that's backing the initiative to ban fracking and other so-called high-intensity drilling processes. He raises horses and cattle in northern Santa Barbara County. This isn't the Santa Barbara of pristine beaches and fancy resorts you might be picturing. This part of the county is dotted with small ranches, vineyards and oil wells, about 1,100 of them. Wrather says Measure P is an insurance policy. WRATHER: You know, it will provide protection for the future, and that's really what we want. SIEGLER: See, there's talk that California's Monterey shale formation, which extends into his county, could be the next North Dakota. And Wrather is worried that fracking and other drilling technologies could contaminate the county's already drought-stressed water supply. His other worry is that his group is being outspent 23 to 1 in the campaign. WRATHER: I'm hoping it'll backfire because it really has the feel of trying to buy this election. JIM BYRNE: I'm sorry. That's just a political gain. SIEGLER: Jim Byrne is the spokesman for No on Measure P. BYRNE: If I owned a business, I would want to do anything in my possibility to save that business. SIEGLER: Byrne says Measure P could effectively shut down all new drilling operations in Santa Barbara County. There's no fracking currently going on in the county. The industry says it doesn't work given the geology. But a process called steam injection is widely used, and that would also be banned if the initiative passes. BYRNE: They go after methods that have been utilized safely, responsibly and under the most stringent regulations for the last 50 years. And they're calling it new and high-intensity. It's just a ruse. SIEGLER: In these post-Citizens United times, there's a lot more scrutiny on the role of money in politics. But there have actually been no spending limits on ballot measures since the 1980s. Rick Hasen is a UC Irvine law professor who also hosts a popular campaign finance blog. RICK HASEN: There's much more at stake in terms of financial interest of those who would engage in oil drilling in this area than the amount that's being spent on the election. SIEGLER: Hasen is not sure all the spending in Santa Barbara is part of an upward trend in ballot measure races nationally, but what is clear is that the stakes are high.

S. Federal Reserve. The central bank announced it would end its stimulus program after six years. And later in the week, the Fed's chair, Janet Yellen, gave a speech about diversity in the field of economics. She said the profession, which seems to be dominated by white men, would benefit from a wider variety of viewpoints and pointed to what she called a leaky pipeline that's prevented women and minorities from making it into the top ranks of academia. We're joined now in our studios by labor economist Julianne Malveaux. Dr. Malveaux, thanks very much for being with us. DR. JULIANNE MALVEAUX: It's absolutely a pleasure. Thank you, Scott. SIMON: What do you make of that leaky pipeline analogy? MALVEAUX: It's absolutely the case. When you look at the research from the past, white males were the norm. It was not until the '70s that folks like Janet Yellen and others introduced women into, essentially, the research - just the research. I think that some of my work and others began to introduce black women, but by and large you're talking a white male space. Janet talked about diversity of ideas as well as diversity in terms of input. And what we often see - the Fed has done a great job under Bernanke to talk about holding interest rates down for economic recovery, especially since Congress has not. But at the same time, what we see is almost an indifference to the plight of African-Americans and people who are lower-income. SIMON: Is that the job of the Federal Reserve though? MALVEAUX: Not necessarily. Well, I think the Fed, you know, they've got 300 PhD economists there. They've got an office of diversity and inclusion. I think here's their job - go out to some of the schools, graduate schools especially, and recruit. And let people know this is what you can do at the Fed. When I look at the Survey of Consumer Finance, for example, that reports on wealth - and the most recent one came out - 2013 came out early this year - they aggregate Africans-Americans and Hispanics or, basically, nonwhites, and the two groups have very different kinds of mobility. And I think that with an African-American economist were there, there might be something different. I worked for the Council of Economic Advisers in 1978, and I remember that there was a line on the unemployment data that said nonwhites. And with my lovely, diplomatic self, I went and said, well, you know, how come we can't disaggregate that? And they did. No one had ever said to them - I mean, I won't say no one, but I know that I fussed, and they said OK, we can disaggregate that. SIMON: No one had ever seen that as a problem from their perspective? MALVEAUX: Yes, and when you have, you know, different kinds of indicators, it is kind of a problem. So I think with the Fed, it's not their job to count. This is not an affirmative action thing, but I think what it is their job to do is to do outreach. SIMON: Earlier this month, Dr. Yellen talked about inequality in the country, saying it greatly concerned her. Should the chair of the Federal Reserve, the U. S. central bank, be issuing these periodic opinions? Does it in any way damage the working relationship she has to have with people of all political persuasions? MALVEAUX: I don't think so. When you look at Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, they probably - Bernanke did talk about inequality. Greenspan did not, but he had these projections that were all over the place. Every time he spoke before Congress, you could see the Dow move. So he had enormous influence on banking. So I don't think that Yellen's comments are out of order. I think the question becomes what kind of policy comes out of the comments. And she is not a dictator. She's got other people in the Fed, she's got to run things by them, but I think she's speaking to a concern. And it's a concern, Scott, that everybody in our nation ought to have. SIMON: Julianne Malveaux, labor economist and the former president of Bennett College for Women. Thanks so much. MALVEAUX: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  A busy week at the U. S. Federal Reserve. The central bank announced it would end its stimulus program after six years. And later in the week, the Fed's chair, Janet Yellen, gave a speech about diversity in the field of economics. She said the profession, which seems to be dominated by white men, would benefit from a wider variety of viewpoints and pointed to what she called a leaky pipeline that's prevented women and minorities from making it into the top ranks of academia. We're joined now in our studios by labor economist Julianne Malveaux. Dr. Malveaux, thanks very much for being with us. DR. JULIANNE MALVEAUX: It's absolutely a pleasure. Thank you, Scott. SIMON: What do you make of that leaky pipeline analogy? MALVEAUX: It's absolutely the case. When you look at the research from the past, white males were the norm. It was not until the '70s that folks like Janet Yellen and others introduced women into, essentially, the research - just the research. I think that some of my work and others began to introduce black women, but by and large you're talking a white male space. Janet talked about diversity of ideas as well as diversity in terms of input. And what we often see - the Fed has done a great job under Bernanke to talk about holding interest rates down for economic recovery, especially since Congress has not. But at the same time, what we see is almost an indifference to the plight of African-Americans and people who are lower-income. SIMON: Is that the job of the Federal Reserve though? MALVEAUX: Not necessarily. Well, I think the Fed, you know, they've got 300 PhD economists there. They've got an office of diversity and inclusion. I think here's their job - go out to some of the schools, graduate schools especially, and recruit. And let people know this is what you can do at the Fed. When I look at the Survey of Consumer Finance, for example, that reports on wealth - and the most recent one came out - 2013 came out early this year - they aggregate Africans-Americans and Hispanics or, basically, nonwhites, and the two groups have very different kinds of mobility. And I think that with an African-American economist were there, there might be something different. I worked for the Council of Economic Advisers in 1978, and I remember that there was a line on the unemployment data that said nonwhites. And with my lovely, diplomatic self, I went and said, well, you know, how come we can't disaggregate that? And they did. No one had ever said to them - I mean, I won't say no one, but I know that I fussed, and they said OK, we can disaggregate that. SIMON: No one had ever seen that as a problem from their perspective? MALVEAUX: Yes, and when you have, you know, different kinds of indicators, it is kind of a problem. So I think with the Fed, it's not their job to count. This is not an affirmative action thing, but I think what it is their job to do is to do outreach. SIMON: Earlier this month, Dr. Yellen talked about inequality in the country, saying it greatly concerned her. Should the chair of the Federal Reserve, the U. S. central bank, be issuing these periodic opinions? Does it in any way damage the working relationship she has to have with people of all political persuasions? MALVEAUX: I don't think so. When you look at Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, they probably - Bernanke did talk about inequality. Greenspan did not, but he had these projections that were all over the place. Every time he spoke before Congress, you could see the Dow move. So he had enormous influence on banking. So I don't think that Yellen's comments are out of order. I think the question becomes what kind of policy comes out of the comments. And she is not a dictator.

I'm Rachel Martin. And this is For The Record. Something big happened last week. It didn't happen with a lot of fanfare but it does say a lot about the health of the U. S. economy. In short, the economy is doing well enough that the U. S. government is going to stop propping it up. We're talking about one particular crutch called quantitative easing, or QE for short. This was a program that had the Federal Reserve buying billions of dollars' worth of this government bonds to stimulate the economy. Now it's over. (SOUNDBITE OF VARIOUS NEWSCASTS)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: In the last 24 hours it was all about the Federal Reserve and QE3 coming to an end. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So say goodbye to new normal easy money. We're returning to old normal easy money. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: That really emphasized the increases and improvements we have seen in the job market here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I actually think the Fed got it right. MARTIN: But this recovery is uneven, and some Americans still feel mired in the Great Recession. BETH MARFELL: My name is Beth Marfell (ph). I'm 24. I'm starting to see that it's going to be much more difficult than I was led to believe it would be, especially with just a Bachelor's degree in biology. JOHN DIAMANDA: My name is John DiAmanda (ph), and I work at McDonald's in Oakland, California. I ran a company called Real Clean Windows, and mostly I washed windows. KIM GRANT BROWN: My name is Kim Grant Brown. I have lived in Memphis since I was born, my whole life. I've built over 250 homes in the area. MARTIN: In 2008, each of them started to see signs that the economy was faltering. Here's John DiAmanda. DIAMANDA: That's the first thing you cut off when your shop's not selling as much, is you cut back on the janitorial work and the window cleaning. MARTIN: Kim Grant Brown says at first, it felt like any other downward turn in the economy. GRANT BROWN: You have your ups and downs in homebuilding. Homebuilding is very cyclical. So we thought it was just a dip. MARTIN: It wasn't. She got fewer and fewer orders for new homes. The bills started to pile up. GRANT BROWN: I know, personally, I paid to work for a couple years. MARTIN: When you say you paid to work, that means you didn't draw a salary for a couple years? GRANT BROWN: Absolutely not. No. MARTIN: How did you get by? GRANT BROWN: I've always been raised that you save in the good times so that you have money in the bad times. And I always paid my bills even though it was painful. MARTIN: Around the same time, Beth Marfell was choosing her major at Sweet Briar College in Virginia. She was drawn to the music school but she settled on science because she wanted something stable with a lot of career options. MARFELL: I thought that I would, you know, have a few months of unemployment, taking odd jobs just to pay my bills. And then I thought, oh, within a month to three months I'll be employed. I'll have a job in science. I'll be starting my career. And that's just not what's happened. MARTIN: A couple years into the recession, life was also getting a lot harder for John DiAmanda. His customer base was shrinking. So was his bank account. And when his car broke down, he couldn't get it fixed. DIAMANDA: I ended up doing all the window cleaning by bus. So eventually, I wasn't even making enough to pay the rent. And I ended up getting evicted by my landlord. MARTIN: So here we are in 2014. The economy is in recovery. How are these three Americans faring? Here is Kim Grant Brown of Memphis. GRANT BROWN: Now we're doing great. We have had really wonderful years the last three years, actually. Definitely we're growing. We're expanding. We're hiring new people. Homebuilding is such a huge driver to the economy. Every house built creates three new jobs. And so you figure, if we're down nationwide, I know we're down by over half of what we should be. If we could just get the homebuilding industry revved up and going again, the job growth would be exponential. MARTIN: But for John and Beth, everything feels far less certain. For the past four years, John has been working part-time at McDonald's. It's barely enough to cover his rent for a bedroom that he has to share. That is a huge disappointment. DIAMANDA: I thought my future was more or less, you know, secure. You know, I had hopes, real good hopes of having a good retirement and getting married and having kids. Now it's kind of up in the air. I don't know what's going to happen. I still have a dream but it seems like, on the wage that I'm getting right now, it doesn't seem likely that I'm able to do that unless something changes. MARTIN: And for the biology major Beth Marfell, she spent many months applying for lab research jobs. No luck. Too many people out there with Master's degrees competing for the same job, she tells me. Marfell is waiting tables and working as a part-time tour guide in Charlottesville. And even with $35,000 in student loans, she still hasn't given up on science. MARFELL: In my dreams, I have my own lab, I'm doing my own research, and I have little underlings helping me out because, you know, it's that mad scientist dream, right. MARTIN: But the life she's living now is not the one that she planned. MARFELL: The narrative I've been given my entire life is you go to college, you get good grades, you'll get a good job. And so I did all these things, sometimes when I really didn't want to. And it's just not worked out. MARTIN: We asked Kim, John, and Beth to tell us the one thing they've had to sacrifice in the recession that they'd like to get back. For Kim, it was dinners out with her family. For Beth, it was more specific. MARFELL: Well, I can't wait to have a paycheck that's steady enough for me to go out and get a burger and fries without worrying about my rent the next month. MARTIN: And John, when he lost his two-bedroom apartment, he had to downsize. He got rid of furniture, his suits, shoes, hundreds of books. DIAMANDA: You know, imagine if you had to get rid of everything you owned except what you carried in a shopping cart. MARTIN: Life has changed for John. He doesn't have his own business. But he is working. He has a safe place to sleep. It is a recovery of sorts. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. And this is For The Record.

And that's great for all of us who've been enjoying lower gas prices. The national average is below three dollars-a-gallon. But it's not good news for U. S. oil producers. They've become important players in the U. S. economy and in the global oil market. And for them falling oil prices are a threat. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The average price for crude oil produced in the U. S. fell below $76-a-barrel today before recovering a bit. And yesterday, Saudi Arabia cut prices for the crude it sells in the U. S. market. During most of the last quarter-century, that would've been viewed as a very positive development for the U. S. economy. Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, says it's kind of amazing we're now having a conversation about whether a drop in oil prices might be harmful. JASON BORDOFF: That is not a conversation we would've been having five or 10 years ago, and it just demonstrates how dramatically the U. S. oil production outlook has changed. YDSTIE: The nation's oil production has increased so rapidly during the past several years that the U. S. is now the world's largest oil producer. That's mainly due to the shale oil boom in North Dakota and Texas. The dramatic increase in drilling activity there has boosted U. S. job growth and the overall economy significantly. The 25 percent drop in oil prices since June has spawned conspiracy theories that Saudi Arabia and OPEC are driving prices down to force U. S. shale producers to stop drilling. OPEC's secretary-general said last week that with oil at around $80-a-barrel, half of all U. S. shale projects would become uneconomic. Jason Bordoff disagrees. BORDOFF: I think that probably overstates the case. We may see some slowdown in the growth rate of U. S. oil production, but I think U. S. production will continue to grow. YDSTIE: Bordoff thinks prices would have to drop below $70-a-barrel and stay there for six months or more to have a significant effect on U. S. production. DANIEL KATZENBERG: We don't expect to see, really, material slowdowns in activity yet. YDSTIE: That's Daniel Katzenberg, senior energy analyst at R. W. Baird and Co. Katzenberg does think if prices remain in the current range, around $75-a-barrel until January, oil companies could begin to cut back on drilling. However, even with some cutbacks, he expects U. S. oil production would continue to grow just a little bit slower. KATZENBERG: I don't believe that we are facing another bust at this point. YDSTIE: Up in the booming oil fields of the Bakken formation in North Dakota, Niles Hushka says there's little concern about current prices curbing drilling. NILES HUSHKA: The reason that no one's reacting is that it's pretty normal. YDSTIE: Since drilling began ramping up in the Bakken in 2007, oil has averaged only about $70-a-barrel says Hushka. He runs an engineering and oil services firm based in North Dakota. And Hushka says that cost of production continues to go down. That's because the infrastructure to support the drilling and transporting of oil is now in place and the technology of fracking oil shale continues to improve. HUSHKA: I think OPEC is sadly mistaken. I think that they, in order to discourage production, especially in the Bakken, you're going to be looking at prices down in the 40 range. YDSTIE: And Hushka says there's still a lot of room in the system to drive costs down. For instance, several pipelines on the drawing boards could reduce transportation expenses for Bakken crude by $7-a-barrel, making production there even more competitive.

They have dropped more than 25 percent since June. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And that's pretty good news if you're filling up at the gas pump. GREENE: Not so good news, though, for businesses who use some pretty controversial methods to produce oil. What they do is becoming less profitable, in some cases even unprofitable. Both crude from Canada's tar sands and oil from fracking here in the United States are relatively expensive processes that require oil prices to stay high. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Most of the world's oil sells for between $80 to $85 a barrel now, but not all oil is created equal. In the Middle East, it's cheaper to produce, less than $30 a barrel on average. In other parts of the world, companies pay a lot more to extract it, sometimes at a loss. PER MAGNUS NYSVEEN: The Arctic is a high-cost area, also oil sands. BRADY: At the Norwegian firm Rystad Energy, Per Magnus Nysveen is head of analysis. He says North American shale oil is on the expensive side. That's found in the middle of the country and needs fracking to force it out of the ground. On average, Nysveen says, this oil cost $62 a barrel. NYSVEEN: What is really interesting is for the U. S. drillers and producers is how long they are going to continue the high activity levels they have now that prices are going down. BRADY: Already, some companies are thinking about drilling fewer wells. (SOUNDBITE OF PUMP-JACK)BRADY: That's a large, tan pump-jack bobbing up and down next to a highway outside Midland, Texas. Fracking combined with horizontal drilling brought new life to the oil business here, but cheaper crude prices are forcing drillers like Steven Pruett of Elevation Resources to re-examine their plans. STEVEN PRUETT: We will drill fewer wells in a lower-price environment. BRADY: With less profit, there's less money to invest in future prospects. At current prices, oil will continue to flow, but not as much as if they went back up to $100. Pruett says this is not a crisis, though. PRUETT: We do not foresee a scenario where prices get so low that we can't cover the cash cost of lifting the barrels. So I don't think in this environment you will see a whole lot of oil and gas production shut in. BRADY: If prices collapsed to 2008 levels when it was $35 a barrel, drillers might be forced to take more drastic steps, like shutting down production, but few are predicting crude will fall that much. You might think a slowdown would be good news to environmental groups, but Jackie Savitz with Oceana says it's more complicated than that. JACKIE SAVITZ: You could make the argument either way. If oil is high, people will burn less; that's a good thing. If oil is low, maybe they'll drill less; that's a good thing. Really what we hope we'll do is we'll start making decisions based on the real science and the real impacts of burning fossil fuels. BRADY: Oceana is among groups calling for policies that speed up a transition to renewable forms of energy. While that could affect oil production, the market rules for now, and the lure of billions of dollars is hard for drillers to ignore. Even if drilling in the Arctic, for example, looks unprofitable for now, companies are committed to exploring there. Production costs tend to go down after new technologies have been around for a while, and Erik Milito with the American Petroleum Institute says global demand for oil continues to rise. ERIK MILITO: And that's the reason why companies are making these investments because they're long-term investments in projects that are expected to provide very large quantities of oil and natural gas for the U. S. economy and for the global account. BRADY: Still U. S. companies have to keep a close eye on their competitors abroad that can produce oil much more cheaply. That's why when OPEC meets later this month, a lot of people in the oil business will be watching to see if the cartel will push prices up or down. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

In the Middle East, it's cheaper to produce, less than $30 a barrel on average. In other parts of the world, companies pay a lot more to extract it, sometimes at a loss. PER MAGNUS NYSVEEN: The Arctic is a high-cost area, also oil sands. BRADY: At the Norwegian firm Rystad Energy, Per Magnus Nysveen is head of analysis. He says North American shale oil is on the expensive side. That's found in the middle of the country and needs fracking to force it out of the ground. On average, Nysveen says, this oil cost $62 a barrel. NYSVEEN: What is really interesting is for the U. S. drillers and producers is how long they are going to continue the high activity levels they have now that prices are going down. BRADY: Already, some companies are thinking about drilling fewer wells. (SOUNDBITE OF PUMP-JACK) BRADY: That's a large, tan pump-jack bobbing up and down next to a highway outside Midland, Texas. Fracking combined with horizontal drilling brought new life to the oil business here, but cheaper crude prices are forcing drillers like Steven Pruett of Elevation Resources to re-examine their plans. STEVEN PRUETT: We will drill fewer wells in a lower-price environment. BRADY: With less profit, there's less money to invest in future prospects. At current prices, oil will continue to flow, but not as much as if they went back up to $100. Pruett says this is not a crisis, though. PRUETT: We do not foresee a scenario where prices get so low that we can't cover the cash cost of lifting the barrels. So I don't think in this environment you will see a whole lot of oil and gas production shut in. BRADY: If prices collapsed to 2008 levels when it was $35 a barrel, drillers might be forced to take more drastic steps, like shutting down production, but few are predicting crude will fall that much. You might think a slowdown would be good news to environmental groups, but Jackie Savitz with Oceana says it's more complicated than that. JACKIE SAVITZ: You could make the argument either way. If oil is high, people will burn less; that's a good thing. If oil is low, maybe they'll drill less; that's a good thing. Really what we hope we'll do is we'll start making decisions based on the real science and the real impacts of burning fossil fuels. BRADY: Oceana is among groups calling for policies that speed up a transition to renewable forms of energy. While that could affect oil production, the market rules for now, and the lure of billions of dollars is hard for drillers to ignore. Even if drilling in the Arctic, for example, looks unprofitable for now, companies are committed to exploring there. Production costs tend to go down after new technologies have been around for a while, and Erik Milito with the American Petroleum Institute says global demand for oil continues to rise. ERIK MILITO: And that's the reason why companies are making these investments because they're long-term investments in projects that are expected to provide very large quantities of oil and natural gas for the U. S. economy and for the global account. BRADY: Still U. S. companies have to keep a close eye on their competitors abroad that can produce oil much more cheaply. That's why when OPEC meets later this month, a lot of people in the oil business will be watching to see if the cartel will push prices up or down.

They've done it through automation. They've done it by sending work overseas. The factory jobs that remain in this country require more skills, and it can be hard to fill some of those jobs. Many economists and policymakers believe they see a fix here, which could address the problem of wage stagnation. Their solution is apprenticeships, an old style of training for new, tough jobs. Apprenticeships combine on-the-job training with targeted schoolwork. As part of American Made, our look at the changing face in manufacturing, NPR's Uri Berliner visited one state, South Carolina, where apprenticeships are being tried. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: John Harris spent six years in the Air Force and dealt with his share of challenging situations, some of them in Afghanistan. But leaving the service last summer. . . JOHN HARRIS: I was terrified. BERLINER: He and his wife were moving to South Carolina. He had no job prospects. Civilian life was a giant unknown. HARRIS: I'm an adult. I'm disciplined. I have leadership skills. So I knew I had all these skills to offer, but I didn't know if anybody would want me. Everybody says they'll hire veterans, but that doesn't mean they can hire you if there's no jobs open. BERLINER: Turns out there was a place for Harris at Cooper Standard. The company makes sealing systems that keep wind and noise out of cars and trucks. Harris is an apprentice there, using his Air Force background as an electrician to learn a new occupation. HARRIS: Mechatronics. BERLINER: Mechatronics, it's a pretty new kind of job in manufacturing. Harris's boss, Warren Snead, explains. WARREN SNEAD: They know a little bit about programming. They can work with automation. They know the basics of wiring, hydraulics, pneumatics - so really a superman or superwoman who can do everything. BERLINER: Someone able to fix just about anything at a plant, the kind of job that can't be sent to a faraway country. Today Harris is installing sensors for an alarm system. Four nights a week, he's in a welding class. And he's feeling pretty good about the direction life has taken since leaving the Air Force. HARRIS: You know, you only have a short amount of time on this planet. You better make the best of it. And that's what I'm going to do. So, yes, I do feel confident that I'm going to make the best that I can for my family. BERLINER: It wasn't so long ago that someone like John Harris probably wouldn't have had an opportunity like this in South Carolina. Back in 2007 the state had a problem - a shortage of skilled workers and no good way to train young people for the workforce. BRAD NEESE: We were really squarely well positioned at the bottom. BERLINER: So the state started a program called Apprenticeship Carolina. Brad Neese is the director. He says from the beginning, they took it beyond the building trades - that's the traditional route for apprentices - to fields like nursing, pharmacy and IT. As the number of apprenticeship programs has fallen nationwide, it's taken off in South Carolina. NEESE: When we started this back in 2007, we only had 90 companies that had apprenticeship programs. So we've hit, you know, 670, which by the way we only had 777 apprentices in 2007. And we've now serviced nearly 11,000 apprentices. So it's been a phenomenal growth. BERLINER: So what's the secret sauce? A state tax credit for companies doesn't hurt. But it's pretty modest - $1,000 a year per apprentice for four years. A big factor is Germany. Companies like BMW and Bosch have plants in the state and brought with them the German system of apprenticeships. NEESE: I think that the German influence has been great, but we also have seen that it's just a process that makes sense. BERLINER: It makes sense for a company called United Tool and Mold because of demographics. I'm walking the factory floor with Jeromy Arnett. He's a manager here. The company repairs and re-engineers molds - molds that stamp out plastic parts for cars, trucks and refrigerators. Tell me why your company has an apprenticeship program. JEROMY ARNETT: Because every day your workforce gets older. We've been walking around here for 20 minutes, and our workforce here aged 20 minutes. We can't go back and get the time from the employees that are growing older. BERLINER: So the company followed the German system of starting apprentices off early - here in South Carolina, after their junior year in high school, combining class work with on-the-job training. ARNETT: We didn't go over and take verbatim what their model is, but a lot of how we set up our apprenticeship is based on that German model. BERLINER: Brandon Richards is a youth apprentice at the company who just started at the local technical college. In class, he studies computer-aided design. Today at work, he's polishing a part so it fits precisely in a mold. BRANDON RICHARDS: I get paid for my hours at work when I'm here. And I get paid while I'm in class. So I stay on the clock even at school. BERLINER: Graduates of the company's apprenticeship program make around $16 dollars an hour and can earn up to 24 as they get more experienced. Arnett says in this area, that's enough to live pretty well. ARNETT: These folks in here are making enough to where they can buy a house for their family. They put food on the table. They take that family vacation. They get the car that they want, and they take care of their kids. To me, that's middle class. BERLINER: An apprenticeship isn't a cure-all. Companies can make the wrong hires, squander their investment. Apprentices can wind up in a field they don't like and find it hard to switch. But everyone I spoke with, regardless of ideology or geography, from employers in red state South Carolina, to economists, to a Cabinet member in the Obama administration, they all say the same thing. The apprenticeship system is an economic plus. Here is Labor Secretary Thomas Perez. THOMAS PEREZ: Apprenticeships are a win-win. Apprenticeships are opportunities for young people to punch their ticket to the middle class and for employers to get that critical pipeline of skilled labor. BERLINER: Given all that, you'd think they would be commonplace - far from it. In 2003, there were about 489,000 registered apprentices in the U. S. . That's according to the Labor Department - last year only around 288,000. Chalk some of that up to the recession and companies investing less in training. But people involved in apprenticeships see something else going on - the belief that somehow it's a failure when a young person doesn't go from high school to a four-year college. ARNETT: It is a stigma that we're trying to get over, especially in our schools. BERLINER: Jeromy Arnett at United Tool and Mold. ARNETT: Just because they don't have a sheet of paper hanging on the wall said they went to school for four years doesn't mean that they're any less important to our country and the economy of our country than anyone else. BERLINER: Labor Secretary Perez says apprenticeship can be a sleeping giant for the U. S. economy, but some of the toughest converts are parents. PEREZ: When you talk to people in the manufacturing context and you say, hey, you know, your son or daughter should be an apprentice manufacturer, too many parents look at me and say, Tom, my kid's going to college. BERLINER: Perez says apprentices can always get four-year degrees while they work, and employers will often foot the bill. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

It's now 5. 8 percent, that news today from the Labor Department. The October jobs report also tells us that employers added 214,000 jobs to payrolls. But if you ask Americans about the economy, they are still mostly unimpressed. NPR's Sonari Glinton has more. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: That payroll number, in the story's introduction, and the unemployment rate - they are headline numbers, and they get headlines. But if you add in other numbers, you can get a fuller picture of the labor market. We have some economists to help us out. First underlying number - wages. First economist - Linda Barrington from Cornell University. She says wages have been inching up, barely. LINDA BARRINGTON: Wages and inflation are, sort of, going hand-in-hand, and have been since the recession, so people aren't feeling like they're getting ahead, even if they have a job. GLINTON: Part of the reason that wages aren't going up, is that there are just so many under-employed people. And, as long as there are large numbers of applicants for each available job, employers won't feel the pressure to boost wages. Our next number - the long-term unemployment rate - Barrington says, it's still high. BARRINGTON: You know, when you see the long-term unemployment numbers, those are people who have not given up, who continue to look for work, who want to work. But, for some reason, an employer isn't seeing what they're bringing as valuable enough to hire them. GLINTON: Those are the people that are hanging in there. Then, there are the people who have just given up. They aren't even a part of the job's picture. That's the next idea, the participation rate. JULI NIEMANN: There you go. Mmhm. Job participation rate - that's another problem. GLINTON: Juli Niemann is with Smith Moore and Company in St. Louis. NIEMANN: And a lot of people are giving up. They're not even in the numbers. They're not in the count. They've been looking for jobs for so long, and can't find the jobs, that they're simply not even trying anymore. And that is why you see this number, below 6%, looking better than it really is. GLINTON: Niemann says there have also been structural changes in the economy, especially in manufacturing. Many people have been replaced by technology, and we're lot more productive. NIEMANN: We do more, better for less. So they can't go back to jobs similar to what they had previously, nor can they find them out there. GLINTON: Another number that we need to look at that gets at why people aren't feeling so great about the economy, despite the solid job growth, is what's called the quit-rate. Which is, essentially, the rate at which people are quitting their jobs. The quit-rate is still relatively low, and our next economist, Tara Sinclair, with the jobs website, Indeed, says, we actually want more people quitting their jobs. TARA SINCLAIR: The reason it's a good thing for people to be quitting their job, is because that suggests that they're optimistic about their labor market choices. GLINTON: And then there's the number of people who have part-time jobs, but would really rather be working full-time. SINCLAIR: That number is still very elevated, which suggests that, even though the employment numbers look pretty good, if people aren't getting the type of job that they want, there's still room for improvement. GLINTON: Before we finish up, let me restate that all the economists considered that headline-number good news. Beth Anne Bovino is chief economist at Standard & Poor's. She says, we sometimes forget that, back in the recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, and it took a long time to get them back. BETH ANNE BOVINO: I mean, I know we still got further to go and - but I'd love to open that bottle of champagne. But I don't want to do it too quick. But, I have to say, every time I see 200,000 plus job gains, I feel like we're making one step ahead. GLINTON: When these underlying numbers get significantly better, that's when people will finally start to feel better about the economy. Sonari Glinton, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since July 2008. It's now 5. 8 percent, that news today from the Labor Department. The October jobs report also tells us that employers added 214,000 jobs to payrolls. But if you ask Americans about the economy, they are still mostly unimpressed. NPR's Sonari Glinton has more. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: That payroll number, in the story's introduction, and the unemployment rate - they are headline numbers, and they get headlines. But if you add in other numbers, you can get a fuller picture of the labor market. We have some economists to help us out. First underlying number - wages. First economist - Linda Barrington from Cornell University. She says wages have been inching up, barely. LINDA BARRINGTON: Wages and inflation are, sort of, going hand-in-hand, and have been since the recession, so people aren't feeling like they're getting ahead, even if they have a job. GLINTON: Part of the reason that wages aren't going up, is that there are just so many under-employed people. And, as long as there are large numbers of applicants for each available job, employers won't feel the pressure to boost wages. Our next number - the long-term unemployment rate - Barrington says, it's still high. BARRINGTON: You know, when you see the long-term unemployment numbers, those are people who have not given up, who continue to look for work, who want to work. But, for some reason, an employer isn't seeing what they're bringing as valuable enough to hire them. GLINTON: Those are the people that are hanging in there. Then, there are the people who have just given up. They aren't even a part of the job's picture. That's the next idea, the participation rate. JULI NIEMANN: There you go. Mmhm. Job participation rate - that's another problem. GLINTON: Juli Niemann is with Smith Moore and Company in St. Louis. NIEMANN: And a lot of people are giving up. They're not even in the numbers. They're not in the count. They've been looking for jobs for so long, and can't find the jobs, that they're simply not even trying anymore. And that is why you see this number, below 6%, looking better than it really is. GLINTON: Niemann says there have also been structural changes in the economy, especially in manufacturing. Many people have been replaced by technology, and we're lot more productive. NIEMANN: We do more, better for less. So they can't go back to jobs similar to what they had previously, nor can they find them out there. GLINTON: Another number that we need to look at that gets at why people aren't feeling so great about the economy, despite the solid job growth, is what's called the quit-rate. Which is, essentially, the rate at which people are quitting their jobs. The quit-rate is still relatively low, and our next economist, Tara Sinclair, with the jobs website, Indeed, says, we actually want more people quitting their jobs. TARA SINCLAIR: The reason it's a good thing for people to be quitting their job, is because that suggests that they're optimistic about their labor market choices. GLINTON: And then there's the number of people who have part-time jobs, but would really rather be working full-time. SINCLAIR: That number is still very elevated, which suggests that, even though the employment numbers look pretty good, if people aren't getting the type of job that they want, there's still room for improvement.

Yet on the day after the election, the president was able to paint a sunny picture. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This country's made real progress since the crisis six years ago. The fact is more Americans are working. Unemployment has come down. More Americans have health insurance. Manufacturing has grown. MONTAGNE: By the numbers, the president was correct. This morning's federal jobs report showed unemployment is the lowest in years - 5. 8 percent. NPR's John Ydstie reports, though, that there is some disappointment - wages continue to be sluggish. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Job creation for October, which was 214,000, was slightly below expectations. But an upward revision during the previous month kept the job growth close to the average of 220,000 for the previous 12 months. That turns out to be the strongest stretch of job creation since before the Great Recession. The strong showing is good news for people looking for jobs. And lots of people streamed into the labor force in October, suggesting many workers now think they have a better chance of getting a job. But John Canally, an economist and senior vice president at LPL financial, says it's disappointing that the solid job growth is not being accompanied by solid wage growth. JOHN CANALLY: You are starting to see scattered wage increases in certain areas of the country and in certain skilled positions, but largely across the country you're still seeing downward pressure on wages. YDSTIE: Wages grew just a tenth of a percent last month. And over the past year, they've grown just 2 percent. That's half the normal pace of wage increases and just barely keeping up with inflation. Canally says that's affecting the mood and spending power of consumers and restraining growth. CANALLY: It's a great explanation as to why consumer spending in this business cycle so far - you know, we're five-and-a-half years in - why it's been about half of what it is normally. YDSTIE: That's meant the economy has grown more slowly than usual during this recovery. And the job market has taken longer to heal as well. Canally says the recent solid job growth numbers and the big fall in the unemployment rate, from 10 percent at its Recession peak to 5. 8 percent now, are masking remaining problems in the labor market. CANALLY: Things like the mix between full-time and part-time is still too skewed towards part-time employment. The median duration of unemployment is way too long, still. But I think that key stat would be the average hourly earnings. YDSTIE: Canally says that's the most important measure for the Federal Reserve as it considers when it will be safe to take away the super-low interest rates that are supporting the economy now.

The average price has fallen below $3 a gallon. But in oil producing states like North Dakota and Wyoming, that celebration is muted. If prices stay low, it means fewer jobs and less revenue for governments. But as Wyoming Public Radio's Stephanie Joyce reports, while there's concern, there's no panic yet. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)STEPHANIE JOYCE: It's lunchtime in Douglas, Wyoming, a town smack in the middle of the state's booming oil patch, and the line of cars at the McDonald's drive-through wraps around the building. A hiring poster hangs in the window, and the parking lot is full. Troy Hilbish says while he didn't know oil prices have been falling, he does know what falling oil prices mean. TROY HILBISH: If the oil prices go up, we drill more. If they go down, we don't drill as much. JOYCE: Hilbish is a toolhand for the oilfield servicing company Schlumberger. And he's seen prices tank before. HILBISH: I ended up picking up a second job and working on a drilling rig, which was pretty tough. I got two hours of sleep for three days out of the week. JOYCE: And Hilbish fared better than some of his colleagues who simply got laid off. But that's not happening in oil country yet. Oil prices have fallen by more than a quarter since June, and most analysts expect they'll stay low for a while. That poses a problem for shale oil, which has fueled the U. S. oil boom in recent years. Because it's more expensive to drill for than conventional oil, prices have to stay relatively high for it to be profitable. JIM WILLOX: Nobody around here is in a panic mode, by any means. JOYCE: That's Jim Willox, commissioner for Converse County, which includes Douglas. Like his counterparts in Texas and North Dakota, Willox says so far, lower prices haven't led to a discernible slowdown. WILLOX: Right now, I think there's 18 rigs in Converse County that are exploring. That's one of the highest numbers we've had. We've sat at 10 to 12 to 13 for quite a while. Suddenly, we've got 18. JOYCE: Willox says most people here are still talking about how much more drilling there's going to be, not whether it's going to slow down. But he acknowledges that historically, energy booms do go bust. WILLOX: Nobody knows where we are on the curve. You know, are we still on upward curve? Have we peaked? Are we plateaued? Nobody really knows. NILES HUSHKA: I think what we're seeing right now is an industry that can't quite figure out what's happening. JOYCE: That's Niles Hushka, a consultant who recently studied the break-even price for oil drilling county-by-county in North Dakota. That's when companies start losing money. There's a huge break-even range because of geology and infrastructure among other things. And Hushka's analysis shows at current prices, it's already unprofitable to drill new wells in some places, but not everywhere. HUSHKA: The industry doesn't want to overreact, because this is an industry that's used to boom-bust cycles. So in an industry that's used to boom-bust cycles, you have to be careful to make sure that the cycle is a true cycle, and that you're not seeing false statistics and so you might make some decisions that will hurt youJOYCE: And it's not just companies scrambling to figure out what's going on. North Dakota gets half its revenue from oil. It had been counting on oil prices staying around $90 a barrel for the next few years. But last week, the state's revenue-estimating group reduced that figure by as much as $18 a barrel. That might not seem like a lot, but over hundreds of millions of barrels, it quickly adds up. Other oil-dependent states are in similar situations. Dan Noble heads up Wyoming's Department of Revenue. DAN NOBLE: It's a heck of a lot less damaging to the state's budget if we miss it on the low side than if we miss it on the high sideJOYCE: Right now, Wyoming is projecting $85 a barrel. Noble says if prices go lower, the state will need to revise that figure. But he's also hoping that just as shale producers have wildly exceeded everyone's expectations over the past couple of years, they'll continue that trend. NOBLE: When they produce more, even though it may be at a lower price, you have another opportunity to actually reach your financial goal. JOYCE: That might be optimistic though. Most experts agree that while well-developed oil fields like the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas can probably withstand lower prices, areas like Wyoming, where drilling is still in its early days, will likely feel the pinch. But Commissioner Jim Willox says that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. WILLOX: If we develop it at a slower pace, that's OK, because we can deal with it better. JOYCE: But for workers like Troy Hilbish, a slower pace also means fewer jobs. He's based out of California, but wants to move to Wyoming. HILBISH: I have six kids and wife. I think family life up here would be better. JOYCE: But he might want to wait a few months and keep an eye on the price of a barrel of oil before making that decision.

SCHAPER: After a few very slow years during the recession, Sanchez says, business is really picking up. SANCHEZ: We are seeing a lot of families wanting to take trips and planning their trips. So we do see more people wanting to travel now. Is it back to where was before? Not yet. But I think it's getting there. SCHAPER: But that means planes are packed tight. And because demand is rising, fares are up, especially over the two weeks when schools are out over the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Thanksgiving weekend fares are higher than last year, too, especially if you want to fly on the Wednesday before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The airline industry is expecting 24. 6 million passengers on planes around Thanksgiving, up one-and-a-half percent over last year. And a whopping 2. 6 million of those will fly on that Sunday. JOHN HEIMLICH: Sunday is not only expected to be the busiest day of the period, but if last year's an indication, that should be the busiest day of the entire calendar year. SCHAPER: That's John Heimlich, chief economist for the industry group Airlines for America. In a conference call with reporters this past week, he noted that dropping fuel prices are pushing up profits, with airlines earning more than $2 billion more so far this year than at this time last year. But he says, that doesn't mean we can expect airfares to drop anytime soon. HEIMLICH: The first priority is to make sure you have strong financial health, can pay down your bills and invest in the future and weather the next recession. SCHAPER: Back at Mena Travel, Giselle Sanchez is looking to find a bargain around Christmas. SANCHEZ: You see all these zeros? When you see zeros in all inventory, that means it's a pretty full flight. SCHAPER: The few seats that are available are too pricey. But Sanchez says, she can still find some low fares. . . SANCHEZ: If you're going to South Florida. . . SCHAPER: . . . Even around Thanksgiving, if you fly on certain days. SANCHEZ: Still be back to work on Tuesday if it's a really early morning flight. Actually, a nonstop I can get you for about $336. SCHAPER: That's tempting. I might ask my editor for a couple of days off. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

So we do see more people wanting to travel now. Is it back to where was before? Not yet. But I think it's getting there. SCHAPER: But that means planes are packed tight. And because demand is rising, fares are up, especially over the two weeks when schools are out over the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Thanksgiving weekend fares are higher than last year, too, especially if you want to fly on the Wednesday before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The airline industry is expecting 24. 6 million passengers on planes around Thanksgiving, up one-and-a-half percent over last year. And a whopping 2. 6 million of those will fly on that Sunday. JOHN HEIMLICH: Sunday is not only expected to be the busiest day of the period, but if last year's an indication, that should be the busiest day of the entire calendar year. SCHAPER: That's John Heimlich, chief economist for the industry group Airlines for America. In a conference call with reporters this past week, he noted that dropping fuel prices are pushing up profits, with airlines earning more than $2 billion more so far this year than at this time last year. But he says, that doesn't mean we can expect airfares to drop anytime soon. HEIMLICH: The first priority is to make sure you have strong financial health, can pay down your bills and invest in the future and weather the next recession. SCHAPER: Back at Mena Travel, Giselle Sanchez is looking to find a bargain around Christmas. SANCHEZ: You see all these zeros? When you see zeros in all inventory, that means it's a pretty full flight. SCHAPER: The few seats that are available are too pricey. But Sanchez says, she can still find some low fares. . . SANCHEZ: If you're going to South Florida. . . SCHAPER: . . . Even around Thanksgiving, if you fly on certain days. SANCHEZ: Still be back to work on Tuesday if it's a really early morning flight. Actually, a nonstop I can get you for about $336. SCHAPER: That's tempting. I might ask my editor for a couple of days off.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie says the first order of business is to stop the bleeding. And he released today what amounts to a turnaround plan for Atlantic City. In the first of two reports, NPR's Yuki Noguchi tells us about the scramble that's already underway to revive the city's prospects. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: For a city with lots of closed shops and casinos, there's also a fair amount of new construction. Across from the shuttered Trump Plaza, Atlantic City Mayor Donald Guardian proudly shows off what will be a Bass Pro outdoor goods store occupying a whole city block. MAYOR DONALD GUARDIAN: It'll open up in the springtime. NOGUCHI: The state's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority chipped in land and $12 million for the project. GUARDIAN: It's going to employ 290 people. So that's real good for the city as well. NOGUCHI: In trying to recast itself, Atlantic City must partially wean itself from its biggest industry. Gaming lifted the city out of disrepair four decades ago. But over the years, Guardian says, the city became too dependent on it. GUARDIAN: And the city was happy because it provided decent paying jobs with benefits. And it paid the taxes, but we lost everything else. You lose your whole entrepreneurial spirit. NOGUCHI: Guardian and redevelopers want to do what Las Vegas did two decades ago at smaller scale - branch out into more entertainment and conference and event hosting. RICK MAZER: You're looking at the steel structure. There was 9 million pounds of steel that is used in this. NOGUCHI: Rick Mazer gazes at what will be the Waterfront Conference Center, built with substantial backing from the Casino Reinvestment Authority and Caesars Entertainment. Mazer is regional president of Caesar's. Inside the adjacent casino and hotel, a food industry and teachers convention are taking place. That's perfect, Mazer says, because meetings fill in weekdays and off-season months when summer gaming season falls off. MAZER: This is the business that I think it will evolve and re-grow Atlantic City. NOGUCHI: But some are skeptical about the potential payoff from new construction. On the city's famous boardwalk in front of the darkened Trump Plaza, I meet Oliver Cooke, an economist at nearby Stockton College. Cooke says city officials have an uphill battle. OLIVER COOKE: You simply are not going to consume your way out of the morass that you're- that you're in. Doing things like building more retail, building more convention centers, has a very, very limited upside. NOGUCHI: Early this year, The Atlantic Club and the Showboat casinos closed. The $2. 4 billion Revel opened and closed within ten months - then, Trump Plaza. And next month, the Trump Taj Mahal could close as its parent company negotiates with creditors through bankruptcy. The city's gaming revenue is half the $5 billion it was at its peak eight years ago. Competition is fierce. According to the American Gaming Association, there are now 1,400 casinos in the country, a hundred of them on the East Coast. There is talk of reselling, reopening and repurposing some casinos. This week, Cooke's employer, Stockton College, announced it intends to buy the old Showboat property. The Revel's new owners are reportedly planning to reinvest and reopen. Meanwhile, the casinos that remain are doubling down. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We cite a figure from the American Gaming Association that there are 1,400 casinos in the U. S. , including 100 on the East Coast. Those figures included card rooms, which are not considered casino operations. The number of U.

Indeed, Resorts is Atlantic City's first casino and had its own brush with death four years ago. MARK GIANNANTONIO: Everybody around would have bet that this would have been the first place to close. NOGUCHI: But it didn't. Mark Giannantonio is Resorts CEO. He says instead, a new owner, backed again by the State Development Authority, invested in a Margaritaville restaurant and gaming wing. And now Resorts is turning a profit. In addition to commercial projects, Mayor Don Guardian hopes state grants will attract new residents who want to invest and rebuild the city one rundown home at a time. GUARDIAN: Then we've got to work on our school system. But I've got to fix the city first, find jobs, get taxes, reduce cost to government, make the place pretty. And then, we'll work on the schools. I liked the challenge. NOGUCHI: He's going to need that optimism. The challenge gets tougher with every casino closure. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News.

Now, another 3,000 casino workers could soon lose their jobs. Trump Taj Mahal is set to close next month unless the casino's bankrupt parent company strikes a last-minute deal with its billionaire creditor, Carl Ichan. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports on the difficult prospects for casino workers in a city with a shrinking economy. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Valerie McMorris has served drinks at the Taj Mahal since it opened 24 years ago. Casinos have sustained McMorris most of her life. Both her parents worked in gaming. VALERIE MCMORRIS: When I was a kid growing up, they both worked in the casino. So, it just allowed so many people a middle class status. NOGUCHI: She says that's changing. Her pay and benefits have been cut. Her husband lost his job at the Rebel - a gleaming 2. 4 billion dollar casino that went bust. Four of the city's dozen casinos have closed so far this year, eliminating nearly a 10th of Atlantic City's jobs. McMorris says neighbors and friends are moving elsewhere. She'd like to apply for teaching jobs. MCMORRIS: But even teaching jobs in this area - they're hard to find because a lot of people cannot afford to live here anymore. So they're moving out of New Jersey. NOGUCHI: I am interviewing McMorris at Burger, a restaurant in the Taj Mahal that now only opens when there are enough customers. These days, about once a week. As the city loses gaming clientele to neighboring states, state and local officials are scrambling to try to bring jobs back by building retail and a new conference center and repurposing casinos. Stockton College economist, Oliver Cooke, says the city should focus more on growing companies outside hospitality. OLIVER COOKE: And, at the end of the day, I mean, the whole point is to somehow, kind of, move your city or your metropolitan economy, kind of, up the value chain. What you hope, of course, to foster is kind of high-wage-led development as opposed to traditionally low wage growth. NOGUCHI: John Palmieri is executive director of the state's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. He says the city is trying to do just that. JOHN PALMIERI: We are fully attuned to the fact that we need to replace the jobs lost with new jobs. But that won't happen overnight. NOGUCHI: Palmieri wants to attract higher-paying jobs - meds and eds, as they say - people who work in hospitals and education. He says the Aerospace Research park near the city's airport could expand as a tech center. But he acknowledges, with a low percentage of college graduates, the local workforce isn't quite ready. PALMIERI: We have certain distress factors that we deal with. It's a poor population. Education's an issue. NOGUCHI: So is urban blight. Layoffs and closures have left their mark around the city. I'm walking along one of the busier streets in Atlantic City. Here's a closed Vietnamese restaurant next to a tattoo parlor and a steakhouse, all boarded up. Paul Smith says as buildings fall into disrepair, the quality of jobs is also eroding. Smith, whose colleagues call him Smitty, is a veteran cook at the Taj Mahal and single father who raised two boys in Atlantic City. Like many others, his main worry is losing healthcare coverage. PAUL SMITH: I need another surgery. Without the benefits, I can't have it. NOGUCHI: Last month, the bankruptcy judge approved cuts to work hours and health and pension benefits for Taj Mahal workers. The workers union, Unite Here Local 54, is appealing the cuts. Smith, other workers and their union president all told me, they're fighting to maintain a standard. They worry that any concessions on benefits in a down market like this one, would become permanent and applied across what remains of the city's casino industry. Paul Smith. SMITH: If we do give up our benefits - I mean, I'm not willing to sacrifice the standard for the rest of Atlantic City to change. I would rather this building close.

In a recent column for Bloomberg View, Megan McArdle suggests that the biggest concern of voters may not be getting a job, but having to stay in a dead-end, low-wage job in a stagnating economy, and watch their dreams of opportunity disappear. Megan McArdle joins us now from the studios of WBEZ in Chicago. Thanks so much for being with us. MEGAN MCARDLE: Thanks for having me. SIMON: So what do you see in election results that maybe more conventional analysis might have missed? MCARDLE: Well, one of the biggest mysteries about this election has been the fact that voters voted in Republicans in states where they also voted in voter initiatives to raise the minimum wage. And that seems little strange because Republicans are the party that opposes raising the minimum wage. Democrats are the party that support raising it. So why would that happen? And I think if what you look at is, you know, we're seeing unemployment fall. What we're not seeing is wage growth and I think that that is a big concern of voters. But I think that the larger concern - why aren't they acting on that across-the-board, looking to Democrats to do more on living wages and that sort of thing - is that people aren't as concerned about wages as they are about employment security and opportunity. And things like the minimum wage - well, they do speak to a certain level of anxiety of people who are, say, working at McDonald's because the manufacturing jobs they might have taken 30 years ago aren't around. It still doesn't speak to the broader problem of there's really no future in doing this. It's shift work. I get switched around a lot. It's not secure. And it doesn't have anywhere for me to grow into. SIMON: Well, let me ask you what amounts to a \"Moneyball\" question - will explain, you know, the revolution in baseball where people realized they might be measuring a player's performance with the wrong stats. So do reporters and pundits use some of the wrong stats to measure successful economic policies these days? MCARDLE: Well, I think you've got a big problem, which is that there's a difference between what you can measure and what you want to know (laughter). And sometimes they're the same thing, right? I want to know what my salary is. There's a nice, hard number attached to it and so forth. On the other hand, there's not really a hard number for how satisfied am I in my job? How much advancement does it offer? Those things are really intangible and they're also really important. And I think that the big data revolution is wonderful, but we should always remember that there is a lot of information between the data that we don't yet know how to put a number on and that that information's important too. And I think that that happens with the economy as we tend to fixate on a few headline numbers because we have them, not because they're necessarily the only important thing. SIMON: So telling someone don't you realize unemployment's under 6 percent now, what an achievement, isn't necessarily comfort to someone who either needs a job or is stuck in one. MCARDLE: There is a real issue where people feel like there used to be this ladder kind of up the economic opportunity scale and that a lot of the rungs seem to have fallen out of that ladder. And telling people that they're lucky to have a job isn't really a satisfying answer for them. SIMON: Do you see the election results and say people clearly want this or that or just that voters don't want whoever's in there now? MCARDLE: I think we've entered a period of throw the bums out politics. And I think that there are a couple of reasons for that. The first is that the economy has been struggling for a while, and I think that, especially for the middle, that to some extent the rise in housing prices masked that, but it has been going on for a while and has been going on under both Democrats and Republicans. The second thing is that when the bums get thrown out, they tend to over interpret that as a mandate to do the things that their, you know, the ideological base of their party has always dreamed of doing. And the problem with that is that the voters you've added to your coalition, the ones who pushed you across the finish line in the election, that's not what they want. What they want is for someone to come along and settle these very basic pocketbook issues that they are worried about. And frankly, the worse economy is, the less they worry about ideology and the more they worry about those, just, basic pocketbook issues. I don't care how you do it. Fix my problem. And so those two things together, I think, have combined to a situation where we just keep flipping the White House, flipping Congress, not that much gets done because both parties are convinced that they have this kind of natural mandate from their base and neither party is answering what voters really want to hear, which is how are things going to get better for me right now? SIMON: Megan McArdle, who is a columnist of Bloomberg View. Thanks so much for being with us. MCARDLE: Thank you.

And the problem with that is that the voters you've added to your coalition, the ones who pushed you across the finish line in the election, that's not what they want. What they want is for someone to come along and settle these very basic pocketbook issues that they are worried about. And frankly, the worse economy is, the less they worry about ideology and the more they worry about those, just, basic pocketbook issues. I don't care how you do it. Fix my problem. And so those two things together, I think, have combined to a situation where we just keep flipping the White House, flipping Congress, not that much gets done because both parties are convinced that they have this kind of natural mandate from their base and neither party is answering what voters really want to hear, which is how are things going to get better for me right now?

Landrieu, who's fighting for her political life these days, has pushed for a vote to approve Keystone. And tomorrow in the Senate, that vote is scheduled. The House passed the same legislation last week, so after years of debate over this pipeline, the president could soon have a chance to sign off on it or to veto it. Two of our correspondents who have been following this story are with us now - White House correspondent Scott Horsley and energy correspondent Jeff Brady. Hi to both of you. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good afternoon. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Hello. SIEGEL: And Jeff, let's begin by stepping back. Would you remind us what the Keystone XL pipeline is and what it's intended to carry that's so important to so many people? BRADY: Well, it would move oil from Alberta up in Canada all the way down to the Gulf Coast. There are a lot of refineries there that can handle that oil. It would haul about 830,000 barrels a day, and of course, oil is very important for our economy. And this is oil that if it weren't coming from Canada, would likely come from someplace like Venezuela or the Middle East - places that are not quite as friendly to United States. SIEGEL: This would be an international pipeline, so the State Department was called in to assess it. Scott Horsley, what does the State Department say about it? HORSLEY: Well, the State Department finished their environmental review last January, and they left enough wiggle room, really, for the administration to go either way. But the basic conclusions were this pipeline would not make much difference to the price that consumers pay for gas at the pump. And it would not make much difference in whether those Canadian tar sands are developed and contribute to climate change. SIEGEL: So as you say, the State Department came up with a report that would justify the president going either way on this. Where does the president stand on this? HORSLEY: Well he's been really torn. He has unusual power here. In fact, the permit that Keystone needs is called a presidential permit. And the president has guarded that power fairly carefully. Back in late 2011 - early 2012, Congress tried to force his hand by giving him a 60-day deadline to make a decision. And the president said, in effect, don't rush me - if it's got to be 60 days, the answer is no. Frankly, Obama knows that someone is going to be angry no matter what he does here. So he has basically stalled, and he's grabbed every opportunity to stretch this process out. The latest stretching device has been a court case in Nebraska, and he talked about that last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Right now you've got a case pending in Nebraska where the pipeline would run through in which a state court judge has questioned the plan. And until we know what the root is, it's very hard to finish that evaluation. And I don't think we should short-circuit that process. SIEGEL: Well, this raises the question of environmental concerns in Nebraska. And Jeff Brady, roughly, what are those concerns? BRADY: It's all about where the pipeline is going to be located. Early on, the route that was proposed went through these environmentally sensitive sand hills, the Sandhills region. You may have heard of it in Nebraska. And that route was widely criticized so they went back to the drawing board, came up with a new route, and then Republican Governor Dave Heineman - he approved that route. Opponents came back and said well, now wait a minute - the governor's not supposed to be the one approving routes. That's supposed to be done by the Public Service Commission. So they challenged it in court - that's before the Supreme Court now, and we expect a decision probably later this year or early next year. SIEGEL: To give some sense of the intensity of feeling here, here is Nebraska farmer Randy Thompson speaking in a video released by the National Resources Defense Council. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RANDY THOMPSON: This pipeline would be a few hundred feet from one of my irrigation wells. And if it were to contaminate that well, it would virtually take out 80 acres of crops for us. SIEGEL: Big concern there that the water supply might be damaged by the pipeline. Is that something you've heard often, Jeff? BRADY: Of course. Environmental concerns are central to the whole issue here. It's not just about contaminating water in Nebraska and the other states along the pipeline route. This is also about what happens back in Alberta where the oil is processed from those oil sands. It emits an estimated 17 percent more greenhouse gases than traditional oil drilling in the U. S. So instead of just poking a hole in the ground and the oil coming out like we do in Oklahoma or Texas, this oil has to be mined from sand and then heated up. And heating it up emits more greenhouse gases. SIEGEL: OK. Now, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu last Wednesday spoke about this and raised the question of the jobs that the XL pipeline would create, she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LANDRIEU: Not minimum wage jobs, but high-paying jobs for middle-class families. That's what we should be about here. SIEGEL: Boy, are there different estimates of the jobs that would be created by the XL pipeline. Jeff, what have you heard? BRADY: Yeah, there are different estimates. The State Department said 42,000 direct and indirect jobs. We're talking about the overall project there. But folks - especially people who opposed this pipeline - dispute a lot of that. And you can really move those numbers around in a lot of different ways to sort of make your point. But the thing that you really can't dispute is that's just during the construction process which is probably about two years. After this pipeline is done, only about 50 people are going to be employed by it because that's why pipelines are so efficient. It takes few people to operate them. SIEGEL: Jeff Brady, is it clear to you why this particular pipeline - in a country with so many pipelines running under it, why this one has taken on such significance? BRADY: Well, you're right. There are a lot of pipelines, and this one is significant primarily because people have decided that it's going to be significant. This is the one that environmental groups said we're going to stop it right here. We want this - they call it dirty tar sands oil - to stay in the ground in Alberta. And so this is the one they've decided to oppose, and that's why we're all hearing about it. HORSLEY: Frankly, Robert, when you're trying to tackle something as big and amorphous as climate change, it's easier to try to block a pipeline than to change people's driving habits or get them to buy fluorescent light bulbs or invest in green power. And so Keystone has become this larger-than-life political symbol, really out of proportion to its tangible impact on the climate. SIEGEL: NPR's Scott Horsley and Jeff Brady, thanks to both of you for that update on the Keystone XL pipeline. BRADY: Thank you. HORSLEY: My pleasure.

NPR's a Selena Simmons-Duffin has this report for our series on millennials, New Boom. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: An unfinished bachelor's degree can affect pretty much every aspect of your life.

JOHNSON: I think that I'm stuck between 40 and 45. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She works in the D. C. area, where incomes are higher. The national average is 31,000 for people with some college. If she had a B. A. . . JOHNSON: I think I would be at a manager level. I would be making more money. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She would. Young college grads make 58,000 a year, on average. At the lower pay grade, she has to live a long way from work. Her commute is an hour-and-a-half by bus and train each way. With a B. A. , making more money. . . JOHNSON: I would be living some place that was closer to work, that I'd be able to afford. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She'd be able to shop at farmer's markets and treat her sister to dinner for once. Instead of hustling for babysitting gigs in her spare time, she and her husband Joseph would probably have kids of their own by now. Instead, she's working on that bachelor's and managing her student loans. JOHNSON: It's close to $20,000. It's 250 a month. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Millions of millennials are in this situation right now. Richard Fry of the Pew Research Center says the real impact of these loans for those with no degree isn't even on how much money you make, it's on your overall wealth. RICHARD FRY: Some college-educated household that doesn't have the student debt, their net worth is about 10, $11,000, OK? As opposed to that, for the ones that are still sort of servicing their student debt, they have a net worth of about a grand. So you're looking at about a 10-fold difference. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: He says households with student loans also tend to have other kinds of debt - credit card debt, car payments. JOHNSON: We've done payday loans and you know, it just - it gets out of control. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: That's Noelle Johnson again. JOHNSON: We had so much more in savings but we had to put a lot of it toward school. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Savings, earnings, debt - all going towards tuition. That means lots of students have to make calculations. Draw school out so there's time to save up and put yourself at risk for dropping out altogether, or take on more student loan debt. JOHNSON: I took out too much so I had to say, well, I can't, you know, take out any more loans and definitely don't have the cash for it. So I have to stop and then save and then pay for that semester, and then do that all over again. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Noelle Johnson started out at community college undecided on a major. She switched schools. She had to move home when she got it ill. Plus all that starting and stopping, put together, she's been working towards her degree for nine years. FRY: Most people who are going to finish bachelor's degrees, they've got them by age 30. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Richard Fry of Pew says the important thing is not how long it takes you to finish, but whether you end up with that degree after all. FRY: For a bachelor's degree, you're looking at at least an extra 6, $800,000 over a working life compared to if you'd stopped at high school. College is expensive but it's a good investment. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Noelle Johnson has a plan to get to graduation. JOHNSON: My job does have a tuition reimbursement program which is great, but that means I do need to be able to pay first so we're just working on getting some money together so I can pay for my next semester and then it will be reimbursed. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: In a year-and-a-half she should have her degree in nonprofit management. JOHNSON: I know that having my degree is definitely going to make the difference. It's going to do everything for us. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She says she really wants to be successful and she needs that bachelor's degree to get where she wants to go. Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR News.

In this area only about half of people between 20 and 24 have a job according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D. C. think tank. In fact among the 100 largest metro areas in the U. S.

WANG: Trejo says he wants to join law enforcement one day. He finally received his high school diploma this year after dropping out of high school at 17. TREJO: I really want to be someone in life because my mom never finished school. My dad never finished school. Most of my family, my uncles never finished school. MISTY MILLER: Not many people get to graduate from high school. The few that do don't always find themselves fit for college, like; they feel like they can't do it. WANG: Misty Miller, who's 20 years old, did graduate from high school and currently attends the University of Texas-Pan American just outside of McAllen. Miller like the majority of residents here is Mexican-American. She says family ties keep many millennials in the area even when job opportunities are scarce. MILLER: Most Mexican kids don't leave home until they're married even if they have a good job or not. It's just being with your family. WANG: Family drew 30-year-old Olmo Maldonado back to McAllen where he now leads monthly talks by local entrepreneurs. OLMO MALDONADO: All right. Welcome to Tech Tuesdays. How many of you guys it's the first time here? WANG: Maldonado's first big break in the tech industry came in California where he worked as a software engineering intern at Google. At that time he didn't see a future in McAllen. MALDONADO: I was really skeptical and pessimistic about the Valley. Like, my rule of thumb was I need to get out of here as quickly as possible. WANG: That changed after Maldonado came home to help run his mother's marketing company for what was supposed to be a few months. Now almost five years later he's working to inspire other millennials. Maldonado wants to add technology to sectors like health care, government and tourism that drive the economy here. He says as more local leaders of McAllen retire he sees opportunities for a new generation. MALDONADO: We can take part in boards. We can be part in legislation. We can be part in a lot of activities. LEILANI DE LEON: There is potential here, but not necessarily potential for college students graduating. WANG: Twenty two-year-old Leilani De Leon is set to graduate from UT-Pan American next year with a marketing degree. She was born and raised in McAllen, but she's ready to relocate for her career. DE LEON: I am open to going anywhere. If I got to leave, I got to leave. WANG: For the area to prosper, millennials who do leave need to eventually come back. That's according to Salvador Contreras, an economics professor at UTPA. He says McAllen's geography 300 miles away from the nearest major U. S. city puts the area at a disadvantage. SALVADOR CONTRERAS: The area as a whole is depressed. And millenials along with Generation Xers and so on and so forth, everybody's in the same boat. WANG: Contreras says McAllen's population has grown faster than economic development here. So for now there aren't enough good paying jobs to go around. He says highly skilled millennials will be key to helping break this cycle of poverty in the future. UTPA student Misty Miller believes she can play a role now. She plans to stay put after graduation and help the community overcome health issues like high obesity rates. MILLER: And I am studying nutrition so I think I'll be needed here. WANG: And so will other millennials. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Next we visit a place with a young population including many immigrants or children of immigrants, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. It's where we go next in The New Boom, our look at the millennial generation. The great recession left many young people jobless. And in South Texas, NPR's Hansi Lo Wang found an astounding number still are. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Welcome to boot camp for the young and unemployed in McAllen, Texas. MARCO LOPEZ: So we're going to go ahead and do this. WANG: Marco Lopez leads a classroom of millennial's inside a strip mall near McAllen. In this area only about half of people between 20 and 24 have a job according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D. C. think tank. In fact among the 100 largest metro areas in the U. S. McAllen has the lowest employment rate for young millennials, like 20-year-old Dennis Trejo. DENNIS TREJO: Limit cell phone use to designated areas. WANG: Trejo reads from a list of tips for jobseekers, part of his week of training at this workforce solutions center before he spends a few months working for the local government. Its temporary, but it's also a rare chance he says to start building a legitimate career in his hometown. TREJO: I've had a lot opportunities to get affiliated with the gang here or get in with the cartels in Mexico. WANG: Is it easier to join a gang than to get a job? TREJO: Yeah, it is. WANG: Trejo says he wants to join law enforcement one day. He finally received his high school diploma this year after dropping out of high school at 17. TREJO: I really want to be someone in life because my mom never finished school. My dad never finished school. Most of my family, my uncles never finished school.

They have to be. They represent employers who sometimes get investigated, even prosecuted, for hiring workers not approved to work in the U. S. legally. But as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, the president's executive action doesn't change much for the business lobby. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Among other things, the executive action will allow more undocumented immigrants with U. S. -born children to apply for work permits. But Matt Sonnesyn says that will not help businesses with their key immigration concerns. MATT SONNESYN: Last night's actions do help for those who are already here to have some security that they're going to be able to remain and continue working. But they don't really address the questions of how we attract and retain those workers from around the world. NOGUCHI: Sonnesyn is a senior director at the Business Roundtable, which represents large businesses. He notes the president did extend a program giving high-skilled students the ability to work while applying for a visa. And there is some added flexibility for those who already have work visas to move between jobs. But Sonnesyn says the action does not increase the total number of visas available - either too high or low-skilled temporary workers. And that is a big blow to business groups, especially as the U. S. economy recovers. Many big employers want to recruit more science and technology workers as well as skilled laborers in fields like manufacturing and construction. But, Sonnesyn says, that's also not a surprise. The president could only act on enforcement - things like border control and deportation of criminals, not legislation. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: The president just didn't have the authority to go to the core of what we see as important for growing the economy over time. NOGUCHI: Douglas Holtz-Eakin  is a former George W. Bush Administration economist and now president of the American Action Forum, a policy analysis group. HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the business groups are going to be by and large disappointed. There really wasn't much in there for them. NOGUCHI: Many business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business and National Association of Manufacturers, support a national system allowing employers to check whether someone is permitted to work legally. That system, known as E-Verify, can reduce an employer's legal liability if they hire someone with falsified documents. E-Verify received no mention last night. Holtz-Eakin says what might be surprising, given the partisan rhetoric, is how little daylight there is between the president's policy position and that of most Republicans and the business community. HOLTZ-EAKIN: There's much less division than people realize. NOGUCHI: The president supports the immigration bill that passed the Senate a year and a half ago - something the business community also supports, but which the Republican leadership in the House has not brought up for a vote. HOLTZ-EAKIN: There's no disagreement on the policy. The issue is 100 percent politics. And the sad reality is the president pushed the politics in the wrong direction last night. NOGUCHI: That certainly is the position of some Republicans in leadership who are angry the president acted unilaterally. Robert Litan is a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ROBERT LITAN: He could have done all this quietly, without making any announcement whatsoever. NOGUCHI: But he didn't. And Litan says he instead chose a high-stakes political gamble that could pay off if Republicans in Congress take up the president's challenge and pass immigration legislation. In any event, Litan says, it's hard to know what the ultimate business implications of last night's actions are. LITAN: Bottom line is business community, like everyone else, is waiting to see what the next move is going to be in Congress - whether there's going to be a legal challenge and so forth. And at the end of the day, whatever the president can do can only last for two years. The next president could decide to undo the whole thing.

C. , has one of the highest costs of living in the nation, and nearly 1-in-5 people here lives at or below the poverty line. Not surprisingly, many low-income people have trouble buying affordable housing. As Rebecca Sheir of member station WAMU tells us, the trouble is not a lack of housing. It's too much red tape. REBECCA SHEIR, BYLINE: Buwa Binitie is showing me around Justice Park Apartments, an affordable housing development he just opened in D. C. 's Columbia Heights neighborhood. We begin in the lobby. BUWA BINITIE: We can't afford the sexy lobbies that most market-rate units have. But I think we've done a very good job giving you that flair. SHEIR: The developer has also done a very good job getting tenants. BINITIE: For this property that you and I are sitting in right now, we have a thousand people waitlist. This building leased up in two weeks. SHEIR: The key word here is leased. Justice Park is a rental building. But at one of Binitie's for-sale properties? BINITIE: The affordable units were selling for $171,000. And the market-rate units were selling for $230,000. All the market-rate units sold in two months. But it's taken me 11 months to dispose of 11 affordable dwelling units. SHEIR: Binitie blames the hold-up on the hoops prospective buyers must jump through. The first trick, says National Low Income Housing Coalition President Sheila Crowley, is proving your income is low enough to qualify for affordable housing, yet high enough to get a mortgage. In D. C. , you must make below 80 percent of the area median income. That's about $107,000 for a family of four. SHEILA CROWLEY: Part of it is this square-peg-into-a-round-hole thing that we try to do in housing. And that's a conundrum. SHEIR: Crowley says this conundrum exists nationwide, and in D. C. , it's compounded by more requirements. Prospective buyers of affordable housing must also attend home-buying training. And if they want to get a district loan, they must navigate the labyrinth of city government. MARILYN PHILLIPS: People can get frustrated with all the hoops you have to jump through. SHEIR: Marilyn Phillips just bought her very first condo. Manna, an affordable housing organization, walked her through the process. PHILLIPS: All of the information they want to gather from you - it can make you feel like, why do you need all this information? SHEIR: The 58-year-old has been fighting breast cancer for years, and now she can finally save money. PHILLIPS: I pay most of my Social Security disability check to my landlord now. I pay $900 a month. My mortgage at this new place is only $224 a month. SHEIR: Sarah Scruggs works for Manna and says the bureaucracy surrounding affordable homeownership is well-intentioned. SARAH SCRUGGS: The D. C. government and the federal government want to make sure that the subsidies that they're providing are going to people that actually need them. SHEIR: But what happens is many low-income individuals decide to just keep renting or scrape their pennies together for a market-rate unit. . . SARAH SCRUGGS: . . . Because they don't have to deal with the paperwork required to buy an affordable dwelling unit and they don't have to deal with the restrictions. SHEIR: Like the one in D. C. that limits maximum resale price and makes homeowners wait anywhere from five to 20 years before they sell. D. C. Department of Housing and Community Development director Michael Kelly says he understands how unwieldy the process can be. MICHAEL KELLY: Unfortunately with all government programs there are bureaucracies and provisions that go with that. We're doing everything we can to streamline that effort. SHEIR: The current mayor has vowed to build 10,000 affordable units by the year 2020. He hopes his successor will continue toward that goal. But under the current system, it could be a while before every unit has an owner to call it home sweet home. For NPR News, I'm Rebecca Sheir in Washington. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Washington, D.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: What do you mean? Wait a second. Wait a second. I'm pretty sure it starts right now. SHAPIRO: OK, fair. The holiday shopping season is already here. And this year, the economy is doing better, so retailers are feeling pretty good. They are counting on a frenzy. And researchers have learned that frenzy can take its toll on us. NPR's Sonari Glinton explores why that could actually be good for us as consumers. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: This story is what we call here at NPR a setup piece. My assignment is to get you ready for the holiday shopping season. Now, usually I like to start these pieces with a montage of my favorite holiday commercials to set the mood. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENTS)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: This Black Friday at Sports Authority, door busters start at 6 p. m. on Thursday. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Or shop in-store when doors open Thursday at 5 p. m. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: This just in. Macy's is giving away a million dollars in prizes on. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Black Friday is here early, so let's get charged up. GLINTON: OK, holiday commercial montage - check. Then I reach out to the retail analyst Howard Davidowitz by phone - always by phone. He usually tells us how crazy this whole thing is. HOWARD DAVIDOWITZ: Well, first of all, waiting in lines and going out and doing all this stuff in the cold is certifiably mad. GLINTON: Davidowitz says, it's madness because many of the deals can be had online. And he says, the real deals can be had if you just have a little patience. DAVIDOWITZ: If you look and track the pattern of sales at the holiday season, it all comes in the last few days. Why is that? Because that's when the prices are the lowest. GLINTON: OK, so here's the time in the piece where I begin to wonder, why do we act this way then? DAN ARIELY: The interesting about this shopping season is that we get a social justification to buy things. GLINTON: Dan Ariely studies behavioral economics at Duke University. He says, it's not necessarily about deals. We get discounts and deals all the time. There's this idea called social proof. ARIELY: Social proof is the idea that, often, what we do is not about what's right or wrong. It's about what other people are doing. We see other people standing in line, and we say hey, this must be a good idea. So all of the sudden, we see lots of people acting, and they basically invoke this herding behavior within us. And we say, we should be behaving like this, as well, and then we follow the rule. GLINTON: So part of the reason people stand in line on Thanksgiving is because now people stand in line on Thanksgiving. And social justification - that allows us to say to ourselves, I don't normally stand in the cold, but this is different because it's the holidays. ARIELY: And that's a once-in-a-year period. But if you buy on the regular Tuesday in March, you would say to yourself, I'm the kind of person who just goes on a whim and buy in general. Let me keep on behaving like this. And now there's really no boundary. GLINTON: Now, this will sound a bit weird on the eve of Thanksgiving, but Ariely says, the holiday shopping season actually works overall to curb consumption. ARIELY: But it's possible that if we didn't have this holiday season, the way shopping would work is we would buy a little bit more throughout the year, but it would accumulate to being more than what we shop for right now. GLINTON: This actually might be like our larger economic governor that keeps us from being just crazy all the time. ARIELY: Yeah, and by the way, here's another example of this - Weight Watchers. You know, Weight Watchers allows you to go crazy once in a while - right? - because they say if you don't go crazy once in a while, you will not be able to sustain the diet in the other places. GLINTON: So the holiday is like a big macroeconomic cheat day, so let's wrap up with a look forward to what we can expect from the holiday season. Katherine Grannis from the National Retail Federation says, last year, there was a government shutdown and the weather was terrible, and all that put retailers into a funk. KATHERINE GRANNIS: We do feel that that kind of funk has lifted and that, you know, that cloud has lifted and that the fog is clearing, and we may actually have a real reason to be optimistic this holiday season. GLINTON: So now that the funk is lifted, are you ready for shopping? Oh, yeah, got to have that Thanksgiving dinner first. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

HOWARD DAVIDOWITZ: Well, first of all, waiting in lines and going out and doing all this stuff in the cold is certifiably mad. GLINTON: Davidowitz says, it's madness because many of the deals can be had online. And he says, the real deals can be had if you just have a little patience. DAVIDOWITZ: If you look and track the pattern of sales at the holiday season, it all comes in the last few days. Why is that? Because that's when the prices are the lowest. GLINTON: OK, so here's the time in the piece where I begin to wonder, why do we act this way then? DAN ARIELY: The interesting about this shopping season is that we get a social justification to buy things. GLINTON: Dan Ariely studies behavioral economics at Duke University. He says, it's not necessarily about deals. We get discounts and deals all the time. There's this idea called social proof. ARIELY: Social proof is the idea that, often, what we do is not about what's right or wrong. It's about what other people are doing. We see other people standing in line, and we say hey, this must be a good idea. So all of the sudden, we see lots of people acting, and they basically invoke this herding behavior within us. And we say, we should be behaving like this, as well, and then we follow the rule. GLINTON: So part of the reason people stand in line on Thanksgiving is because now people stand in line on Thanksgiving. And social justification - that allows us to say to ourselves, I don't normally stand in the cold, but this is different because it's the holidays. ARIELY: And that's a once-in-a-year period. But if you buy on the regular Tuesday in March, you would say to yourself, I'm the kind of person who just goes on a whim and buy in general. Let me keep on behaving like this. And now there's really no boundary. GLINTON: Now, this will sound a bit weird on the eve of Thanksgiving, but Ariely says, the holiday shopping season actually works overall to curb consumption. ARIELY: But it's possible that if we didn't have this holiday season, the way shopping would work is we would buy a little bit more throughout the year, but it would accumulate to being more than what we shop for right now. GLINTON: This actually might be like our larger economic governor that keeps us from being just crazy all the time. ARIELY: Yeah, and by the way, here's another example of this - Weight Watchers. You know, Weight Watchers allows you to go crazy once in a while - right? - because they say if you don't go crazy once in a while, you will not be able to sustain the diet in the other places. GLINTON: So the holiday is like a big macroeconomic cheat day, so let's wrap up with a look forward to what we can expect from the holiday season. Katherine Grannis from the National Retail Federation says, last year, there was a government shutdown and the weather was terrible, and all that put retailers into a funk. KATHERINE GRANNIS: We do feel that that kind of funk has lifted and that, you know, that cloud has lifted and that the fog is clearing, and we may actually have a real reason to be optimistic this holiday season. GLINTON: So now that the funk is lifted, are you ready for shopping? Oh, yeah, got to have that Thanksgiving dinner first.

October numbers show a rise of 1. 4 percent. That's shy of the Federal Reserve Bank's target inflation rate of 2 percent. Naturally, no one wants to pay more for goods and services. In fact, the major purpose of the Federal Reserve is to resist inflation. But these days, the Fed and its counterparts around the world are worrying about too little inflation, which is why we've got David Wessel on the line to clear up the confusion. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. Good morning. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: So start us off with the basics. WESSEL: Well, the numbers bounce around a lot from month-to-month, but the prices of all the goods and services in the economy have been rising at a pace of about one-and-a-half percent a year according to what's called the personal consumption expenditures index. That's the inflation gauge the Fed favors. And that 1. 5 percent is quite a ways from the Fed's 2 percent target. In Europe, which has a similar target, prices are up just 0. 4 percent over the last year. And Japan is also having trouble getting prices up to its 2 percent target. So it's a global phenomenon. Now, I should say there's always a lot of skepticism about these government measures. People tend to focus on the price of things that are going up, like college tuition or health insurance, and overlook the prices of things that are going down, like gasoline is. And consumers always have a hard time understanding that if a thousand dollars buys you a more powerful laptop this year than it did last year, the government counts that as a price decline. But nearly every available measure shows very, very little inflation. And at these low rates of inflation, there's even a risk of deflation or falling prices. MONTAGNE: Although falling prices, now that really should be every shopper's dream come true. So what's the problem? WESSEL: Well, falling prices are great as long as your wages aren't falling, too. And in deflation, they both fall together. Or if wages are sticky and they don't fall, then economists tell us that can make workers awfully expensive and lead employers to hire fewer people. It can actually produce more unemployment. In addition, most people borrow money, like a mortgage, and they owe a fixed dollar amount. And that doesn't change when wages and prices fall. So it gets harder to pay off your debts. And many of these same problems occur when inflation is just very low as it is today, which is why the Fed and the European Central Bank and all are working so hard to raise the inflation rate. MONTAGNE: Although, why haven't these efforts by the central bankers achieved that result? WESSEL: In part, this is a symptom of a global economy with too much supply - that is, too many empty buildings, too many empty factories, too many idle workers - and not enough demand. Now, the Fed expects a gradual rise in inflation towards the 2 percent goal if the economy continues to improve here as it expects 'cause more people working means more spending, and that means more demand and prices will go up. But in part, this suggests that the World Central Bank, particularly the European one, haven't really done enough because their job is to keep inflation at target, and they're failing. Or maybe governments have been overly worried about deficits and have been too tightfisted. But some of this is a mystery, a manifestation of changes in the world economy that we don't fully understand, particularly the extent to which globalization and technology are holding wages down much more than anybody expected. MONTAGNE: OK, David, how about an update on turkey or any other part of Thanksgiving dinner? WESSEL: Not much inflation there. The government says the average frozen turkey price is 1. 2 percent below last year. And there's such a big glut of cranberries that the Agriculture Department said this week it's going to buy 68 million pounds of them to try and stabilize prices. MONTAGNE: Thanks, David.

It could also mean better jobs for them. The broader impact on the labor market is less certain. NPR's Jim's Zarroli has this story about what happened the last time the federal government offered legal status to large numbers of undocumented workers. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: President Obama's executive order on immigration could have a profound impact on millions of people. Margarita Soto(ph) understands that very well. Soto, who lives in Queens with her husband and children, was born in Peru. When she was two, her family went to Canada and lived there illegally for a few years. Then one day, they drove over the border into North Dakota to take up residence in the United States. MARGARITA SOTO: I remember it as a kind of cheery, childhood trip because I didn't know. My parents didn't share their fears with me. They shared it with each other. And so they - we lived a fairly sheltered life despite the fact that we were illegal aliens, or undocumented children. ZARROLI: The family ended up in New Jersey where her father got a job working long hours in a bakery. Soto says she never really understood the family was in the United States illegally, but certain things didn't add up. Like, when she wanted to get a job and didn't have a Social Security number. SOTO: And I really wanted to work when I was 15 and all my 16-year-old friends were all working. And so my mom's just like well, yeah, you just make up a Social Security number. That's what you do, and so I did. ZARROLI: Then in 1986 when she was in high school, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act. The bill, which was signed into law by President Reagan, allowed some 2 million undocumented workers with clean records to apply for citizenship. Sherrie Koussoudji, associate professor of social work at the University of Michigan, says it fundamentally changed their lives. Koussoudji says when most people look for jobs they consider things like pay and promotion prospects. SHERRIE KOUSSOUDJI: An undocumented worker's going to look for a job that minimizes the risk of apprehension. ZARROLI: The 1986 act allowed such people to look for and get better jobs. KOUSSOUDJI: When you're undocumented, you're likely to stay in the back of the restaurant because it's a safer job, but once you have working papers, you can move to the front of the restaurant where those jobs tend to be higher-paying jobs. ZARROLI: Koussoudji says that within a couple of years of legalization, workers were making on average 6 percent more than before. Margarita Soto's mother, Amata(ph), says the family got their documents together and went to the immigration office almost immediately. AMATA: It was very quick and easy and there's hardly anybody in those office because people were afraid, but we went and it was so, so fast, I mean, because I said we had all the papers. ZARROLI: Once they were approved, Soto's father was able to quit his bakery job and get a much better paying one in a factory. Soto's mother eventually went into health care. AMATA: With the amnesty, financially we feel more secure. I went to school because I always wanted to be a nurse. And so I'm so grateful that I have Ronald Reagan in my heart. I'm so grateful. ZARROLI: Randy Capps is with the Migration Policy Institute. He says when people no longer have to worry about deportation they can get jobs better suited to their talents. The economy becomes more productive, people make more so they can spend more. RANDY CAPPS: Generally, economists have shown that during periods when the economy is expanding, having more people be able to enter and move up in the labor force is beneficial to everyone. ZARROLI: But Capps says that's not so true when the economy is in recession. When jobs are scarce, legalization can depress overall wages - not by a lot, he says, but in some fields, like construction, it can have an impact. CAPPS: To the degree that there is some competition then that could have somewhat of a negative affect. It's only going to have that effect on the least educated workers in those sectors where the unauthorized are most heavily concentrated. ZARROLI: There's also the question of whether the president's executive order might encourage more people to cross the border illegally. Capps says it's a tough question to answer because so many different factors affect the flow of illegal immigrants, nor is it really clear how many workers will come forward to participate in President Obama's program. Unlike the 1986 act, the president's executive order is temporary and it could be reversed by another administration. A lot of immigrant families right now are hoping for the kind of second chance the Soto's got in 1986, but the move by President Obama might not be enough to give them what they're looking for.

They're two of the million super-cute extra babies born between 1981 and 2012, all of whom might be hurting the economy. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Let's get one thing out of the way first. Everyone in this story loves twins - even this guy. MARK ROSENZWEIG: Well, basically, we would prefer that people were not twins to being twins. HERSHER: Mark Rosenzweig is an economist. His career is built on studying twins. But, if he's being honest, he thinks twins are bad economic news. First, there's healthcare costs. Twins are more likely to be born prematurely, which can lead to all kinds of expensive medical problems. And then there's birth weight. He did a study based on hundreds of female twins in Minnesota that looked at the effect of birth weight on lifetime earnings. ROSENZWEIG: The birth weight of twins are, on average, about 28 ounces lower. So the earnings result was 16 percent lower, related to the fact that they had lower birth weight. HERSHER: Yeah, you heard that right. On average, girl twins make 16 percent less money over their lifetimes, just because they're born less chubby. Unless you think it's only the girls who are a problem. Multiple studies have also found low birth weight correlates with less educational success in boys, which also means earning less money. And then there's the stress on a family of bringing home two babies at once. Here's another person who loves twins. NANCY SEGAL: As a twin researcher, of course, I want lots of twins in the population. HERSHER: Nancy Segal runs that Twin Studies Center at Cal State Fullerton. SEGAL: The birth of twins - it's usually greeted with a great deal of shock. A two-person stroller, two cribs, two of everything, basically. HERSHER: Double the carpools, double the college payments - raising all those extra millennial twins has been hard on family budgets, plus the cost of having them in the first place. The main reason for the twin-boom in the '90s was a new, expensive technology called in vitro fertilization which, in its early days, frequently produced twins, triplets and more. But despite the costs, Segal doesn't buy that twins are a bad thing for society. She points out twins tend to support each other emotionally and tend to live closer to each other and to family than regular siblings, which could make them more available to care for aging parents. And being twins might just help them economically, too. MATT GRADNANI: I'm Matt Gradnani. MIKE GRADNANI: I'm Mike Gradnani, and we are both 25 years old. HERSHER: The Gradnanis are identical twins, and they're really, really close. They went to college together, played football and rugby together. They go to bars together, but they're not into the same kinds of women, if you were wondering. And, at 25 years old, they live together in an apartment they own together, which they could afford because there are two of them. MIKE GRADNANI: I mean, we both kind of felt that it'd be smarter in the long run to put money in our own investment instead of someone else's pocket. And, ultimately, the two of us could afford a lot more space together than we could individually. So. . . MATT GRADNANI: It's our hometown. MIKE GRADNANI: It's our hometown that we grew up in. HERSHER: And Mike and Matt even co-own a successful business selling real estate. How is that for hurting the economy?

The ultimate economic impact of all those twins is yet to be known. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

Unlike construction elsewhere, in the city the new condo boom is being financed mostly by foreign buyers. NPR's Greg Allen reports that it caps a decade of building that's transformed one of America's poorest cities into an international destination. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Few people track Miami development closer than Peter Zalewski. He runs cranespotters. com, a business that keeps tabs on all the new construction proposed in downtown Miami. In an area that covers less than four square miles, there's a lot going on. PETER ZALEWSKI: Downtown Miami, we're looking at 69 towers, 18,400 units. ALLEN: Those are all residential condominiums. If history is any guide, all of the projects won't be built. But Zalewski says there are other big projects coming likely to add to the total. ZALEWSKI: So I would tell you if we were to sit down a year from now, we will be well over and above what we did during our last boom and ultimate bust and an ultimate recovery. ALLEN: Since it was founded just over a century ago, Miami's history has largely been a series of property booms and busts. Over the span of just a few years until it ended in 2006, Miami's last building spree added more than 20,000 condo units to a downtown where previously few lived. This new boom is adding more condos, also commercial, retail and entertainment properties at a dizzying pace. This is one of the big projects currently under construction. Brickell City Center is a $1 billion project that will include residential condos, a hotel, plus a shopping and entertainment complex. Several blocks away in Miami, construction is slated to begin soon on another even larger project. That one is a $2 billion complex - Miami World Center. NITIN MOTWANI: Everybody has got their eyes on Miami. ALLEN: Developer Nitin Motwani refers to the Miami World Center project as the hole in the doughnut. Right now, it's a 30-acre parcel of parking lots and old buildings in the heart of the city. Motwani is planning a convention hotel, a shopping mall and more condominiums. Similar construction booms are going on in other cities - Los Angeles, New York, Houston and Washington D. C. to name a few. In Miami, though, developers are focused on one particular product - luxury condominiums for foreign buyers. Real estate consultant Peter Zalewski says with its celebrities, nightlife and jet-set events, Miami has built an international reputation. ZALEWSKI: This is why we have Russian oligarchs purchasing property. This is why we have Malaysian conglomerates that own casinos and cruise lines coming here and buying. They're all coming here because they seem to think that this is the next Singapore. This is the next London. This is the next great global city. ALLEN: The annual Art Basel show has also been a factor - an event that every December attracts the ultra-wealthy to Miami Beach. Developers and city officials say they can track foreign investment dollars by watching the news. Sales to Russian buyers slowed after the U. S. imposed sanctions on that country. Economic and political turmoil in Latin America brought investors from that region. And it's not just the super-wealthy. Nelly Fernandez lives in Caracas where she's a real estate broker. Because of Venezuela's crime and political problems, Fernandez has used her savings to buy a modest condo in Miami. NELLY FERNANDEZ: I have many, many friends in Miami. I have family there. In this city I feel like I am home, you know? ALLEN: Developer Nitin Motwani says that's one of Miami's key attractions for international buyers. It's a city where visitors from Latin America, Europe and even Russia quickly find others who literally speak their language. MOTWANI: So I think what happens when people come here - you get beautiful weather. You get great taxes. You get great restaurants. You get great beaches. And all of that is spectacular. But what no one else can replicate is the diversity of our people. ALLEN: The decade of residential construction transformed Miami's downtown. Many of the condos are now rented by young professionals who work and play in the area. City Commissioner Mark Sarnoff says it's dramatically altered the demographics of the urban core. CITY COMMISSIONER MARK SARNOFF: The average person is 37 years old. That's pretty young. Miami's undergoing a youth movement, and that youth movement is good because it's the creative class moving to the downtown core. ALLEN: The high-end development downtown can mask, though, another important fact about Miami - even after all the new construction, it remains one of America's poorest cities. According to the Census Bureau, the Miami area has the nation's second-lowest median income - lower than Detroit or Newark. With the wealth pouring in, the divide between rich and poor is getting wider. Particularly vulnerable are residents who live in neighborhoods that border on Miami's downtown. In Overtown, a nearby neighborhood, work crews are renovating the old Josephine and Dunn Hotel. It was one of the few accommodations in segregated Miami open to African-Americans in the '30s and '40s. Yvette Harris works with Jackson Soul Food, a restaurant that's a Miami landmark. By next year, Harris says, Jackson will turn the old hotel into a European-style bed-and-breakfast. YVETTE HARRIS: Where travelers will be able to come into a community where they're able to do some cultural tours and just learn a little bit about the Overtown area. ALLEN: The work is being paid for out of a fund generated by fees on downtown development. Also in the works is a $60 million project to build affordable housing. Activist and author Marvin Dunn is concerned about the neighborhood's future as developers begin looking for new places to build. MARVIN DUNN: So these properties become very, very valuable. What will happen? The private market will dominate. People will build. Development will proceed to the West. Overtown will be squeezed. ALLEN: Dunn believes gentrification may push out half of the community's long-time African-American population in coming years. A decade after high-rise condominiums began reshaping Miami's downtown, it's an indication that the city's transformation never stops. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

Online sales rose sharply yesterday, also known as Cyber Monday, but sales at brick-and-mortar stores during the Black Friday weekend were down compared to last year. NPR's John Ydstie has more on our changing shopping strategies. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: This weekend, Will Falls, who lives near Raleigh, North Carolina, decided to skip the mall and shop online instead. He says it's just so much easier. WILL FALLS: No standing in line. No finding a parking spot. You know, just get comfortable and go at it. YDSTIE: Falls helped contribute to an 8. 5 percent increase in online shopping yesterday compared to a year ago. The use of mobile devices rose sharply. Though, desktop computers still accounted for three-quarters of online sales. The growth in online contrasts to an 11 percent drop-off in sales at brick-and-mortar stores last weekend. BOB DRBUL: I definitely believe, like, there is cannibalization occurring, you know, from the perspective of online against the stores. YDSTIE: Bob Drbul is an analyst and managing director at Nomura Securities. Of course, he says, some of that cannibalization is going to the retailer's own online arm. Drbul says another reason for the drop in in-store shopping this past weekend is that retailers are spreading their Black Friday sales across the whole month of November. Elle Phillips, a 37-year-old graphic designer from near Boise, Idaho, says her family was visiting for Thanksgiving this past weekend. ELLE PHILLIPS: And they wanted to go Black Friday shopping. I prefer to avoid it at all costs. YDSTIE: Her brother-in-law headed for Cabela's, the big hunting and camping store, at 4 a. m. . He came back six hours later with tales of a checkout line stretching to the back of the huge store. PHILLIPS: It literally took him two hours just to get through to the register with, you know, a couple of hoodie sweaters. So that just sort of - I don't know - verified the reason why I don't go out on Black Friday. YDSTIE: Meanwhile, Phillips did her shopping online, including finding some new boots for her husband. PHILLIPS: I look for those boots on Amazon, find out what the best price on there is, and then I actually went straight to the manufacturer's website, which in this case was Doc Martens, and I found an equally good price there - all with free shipping. YDSTIE: That kind of price shopping and free shipping is forcing profit margins down for retailers, says Bob Drbul. But he expects a strong holiday season nevertheless. DRBUL: This has the potential to be the best retail performance since 2011. YDSTIE: A big reason is that falling gas prices are putting more money in consumers' pocket.

They don't have the resources of BP or Exxon Mobil. INSKEEP: And when your prices fall at the pumps, so do the producers' bank accounts. They are among many producers affected worldwide as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The decline in prices has made major oil exporters, like Venezuela and Nigeria, nervous. And a lot of people were expecting OPEC to try to reverse the decline by announcing production cuts at its big meeting in Vienna last week. But OPEC Secretary General Abdalla Salem el-Badri told reporters that wasn't about to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABDALLA SALEM EL-BADRI: That does not mean that we should really, you know, rush and do something. We have to wait and see how the market will settle. ZARROLI: Prices have been very decent for a long time, he said. And just because they're falling now doesn't mean the industry should panic. The news that OPEC isn't going to ride to the rescue sent oil prices plummeting. But OPEC appears to be playing a long game. Jim Burkhard is vice president and head of oil market research at IHS. JIM BURKHARD: OPEC, especially the core OPEC members, are likely to be patient and in order to allow demand/supply to rebalance and eventually see prices recover but that will take time. ZARROLI: Prices have fallen so much in recent months because of a glut of supply brought about in large part because of the shale oil boom in the United States and Canada. With prices declining, a lot of those producers will have less incentive to drill. Energy consultant Michael Lynch says that won't affect major energy projects, and big oil companies like Exxon can afford to wait out the storm by concentrating on their most productive wells. But he says, there could be something of a shakeout. MICHAEL LYNCH: The small producers tend to operate a lot more on cash flow. They don't have deep pockets. ZARROLI: Lynch says a lot of small companies have borrowed heavily to lease wells and begin drilling. LYNCH: And if they don't have the cash coming in as they had expected, they won't be able to service that debt or keep drilling to raise their production levels. ZARROLI: So the next few months could be pretty brutal and some companies could go under. Jim Burkhard says it's still too early to gauge the impact of the price declines. But the pace of growth in the industry is likely to fall, and a lot of companies are already reassessing their drilling operations. BURKHARD: We've already seen companies decide to cut back their spending in 2015 by 20, 30, 40 percent. So the impact is already materializing. ZARROLI: And that impact is likely to be felt throughout the industry. With less drilling going on, companies that cater to oil producers, companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, are already seeing their stock prices fall. BURKHARD: It's a significant challenge for companies that provide services because if we drill for less oil - if there's less wells drilled, then there's simply less of a market for those service companies.

Last night on All Things Considered, we traveled with NPR's John Burnett to an illegal marijuana operation in the mountains of northwestern Mexico. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Here we are. It smells a little skunky. GREENE: That cannabis John was smelling is being grown for the Sinaloa cartel. But as one grower told John, its value as a cash crop is being hurt by marijuana legalization north of the border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Through translator) Two or three years ago, a kilogram of marijuana was worth $60 to $90. But now they're paying us $30 - $40 a kilo. It's a big difference. If the U. S. continues to legalize pot, they'll run us into the ground. GREENE: And this morning, an expedition north of the border to a less exotic location. It's an industrial park on the northeast side of Denver. With recreational marijuana legal in Colorado for almost a year now, we're going to meet at entrepreneur who is putting a lot on the line to capitalize on this growing market. NPR's Kirk Siegler picks up our story from here. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: On a balmy late fall day, I pull off interstate 70 onto Holly Street. It looks like a typical industrial district. There's a Safeway distribution center. There's a landscaping company. But roll the windows down, and you know what's also going on here. The smell of pot is everywhere. A left-hand turn onto 39th Avenue and the warehouses have been turned into grow houses. The one Brooke Gehring owns used to house furniture. BROOKE GEHRING: A little background about where you're standing. SIEGLER: You know you've found hers when you see a police station across the street. GEHRING: Where most people may have said, no, we don't want to grow marijuana around the police, for us, it's another security measure. SIEGLER: With the federal government taking a hands-off approach for now, legal marijuana has quickly grown into a billion-dollar industry in Colorado. Brooke Gehring's mission is to make it legitimate - mainstream. GEHRING: Change the face. So I know that we're, you know, on radio right now - but really not to be the stereotype of what they think is stoner culture but to realize they're true businesspeople that are operating these companies. SIEGLER: Like Gehring. She's smartly dressed in a business suit carrying an iPad and briefcase. And her two businesses - Patient's Choice Colorado and Live Green Cannabis - are about as transparent as they come. GEHRING: If you don't mind stepping onto this pad - it's just going to be making sure there's no outside matter. SIEGLER: We're stepping on a big spongy mat to disinfect our feet. We're also now wearing protective full-body suits as we walk inside one of the grow rooms. Gehring spent $3 million just to retrofit this warehouse. GEHRING: So you can see here we have a lot of very healthy and happy plants. SIEGLER: There are about 5,000 happy, healthy plants in here. Though company-wide, the number hovers around 50,000. Gehring expects to reach the $10 million mark in sales this year. It's a 25 percent increase since January 1, so you can see why security is such a big deal. It should also be no surprise that this is a tightly regulated business. GEHRING: These are RFID tags. And this essentially goes onto the plant. Once it goes into our tracking system, this is how the state monitors us through a metric to know our plant counts. SIEGLER: Even the shake that falls on the floor gets scooped up, weighed and reported. This is how Gehring wants it. She knows that tough regulations are the only way this industry will continue and even thrive. It's one of the reasons why she has a key seat on a state advisory panel that's helping write the regulations. GEHRING: We have a state that supports us. And we have a government that is willing to work with the industry, work with law enforcement, work with the Department of Public Health and Environment and try to come up with a system to which they can collect taxes and revenues and we can operate, create jobs and also make profits as a business. SIEGLER: But the federal government could come in any day and shut all of this down if it wanted to. Given that, Gehring has a lot of reservations about how fast this industry has grown. GEHRING: I guess as an industry, I worry that people will overproduce. And the people that overproduce and don't have a outlet to be able to sell it, they might consider the option of selling it outside of the regulated market. JOHN SUTHERS: I think it's pretty safe to say that we are becoming a major exporter of marijuana. SIEGLER: This is Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers. And you think about it. Every Coloradan is allowed to buy up to an ounce per transaction - tourists a little less. But there isn't really a limit on how many shops you can visit in a day. And people can also grow their own plants. It's not hard to imagine how quickly a lot of product could move into the wrong hands. SUTHERS: You know, you go to some of these warehouse districts, and there's maybe four or five grow operations. And I think some people are counting on the fact that nobody's going to notice that this particular one isn't licensed. No one's going to particularly notice that a lot of marijuana's going out the back door. SIEGLER: Suthers says his office and the DEA recently seized an undisclosed amount of pot from a warehouse district that was bound for out-of-state markets. There's no telling how far the black market takes legally grown marijuana from Colorado or who's doing the taking. But as we reported last night, a DEA official confirmed to NPR that the Mexican cartels are buying Colorado pot and bringing it into Mexico for sale there. See, it's triple the potency of marijuana grown outdoors in Mexico. SUTHERS: All this activity of course is undermining the regulatory system in Colorado where we're supposed to be, you know, collecting taxes. SIEGLER: And even our marijuana entrepreneur in Colorado, Brooke Gehring, she knows this could be her undoing. It's one of the reasons she originally opposed Colorado's recreational pot ballot measure two years ago. She thought it was premature and worried the controls just weren't there yet. Gehring says she could be producing more under the licenses that she currently holds, but she wants to make sure all the internal controls are in place so everything is accounted for. GEHRING: I view the black market as our biggest competition and could be the biggest, I would say, roadblock to really having the federal government on board with legalization. SIEGLER: But being here, you get the sense that entrepreneurs like Gehring are more excited than they are nervous. They see themselves as being on the frontier, like the early wildcatters in the oil business, staking their claim, helping write the rules, taking on all this risk. GEHRING: We do have the entrepreneurial spirit. We do see the opportunity of being true pioneers in what we're doing. SIEGLER: And Gehring's used to balancing opportunity and some risk. Before she got into the pot business in 2009, she was a commercial banker. Kirk Siegler, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Now to the business of marijuana - legal and illegal. Last night on All Things Considered, we traveled with NPR's John Burnett to an illegal marijuana operation in the mountains of northwestern Mexico. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Here we are. It smells a little skunky. GREENE: That cannabis John was smelling is being grown for the Sinaloa cartel. But as one grower told John, its value as a cash crop is being hurt by marijuana legalization north of the border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Through translator) Two or three years ago, a kilogram of marijuana was worth $60 to $90. But now they're paying us $30 - $40 a kilo. It's a big difference. If the U. S. continues to legalize pot, they'll run us into the ground. GREENE: And this morning, an expedition north of the border to a less exotic location. It's an industrial park on the northeast side of Denver. With recreational marijuana legal in Colorado for almost a year now, we're going to meet at entrepreneur who is putting a lot on the line to capitalize on this growing market. NPR's Kirk Siegler picks up our story from here. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: On a balmy late fall day, I pull off interstate 70 onto Holly Street. It looks like a typical industrial district. There's a Safeway distribution center. There's a landscaping company. But roll the windows down, and you know what's also going on here. The smell of pot is everywhere. A left-hand turn onto 39th Avenue and the warehouses have been turned into grow houses. The one Brooke Gehring owns used to house furniture. BROOKE GEHRING: A little background about where you're standing. SIEGLER: You know you've found hers when you see a police station across the street. GEHRING: Where most people may have said, no, we don't want to grow marijuana around the police, for us, it's another security measure. SIEGLER: With the federal government taking a hands-off approach for now, legal marijuana has quickly grown into a billion-dollar industry in Colorado. Brooke Gehring's mission is to make it legitimate - mainstream. GEHRING: Change the face. So I know that we're, you know, on radio right now - but really not to be the stereotype of what they think is stoner culture but to realize they're true businesspeople that are operating these companies. SIEGLER: Like Gehring. She's smartly dressed in a business suit carrying an iPad and briefcase. And her two businesses - Patient's Choice Colorado and Live Green Cannabis - are about as transparent as they come. GEHRING: If you don't mind stepping onto this pad - it's just going to be making sure there's no outside matter. SIEGLER: We're stepping on a big spongy mat to disinfect our feet. We're also now wearing protective full-body suits as we walk inside one of the grow rooms. Gehring spent $3 million just to retrofit this warehouse. GEHRING: So you can see here we have a lot of very healthy and happy plants. SIEGLER: There are about 5,000 happy, healthy plants in here. Though company-wide, the number hovers around 50,000. Gehring expects to reach the $10 million mark in sales this year. It's a 25 percent increase since January 1, so you can see why security is such a big deal. It should also be no surprise that this is a tightly regulated business. GEHRING: These are RFID tags. And this essentially goes onto the plant. Once it goes into our tracking system, this is how the state monitors us through a metric to know our plant counts. SIEGLER: Even the shake that falls on the floor gets scooped up, weighed and reported. This is how Gehring wants it. She knows that tough regulations are the only way this industry will continue and even thrive. It's one of the reasons why she has a key seat on a state advisory panel that's helping write the regulations. GEHRING: We have a state that supports us. And we have a government that is willing to work with the industry, work with law enforcement, work with the Department of Public Health and Environment and try to come up with a system to which they can collect taxes and revenues and we can operate, create jobs and also make profits as a business. SIEGLER: But the federal government could come in any day and shut all of this down if it wanted to. Given that, Gehring has a lot of reservations about how fast this industry has grown. GEHRING: I guess as an industry, I worry that people will overproduce. And the people that overproduce and don't have a outlet to be able to sell it, they might consider the option of selling it outside of the regulated market. JOHN SUTHERS: I think it's pretty safe to say that we are becoming a major exporter of marijuana. SIEGLER: This is Colorado's Attorney General John Suthers. And you think about it. Every Coloradan is allowed to buy up to an ounce per transaction - tourists a little less. But there isn't really a limit on how many shops you can visit in a day. And people can also grow their own plants. It's not hard to imagine how quickly a lot of product could move into the wrong hands. SUTHERS: You know, you go to some of these warehouse districts, and there's maybe four or five grow operations. And I think some people are counting on the fact that nobody's going to notice that this particular one isn't licensed. No one's going to particularly notice that a lot of marijuana's going out the back door. SIEGLER: Suthers says his office and the DEA recently seized an undisclosed amount of pot from a warehouse district that was bound for out-of-state markets.

S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez joins me here in the studio to talk about those new jobs numbers. Welcome back to the program. U. S. LABOR SECREATRY THOMAS PEREZ: Melissa, it's always a pleasure to be with you. BLOCK: In this latest jobs report - one of the best we've seen in quite some time. How do you account for that? PEREZ: Well, we've seen broad-based growth for a while. This is now the 10th month in a row - over 200,000 jobs. So the economy has been moving in the right direction for some time. And what's nice about this report, for me, is it's broad-based growth. This is not a holiday hiring blip. This is growth across many sectors. Construction's doing well. Manufacturing's doing well. The sector that's doing the best right now and has been for the last year or so is business and professional services. We saw wage growth last month that was significant. And so we're seeing things moving in the right direction, and we're on pace for the best year of job growth since the late '90s. BLOCK: Now, you mentioned, Secretary Perez, significant wage growth. And let's talk about that because there has been a pretty long-standing problem of wage stagnation. So here's the relevant number for December - a 9-cent-per-hour increase in the average hourly wage. You call that significant. How do you read it? PEREZ: Well, average hourly earnings went up about 0. 4 percent, which was twice what the economists had predicted. And what we see in wage growth is that when labor markets get tighter then employers have to pay more. And so we're moving in the right direction, but it's undeniable that we're not moving fast enough. And I speak to so many people in my travels across the country who haven't gotten a meaningful raise in years. And I think one of the biggest pieces of unfinished business in this recovery is to make sure that the shared prosperity means that people can get a meaningful raise. BLOCK: And let's talk about why that hasn't happened 'cause we've been seeing solid growth in jobs but really puny growth in wages, right? - about 2 percent growth year to year, just barely outpacing inflation. Why so little improvement up to now? PEREZ: Well, it's frustrating. You look at productivity growth since the late '70s and we've seen productivity growth of over 90 percent. And you look at wage growth, and you see real wage growth that's been something like 2, 3 percent. And what's frustrating for American workers - and I share that frustration - is that they helped bake the pie of increased productivity, but they're not sharing in the spoils of that. BLOCK: And why is that? PEREZ: And so that's why - well, I mean, I think there are a number of forces here. And what we're doing as an administration is focusing on really a number of areas to make sure that we lift wages. We have transformed our system for how we train people in America. What I hear from employers day in and day out is, I need to make sure I have that skilled workforce to compete. And so we've been able to help so many people punch their ticket to the middle class by transforming our workforce development system for advanced manufacturing jobs and other critical jobs that exist right now. Another area is to make sure that we enforce laws that are on the books. Just yesterday, we released a report in California and New York alone - minimum wage and overtime violations amounted to losses of over $1 billion in wages. And if you extrapolate nationally, we're talking about, in any given month, over 2 million workers are being ripped off in the wage and hour context. BLOCK: You're saying this is money to which they're entitled that they're not getting? PEREZ: Absolutely. And enforcement matters. And this president has been very vigilant in giving us those resources. And so there's no one magic bullet that is going to address the issue of making sure we lift wages. The thing that will help as much as anything is to continue to pick up the pace of growth. BLOCK: If you had to choose one, Secretary Perez, between further declines in the unemployment rate or wage gains - and I know you're going to want to say both. But if you had to choose one of those two, which would it be? PEREZ: I think that's actually a false choice because as the labor market tightens because more people have jobs, then an employer has to give more wage incentives to hire the people that he or she needs. You know, 70 percent of GDP growth is consumption. One of the best ways to grow this economy is to put money in people's pockets. And so that's why the president advocates so vigilantly for raising the minimum wage. That's why we're working overtime to put in overtime regulation in place because that is about putting money in people's pockets. Job creation is really a joint venture between businesses and consumers. And one of the most frequent things I hear, Melissa, from business owners when I ask the question, what can we do to help? What do you need? The answer is, I need more customers. And when people have more money in their pockets, they buy more things. BLOCK: Secretary Perez, thanks for coming in.

JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Nairman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, joined the chorus of praise for this report. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NAIRMAN BEHRAVESH: Overall, this is a broad-based very positive report. YDSTIE: Broad-based in that all industry sectors saw solid growth -from construction, to manufacturing, to business services. Behravesh says the big November number probably includes some holiday hiring and may overstate the trend, which he thinks is closer to 240,000. That's about the average monthly job growth this year. BEHRAVESH: Which is the strongest in 15 years. So that's really good news for the economy. It looks like we've moved up to sort of the next level of growth. YDSTIE: The good jobs report produced good cheer at the White House where President Obama highlighted another data point. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Over the last four years, we've put more people back to work than Europe, Japan and all other industrialized, advanced countries combined. YDSTIE: Obama also said more progress needs to be made. In fact, 9 million Americans remain unemployed and another 7 million work part-time but want full-time work. 37-year-old Larry Lavadore from Sacramento is one of them. He's working part-time at Home Depot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LARRY LAVADORE: I've been looking for full-time work probably about a year, but I took the Home Depot part-time as kind of desperation just to get some income. YDSTIE: For 13 years, Lavadore worked in the wholesale electrical supply business - including as a store manager. Now, he says, he's barely making it. LAVADORE: I actually have some friends helping me out - just moved in with them recently - trying to make sure I don't become homeless. YDSTIE: Today's data did show more workers joining the labor force, suggesting they're more optimistic they'll find a job. But that kept the unemployment rate from falling. It remained at 5. 8 percent in September. Finally, today's report showed a welcome uptick in wage growth. Sluggish wage growth has dampened enthusiasm about the current recovery. Behravesh says the November bump is a good sign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEHRAVESH: This is very encouraging news in terms of stronger growth in wages than we've seen in a while.

The government reports that 321,000 jobs were added to payrolls around this country in November. That's a lot of jobs - a lot more than in many, many recent months. It's the biggest monthly increase, in fact, in three years. And just as important wages rose strongly after lagging throughout this recovery. NPR's John Ydstie has more. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Another solid month of job growth of around 225,000 a month had been expected. And that wouldn't have been so bad since the past year of growth at that rate has produced the best 12 months of job increases since 1999. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, had expected a strong number, but not this good. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: Well, it clearly is a very, very strong report on any number of fronts. And perhaps the most cheering news was the fact that wages rose four-tenths of a percent last month, which is some of the strongest we've seen in a while. YDSTIE: Behravesh says the worry has been that while job growth has been solid for the past couple of years, wage growth has barely kept up with inflation. BEHRAVESH: And this is a first early indication that maybe wages are beginning to increase again. Maybe the recovery is finally spreading to wages, as it were. YDSTIE: That's important for the well-being of workers and their families, but also suggests a better economic growth in the future as workers have more to spend. That creates more demand and even more jobs. But Behravesh has this caution. BEHRAVESH: Now, we have to be careful not to jump to conclusions. This is one month. And one month does not a trend make. But still, this is a very good early indicator perhaps of improvement in the wage picture. YDSTIE: The big increase in jobs didn't push the unemployment rate down though. It remained at 5. 8 percent. But Behravesh says there's a good reason for that. BEHRAVESH: More workers are feeling optimistic about job prospects and are coming back into the labor force. That tends to mean that the unemployment rate either stays flat or may actually rise a little bit. But these are for good reasons, which is to say optimism on the part of job seekers about job prospects. YDSTIE: Behravesh says this report will get the Federal Reserve's attention. He says if wage growth continues to be as strong in coming months, we could see a rise in interest rates before next summer. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

That creates more demand and even more jobs. But Behravesh has this caution. BEHRAVESH: Now, we have to be careful not to jump to conclusions. This is one month. And one month does not a trend make. But still, this is a very good early indicator perhaps of improvement in the wage picture. YDSTIE: The big increase in jobs didn't push the unemployment rate down though. It remained at 5. 8 percent. But Behravesh says there's a good reason for that. BEHRAVESH: More workers are feeling optimistic about job prospects and are coming back into the labor force. That tends to mean that the unemployment rate either stays flat or may actually rise a little bit. But these are for good reasons, which is to say optimism on the part of job seekers about job prospects. YDSTIE: Behravesh says this report will get the Federal Reserve's attention. He says if wage growth continues to be as strong in coming months, we could see a rise in interest rates before next summer.

But there is an underground market. Literally, people are living underground. Below the city's bustling streets, bomb shelters and storage basements are turned into apartments. An estimated 1 million of Beijing's residents live underground. Annette Kim, an urbanization researcher at the University of Southern California, spent last year in China's capital city, studying Beijing's underground housing market. ANNETTE KIM: Part of why there's so much underground space is because it's the official building code to continue to build bomb shelters and basements. That's a lot of new underground space that's increasing in supply all the time. They're everywhere. RATH: Kim says apartments go as deep as three stories below ground. Residents have communal bathrooms and shared kitchens, and the tiny, windowless rooms have just enough space to fit a bed. KIM: It's tight. But I also lived in Beijing for a year, and the city, in general, is tight. (Laughter). RATH: Living underground at about 70 bucks a month offers an affordable alternative, but there's a stigma to living in basements and bomb shelters. During her research, Kim interviewed residents above-ground about their neighbors directly below. KIM: They weren't sure who was down there. There is actually very little contact between above-ground and below-ground, and so there's this fear of security. RATH: She says the underground dwellers are mostly young migrants who moved from the countryside looking for work in the big city. KIM: They're all the service people in the city. They're your waitresses, store clerks, interior designers, tech workers who just can't afford a place in the city. RATH: Kim says there's a range of units from the dark and dingy to the neatly decorated. But it's rare to get a glimpse below. Property owners are strict about who they let in. That didn't stop Beijing-based photographer Chi Yin Sim. CHI YIN SIM: I started to try and find ways to get down there because I was fascinated by the fact that there was a universe beneath our feet. RATH: The first basement-dweller she met was a young woman, a pedicurist at a salon who lived with her boyfriend. SIM: I was just like, can I come and visit? And she was like, sure, come and visit us. RATH: In the photo, the couple sits on their bed, surrounded by clothes, boxes and a giant teddy bear - all two floors below a posh Beijing apartment complex. Sim's pictures reveal rooms that look like prison cells, personalized to varying degrees. SIM: The air's not so good. Ventilation is not so good. And the main complaint that people have is not that they can't see the sun. It's that it's very humid in the summer, so everything that they put out in their rooms gets a bit moldy 'cause it's just very damp and dank underground. RATH: Sim says many people simply adapt to the close quarters. SIM: At dinner time, you can hear people cooking. You can hear people chitchatting in the next room. You can hear people watching television. It's really not so bad. I mean, you're spending almost all your day at work anyway. You're coming back, and all you need is a clean and safe place to sleep in. RATH: She also met a number people who were too embarrassed to have their photo taken, especially since one Chinese newspaper referred to Beijing's underground residents as the Rat Tribe. It's especially difficult for the older residents - the ones who have been down there for years, says Annette Kim. KIM: They're hoping that their next generation, their children will be able to live above ground. It's this sense of longing and deferring a dream. And so it makes me wonder how long this dream can be deferred. RATH: Kim says housing laws changed in 2010, and living underground is now illegal. But she says it's still an active market. For hundreds of thousands of people, it's the only viable option for living in or under Beijing. To see more of Chi Yin Sim's amazing photos, check out our website, npr. org.

Prices in many states are almost a full dollar cheaper than last spring, so some politicians think this is a good time to increase gasoline taxes. As NPR's David Schaper reports, leaders in several states are tired of waiting for Congress to fix the federal highway fund to their considering raising gas taxes themselves. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is wearing a lot of hardhats and brightly colored vests these days as he traveled his state, showing off giant potholes, crumbling concrete, rusting structures and buckled pavement. Along the Lodge Freeway in Detroit, it's an aging bridge that's threatening cars and trucks speeding by. GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER: When you see those wood ducts underneath the bridge, they're not there for a good reason. They're there to keep crumbling concrete and stuff from falling on the roadway. SCHAPER: But Snyder needs money to do that work. So he's trying to sell Michigan legislatures, especially those in his own Republican party, on raising the state's motor fuel tax to fund long-neglected infrastructure needs. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)SNYDER: Do you know of anyone that says we have good roads in this state? Nobody. SCHAPER: Snyder is calling on lawmakers to roughly double Michigan's gas tax to raise over a billion dollars. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)SNYDER: The money I'm talking about is to get us to fair to good roads. They're not even going to be great roads, folks. We can't afford to have great roads in this state, given what we need to invest, but we can have good roads. SCHAPER: Snyder is one of a growing number of Republicans across the country who see the need to spend big to improve infrastructure and who are looking to increase gas taxes to pay for it. CARL DAVIS: Ever since last year, there's kind of been a switch that's been flipped. SCHAPER: Carl Davis is a senior analyst with the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. He says, gas tax increases are now on the table in states across the country, from New Jersey to Utah and from South Carolina to South Dakota. DAVIS: There have been overwhelming infrastructure needs for quite a while, and now the gas prices are lower. It's a little bit more politically feasible to talk about raising the gas tax. SCHAPER: And Davis says states are leading the way because the federal highway fund is lacking. DAVIS: The federal gas tax hasn't gone up in over 21 years, and the states don't have the luxury of just sitting around and doing nothing on this issue. They have to find a way to keep their bridges from falling down and keep their roads from developing too many potholes. SCHAPER: With the federal gas tax stuck at 18. 4 cents a gallon and construction costs rising, the highway trust fund nearly went broke last summer before Congress came up with a short-term fix that will only last until May. And while there is some support among a small but growing number of Republicans in Congress for raising the federal gas tax, action appears unlikely before the end of this year. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)SCHAPER: And despite poor road conditions, there is little enthusiasm for a gas tax increase at this filling station in Chicago's south suburbs, where customers are overjoyed by the recent sharp drop in prices to less than 2. 70 a gallon here. CHERYL PRESS: Oh, I love it. I love it. I have extra money to spend. SCHAPER: And Cheryl Press says as she wants to spend her extra cash on Christmas presents, not a higher gas tax. PRESS: I'm opposed to it. SCHAPER: Press doesn't expect gas prices to stay this low for long, and neither does Emmet McClendon of Chicago. EMMET MCCLENDON: And what happens is gas goes up, taxes goes up. SCHAPER: You wouldn't want to see that? MCCLENDON: Oh, absolutely not. SCHAPER: But not everyone is against the idea.

The change involves banks and the trading of derivatives. NPR's John Ydstie joins us in the studio to explain all this. Hi, there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So first of all, remind us what derivatives are. YDSTIE: Well, derivatives are transactions that allow you to bet on the future price of a commodity or the direction of interest rates or the value of other financial instruments. For instance, airlines use derivatives to protect themselves against fluctuations in the price of jet fuel. Banks use the transactions to protect themselves from fluctuations in interest rates. Of course, derivatives also include things like the mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps that brought Wall Street to its knees and fueled the financial crisis. So after the financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank reform bill included provisions that prohibited banks with government backing like FDIC insurance from engaging in transactions involving the riskiest of these derivatives, like credit default swaps, because if things went bad, taxpayers would once again be on the hook to bail them out. CORNISH: So this rollback - this proposed rollback in the legislation we see now - how would it change that? YDSTIE: Well, under Dodd-Frank, those risky transactions were to be pushed out into affiliates of the banks that didn't have any government safety net. The banks hate this provision. They say it's too complex and unworkable, and they've been lobbying to repeal it. And they managed to get language that does that into this bill. CORNISH: And that's led to Sen. Elizabeth Warren being at the forefront of leading opposition to it. Is that right? YDSTIE: Right. She said on the floor of the Senate yesterday that repealing the so-called push-out rule would allow Wall Street to gamble with taxpayers' money once again and, if something went wrong, get bailed out by the government again. But there are some Democrats and prominent reformers, like Federal Reserve Chairman - former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who have actually supported the rollback. CORNISH: So help us understand. I mean, what's the argument made by Volcker and that group? YDSTIE: Well, they agree with the banks that the push-out rule does complicate the regulatory framework. And they say another provision of Dodd-Frank, called the Volcker Rule, largely takes care of the problem. It prohibits banks from using federally insured deposits to make investments for the banks own proprietary accounts. And that would include derivatives like credit default swaps. They also say pushing these transactions out of the banks means they would be less regulated. CORNISH: Meanwhile, they're pairing this with this huge omnibus bill, with the government shutdown threat looming. It seems bound to create a serious pushback, right? YDSTIE: Well, you're right. And actually, former congressman Barney Frank, one of the main authors of Dodd-Frank, made that point. In the past, he supported changing this derivatives rule. But putting an issue as complex as this into a huge spending bill is a huge mistake, he says. He says it would be a frightening president - precedent - and be a roadmap for others who want to repeal financial protections. CORNISH: So let me map out the players here. Democrats negotiated this deal along with Republican congressional leaders and the White House. And the White House has said the president would likely sign it. So we've got Democrats here taking opposite positions on this bill? YDSTIE: Absolutely. What you've got here is a split between centrist Democrats and populists like Sen. Warren. Until very recently, Democratic leaders said that they were comfortable with this deal and that, in fact, they got some additional funding for financial regulators in it. But now it looks like there may not be enough votes to pass it. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thanks so much. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

The vast majority of home loans made today are guaranteed by the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, the regulator in charge of Fannie and Freddie will allow first-time homebuyers to put down as little as 3 percent. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The move is part of an effort by Fannie and Freddie's regulator to make homeownership, once again, more attainable. That regulator is Mel Watt, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MEL WATT: Our objective here has been to normalize the availability of credit for borrowers who have the ability to repay a loan. ARNOLD: That was Watt speaking at a recent Senate hearing. Under this latest move, if you qualify - and let's say you're buying a $200,000 house - you could now put down just $6,000 instead of 10,000. But many conservatives don't like that. EDWARD PINTO: I think it's a bad thing. ARNOLD: Edward Pinto is a director of the American Enterprise Institute's Center on Housing Risk. He says going back to such low down payment loans is risky. He says if you put 3 percent down and house prices start falling even a little bit, you can quickly end up owing more than your house is even worth. PINTO: This was the beginning of the last run that ended poorly with the housing price collapse in 2006, 7. Back in 1994, Fannie announced it would start doing 3 percent down loans. ARNOLD: Now, nobody is saying we're anywhere near returning to the days of wildly reckless lending during the housing bubble. You probably remember those no-document loans or zero-down interest-only loans or there were the loans where, after two years, the payment just completely exploded beyond what the homeowner could possibly afford. These new 3 percent down payment loans are plain-vanilla 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. Still, Pinto says. . . PINTO: Risk is moving up slowly but steadily, and these things take place over a period of many years. And it tends to be like the proverbial frog in the pot of water put on a slow boil. The frog doesn't notice it because it's happening very slowly. That's one of the reasons that we decided to publish the risk index that we published. ARNOLD: But some housing experts say, to extend Pinto's analogy, we're still dealing with a very cold frog. That is, the system is still too risk-averse and it's too hard to get a mortgage. Mike Calhoun is the president of the Center for Responsible Lending. He says just look at the credit scores of people who are actually getting approved for home loans. MIKE CALHOUN: Right now, credit scores for loans that are being approved are at their tightest level ever. ARNOLD: Calhoun says the average American household's credit score is under 700, and the average loan that's getting approved is for someone with a 750 credit score. CALHOUN: That is a big difference. There are estimates that anywhere from half a million to a million households each year who would normally qualify for home mortgages are being cut out of the market today because of this overly-tight credit. ARNOLD: So Calhoun, anyway, sees this latest move to offer 3 percent down payment loans for first-time homebuyers as a step in the right direction. Chris Arnold, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  A new policy goes into effect tomorrow which will make it easier for some Americans to come up with a down payment for a house. The vast majority of home loans made today are guaranteed by the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, the regulator in charge of Fannie and Freddie will allow first-time homebuyers to put down as little as 3 percent. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The move is part of an effort by Fannie and Freddie's regulator to make homeownership, once again, more attainable. That regulator is Mel Watt, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MEL WATT: Our objective here has been to normalize the availability of credit for borrowers who have the ability to repay a loan. ARNOLD: That was Watt speaking at a recent Senate hearing. Under this latest move, if you qualify - and let's say you're buying a $200,000 house - you could now put down just $6,000 instead of 10,000. But many conservatives don't like that. EDWARD PINTO: I think it's a bad thing. ARNOLD: Edward Pinto is a director of the American Enterprise Institute's Center on Housing Risk. He says going back to such low down payment loans is risky. He says if you put 3 percent down and house prices start falling even a little bit, you can quickly end up owing more than your house is even worth. PINTO: This was the beginning of the last run that ended poorly with the housing price collapse in 2006, 7. Back in 1994, Fannie announced it would start doing 3 percent down loans. ARNOLD: Now, nobody is saying we're anywhere near returning to the days of wildly reckless lending during the housing bubble. You probably remember those no-document loans or zero-down interest-only loans or there were the loans where, after two years, the payment just completely exploded beyond what the homeowner could possibly afford. These new 3 percent down payment loans are plain-vanilla 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. Still, Pinto says. . . PINTO: Risk is moving up slowly but steadily, and these things take place over a period of many years. And it tends to be like the proverbial frog in the pot of water put on a slow boil. The frog doesn't notice it because it's happening very slowly. That's one of the reasons that we decided to publish the risk index that we published. ARNOLD: But some housing experts say, to extend Pinto's analogy, we're still dealing with a very cold frog. That is, the system is still too risk-averse and it's too hard to get a mortgage. Mike Calhoun is the president of the Center for Responsible Lending. He says just look at the credit scores of people who are actually getting approved for home loans. MIKE CALHOUN: Right now, credit scores for loans that are being approved are at their tightest level ever. ARNOLD: Calhoun says the average American household's credit score is under 700, and the average loan that's getting approved is for someone with a 750 credit score. CALHOUN: That is a big difference. There are estimates that anywhere from half a million to a million households each year who would normally qualify for home mortgages are being cut out of the market today because of this overly-tight credit. ARNOLD: So Calhoun, anyway, sees this latest move to offer 3 percent down payment loans for first-time homebuyers as a step in the right direction.

I'm David Greene. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne with an update now on a topic we began looking at two years ago - America's modern families. This morning, families that don't seem so modern. Here's Steve Inskeep. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: More people have extended family members in the house, especially grandparents, putting three generations under one roof in a seemingly old style. NPR's Jennifer Ludden starts us off with some numbers here. Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So what's going on? LUDDEN: So we're talking about, you know, increasingly complicated family structures in this country but the Census Bureau asks the simple question - in which households are there grandparents and grandchildren? And that number has really gone up sharply by about a third in really just the past generation. I spoke with Gretchen Livingston who studies these families with the Pew Research Center. GRETCHEN LIVINGSTON: For a while there, the numbers were going up somewhat, but then once the recession occurred, we actually saw a real uptick in the number of kids living with their grandparents. And now the numbers are close to 8 million. To put that in perspective, that means about 1 in 10 kids are living with a grandparent. INSKEEP: Eight million. So grandma comes to live with the family here? LUDDEN: She does. You know, Steve, sometimes grandma is the family. People come to live at her house, and a lot of times, in a about a third of these cases, there is no parent present. In fact, these so-called grandfamilies have become so common in America, you now see public housing complexes designed with this in mind. So you've got the wide walkways, everything on one floor and the guardrails, and then outside the window, you've got the playground for the children. INSKEEP: Wow, and this cannot be easy for everybody who ends up doing it. LUDDEN: It's not. It's not. I spoke with Donna Butts who is with Generations United, which advocates for these kinds of families. And she says while many love the situation, there can definitely be some challenges for the older generation. DONNA BUTTS: They usually aren't expecting to be taking care of the children. So they're not prepared financially. Their home may be great for a retired person or a retired couple but not for little toddlers. Many of the grandparents, about 58 percent, are still working. So trying to juggle taking care of a child. LUDDEN: And so you can see the same dynamic that we have working parents, working grandparents - all the more difficult. But Butts says there's also a cultural dynamic here where even if some people don't have to do this for economic or other reasons, you see families who really want to do this and Hispanic and Asian families especially. They are twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to live with multiple generations in one house. INSKEEP: So let's meet some people who do this. Diana Limongi Gabriele is in our studios in New York. Welcome to the program. DIANA LIMONGI GABRIELE: Hi, good morning. Thank you for having us. INSKEEP: And you notice she said thank you for having us. That's because she's brought along her father, Lizandro Limongi. Welcome to you, sir. LIZANDRO LIMONGI: Thank you, sir. INSKEEP: She lives with her father. She's also a mom with kids. And as I understand it, you bought a house together that is divided into two apartments. So you've got two couples in the same house. How do you have it set up? GABRIELE: So it is really two separate apartments. However, you know, we have a basement that we share, we have a backyard. And honestly, my parents' door is always open, so my son goes up and down whenever he kind of wants to say, hello, grandma and grandpa. INSKEEP: Oh, OK. How old is your son? GABRIELE: He's 3-and-a-half. INSKEEP: Oh, that's great. Now whose idea was it to buy house together? GABRIELE: I think it was both of us? I don't think one of us wanted it more than the other. Our parents couldn't buy a house alone where we wanted to live. We couldn't buy a house alone where we wanted to live. So it kind of made sense financially for both of us. LUDDEN: So, Mr. Limongi, can I ask you, what did you think when this idea came up? LIMONGI: I thought it was very good idea because, you know, I can't do it alone. LUDDEN: You could not do it alone? You could not afford a house. This is your first house, is that correct? LIMONGI: Yes, it is. INSKEEP: How long have you been in the United States? LIMONGI: Thirty - 39 years. INSKEEP: And I believe you came from Ecuador, is that right? LIMONGI: Yes. INSKEEP: So more than 30 years in the United States, finally an opportunity to buy a home, and it's the home with your daughter and your son-in-law and your grandson. What's that like for you? LIMONGI: I love it. GABRIELE: He really does. He's not just saying that. (LAUGHTER)GABRIELE: You know, he - parents kind of - you see a whole side of them when a grandchild comes into the picture. And for me, especially, it's really important because of the language and the culture that come along with that. I speak to my son in Spanish, so having my parents so close by allows him to really practice his language skills every day. It's really priceless. LUDDEN: Diana, you've written about this, and you did talk about how as wonderful as it is, sometimes you guys can get on each other's nerves and I guess that parent-child relationship never really quite goes away. GABRIELE: It never goes away and there's an added layer when, you know, the child has a child because the grandparents, of course, want to have an input. INSKEEP: Oh, and then your parenting is being called into question. GABRIELE: Yes. There are days when you just kind of retreat to your own space and, like, OK, you know, thank you for your comments. I'm going to leave now. INSKEEP: Mr. Limongi, do you get babysitting duty? LIMONGI: Yes. Yes, I love it. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah? GABRIELE: Yeah, he lets him eat chocolates and do whatever he wants. (LAUGHTER)INSKEEP: Not that anybody's upset about that. GABRIELE: It's very funny actually. LUDDEN: So, Diana, what's it like for your husband? GABRIELE: He and my father have a really good relationship. You know, my husband is from France, so they enjoy the same sports. They watch soccer together, so they get along. INSKEEP: Is this a very natural experience for you because of the country from which you came? LIMONGI: Yes, it is. You know, in Ecuador, the people live not too far, you know? I can see your parents every day. GABRIELE: Yeah, I don't think that there are many three-generational houses in Ecuador from what I've seen 'cause I have lived there before, but the idea of family is different. So even if the kids live separately, I think it's very important for the kids to have that contact. INSKEEP: Now, you mentioned that you are doing this in part for financial reasons. You live in New York City. Real estate is very expensive. It would've been difficult for either couple to buy a house alone. If you could have afforded separate houses, would you live together anyway? GABRIELE: I personally think maybe, yeah. And the reason I say this because before we didn't live together, we saw each other a lot. And then what's happening now is that, you know, my parents are getting older. They're going to retire one day. So I wouldn't want them to be far away. INSKEEP: Mr. Limongi, how about you? LIMONGI: Same thing. You know, I love my daughter. I can't live, you know, too far. INSKEEP: You can't live too far away. LIMONGI: Yes. INSKEEP: Well, Diana Limongi Gabriele and Lizandro Limongi, thanks to both of you. GABRIELE: Thank you. LIMONGI: Thank you.

The currency has plummeted nearly 25 percent against the dollar over the last four trading days, and over the past year it's down more than 50 percent. Today the Russian Central Bank took action. It boosted its benchmark interest rate to 17 percent to stem the tide. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, the ruble's collapse will make it much more difficult for Vladimir Putin to ignore Western sanctions. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The Russian Central Bank raised its key interest rate from 10. 5 percent to 17 percent, but that didn't seem to help much. The ruble fell even further after the rate hike. It finally recovered a bit, but Anders Aslund, an economist and Russian expert, says the situation hasn't stabilized. He says nobody wants to own rubles now because the Russian economy is in a terrible state. ANDERS ASLUND: Nobody wants to put money into Russia and that means that there is a one-way street now for money out of Russia. And the Central Bank can't really change that. YDSTIE: International companies, Russian companies, investors and individual Russians are selling rubles for dollars and euros to avoid further losses. Aslund, who's a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Russian companies who've borrowed from Western banks are especially panicked because they need to pay off debts denominated in euros and dollars. ASLUND: And therefore they are paying off these debts as fast as they can, but of course many of them will be caught in a trap and go bankrupt. YDSTIE: A near 50 percent fall in the price of oil since June is a big reason for Russia's economic mess. It's Central Bank warned this week that with the global oil price at $60 a barrel - where it closed today - the Russian economy would end up in a deep recession, contracting by 4. 5 percent next year. Oil accounts for two-thirds of Russia's exports and it supplies about half the government's revenue. Aslund also says the sanctions put on Russia in July for its military action in Crimea and Ukraine are hurting the country's economy very significantly. ASLUND: Only now in December, the financial markets had started realizing how severe these financial sanctions really are. YDSTIE: The only reasonable strategy to stabilize the Russian economy, says Aslund, is for Russian President Vladimir Putin to get out from under the sanctions imposed by the U. S. and its allies. ASLUND: And in order to do so, he needs to satisfy the United States and the European Union by withdrawing Russian troops from Eastern Ukraine. There's no other good solution for Mr. Putin. YDSTIE: The White House reiterated that position today and the president's top economist also said the ruble's big decline would have very little impact on the U. S. Economist Blu Putnam agrees. BLU PUTNAM: We won't even know the ruble collapsed. YDSTIE: Putnam is managing director and chief economist at the CME Group. It operates options and futures exchanges that deal in oil, foreign currencies and many other products. PUTNAM: You'll see some stories about company A or company B, but the impact on the economy? You're not going to find it. YDSTIE: That's because U. S. exports to Russia account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the U. S. economy. Putnam says the ruble's decline won't affect the deliberations of Federal Reserve officials, who are meeting today and tomorrow to discuss interest rates.

That's the growing number of manufacturing jobs that are returning to the U. S. It seems to go against the trend over the past few decades of moving operations overseas or offshore to cut costs. Now, a study released yesterday takes a closer look at a reshoring. NPR's Jim Zarroli has this report. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The authors of the report say they were intrigued by the large number of recent media stories suggesting a small stampede back to the United States by manufacturers. Much of the evidence seemed anecdotal, so they began tallying up the number of reshoring cases they found. They discovered that the number was small but rising. There were just 64 reshoring cases in 2011. This year, there will be around 300, with electronics and transportation companies leading the way. Patrick Van den Bossche is a partner at A. T. Kearney. PATRICK VAN DEN BOSSCHE: We saw that the number of cases was definitely growing. And so that begs the other question which is, well, what's the economic impact of that? ZARROLI: And Van den Bossche says the impact is less significant than it appears. He says the uptick in reshoring cases needs to be put in context. VAN DEN BOSSCHE: Basically what you see is you see more manufacturing activity within the U. S. But relatively speaking, you're actually seeing even more in Asia for product coming to the U. S. ZARROLI: And that means the U. S. trade deficit with the rest of the world is still huge. Van den Bossche says that energy costs are falling in the United States because of the shale oil boom. And wages are rising in China. So more companies have good reason to think about moving back home. But the number who have actually done so is still small and has had a negligible impact on the economy. VAN DEN BOSSCHE: There's a trend here that says that, yes, we are starting to manufacture more. We are getting more and more competitive. But it's not quite yet showing in the economic data. ZARROLI: None of that is exactly news to Harry Moser, founder and president of the Reshoring Initiative, which helps manufacturers relocate in the United States. Moser has been a big promoter of the reshoring trend, but he says the phenomenon and can be overstated. HARRY MOSER: No one claims - at least we don't claim - that you're going to see a million new jobs from reshoring next year. That would be totally irrational, irresponsible. And we don't have the skilled workers to do it. ZARROLI: But Moser says things are changing. He says the movement of U. S. manufacturers to China and India and other low-wage countries was a long, drawn-out process. And reshoring will be, too. MOSER: So it's taken 60 years for that to happen. And it's going to take decades for its reverse - for our trade deficit to be eliminated, for reshoring and foreign direct investment to bring many of those jobs back. ZARROLI: The important thing, he says, is that the incentives to move overseas are growing less attractive. And more companies are at least thinking about manufacturing domestically. That's something they weren't doing a few years ago. And Moser believes the trend will continue even if, as this report suggests, it's taking a while to build up steam. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Here's an expression that's caught on of late - reshoring. That's the growing number of manufacturing jobs that are returning to the U. S. It seems to go against the trend over the past few decades of moving operations overseas or offshore to cut costs. Now, a study released yesterday takes a closer look at a reshoring. NPR's Jim Zarroli has this report. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The authors of the report say they were intrigued by the large number of recent media stories suggesting a small stampede back to the United States by manufacturers. Much of the evidence seemed anecdotal, so they began tallying up the number of reshoring cases they found. They discovered that the number was small but rising. There were just 64 reshoring cases in 2011. This year, there will be around 300, with electronics and transportation companies leading the way. Patrick Van den Bossche is a partner at A. T. Kearney. PATRICK VAN DEN BOSSCHE: We saw that the number of cases was definitely growing. And so that begs the other question which is, well, what's the economic impact of that? ZARROLI: And Van den Bossche says the impact is less significant than it appears. He says the uptick in reshoring cases needs to be put in context. VAN DEN BOSSCHE: Basically what you see is you see more manufacturing activity within the U. S. But relatively speaking, you're actually seeing even more in Asia for product coming to the U. S. ZARROLI: And that means the U. S. trade deficit with the rest of the world is still huge. Van den Bossche says that energy costs are falling in the United States because of the shale oil boom. And wages are rising in China. So more companies have good reason to think about moving back home. But the number who have actually done so is still small and has had a negligible impact on the economy. VAN DEN BOSSCHE: There's a trend here that says that, yes, we are starting to manufacture more. We are getting more and more competitive. But it's not quite yet showing in the economic data. ZARROLI: None of that is exactly news to Harry Moser, founder and president of the Reshoring Initiative, which helps manufacturers relocate in the United States. Moser has been a big promoter of the reshoring trend, but he says the phenomenon and can be overstated. HARRY MOSER: No one claims - at least we don't claim - that you're going to see a million new jobs from reshoring next year. That would be totally irrational, irresponsible. And we don't have the skilled workers to do it. ZARROLI: But Moser says things are changing. He says the movement of U. S. manufacturers to China and India and other low-wage countries was a long, drawn-out process. And reshoring will be, too. MOSER: So it's taken 60 years for that to happen. And it's going to take decades for its reverse - for our trade deficit to be eliminated, for reshoring and foreign direct investment to bring many of those jobs back. ZARROLI: The important thing, he says, is that the incentives to move overseas are growing less attractive. And more companies are at least thinking about manufacturing domestically.

The price of oil is plunging and with it Russia's ruble, which could collapse. That is already sending financial markets into turmoil in other parts of the world - all this while the U. S. economy continues to recover. U. S. Federal Reserve officials wrap up a meeting today in Washington D. C. And to find out what they're likely to do and say in the face of these and other challenges, we turn - as we often do - to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. Good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: What are you expecting from the Fed today? WESSEL: Well, the Fed isn't going to do anything today. It's ended its aggressive bond buying - what's called quantitative easing. It's going to continue to hold short-term interest rates near zero where they've been for six years now. The big question is what the Fed is going to say at its end-of-meeting statement and what Janet Yellen, the chair, will say in her press conference this afternoon. Now, the Fed has been promising to keep interest rates at zero for (quote), \"a considerable time. \" But it's widely expected today to drop that phrase, a signal that it's inching towards the day when it'll begin raising interest rates, a move markets now expect to come sometime in the middle of 2015. MONTAGNE: So dropping the phrase a considerable time, meaning - small words, but a few words for the Federal Reserve can mean a lot. How much difference would it make in any event, as you predict, that they keep interest rates unchanged? WESSEL: Well, it'll make a big difference that they change their language. Because financial markets, stocks, long-term bonds, currencies all move on expectations of what the Fed's going to do in the future as investors and traders place their bets. So dropping that phrase and replacing it with some other will be seen as confirming expectations that the Fed anticipates the U. S. economy will be strong enough next year to handle a gradual increase in interest rates. Now, there's a chance the Fed will hold off on the wording change because there's so much trouble outside the United States. But because markets and investors around the world have become so accustomed to very low interest rates, the Fed knows that its first rate increase is likely to be - well, shall we say - unsettling. So it wants to be sure it's warned loudly and repeatedly that rates are going to rise before it actually does so. And that's why the wording is so important. MONTAGNE: How confident are Fed officials that the U. S. economy is going to be healthy enough to raise rates? WESSEL: Well, although the U. S. economy has not fully recovered from this devastating recession, it is clearly getting better. Some Fed officials are itching to raise rates soon. Now that the unemployment rate has come down, they no longer see the need for this really extraordinary monetary medicine. But others argue for waiting until the economy and the job market can recover more fully, especially since there's so few signs that inflation is rising. Now, I'd say until a few weeks ago, the bulk of Fed officials were pretty confident that by the second or third quarter of next year, they'd be ready to raise rates. But as you point out, the past several days have clouded the picture considerably. Falling oil prices are very good for the U. S. economy overall, but it's been so sharp it's producing some anxiety that maybe it's a signal that the rest of the world is really a lot sicker than we thought and that could spill over here. So I think the Fed will choose its words very carefully today to preserve some maneuvering room on the timing of that next raise increase. MONTAGNE: And David, you mentioned that there are a few signs of inflation out there. Is that a reason the Fed would hold on - rather hold off on raising rates? WESSEL: It could be. Inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target. All around the world, there's less inflation than the Fed or the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan would like. In fact, the world's a little too close to deflation or falling prices for their taste. And falling aisle prices, while largely good, could unsettle consumers and investors and raised doubts about whether the central banks are really going to be able to get inflation back up to their 2 percent target. So I think that's just one of the issues that's likely to come up in Janet Yellen's press conference this afternoon, where she has a chance to really explain what they're thinking.

Its neighbor Pennsylvania is in the middle of a fracking boom. Marie Cusick of member station WITF in Harrisburg explains why industry and environmental groups think New York's good for PA. MARIE CUSICK, BYLINE: Six years ago New York placed a temporary moratorium on fracking in order to study the gas drilling technique. Now the state's banning it altogether. Officials there question its economic benefits and cite environmental risks. The state's acting health commissioner, Howard Zucker, claims there isn't enough research into potential health threats. HOWARD ZUCKER: There are many red flags because scientific issues have not yet been comprehensively studied through rigorous scientific research at this time. CUSICK: So New York obviously won't see drill rigs anytime soon, but just across the border, things couldn't be more different. The rural northeastern corner of Pennsylvania is home to some of the most productive wells. Many of them are operated by Houston-based Cabot Oil and Gas. As company spokesman George Stark looks out over the heavy machinery on a fracking site surrounded by rolling hills and farms, he says New Yorkers who fear the process just don't understand it. GEORGE STARK: Our industry, this entire episode, is saving many farms. So the farmers that I've been in contact with endorse and embrace hydraulic fracturing. CUSICK: Pennsylvania's now dotted with more than 7,000 active wells. Christopher Robart is an analyst with IHS Energy and says New York's ban will have little to no impact on drillers already at work in nearby states. CHRISTOPHER ROBART: They can do things much more economically and efficiently in those parts where there already is money and already are investments in the ground, than in New York, for instance, where they'd have to start from scratch. CUSICK: Industry groups say they felt like New York has had an unwelcome mat out for years. Stephanie Catarino Wissman heads Pennsylvania's division of the American Petroleum Institute. She feels like New York's loss is Pennsylvania's gain. STEPHANIE CATARINO WISSMAN: I mean I would say to New Yorkers, you know, come to Pennsylvania and take advantage of these jobs that are available with this well-paying industry. CUSICK: Meanwhile, environmental groups in Pennsylvania cheered the decision. Joanne Kilgour heads the state's Sierra Club chapter. JOANNE KILGOUR: It's a great day for the people in the shale fields whose experience has been repeatedly denied by the industry. CUSICK: Those experiences include things like tainted water supplies, unhealthy air emissions and the industrialization of rural landscapes. Despite New York's decision, both sides of the drilling debate are worried about what's next for Pennsylvania. The state's newly-elected Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, made his central campaign pledge about levying a new tax on the gas industry. But Kilgour and other environmentalists worry that could make the state even more reliant on fracking. KILGOUR: What we want to make sure that we don't do is continue to rely on these boom-bust, single-source economies that are inherent to the extraction of fossil fuels. CUSICK: The industry has lobbied heavily against the tax, calling it a job killer. Wolf opposes a ban on fracking, but wants to strengthen regulations and he plans to create a new registry for public health complaints. GOVERNOR TOM WOLF: I think that this could be a really great thing for Pennsylvania's economy. It could create great jobs. So I want to have my cake and eat it too. I don't want to do what New York did. CUSICK: When he takes office next month, Wolf will face a $2 billion budget shortfall and he's counting on Pennsylvania's gas to help solve the state's fiscal woes. For NPR News I'm Marie Cusick.

Christopher Robart is an analyst with IHS Energy and says New York's ban will have little to no impact on drillers already at work in nearby states. CHRISTOPHER ROBART: They can do things much more economically and efficiently in those parts where there already is money and already are investments in the ground, than in New York, for instance, where they'd have to start from scratch. CUSICK: Industry groups say they felt like New York has had an unwelcome mat out for years. Stephanie Catarino Wissman heads Pennsylvania's division of the American Petroleum Institute. She feels like New York's loss is Pennsylvania's gain. STEPHANIE CATARINO WISSMAN: I mean I would say to New Yorkers, you know, come to Pennsylvania and take advantage of these jobs that are available with this well-paying industry. CUSICK: Meanwhile, environmental groups in Pennsylvania cheered the decision. Joanne Kilgour heads the state's Sierra Club chapter. JOANNE KILGOUR: It's a great day for the people in the shale fields whose experience has been repeatedly denied by the industry. CUSICK: Those experiences include things like tainted water supplies, unhealthy air emissions and the industrialization of rural landscapes. Despite New York's decision, both sides of the drilling debate are worried about what's next for Pennsylvania. The state's newly-elected Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, made his central campaign pledge about levying a new tax on the gas industry. But Kilgour and other environmentalists worry that could make the state even more reliant on fracking. KILGOUR: What we want to make sure that we don't do is continue to rely on these boom-bust, single-source economies that are inherent to the extraction of fossil fuels. CUSICK: The industry has lobbied heavily against the tax, calling it a job killer. Wolf opposes a ban on fracking, but wants to strengthen regulations and he plans to create a new registry for public health complaints. GOVERNOR TOM WOLF: I think that this could be a really great thing for Pennsylvania's economy. It could create great jobs. So I want to have my cake and eat it too. I don't want to do what New York did. CUSICK: When he takes office next month, Wolf will face a $2 billion budget shortfall and he's counting on Pennsylvania's gas to help solve the state's fiscal woes. For NPR News I'm Marie Cusick.

Today, wages for manufacturing jobs are plummeting. And, as Michigan Radio's Tracy Samilton reports, some states wonder if fighting for those jobs is still worth it. TRACY SAMILTON, BYLINE: Cynthia Hunter is a 58-year-old dynamo - some would say a workaholic. Hunter retired from a first career in her early fifties, became a manager at Exxon Mobil, then took a buyout when the company sold its gas stations. CYNTHIA HUNTER: I was scared to say out of the marketplace. I mean, I had worked all these years and I never in my life collected unemployment, ever. SAMILTON: So in 2012, Hunter took a $9 an hour job at Case Logistics in Detroit. The low pay was a shock, but at least she doesn't have children to feed and clothe. HUNTER: Everyone there at this plant - everyone - has, like, a second job - something else that do. SAMILTON: Catherine Ruckelshaus, with the National Employment Law Project, says $9 an hour is all too common these days. CATHERINE RUCKELSHAUS: Some good jobs do remain, but too many of them resemble positions at Walmart or McDonald's. SAMILTON: Here's the good news. Three-hundred-fifty-thousand auto manufacturing jobs came back after the recession. Here's the bad - many pay much less now. Real wages for auto supplier jobs fell 14 percent since 2003, even as the average for all jobs fell only one-and-a-half percent. RUCKELSHAUS: The companies simply aren't feeling any pressure from anywhere to do right by their workers. SAMILTON: Ruckelshaus wonders why states still dangle huge incentives before manufacturers. Nissan got 1. 3 billion dollars from Mississippi for a new factory, plus a 25 year tax break, all for jobs that pay $12 an hour. Now, many people would say, better a low-paying job than no job. But some states are starting to demand a bigger bang for their buck. For instance, Michigan now puts cash on the table, but no tax breaks. Mike Finney is head of its Economic Development Corporation. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: We incorrectly say that Nissan received $1. 3 billion, plus a 25-year tax break,  from the state of Mississippi to build a factory. In fact, the $1. 3 billion figure includes the value of the tax break. ]MIKE FINNEY: We don't give them the money in advance where it's all spent. We give it to them as they meet the commitments that they've made. SAMILTON: And Finney says Michigan only chases jobs with above-average pay. Still, there's nothing states can do about NAFTA and Mexico. Mexican autoworkers earn between $2. 50 and $5 an hour. Sean McAlinden, an economist with the Center for Automotive Research, says southern states tried to compete both with the Midwest and Mexico. SEAN MCALINDEN: The Southerners, you could say, got the work based on cheaper wages than the old upper-Midwest. And now, if you live by the cheap wage, you die by it. SAMILTON: But he says forcing manufacturers to pay more would likely accelerate the loss of jobs to Mexico, for jobs that can still be shipped away. But some can't, like Cynthia Hunter's job, inspecting and placing parts in sequence for the assembly plant next door. Hunter got fed up with the low pay and decided to organize her plant this summer. HUNTER: People were scared and, I mean, don't get me wrong, I couldn't lose my job at the time, but I just wasn't scared. I knew that there was something better out there. SAMILTON: Workers at Case signed their first union contract four weeks ago, and got a $2 an hour raise. Meanwhile, there's another free-trade agreement looming - the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal with Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan and seven other countries. There's concern it could put more downward pressure on U. S. wages. That's sparking opposition to the deal, especially from members of Congress who represent states with a heavy reliance on manufacturing jobs. For NPR News, I'm Tracy Samilton.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Another way to look at this - the U. S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a decade. This made for a very chipper day on Wall Street. For the first time, the Dow closed above 18,000. SIEGEL: NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports the economy is expected to have a cheery New Year, as well. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: GDP includes everything from government and consumer spending, to how much businesses spend to restock shelves. It accounts for imported and exported goods. Most of the recent economic data have been good. And for Gus Faucher, that signals party time. GUS FAUCHER: You know, we get all this data, it's like Christmas to me, so. . . NOGUCHI: Really? Is that what you asked Santa for this year? FAUCHER: Yes (Laughter). NOGUCHI: Faucher is senior economist at PNC Financial. He says the economy is finally firing on all cylinders. Other economic reports today indicate wages are up, consumers are spending more and business investment increased. And greater spending translates into more jobs and bigger corporate profits. But if you look at GDP over the course of the year, it's been inconsistent. In fact, if you were to chart it, it might look roughly like Santa's pointy hat. It started off in negative territory with a peak in the middle of the year and is expected to fall off from that high toward the end of the year. But Faucher says even with economies in Asia and Europe slowing down, things for the U. S. are looking good heading into next year. FAUCHER: Even if gasoline prices weren't falling, the U. S. economy would still be in pretty good shape simply because we're seeing strong job growth, businesses are in good shape. So I think the fundamental underpinnings are pretty good. But the lower gasoline prices are providing a little bit extra boost. NOGUCHI: But there are other factors offsetting some of that advantage. Doug Handler is chief U. S. economist for IHS Global Insight. DOUG HANDLER: The fourth quarter is really not going to be quite as good as the booming quarters of the second and the third. NOGUCHI: For one thing, he says, defense spending surged during the third quarter, and that spending will go away. Also. . . HANDLER: Third quarter was a great quarter for exports. And given a lot of weakness that we're seeing in a lot of economies with a lot of our trading partners here, we don't see that sort of growth really carrying forward either. NOGUCHI: Still, Handler says he expects growth will both be more consistent and higher on average next year. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

So there is some amount of relief seeing the positive economic news as 2014 draws to a close. The latest government data says the U. S. economy grew at an impressive 5 percent rate in the third quarter. The best quarter in more than a decade. The stock market hit a record yesterday again. The unemployment rate has been below 6 percent for three months now. Let's talk about how cautious we might need to be with our optimism with David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, a contributing correspondent for the Wall Street Journal and also a frequent guest on this program. David, welcome back to the program, hope you're well. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So how excited can we be about this economic news we're seeing right now? WESSEL: Well, it looks like a pretty good picture. After a lousy first quarter, the economy grew at a healthy pace in both the second and third quarters. The job market isn't completely back to normal, but we added 2. 7 million jobs in the past year. There isn't much inflation. Oil prices are surprising us, falling, giving consumers more money to spend. The federal deficit is shrinking. Local state and federal governments have ended a long period of belt-tightening. The stock market is up more than 10 percent over the past year. So it is looking pretty good. But there are some clouds. GREENE: OK. WESSEL: Mortgage rates are low, housing isn't so good. Factories aren't seeing many orders and - but economists still expect the economy to grow about 3 percent in 2015. That's a bit faster than it did this year. GREENE: Well, what is the key as we look to next year to really build on the momentum and get this economy really cranking up? WESSEL: Well, I think domestically, it's whether the improvements we've seen so far can build confidence among consumers and businesses that lead them to spend more readily and at lead businesses to hire and invest more than they have been. We really need to avoid something like a congressional game of chicken over the budget or another threat of war because the private-sector economy really does seem poised for steady improvement, perhaps better than it did over the past year. GREENE: And I guess it's not just what happens in this country, I mean, economic indicators around the world can also have a huge impact on the U. S. economy. WESSEL: Absolutely. I mean, oil and gas prices are the biggest factor. If they stay at today's level, that's a huge plus. If they rise, it's a minus of course. But there's also a lot of worry about the health of the rest of the world - Europe, Japan, China's slowing, so is Brazil. And the possibility that we'll have some geopolitical tension - North Korea, Russian, Middle East. So I think the biggest risk to U. S. growth are outside the country. And this divergence of fortune between the U. S. and the rest of the world raises the risk of some unanticipated instability in financial markets. It could spill over to the rest of the world economy. GREENE: I mean, as families are sitting down and celebrating the holidays, David, and going shopping and doing things like that, I mean, are American families beginning to feel better - you know, their budgets and sort of their pocketbooks - are they feeling a better economy right now? WESSEL: Well, feeling is an interesting word. I mean, the measures of consumer confidence are improving that always happens when gas prices go down. I think the picture is this - the economy's been growing for five years now, factories are finally producing more than they did before the recession. A greater percentage of American adults are working than at any time in the past five years, but the incomes and wages of ordinary Americans are still sagging. A disproportionate share of the good news over the past five years has gone to the best off, the already wealthy - lawyers, doctors, executives, investment bankers. And the really big question for 2015 is whether the combination of a shrinking pool of jobless people or underemployed workers and the growing demand for labor will be enough to overcome all the pressures of globalization and technological change and finally produce rising wages for the middle class. That's really the big question and the big hope for 2015. GREENE: All right, getting a picture of the economy as this year draws to a close with David Wessel.

The Commerce Department says the U. S. economy is growing at its fastest pace in 11 years. Consumer spending is up. And, of course, gas prices are way down. As NPR's Chris Arnold reports, in 2015, cheaper gas could be the thing that finally kicks the economic recovery into a higher gear. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: For most Americans, wages have been stagnant since before the financial crisis. But for many, especially if they drive a lot, right now they're getting in effect a pay raise in the form of cheaper gas. In fact, if prices stay where they are right now, around $2. 40 a gallon, that would mean an extra $1,500 per household next year. Based on median household income, that's a 3 percent raise for the entire country. BOB COSTELLO: Oh yeah, it's a game changer. And it's going to really help us go into 2015. ARNOLD: That's Bob Costello. He's the chief economist of the American Trucking Associations. So he pays close attention to fuel prices and what they mean for the economy. COSTELLO: This is the shot in the arm that could get us finally going on a more consistent basis. ARNOLD: Costello's talking about the overall economy. But he says if you zoom in on the trucking industry, you see some especially good things happening. COSTELLO: This is an industry that consumes almost 38 billion gallons of diesel every year. ARNOLD: And with diesel prices down nearly a dollar a gallon, you don't have to be an economist to figure out that trucking companies are already saving together billions of dollars on fuel. And that can create what's called a virtuous cycle, where that savings or extra money gets put back into the economy, boosting it in other ways. COSTELLO: I talk to trucking companies every week that say, you know, we went out and bought ten new trucks in the last month. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK ENGINE REVVING)ARNOLD: That's the sound of a truck at Dark Horse Express, which is a small trucking company outside of Nashville, Tennessee. Jeff Hickman's the owner. He's got 15 trucks on the road, which means compared to last year, he is saving a lot of money on fuel. JEFF HICKMAN: It's anywhere from $5,000 to $6,000 a week. For a company our size, it's - it's huge. ARNOLD: Hickman says many trucking companies are hauling more stuff this year too. He specializes in frozen food, so he's got some truckloads of turkeys headed to grocery stores, some frozen pizzas. HICKMAN: Everybody is busy. I don't know anybody that has trucks sitting because there's not freight for them to move. ARNOLD: And Hickman says that means that he's been using some of that savings on fuel to pay higher wages to his truck drivers because there's more competition to get good drivers and to keep them. HICKMAN: We are paying our drivers almost 10 percent more over last year's wages. ARNOLD: Other workers in other industries should be so lucky. Overall, there's been very little growth in wages, though one recent report showed that maybe they're finally starting to rise. But either way, cheaper gas is putting money into people's pockets. Over in Idaho Falls, Idaho, 23-year-old Lacey Bennion says gas is just $2. 29 a gallon. LACEY BENNION: It's been a huge blessing for me and for my family. And my husband and I  are newlyweds. We haven't been married for quite a year yet. He's still a student, and I'm working full-time. ARNOLD: Bennion says she's driving an old Dodge Stratus with 200,000 miles on it, which, of course, doesn't get the best gas mileage. So with the extra money, she says, she and her husband actually felt better about buying a few more presents this year, including some stuff for their kitchen. BENNION: It feels good to buy something new that we've needed for a long time because you feel that much better 'cause you really needed that thing. ARNOLD: And heading into the new year, the economy is continuing to gain jobs and grow more quickly. Wages, as we said, may even be starting to rise a bit. So add in the cheaper gas and things are looking better than they have in a long time. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

The lower price of fuel is a big reason for that. Another reason, with the economy recovering, more people are getting on planes and flying, both for business and pleasure. So good year for the airlines, but as anyone traveling for the holidays this week will tell you, they are not passing their savings on to passengers. Here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: With many of us now taking off on a holiday break and the end of the year upon us, it's a good time to give out end-of-the-year grades. I recently asked frequent flyers going through Chicago's O'Hare airport what grade they'd give their airlines. TANYA LAWSON: Well, I'd probably give them a B. SCHAPER: Tanya Lawson is an attorney on her way home to Miami and says she doesn't have too many complaints. Lawson gives the airlines high marks for being on time for the most part. But she's not happy with everything. LAWSON: I think comfort has gone out the window completely. Another airline I traveled on recently, my knees were too long, and I was in pain literally for the entire fight. And I'm only 5' 8\". SIDNEY MORAGNE: I'd give them a C. SCHAPER: Sidney Moragne is a psychiatrist from Jackson, Tennessee. MORAGNE: I'd give them a C. When it's bad, it's pretty bad. But a lot of times it's efficient. The planes are always pretty full now. That's one thing. You're packed in there pretty tight. SCHAPER: And both Moragne and Lawson and others say they're tired of airlines charging for everything from extra baggage to extra legroom. As for the base fares, though, many travelers say they aren't too terribly high if you buy far enough in advance. But Moragne notices that while the price of fuel plummets, airfares are still up. MORAGNE: They're not coming down, relatively speaking, the way gas has come down. SCHAPER: Do you think they should? Or do you. . . MORAGNE: Sure, they should. Yeah, they should. They're making profits. SCHAPER: That's true. The International Air Transport Association estimates the world's airlines will rake in nearly $20 billion in profits this year. And the group expects that figure to soar to a record $25 billion next year. And with fuel making up close to half of the airlines' expenses, they are saving money. But the airlines say it's not as much you'd think. And the fuel price plunge comes after near record high prices. John Heimlich, chief economist for the industry group Airlines for America, says airlines are using their windfalls now to pay down debt, to give investors dividends for the first time in decades and to improve the flying product. JOHN HEIMLICH: So we continue to see new aircraft coming into the system, facilities improving, a more stable, better-trained workforce in flight, you know, tablets, proliferation of Wi-Fi. And now you're seeing it in more international markets. SCHAPER: But at least some of those amenities won't be free to all passengers. Airlines have begun offering far fewer cheap seats. And they're separating passengers into more classes, with each level you go up in price coming with a few more perks and comforts. GEORGE HAMLIN: Bells and whistles are being added if you are paying premium prices. SCHAPER: George Hamlin is president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting. HAMLIN: I think it would be fair to say that the game here is pay-to-play. If you want the cheapest fare, don't look for the primo product. SCHAPER: Looking ahead to 2015, Hamlin says travelers should continue to expect jam-packed planes and high fares. As demand for air travel continues to rise, recent mergers reduce competition, and airlines have reduced excess seat capacity to better match demand. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

We begin this Christmas Day with a couple of views of the U. S. economy - its strengths and the weaknesses that remain as 2014 comes to a close. NPR's John Ydstie reminds us where we started last January. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The tough winter weather sent the U. S. economy into the ditch early in the year. Plus, businesses and consumers were still a little dazed by a government shutdown and debt ceiling fight late in 2013. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics says it all produced an anxious start to the year. MARK ZANDI: Yeah, a lot of worry particularly because we had misstepped a few other times during the recovery. You know, we had these false dawns when we thought the economy was really going to kick into gear and then we kind of fell back into the morass. YDSTIE: But this time the economy rebounded. ZANDI: Most obviously in the job market - almost 3 million jobs will be created in 2014. That's as good a year since the late 1990s when the economy was booming, and the quality of the jobs improved. YDSTIE: Amanda Eschenburg and her husband from Waukesha, Wisconsin, are good examples of that trend. The young couple, both in their mid-20s, quit their jobs and found new ones in 2014. AMANDA ESCHENBURG: The fact that my husband and I have both been able to quit our jobs in the same year and start at new places and be able to have more spending power and savings power seems to me like at least in our situation it's gotten better. YDSTIE: Amanda moved from a job at Walgreens to a new position with the Department of Children and Family Services. Her husband got a good industrial design and engineering job. And they've started to look for a house to buy. Homeownership seems more realistic now that their incomes are higher. ESCHENBURG: I'm working 40 hours. My husband generally works, like, 50 hours a week. They've told him he can take as much overtime as he wants. There are some days, depending on when projects are due, that he's there much longer, so we've had some really, really big checks coming in from his job. YDSTIE: Mark Zandi says other pluses for the U. S. economy include less debt weighing down U. S. companies, stronger banks and lower energy costs, all of which make U. S. businesses more competitive. ZANDI: And that means that we will see businesses expand, locate, operate more here in the U. S. than everywhere else in the world, and that goes right to jobs, that goes right to incomes, that goes right to wealth and our growth prospects. YDSTIE: Zandi thinks that wages, which have lagged during this recovery, will rise in the new year, making it possible for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates. They've been near zero for six years. But Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research thinks that raising rates would be a bad idea. DEAN BAKER: People should understand that's a policy designed to give us fewer jobs. I mean, if they're raising interest rates, they're trying to slow the economy, which, of course, has the effect of reducing employment growth, fewer jobs. It's a hit to the economy that's completely unnecessary. YDSTIE: Unnecessary because inflation is already low and falling further because of the drop in oil prices. Baker points out that the growth rate for 2014 is likely to be under 2. 5 percent - disappointing, he says, given how much ground the economy still needs to make up to shake off the effects of the Great Recession. BAKER: We're still down somewhere in the order of 7 million jobs from the pre-recession levels of employment. So given that sort of weakness in the labor market, most workers have very low bargaining power. And what that means is we've seen very, very little wage growth. YDSTIE: With all those workers on the sidelines, Baker argues the economy is performing $700 billion below its potential output. That's like giving up about $2000 in annual income per person. Baker expects 2015 to be another year much like this year for the economy with steady growth and more jobs added, but not much improvement in wages. Zandi expects a very good year in 2015. With more than 3 million jobs created and wages rising, he says the economy will be off and running. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Prices have fallen so much that drivers in a few states are finding gasoline this Christmas for under $2 a gallon. Average prices for a gallon of regular have dropped by more than a third since last summer. In a moment, we'll hear how this is pushing Venezuela to the brink of financial crisis. But first, NPR's Jeff Brady reports that in this country it means people are taking to the road more. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Here in Philadelphia I didn't have to go far to find an example of someone driving more. Recently, I got a haircut at a rock 'n' roll-themed barbershop. FRAN DOYLE: My name is Fran Doyle. I'm the manager of Floyd's 99 Barbershop in Willow Grove. I'm also a stylist, and I also do Jeff's hair. (LAUGHTER)BRADY: Just a haircut, nothing fancy. Anyway, Fran says he commutes about 45 minutes a day by car, and he's loving the lower gas prices. He was paying about $55 to fill up. Now it's closer to $35. And instead of staying home this Christmas. . . DOYLE: . . . I also chose last-minute to take a trip to Florida. And after looking at the airlines - the flight prices - I decided to drive just because of the price of gas. BRADY: He's not alone. Through the first weekend of the New Year, AAA projects a 4 percent increase in the number of people traveling more than 50 miles by car. A big question for the New Year is how long will the lower prices last? PHILIP VERLEGER: I think prices will continue to decline. BRADY: Energy economist Philip Verleger is among those projecting low prices as long as the world's biggest producers keep pumping oil at the current rate. And he's willing to go out on a limb. VERLEGER: We are going to see a period of really low gasoline prices - not for six months, not for a year, but probably two or three years - maybe four years. BRADY: As always, geopolitics could disrupt oil production and change that forecast. Oil consumption also plays a factor. World demand has been less than projected. Amy Myers Jaffe at University of California Davis says news out of China could affect oil company profits. AMY MYERS JAFFE: If the Chinese economy continues to falter, that is certainly going to be a negative for oil and gas prices. I would say that's probably the biggest wildcard out there. BRADY: Here in the U. S. Myers Jaffe says she does not expect a big slowdown in the oil drilling boom. She says at $50 a barrel, drillers in Texas may not be able to swim in champagne, but she says they'll still be able to drink it. Jeff Brady, NPR News, Philadelphia.

BRADY: Energy economist Philip Verleger is among those projecting low prices as long as the world's biggest producers keep pumping oil at the current rate. And he's willing to go out on a limb. VERLEGER: We are going to see a period of really low gasoline prices - not for six months, not for a year, but probably two or three years - maybe four years. BRADY: As always, geopolitics could disrupt oil production and change that forecast. Oil consumption also plays a factor. World demand has been less than projected. Amy Myers Jaffe at University of California Davis says news out of China could affect oil company profits. AMY MYERS JAFFE: If the Chinese economy continues to falter, that is certainly going to be a negative for oil and gas prices. I would say that's probably the biggest wildcard out there. BRADY: Here in the U. S. Myers Jaffe says she does not expect a big slowdown in the oil drilling boom. She says at $50 a barrel, drillers in Texas may not be able to swim in champagne, but she says they'll still be able to drink it.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. The economy had a shaky start in 2014. The polar vortex early in the year was a blow to the economy. But as the year ends, new numbers released just last week show that the economy is growing and growing increasingly fast. Mark Zandi is the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. He joins us from WHYY in Philadelphia to talk about whether this rebound will continue into 2015. Mr. Zandi, welcome. MARK ZANDI: Thank you. It's good to be with you. WERTHEIMER: Now for the last year, you and other people in your line of work have talked about that. That the economy is improving. That the economy is getting stronger. But there are also lots of reasons to believe that the American people don't feel it and therefore don't believe it. Why is that? ZANDI: That's true. I think it's because, for most people, they have a job, they're working, and what matters to them is their wages - whether their wage is keeping pace with the rate of inflation and whether their pay increase this year is bigger than last year. And so far at least, they can't say that. All that they can say is, yeah, my wage growth has been consistent with inflation. My standard of living has been roughly unchanged, and this is still a pretty blase economy. They really haven't felt the benefits of the better economy, at least not yet. WERTHEIMER: You know, if we think back to the last boom in the '90s that was driven by computers and the Internet, we had the unfortunate boom of real estate, which was a bubble that burst. What's driving this growth, and does it feel like it could burst? ZANDI: This is real. This is not based on a bubble. It's not based on a tech bubble, housing bubble or any other kind of bubble. And perhaps the most encouraging this is the growth isn't being driven by a sector or two sectors. It's very broad-based. This feels more fundamental to me, and thus, I am confident - more confident this will be longer lasting. WERTHEIMER: The Pew Research Center has recently reported that wealth and equality, the gap between the rich and the poor, is the widest it's been in at least three decades. It's obviously not yet a good economy for everybody. ZANDI: You know, I think that is weighing on the collective psyche and people's perceptions about the economy and will continue to do so for quite some time because the broader forces at work creating this skewing of the distribution of wealth, income and consumption are still largely in place and will remain in place for some time. So that's not something that's going to go away. So, you know, people will feel better a year from now or two years from now, but they're not going to feel great. And one of the reasons is because of this skewed distribution of wealth. WERTHEIMER: So do you see anything out there that could derail this current improvement? The Federal Reserve keeps suggesting that they're going to raise interest rates next year. Would that be something that could slow down or put the brakes on what looks like a pretty steady improvement? ZANDI: Well, Linda, I am an economist, and I do have two hands so there are other ways of looking at this. Yes, there are risks, and you put your finger on one of the key one, and that is rising interest rates. So if you buy into my script about growth and the tightening in the labor market - stronger wage growth, that means the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates. And so I do worry about that. I also worry about what's going on overseas. You know, Europe is close to recession. Japan is in recession. China's growth rates have slowed. And we have a lot of geopolitical risks. It would take a lot of bad things happening overseas to derail what's happening here. But, you know, you can construct those scenarios, and we do need to be focused on that as a risk. WERTHEIMER: Mark Zandi is the chief economist from Moody's Analytics.

Children can be exposed to books even before they can talk. Of course that means a family has to have books. We are beginning a series of reports on programs that help kids get ready to read, and that includes kids from low-income families targeted by a program called First Book. NPR's Lynn Neary reports. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: There are neighborhoods in this country where everyone has lots of books, and then there are neighborhoods where books are harder to find. Dr. Susan Neuman put a focus on that discrepancy in a study she did almost 15 years ago. Neuman, who is now a professor at New York University, set out to see just how many books were available in low-income neighborhoods of Philadelphia. The results were startling. SUSAN NEUMAN: We found a total of 33 books for children in a community of 10,000 children. NEARY: Thirty-three books per home you're saying. Is that right? NEUMAN: No. NEARY: No? NEUMAN: Thirty-three books in all of the neighborhood. NEARY: By comparison, there were 300 books per child in affluent communities in the same city. Neuman recently updated her study. She has not yet released the findings, but she says not much has changed. Despite advances in technology, Neuman says access to print books is important because reading out loud creates an emotional link between parent and child. NEUMAN: There's that immediate connection and that eye-to-eye joint attention. The parent is not looking at her cell phone or his cell phone. She is focusing on the child and the book. The second reason is the vocabulary that is contained in those books. Even very rudimentary, you know, beginning books, like board books, have vocabulary that tends to be outside the parents' normal day-to-day interaction. So that child is learning words that he or she is likely not to see in any other place. KYLE ZIMMER: Do you know this book? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: (Crosstalk). ZIMMER: OK, ready? It's called \"The Snowy Day. \"NEARY: Kyle Zimmer sits on a tiny chair surrounded by 4-year-olds at the National Children's Center in Washington, D. C. Zimmer is the president and CEO of First Book, an organization that has forged an innovative partnership with publishers to get books into the hands of kids who need them. Andrea Brunk, a physical therapist at the center, points to an array of picture books sitting on a couple of tables in the classroom. ANDREA BRUNK: First Book brought a huge variety of books for our kids. They're all age-appropriate. There are diverse characters, and all the kids are going to come up after they're read to. And they get to take two books home apiece. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I got this one. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I got these. . . NEARY: When the reading ends, the kids crowd around the tables to pick out their favorites. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: I got Barney book. NEARY: You got a Barney book? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: Yeah, and a princess book. Can you read it to me? NEARY: First Book began by setting up a book bank and distributing, at virtually no cost, unsold books that were returned to publishers and would otherwise be destroyed. It went on to create a children's book marketplace. It buys books from publishers in bulk at deeply reduced prices and sells them to a variety of nonprofit organizations. ZIMMER: Virtually, anybody serving children in need from 0 to 18 years of age - it can be a homeless shelter. It can be a formal classroom. It can be an abuse refugee. It can be really any place where kids are gathered. NEARY: Zimmer says publishers like the program because it's opened up a previously untapped market. Traditionally, she says, children's book publishers cater to a very few. ZIMMER: On average, a premium picture book is about $18 at retail. And you imagine who the customer base is that can afford an $18 picture book for their family. What you're talking about is probably the upper 5 to maybe 10 percent of the socioeconomic ladder. NEARY: First Book's nonprofit partners like the program because they can buy so many books so cheaply. BRUNK: Two-eighty-five buys one book. NEARY: Andrea Brunk says in the past, the National Children's Center was grateful for any books that came its way. With First Book, the center can choose exactly what it needs. BRUNK: And so we actually encourage people to try to just give us the donations if they're OK with that and let us do the picking because we can get them at such a reduced rate that their money goes further. NEARY: Back in the classroom, the children are focused on their new books. Some sit quietly turning pages and looking at the pictures. Some trade books with their friends. Others gather around their teacher, listening to a story. ROSE CAMPBELL: Oh, sorry, George, said the man with the yellow hat, I forgot to to fix your chair. NEARY: Teacher Rose Campbell says for the kids, the best thing about getting the books is that they can take them home. CAMPBELL: At home, parents can actually read to them, and they can also read to their parents. So if they're - we're reading a book here with them, they can go home and say to the parents, hey, we read this in class today. So they're really excited about that. NEARY: The NCC has now set up a program for parents to encourage them to read to their children. Andrea Brunk says parents who attend a session will leave with a bundle of books. BRUNK: The parents kind of know now, OK, this is theirs, and they didn't have to do anything to get this. They didn't have to go to the store and spend $16 to buy a book or something like that. But it's a high-quality book, and the child gets to keep it. They don't have to worry about taking it back to the library - that type of thing. And now they have the tools to work with their child. And I think that's really - we've really tried to empower them and say, hey, you have everything you need, and you can do this, and you can make this difference with your child long-term. NEARY: One parent who's taken advantage of both the books and the program the center offers is Alisa Jackson Gray. She had four children of her own and is now raising her grandson along with a great-niece and nephew. Gray says she's always read to her kids, but she says a lot of families that live in her community are dealing with so many problems that it's hard to make reading a priority. ALISA JACKSON GRAY: Sometimes they don't even know where their next meal is going to come from, and then when you come to school and you get a pack of books - I was very happy and pleased to get my pack of books. And every night, my children and myself, we sit there, and we read it. And I'm a mother two times - reading the books. You know, I was very elated to see my 1-year-old get the book and flip through the pages like she really can read. And she's pointing to the words, and she's so impressed - book? Yes, book. NEARY: Since 1992, First Book has gotten more than 100 million new books into the hands of kids from low-income homes. Providing books to those families, says founder Kyle Zimmer, and giving parents the support they need to read to their children can go a long way toward breaking the cycle of illiteracy.

Globally there were $3 trillion worth of deals announced the 2014; the biggest year for mergers and acquisitions since the financial crisis. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports the trend is expected to contend. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Ever since the great recession, there's been a big chill on mergers and acquisitions as companies and banks hoarded their cash. This year, that changed. It wasn't the number of deals that was impressive; it was the large sums involved. And they included some big names. Reynolds American buying smaller tobacco Lorillard for $28 billion. And Burger King closed on its deal to buy Canadian coffee and doughnut icon Tim Hortons for $11 billion. David Harding leads corporate mergers and acquisitions for Bain and Company. To him, this was all fairly predictable. DAVID HARDING: The M&A industry is highly cyclical. It's a little bit like sunspots. NOGUCHI: And this year's flare-up, he says, was driven in part by companies' huge cash coffers. HARDING: There is a tremendous amount of capital sloshing around in the world looking for a home. NOGUCHI: Harding says the economy is improving, but companies in the U. S. and Europe are finding it hard to grow organically, as they say in business circles. So instead, Harding says they're looking at targeted acquisitions. In one of the year's biggest, Facebook bought messaging software firm WhatsApp for an eye-popping $22 billion. Drug firm Actavis announced plans to buy both Allergan and Forest Laboratories this year, as pharmaceutical companies tried to buy their way into new markets and expertise. The corporate merger trend is likely to continue, says Harding. The dramatic fall in oil prices is setting the stage for still more mergers among some companies in the energy and manufacturing sectors. HARDING: My sense is that 2015 will be a bigger year than 2014. NOGUCHI: Richard Jeanneret agrees. RICHARD JEANNERET: To use a baseball analogy, we're in the early innings. NOGUCHI: Jeanneret is a vice chair of a division of Ernst & Young that advises clients on deal making. He says he expects more midsize companies to get in on the action next year, making it a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions overall. A number of this year's deals, including Burger King and Tim Hortons, caused a big stir because they involved U. S. companies buying smaller firms then moving headquarters abroad to avoid paying higher U. S. corporate taxes. The practice, known as tax inversion, prompted the Obama administration to change the tax rules in September. That change scuttled the year's biggest announced deal - drug maker AbbVie's plans to buy the U. K. -based firm Shire for $54 billion. AbbVie publicly criticized the administration. But Jeanneret says tax inversions were not a major factor in this year's deals. JEANNERET: It makes for great fodder. It's clearly been present in some very large transactions. But the reality of it is the volume is extremely low. NOGUCHI: In the past, some companies have been burned by bad deals. But Jeanneret says companies are vetting deals more carefully than they did a decade ago. JEANNERET: At that time, they were responding to market pressures to be bigger. Now, you know, the marketplace wants greater focus. NOGUCHI: So sometimes, that means merging. But sometimes, as was the case this year with eBay and Hewlett-Packard, it means spinning off old acquisitions that didn't work out. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

The practice, known as tax inversion, prompted the Obama administration to change the tax rules in September. That change scuttled the year's biggest announced deal - drug maker AbbVie's plans to buy the U. K. -based firm Shire for $54 billion. AbbVie publicly criticized the administration. But Jeanneret says tax inversions were not a major factor in this year's deals. JEANNERET: It makes for great fodder. It's clearly been present in some very large transactions. But the reality of it is the volume is extremely low. NOGUCHI: In the past, some companies have been burned by bad deals. But Jeanneret says companies are vetting deals more carefully than they did a decade ago. JEANNERET: At that time, they were responding to market pressures to be bigger. Now, you know, the marketplace wants greater focus. NOGUCHI: So sometimes, that means merging. But sometimes, as was the case this year with eBay and Hewlett-Packard, it means spinning off old acquisitions that didn't work out.
