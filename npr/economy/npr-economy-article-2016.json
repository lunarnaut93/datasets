And we are reminded of how difficult it is to predict anything in this region these days. Things have been very tense between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi government executed a Shiite cleric. Both of these nations are big oil producers. And in the past, a simmering conflict like this would have led to a spike in oil prices. Instead, though, oil prices have fallen in recent days, actually sliding to an 11-year low. We asked NPR's John Ydstie to explain why. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Oil analyst Dan Katzenberg of R. W. Baird & Co. says the mild reaction of the oil market to more trouble in the Middle East is evidence of a big change. DAN KATZENBERG: Historically, this would have absolutely caused crude prices to spike. YDSTIE: Because of worries, the conflict might lead to a cut in oil exports from the region. But that hasn't happened this time because of a global glut of oil - a glut largely due to the huge rise in U. S. production, says Jack Gerard. He's president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry research group. JACK GERARD: The market's looking at that situation, that unrest, and they're saying, well, it could have an impact, obviously, within those significant producing nations. But there's alternatives today. YDSTIE: And the main alternative is the U. S. American production soared in recent years, after the introduction of fracking technology allowed oil to be pumped from shale formations. U. S. production peaked recently at over 9 million barrels a day. That's eroded the dominance of Mid East oil producers. GERARD: Those who had significant influence over global pricing - if you talk to analysts, we'll tell you that that dynamic has shifted and is changing. YDSTIE: Gerard is referring to OPEC, the group of oil exporters led by Saudi Arabia who once could set a ceiling and floor for oil prices. But the Saudi's have been pumping freely, doing their best to drive prices lower and force U. S. producers out of business. On Tuesday, the Saudi's cut prices once again, this time for sales of oil to Europe. The move was largely interpreted as an effort to keep Iran, also an OPEC member, from regaining its traditional market in Europe as sanctions are lifted this year. Dan Katzenberg says that could weaken OPEC further and send prices even lower. KATZENBERG: I think the expectation is that you're just going to see each of these countries looking out for their best interests. And by doing that, they're going to pump at full volume. YDSTIE: Katzenberg says that could mean gasoline prices for U. S. consumers - now about $2 a gallon - could go even lower. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

And what they saw happen in the U. S. in 2015 was just weird. It was hot, and there were all kinds of extreme weather events. And as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, all that heavy weather was getting extensive. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: December was a fitting end to a strange weather here. JAKE CROUCH: This is the first time in our 121-year period of record that a month has been both the wettest and the warmest month on record. JOYCE: Jake Crouch is a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says the rest of the year was very wet and hot, too, the second-hottest on record. The cause - a warming climate and a super-strong El Nino. El Nino is a weather phenomenon out of the Pacific Ocean that hits every few years and affects weather globally. Together, climate and El Nino pushed the average temperature in the U. S. up over its 20th-century average by 2. 4 degrees. NOAA scientist Deke Arndt puts that in perspective. DEKE ARNDT: And if we all went home and reset our thermostat to 2. 4 degrees higher in our homes for a year, we would certainly feel the difference. JOYCE: And when the atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture, leading to record snows in the Northeast last February and March and record rain in the South and Midwest. Arndt says scientists expect more of the same. ARNDT: The fact is we live in a warming world, and a warming world is bringing more big heat events and more big rain events to the United States. JOYCE: All this weather led to 10 extreme events that each did at least $1 billion in damage. These include a drought, flooding, severe rainstorms, big wildfires and winter storms - a wider variety of costly weather events than usual. Insurance companies are paying for most of this damage. Surprisingly, payouts this year were lower than the previous few years. That, says Mark Bove, is due mostly to luck. Bove is a meteorologist at Munich Re, which insures insurance companies for their losses. He says no serious hurricanes hit the U. S. this year, but he says that's not likely to last. Moreover, he's noticing a trend that's been going on for years and likely will continue. MARK BOVE: We seem to be seeing more extreme precipitation events. When it rains today, it seems to rain harder and heavier. JOYCE: But even as the rain gets harder, Bove says people don't seem to be taking notice. BOVE: We tend to not build buildings to withstand the storms that we already see, let alone how they might change in the future. JOYCE: And that will mean higher costs in a future where weather appears to be more unpredictable than ever. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

He's an Asian expert with the Atlantic Council. And first, we heard about this lack of transparency in what's actually happening in China's economy. I mean, why don't we have a better idea of China's economic problems? JAMIE METZL: Well, a lack of transparency is a problem across the board in China, not just in the economy but elsewhere. But in the economy, where the legitimacy of the Chinese government is in many ways pegged to economic growth, the government has is very careful about the kind of information that comes out. And that's why we've seen all kinds of situations where people giving just basic economic information that would be perfectly legal and normal elsewhere winds them up in jail in China. China is invested in these very high growth rates because of this connection to legitimacy. MCEVERS: Right. METZL: And when this bad news comes out, sometimes the government allows it to emerge, and sometimes it's suppressed. And when you multiply that across an economy, you get to a point where people don't really trust the numbers. And that's why when there are other indicators of economic growth or decline, people jump onto them because we don't know what to trust and what not to trustMCEVERS: All right, so you're not going to go to jail for answering this question. METZL: Yes. MCEVERS: Explain to us why China's economy is slowing down. METZL: First, the global economy is slowing, and so their export markets aren't as robust as they've previously been. MCEVERS: Right. METZL: But secondly, China is becoming less competitive as a global economy in part because they are trying to transition from a manufacturing and export economy into an economy that's focusing on innovation and higher-end products. And as they do that, as their cost of production goes up, they are competing with high-end economies like the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea. And that's a very, very difficult place to be. And so China knows what they need to do, but they're having a tough time enacting the structural reforms needed to get there. MCEVERS: So it sounds like the slowdown itself isn't a surprise, but do you think that the reaction to it - some would say, as we heard, the overreaction to it - is that a surprise? METZL: Well, everybody assumes that Chinese leaders are these incredible geniuses, but they're not. They're humans like leaders in any other countries, and they don't have a lot of experience in managing a complex capitalist economy. And so when push comes to shove, very often, although they recognize the need for market reforms, that's not what they do. And six months ago in the middle of last year, when there was a major market crisis, rather than trusting in the market, which is what they said they were going to try to do, they created all of these controls, one of which was a limitation on how many shares of companies big investors could sell. And that was set to expire six months later, which is now. And there are all these pent-up misallocations of resources, valuations that don't make sense. And for China, like for everybody else, at the end of the day, gravity applies. MCEVERS: And China has shut down trading twice already this week, but it says it won't do that tomorrow. I mean, have we seen the worst of this already? METZL: I don't believe so. China established these so-called circuit breakers. And the goal is that when in a given day, if the stock market - the Shanghai stock market - falls by 7 percent, then it shuts down for the day. The problem is, China's stock market is very much like a casino. There's lots of wild swings up and down. And so investors, many of whom are retail investors, were gaming the system. So when you get to 4 percent, rather than people calming down and taking a step back, people though, well, jeez, if we get to 5 percent, then I'm stuck; I better sell now. So even in this one week of these the circuit breakers, it was having the reverse effect of what they had intended. But the core problem is that the valuations in the stock market today don't really correspond to the underlying fundamentals and to people's perceptions of where the Chinese economy is actually going. And so if you're going - if they're going to have a market economy, they need to have more faith in the market process. But that requires a very tough stomach.

Stock prices plunged as soon as trading began here in the United States with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by triple digits. And this comes after a big selloff in Asia and Europe. And once again, all this turmoil seems to have begun in China. We're joined from New York by NPR's Jim Zarroli. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So tell us what is happening in China. It sounds like things got so bad so quickly, the government actually had to suspend trading there. ZARROLI: Yeah, well, this week China's stock markets started using these circuit breakers which is something that we have in the U. S. stock markets, too. They're meant to curb volatility. So the way they work is that when stocks fall enough, trading is suspended for 15 minutes. And then if they fall even more, trading is suspended for the rest of the day. Now that happened this morning after just 29 minutes. Stocks had fallen so much that the markets shut down trading altogether. Now, these circuit breakers have only been in place this week, but they've already had to be activated twice. They were supposed to be sort of rarely used, but they've already been used twice. So after the markets close today, the Chinese stock market officials announced that they would stop using them. GREENE: Well, is that an indication that the government feels like using those circuit breakers actually was having the opposite effect and making people more nervous? ZARROLI: Well, I think it was certainly making a lot of investors angry because, as you can imagine, they were trying to, you know, sell their positions, and they were trying to trade. And after just a short time, they were told they couldn't do that. The Chinese stock market is trying very hard to be seen as respectable - to be, you know, on par with the other major stock markets in the world. And this is one of the reasons they're trying to cut down on volatility. But this just seemed to have the opposite effect, and there was a backlash. GREENE: What's going on in China? I mean, for so many years, the government seemed to be guiding that economy so ably. And, I mean, what's going wrong? ZARROLI: Well, I think that's what a lot of people are asking. I mean, China has been trying to change its economy so that it's less of an investment - you know, a capital-driven economy and more of a consumer-driven one. But I think there's a broad problem right now in that the leadership in Beijing is sort of losing credibility. I mean, China has - as you say, it's always been a top-down economy. The government has been steering things very well for a long time. But I think lately their efforts haven't succeeded as well. And I think a lot of investors are asking, you know, does Beijing really have a grip on this? What's - and what does it mean for the rest of the world? China is so big that its actions have consequences all over the place, and we're feeling that now. GREENE: Well, let me ask you about those consequences. What is the view from New York in terms of how bad this could get for the U. S. markets? ZARROLI: Well, I think the - I think one of the questions that's being raised is what it means for the Federal Reserve. You know, the markets are seeing less of a likelihood, I think, that interest rates are going to keep going up. In December, you had the Fed raise rates by a quarter point because the economy - the U. S. economy is improving. Everybody was predicting there would be more rate increases this year. But now a lot of people are wondering whether that's going to happen. They're looking at what's happening overseas and saying, you know, what does this mean for the U. S. economy? GREENE: All right, we're speaking to NPR's Jim Zarroli about what has already been a tumultuous day in the financial markets, both in the United States and across the world, all linked, it seems, to a big fall in stocks in China. Jim, thanks a lot. ZARROLI: You're welcome. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And this has been another tumultuous day in the financial markets. Stock prices plunged as soon as trading began here in the United States with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by triple digits. And this comes after a big selloff in Asia and Europe. And once again, all this turmoil seems to have begun in China. We're joined from New York by NPR's Jim Zarroli. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So tell us what is happening in China. It sounds like things got so bad so quickly, the government actually had to suspend trading there. ZARROLI: Yeah, well, this week China's stock markets started using these circuit breakers which is something that we have in the U. S. stock markets, too. They're meant to curb volatility. So the way they work is that when stocks fall enough, trading is suspended for 15 minutes. And then if they fall even more, trading is suspended for the rest of the day. Now that happened this morning after just 29 minutes. Stocks had fallen so much that the markets shut down trading altogether. Now, these circuit breakers have only been in place this week, but they've already had to be activated twice. They were supposed to be sort of rarely used, but they've already been used twice. So after the markets close today, the Chinese stock market officials announced that they would stop using them. GREENE: Well, is that an indication that the government feels like using those circuit breakers actually was having the opposite effect and making people more nervous? ZARROLI: Well, I think it was certainly making a lot of investors angry because, as you can imagine, they were trying to, you know, sell their positions, and they were trying to trade. And after just a short time, they were told they couldn't do that. The Chinese stock market is trying very hard to be seen as respectable - to be, you know, on par with the other major stock markets in the world. And this is one of the reasons they're trying to cut down on volatility. But this just seemed to have the opposite effect, and there was a backlash. GREENE: What's going on in China? I mean, for so many years, the government seemed to be guiding that economy so ably. And, I mean, what's going wrong? ZARROLI: Well, I think that's what a lot of people are asking. I mean, China has been trying to change its economy so that it's less of an investment - you know, a capital-driven economy and more of a consumer-driven one. But I think there's a broad problem right now in that the leadership in Beijing is sort of losing credibility. I mean, China has - as you say, it's always been a top-down economy. The government has been steering things very well for a long time. But I think lately their efforts haven't succeeded as well. And I think a lot of investors are asking, you know, does Beijing really have a grip on this? What's - and what does it mean for the rest of the world? China is so big that its actions have consequences all over the place, and we're feeling that now. GREENE: Well, let me ask you about those consequences. What is the view from New York in terms of how bad this could get for the U. S. markets? ZARROLI: Well, I think the - I think one of the questions that's being raised is what it means for the Federal Reserve. You know, the markets are seeing less of a likelihood, I think, that interest rates are going to keep going up. In December, you had the Fed raise rates by a quarter point because the economy - the U. S. economy is improving. Everybody was predicting there would be more rate increases this year. But now a lot of people are wondering whether that's going to happen. They're looking at what's happening overseas and saying, you know, what does this mean for the U. S. economy? GREENE: All right, we're speaking to NPR's Jim Zarroli about what has already been a tumultuous day in the financial markets, both in the United States and across the world, all linked, it seems, to a big fall in stocks in China.

She is president and CEO of the Center for Work Education and Employment. It's an organization that helps low income, single parents get jobs. And she joins us from Denver, Colo. Laurie, tell us why parents that you work with aren't counted in these numbers. LAURIE HARVEY: Well, the parents that we're working with are receiving public assistance or TANF, which is Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, so most of them have not been employed long enough to have received unemployment. So the unemployment figures and the employment figures are built off of those who have received unemployment, so they're somewhat of a subset and quite a vulnerable population in terms of those who need a lot of special work and assistance to get into the job market. MCEVERS: When we look at today's jobs report, I mean, there's an interesting figure showing that the unemployment rate for single mothers is actually the lowest it's been in 15 years. It's at 5. 8 percent. Does that sound right to you? HARVEY: You know, it does, although we do know that there's a lot of single parents who still are not able to access even public assistance. But I do think those numbers should be lower because, comparing the first six months to the second six months of last year, our full-time placements increased by 9 percent. Our overall placements increased by 10 percent. MCEVERS: You talked about the numbers and the increases. But, like, are you seeing people's lives change because wages are going up? HARVEY: Yes, I think that those - we see a lot of our individuals who really don't have a lot of skills. These are not individuals who have been working in a corporation or a business and now are just unemployed. These are individuals who dropped out of high school, probably in ninth grade, and have, generally, retail, housekeeping, kind of stopgap jobs. And interestingly enough, we're seeing some of those who decide not to take the first job that comes along and being a little more picky and realizing that there are better jobs for them and trying to focus on those quality jobs that have higher salaries, better benefits and have a career potential. MCEVERS: Is there a story of someone you can talk about maybe who you've served recently as you've seen these changes sort of play out in their life? HARVEY: We had an individual recently who came to us and didn't have any experience. And what she decided to do was take a job in fast food and look at getting her resume built up while, at the same time, really looking at a customer service job. It took her a month or two, but she then received a customer service job with Dish Network, which is paying much higher, of course. And I think that shows that the participants themselves realize that there are more opportunities for them to grow and get those good jobs that are more quality. MCEVERS: What kind of salary increase are we talking about? HARVEY: Oh, she would've been making probably $8 dollars an hour, maybe $9 an hour, if that, in her job with fast food. And the entry-level - or jobs for customer service are in that $13, $14 an hour range. MCEVERS: That's Laurie Harvey. She's president and CEO of the Center for Work Education and Employment in Denver, Colo. Thanks so much. HARVEY: Thank you for having me.

That came today in the monthly jobs report. The Labor Department said in December employers added roughly 300,000 jobs. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: China worries have been at the center of this whirlwind. Its stock market sold off this week, and its currency fell as concerns mounted about a slowdown in its economy. U. S. investors feared China's problems could threaten growth here, too. But the report that the U. S. economy added 292,000 jobs in December demonstrates the staying power of U. S. growth, says Rob Martin, chief U. S. economist at Barclays Investment Bank. ROB MARTIN: We feel confident that the economy is in a great spot, and it is very likely to withstand any kind of headwinds coming from turbulence in the Chinese economy. YDSTIE: While some U. S. exporters could be hurt, Martin thinks the money U. S. consumers save from lower prices for imported Chinese goods will boost economic activity and more than offset any drag on U. S. growth. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says there's another positive sign in this report. DEAN BAKER: Many of the people who dropped out of the labor force may now finally be coming back. YDSTIE: The labor force grew by almost 470,000 workers in December after a big gain in November. That suggests workers have more confidence that the economy will provide them a job. One negative in the jobs report today was wages. They were flat in December. Baker says they're not growing at a healthy pace because there are still millions of people out of work who are competing for jobs. And there are other concerns, says Baker. Many economists have trimmed their estimates for U. S. growth because of data showing a slowdown in manufacturing and construction. BAKER: So I worry that we might see some slowing of the economy, and, of course, the fallout from China would be another factor. So that's one issue. The other is the response of the Fed. YDSTIE: After today's strong jobs report, many economists are predicting the Fed will remain on track to boost interest rates another full percentage point during 2016.

C. as carmakers celebrated record auto sales. Americans bought 17-and-a-half million cars and trucks last year. That's a big turnaround from 2009, and the Obama administration cheered the rebound as vindication of the president's decision that year to rescue General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy. There is, however, another element of the president's auto agenda that's not looking so good, and NPR's Scott Horsley joins us to talk about that. Good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: What's the problem with all these new car sales? What's the downside? HORSLEY: Well, Renee, just to give the high-fivers their due, it is encouraging that people have been flocking to auto dealerships. It means they've got money in their pockets, they're feeling good about the economy. It's certainly good for the 640,000 people who got jobs in the auto industry in the last five or six years. But the drawback is in 2011, the president struck a deal with automakers that was supposed to more than double the average fuel economy by 2025. That would help consumers go twice as far on every gallon of gas, and it was also a key ingredient in the president's recipe for battling climate change. Now, for a couple of years after that deal was struck, we did see gains in the average miles per gallon, but those improvements, Renee, have now stalled. Brandon Schoettle and Michael Sivak track this every month at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. And this week, they reported that the average miles per gallon of new vehicles sold in 2015 was down from the year before. In fact, it's been falling month by month, and in December, the average fell below 25 miles to the gallon. MONTAGNE: And why are the numbers slumping? HORSLEY: Two words - cheap gasoline. As gas prices have tumbled this year, more and more consumers are opting for bigger, less fuel-efficient trucks and SUVs. And the University of Michigan's Brandon Schoettle says even though the typical pickup gets better mileage today than it did a few years ago, that changing mix - away from cars, towards light trucks - is pulling the overall average fuel economy down. BRANDON SCHOETTLE: There's kind of two competing forces here. The automakers are doing what they can to improve the technology in the vehicles and make the fuel economy for these better and better each year. And they really have been doing that. But on the other hand, you've also got the consumer behavior - what drivers want to purchase and drive around. HORSLEY: Now, automakers aren't too bothered by this, since they generally make more money on the bigger, heavier vehicles. But it does mean we're a long way from that goal of more than doubling fuel economy by 2025. MONTAGNE: And what does this then mean for the president's climate agenda? HORSLEY: Well, fuel economy standards were just one part of the broader climate plan - not as significant, for example, as the rules governing power plants pollution. But what this does illustrate is just how important price signals are in getting consumers to knock down their carbon footprint. And it looks like we're going to have cheap gas with us for a little while, at least. The price of crude oil continues to slump. One thing, though, I know, Renee, from following the energy markets for a long time - they are volatile. What goes down does go up. And it's worth keeping in mind that the average car on the road today is 11 years old. So before you head out to the dealership, you might want to think not only about where gas prices are now, but just how confident are you that we're going to have two-dollar-a-gallon gas two years, five years, 10 years down the road?

I'm Scott Simon. We've just seen the worst first week of the year in stock market history. Fears over economic trouble in China sent stocks plunging around the world, but we also got a surprisingly good employment report yesterday in the United States. So the economy here might be stronger than we thought. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: This past week has not been dull for anyone trading stocks. Weak economic data in China sent shares there lower. That's not so unusual. But this time, the Chinese government had instituted what are called circuit breakers to suspend trading after a sharp decline. That was supposed to calm investors, but it backfired. This was some of the coverage on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We've hit what they call circuit breaker. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Number one. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: This is crazy. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Yeah, it's very disconcerting for the markets. They're learning by doing. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: It is. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We got Shenzhen markets basically falling through 2,000 down 6. 7 percent. ARNOLD: Later in the week, China got rid of the circuit breakers and stocks stopped free-falling. Still, even the major U. S. stock indexes over the past week fell between 6 and 7 percent. Matthew Kaufler is with Federated Clover Investment Advisors. He says actually the China trouble itself isn't so terrible. MATTHEW KAUFLER: It's perfectly normal for growing economies like China or India to go through growing pains, but it will sort itself out. ARNOLD: Kaufler says though on top of China, there's plenty of geopolitical uncertainty. Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, terrorist attacks and. . . KAUFLER: You had North Korea apparently testing the hydrogen bomb. That's not a good development. And we can call it saber-rattling all we want. It's not a good development. ARNOLD: There's skepticism about whether that really was a hydrogen bomb. But Kaufler says all these things together have taken a toll on investor confidence. Finally, by Friday morning, markets got some good news. The Labor Department reported nearly 300,000 job gains in the U. S. in December, and the previous two months were revised higher by another 50,000 jobs. DAIVD KOTOK: The U. S. economy is recovering. ARNOLD: David Kotok is chief economist at Cumberland Advisors. He says he was encouraged by the jobs report. He also thinks cheaper gasoline is going to give the economy more of a boost going forward. And he says he's bullish on the outlook for the U. S. , for the rest of the decade, for a bunch of reasons. KOTOK: Low interest rates, gradually improving growth, gradually improving labor markets in the United States, and the U. S. stock market will flourish in such an environment, maybe dramatically higher. ARNOLD: Still, the jobs report had a weak spot in it - wage growth. Lindsay Piegza is chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus. She says wage growth was flat in this latest report, and it's been too anemic throughout the recovery. LINDSAY PIEGZA: That's exactly right. And that's how we know that this current average pace of around 250,000 jobs is insufficient to absorb all the slack in the labor market. If that was sufficient, we would be talking about 3, 4 percent wage growth. But instead we're still bouncing around 2, 2. 5 percent. ARNOLD: So Piegza says this recovery has a ways to go before she'll feel really good about the health of the U. S. economy. Many investors may actually be thinking the same thing. Even after the better-than-expected jobs report, the Dow and the S&P both closed down another 1 percent yesterday. Chris Arnold, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.

He says he was encouraged by the jobs report. He also thinks cheaper gasoline is going to give the economy more of a boost going forward. And he says he's bullish on the outlook for the U. S. , for the rest of the decade, for a bunch of reasons. KOTOK: Low interest rates, gradually improving growth, gradually improving labor markets in the United States, and the U. S. stock market will flourish in such an environment, maybe dramatically higher. ARNOLD: Still, the jobs report had a weak spot in it - wage growth. Lindsay Piegza is chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus. She says wage growth was flat in this latest report, and it's been too anemic throughout the recovery. LINDSAY PIEGZA: That's exactly right. And that's how we know that this current average pace of around 250,000 jobs is insufficient to absorb all the slack in the labor market. If that was sufficient, we would be talking about 3, 4 percent wage growth. But instead we're still bouncing around 2, 2. 5 percent. ARNOLD: So Piegza says this recovery has a ways to go before she'll feel really good about the health of the U. S. economy. Many investors may actually be thinking the same thing. Even after the better-than-expected jobs report, the Dow and the S&P both closed down another 1 percent yesterday.

But the Authors Guild, a group which represents the interests of scribblers everywhere, has filed a petition on New Year's Eve asking the Supreme Court to review the latest decision in the Google Books case. It's become harder and harder for writers to earn a living. A lower court has upheld Google's right to add whole volumes to its database without paying fees or getting permission. A few days later, the Guild released an open letter to publishers demanding better contract terms for authors. NPR's Lynn Neary has more on the group's fight to raise the writers' wage. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Since 2009, the mean income for writers has gone down 30 percent, says Authors Guild Executive Director Mary Rasenberger. And that, she says, is huge. MARY RASENBERGER: So it's alarming. And incomes are now down to unsustainable levels. And that means that even longtime author, authors who have been writing books for decades, are now being forced to seek other work. So we are looking at this in a holistic way. You know, why is this happening? And what can we do about it? NEARY: The Google Books case, says Rasenberger, addresses the issue of copyright protection. The letter to the publishers takes on standard author contracts. Among other things, the Guild says, its writers should get a higher share of ebook income. And authors should have an option to retain the rights to their own books. The standard contracts the guild is protesting have been part of the business for decades. RASENBERGER: These are the agreements that the un-agented authors see - or those without powerful agents - where the terms tend to be much, much worse. NEARY: Much worse, that is, than the best-selling authors who can set their own terms. And that, says Porter Anderson, is part of the problem the Guild will face in dealing with publishers. Anderson, who writes about the industry for The Bookseller, an online British publication, says writers are not an easy group to organize. PORTER ANDERSON: They're all at very different levels. They have different professional experience. They have different reasons for writing. They have different types of writing. There are factions within factions inside the author cap. NEARY: Writers are also known for working in isolation. But, says Anderson, social media is changing all of that. ANDERSON: Not only are authors able to talk to each other continually in real time, but they're also in touch with their readers. This is new. NEARY: Anderson believes it significant that international writers organizations from Europe, Africa, Australia and Canada signed on to the Authors Guild letter to publishers. ANDERSON: If an international coalition can start communicating to readers all over the world, look what your authors are going through. Did you know this is the experience and the condition in which your favorite author is working? Something has changed. The publishers then are facing a new world in which a lot of questions can be asked in a lot of places in very loud voices. NEARY: The Authors Guild plans to meet with individual publishing companies to discuss their demands. And Mary Rasenberger says. . . RASENBERGER: Do we expect them to turn around tomorrow and create new agreements that meet all of our - all of our requests? Probably not. NEARY: But, she says, they're hopeful.

The word began as jazz musician slang and now describes an aspect of the new economy. GEOFF NUNBERG, BYLINE: The most obvious candidates for word of the year are the labels of the year's big stories - new words like microaggression or resurgent ones like refugee. But sometimes a big theme is captured in more subtle ways. So for my word of the year, I offer you the revival of gig as the name for a new economic order. It's the last chapter in the life of a little word that has tracked the rise and fall of the great American job. Gig goes back more than a century as musician slang for a date or engagement. Nobody's sure where it originally came from, though there are lots of imaginative theories out there. But the word didn't have any particular glamour until the 1950s, when the hipsters and the beats adapted it to mean any job you took to keep body and soul together while your real life was elsewhere. The earliest example I found is from a 1952 piece by Jack Kerouac, talking about his gig as a part-time brakeman for the Southern Pacific Railroad in San Jose. For the hipsters, calling a job a gig was saying that it didn't define you. A gig was a commitment you felt free to walk away from as soon as you had $50 in your pocket. That was the era when the real job was enjoying its moment in the American sun thanks to New Deal programs, strong unions and the post-war boom. So to turn away from that security and comfort in search of something more meaningful seemed a daring and romantic gesture. When you read Kerouac, it still does. Gig was a natural for the hippies who succeeded the hipsters and who made the avoidance of regular work a condition of tribal membership. But the word's more subversive overtones receded along with a counterculture. In recent decades, gig has become just a hip term for any kind of temporary job or stint with the implication that you're not particularly invested in it. I think of the barista or bookstore clerk who responds to my questions with a look that says hey man, it's a gig. I don't really do this. That tone of insouciance has made the gig economy the predominant name for what's being touted as the industrial revolution of our times. The lifetime job is history, we're told, a victim of technology and the logic of the market. Instead, careers will be a patchwork of temporary projects and assignments with the help of apps and platforms with perky names like Fancy Hands, Upwork and TaskRabbit. It's been called the on-demand economy, the 1099 economy, the peer-to-peer economy and freelance nation. But over the past year, investors, the business media and politicians seem to have settled on the gig economy. It strikes just the right jaunty, carefree note. The Financial Times explains that in the future, work will be less secure but lots more exciting. We can make our own schedule and hours, pick the projects that interest us, work from anywhere and try our hands at different trades. The buzzwords fly thick and fast here - we'll be solopreneurs (ph) and free-range humans with portfolio careers. As the head of a freelancer's organization puts it, we're no longer just lawyers or photographers or writers. Instead, we're part-time lawyers, cum amateur photographers who write on the side. That's the image that phrases like the gig economy and freelance nation bring to mind, an economy populated by professionals and creatives, usually single millennials, people who may be willing to trade some security for the opportunity to take off a month or two to visit Patagonia. But that language doesn't get at most of the people who are cut loose in the new economy and who aren't reveling in the independence it gives them, the low-paid temps and contingent workers that some people call the precariat. When you hear freelancer, you don't think of people cobbling together a livelihood cleaning apartments, delivering groceries and doing other people's laundry. And not many of those people think of themselves as having gigs. Unless you're a bass player, calling a god job a gig is a luxury reserved for people who can pretend they don't need one. There's a kind of semantic shell game going on here as the promoters of the new economy trade on the whisper of romance that still clings to gig. For the hipsters and the beats, the word evoked a fantasy of freedom and escape from the soul-deadening routine of a permanent job. If you have a long cultural memory, it's a bit odd to hear the extravagant praise of gig life coming from the investors and consultants who are hyping the new economic order. It's as if the shade of Kerouac were still haunting the place that's now called Silicon Valley, where he worked as a brakeman 65 years ago. But their logic sounds impeccable. If gig suggests the independence you get when you're not tied down to a steady lifetime job, then just think of the freedom we'll all enjoy when the traditional job is consigned to the scrapheap of history and the economy is just gigs all the way down. But the idea of a gig is only alluring if you know you can hit the road when it gets joyless. Otherwise, it's just an old word for a job you can't count on having tomorrow.

And it said it will eventually do more business in China than in the United States. The announcement underscores the potential of China's vast consumer market. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports the Chinese government sees untapping that potential as key to solving many of its economic problems. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: For years, China has poured money into big capital projects - factories and ports and railroads. Now, says Christopher Balding of Peking University, it has become overbuilt. CHRISTOPHER BALDING: You hear stories and read articles about airports that have been built all over China and they get two flights a day. And you hear stories like this across all types of industries. ZARROLI: There's simply not enough demand for all the roads and factories China has. And with global growth slowing, that's not going to change anytime soon. So a lot of economists say to keep the economy growing, demand must come from inside. Chinese consumers have to spend more. That's not easy. For one thing, living in is expensive. The social safety net is skimpy, and things such as health care and retirement aren't subsidized the way they are in the West, says Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. SCOTT KENNEDY: Chinese spend a lot of their money on health care and on education, on housing. And so there's not a lot of extra disposable income for what would drive consumption, say, in the United States and other richer countries. ZARROLI: And the Chinese system sometimes makes a bad situation worse. Laws block people who move to new cities from putting their children in public schools. There are restrictions on where people can invest their money. So Chinese people end up putting a lot of money in state-owned banks where the returns are feeble, says Linda Lim of the University of Michigan. LINDA LIM: So people rationally at an individual level save a lot for their retirement, for their housing, for their health care, for their children's education. ZARROLI: Beijing has acknowledged the system needs to change. But almost anything it does invites a painful trade-off. Opening up banks to foreign competition means less money will flow into state-owned banks, many of which already have a lot of bad debt. Spending more money on social services means less money to prop up state-owned businesses, and that could mean layoffs. Lim says Beijing is trying to implement reforms without doing too much damage to entrenched interests with government connections. LIM: So that's a very difficult and delicate balance between the two. It should ideally take place in a gradual manner, and, in a way, if you rush these things too much you create a lot of dislocations and shocks. ZARROLI: There have been serious missteps on the government's part. To give people a new place to invest, Beijing encouraged the growth of the stock market. That backfired when stock prices plunged. Scott Kennedy says there's also a lot of resistance to change within the government. KENNEDY: Well, giving up authority and power over economic choices is not something that the Chinese government wants to do easily. Your brain knows it, but you heart doesn't necessarily agree yet. I think that's where they are. ZARROLI: But with the global economy slowing down, China has to find new ways to grow. And that means getting Chinese consumers to help pick up the slack.

He's a coalminer in Kentucky. His industry is fading, even as the wider economy grows. The miner met us on his very first day off the job. Hey, how are you? JOE MOORE: Pretty good. Joe Moore. INSKEEP: Hey, Mr. Moore. Joe Moore wear a beard and a Tennessee Titans cap. He opened his car door, brushed aside the empty cigarette packs on the seats and drove us through Webster County in western Kentucky. Nationwide production dropped as much as 10 percent last year. Companies are filing for bankruptcy, including a big one just yesterday. We saw a sign of the trouble when Joe Moore drove us to his former workplace. MOORE: Authorized personnel. INSKEEP: That's you. You're authorized. MOORE: Well, I used to be authorized. INSKEEP: The previous day he'd signed papers confirming his termination as the mine shut down. MOORE: I don't work here anymore (laughter). INSKEEP: Coal faces unprecedented competition as well as President Obama's long-term moves against climate change. Joe Moore lost a job that, with overtime, paid him $100,000 per year or more. And as we drove, he recalled a moment during his decades of scuttling through tunnels that were often too low to stand up straight. MOORE: I had a chest cold. I was a young man then, and I went to the doctor. And they had you take your shirt off, and my back was just all ripped up, very big scratches in it. INSKEEP: From the ceiling? MOORE: Right. And he said - who's been beating you? And I said it's just from work. And he said you need to find a different occupation. INSKEEP: (Laughter). MOORE: Said you are damaging your body. I said well, great. You want to adopt me? - because I don't know of anything else I can do. INSKEEP: He stayed in the mines 39 years. We were driving away from the mine as we talked, and Moore accidentally made a left turn. MOORE: Hold on. This is my way home. That's why I turned here (laughter). INSKEEP: The force of habit was too strong to break. Webster County, Ky. , does not want to break its coal habit. Though one mine closed here, another has been producing coal since 1967. INSKEEP: We reached it by taking a steel elevator straight down. GARY THWEATT: We're 530 feet right here. INSKEEP: We rode down with Gary Thweatt, the mine supervisor. THWEATT: I still get excited every day. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEVATOR CHIME)INSKEEP: The underground tunnels spread out like a street grid. You turn left. You turn right. And at the end of one street, a machine faced a black rock wall. THWEATT: See those teeth? It's going to knock the coal down, load it in the conveyor and it'll come back the conveyor into the shuttle car. INSKEEP: In the dim light, we saw the dark glitter of coal. How much coal just came off that conveyor belt? THWEATT: About 16, 17 tons. INSKEEP: In, like, 30 seconds? THWEATT: Right - 38, matter of fact. INSKEEP: Thirty-eight seconds to be exact. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING)INSKEEP: It's a profitable business, even in this time of decline. Our producer Ashley Westerman grew up in Webster County. And in the tunnels, she saw a familiar face. THWEATT: This is Ryan Hammers. He's our section foreman. INSKEEP: Hey. How are you, Ryan? ASHLEY WESTERMAN: Oh, Ryan. THWEATT: You know Ryan? WESTERMAN: Ashley Westerman - we went to high school - we went to elementary school together, actually. THWEATT: Elementary school? WESTERMAN: Yeah. THWEATT: It's a reunion. INSKEEP: Ashley went on to college. Ryan ended up in this mine. Depending on his overtime, Ryan is likely the one who is paid more. It's attractive for those who don't mind the conditions. And many miners are used to it because their ancestors mined before them. We had dinner at the home of a coal mining family, and we talked while our host Zeann Bumpus, or Z, prepared dinner. (SOUNDBITE OF DISHES CLANGING)ZEANN BUMPUS: Didn't break a thing. INSKEEP: You need help back there 'cause. . . BUMPUS: No, I'm breaking things fine. INSKEEP: I'm breaking things fine, she said. She made us a dessert called chess bars - eggs, butter, cream cheese and so much sugar it hurts your head. Z's parents sat in the living room. They're Dan and Mary Harris. Until he retired, Dan was a coalminer, like his father and his father before that. So how long were you underground? How many hours? MARY HARRIS: A lot of time 16, 17 hours. DAN HARRIS: I've done work - I guess I went in about 1:30. M. HARRIS: And stayed till maybe 8 the next morning. D. HARRIS: No, it was about 9:30 when (laughter) they run me out. M. HARRIS: And then he'd be up and be ready to go back at noon. INSKEEP: He could hardly stand to leave work, even though he sometimes saw miners maimed or killed. Dan Harris's daughter Z was married to a miner. Z's son only briefly considered a different way of life. BUMPUS: He went to college and he stayed two days. . . INSKEEP: . . . After which he came home. BUMPUS: And not long after that, he went to the mines. . . INSKEEP: . . . Continuing a pattern as old as the United States. Webster County, Ky. , residents know fossil fuels are linked to climate change. Many do not deny the science. I know we're not helping, one miner said. But people do minimize coal's role and play up the industry's importance. We saw a bumper sticker reading, if you don't like coal, don't use electricity. It's been a winning argument - until now. HEATH LOVELL: For the first time in my career, I've actually questioned if I'll be able to retire from coal in 20 years from now. INSKEEP: Heath Lovell of Alliance Coal met us at Webster County's last mine. LOVELL: Depending on what happens in November with the presidential election, I think that will go a long way in determining what does coal's future look like over the next 10, 15, 20 years. INSKEEP: Alliance Coal blames President Obama for much of its trouble. Regulators cracked down on safety, and the president's Clean Power Plan targets electricity generated with coal. In an interview with us, the president said he understands why some people think he's waging a war on coal, but he argued the industry's real problem is competition. Surging natural gas production drove down energy prices, and that is indeed part of Webster County's story. Nearby power plants are switching from coal to gas. Which explains why laid-off miner Joe Moore had time to join us for lunch at a burger joint. UNIDENTIFIED WAITRESS: Cheeseburger, plain? MOORE: I'll take it. INSKEEP: Moore is philosophical about the president, who got Moore's vote in the first of his two campaigns. MOORE: You know, I could sit here and say - oh, he's (vocalizing nonsense), but, you know, he's done what he set out to do. I'm just caught up in it. INSKEEP: Caught up in epic economic change. Moore is following this year's campaign. He's interested in democrat Bernie Sanders and in republican Ted Cruz. Each has been cultivating blue-collar voters. Before voting, of course, Joe Moore has to work out his future. Do you have plans, or are you going to figure it out as you go? MOORE: Well, after 39 years steady going, I think I'm going to take a minute, you know, and figure some things out. INSKEEP: He does have options. His termination came with an offer of assistance if he should return to school. Then again, he might try for a job in a mine that is still open. It is not easy to let go of coal. That is a river of coal. LOVELL: Yes, it is. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   I'm Steve Inskeep with a story of a man out of work. He's a coalminer in Kentucky. His industry is fading, even as the wider economy grows. The miner met us on his very first day off the job. Hey, how are you? JOE MOORE: Pretty good. Joe Moore. INSKEEP: Hey, Mr. Moore. Joe Moore wear a beard and a Tennessee Titans cap. He opened his car door, brushed aside the empty cigarette packs on the seats and drove us through Webster County in western Kentucky. Nationwide production dropped as much as 10 percent last year. Companies are filing for bankruptcy, including a big one just yesterday. We saw a sign of the trouble when Joe Moore drove us to his former workplace. MOORE: Authorized personnel. INSKEEP: That's you. You're authorized. MOORE: Well, I used to be authorized. INSKEEP: The previous day he'd signed papers confirming his termination as the mine shut down. MOORE: I don't work here anymore (laughter). INSKEEP: Coal faces unprecedented competition as well as President Obama's long-term moves against climate change. Joe Moore lost a job that, with overtime, paid him $100,000 per year or more. And as we drove, he recalled a moment during his decades of scuttling through tunnels that were often too low to stand up straight. MOORE: I had a chest cold. I was a young man then, and I went to the doctor. And they had you take your shirt off, and my back was just all ripped up, very big scratches in it. INSKEEP: From the ceiling? MOORE: Right. And he said - who's been beating you? And I said it's just from work. And he said you need to find a different occupation. INSKEEP: (Laughter). MOORE: Said you are damaging your body. I said well, great. You want to adopt me? - because I don't know of anything else I can do. INSKEEP: He stayed in the mines 39 years. We were driving away from the mine as we talked, and Moore accidentally made a left turn. MOORE: Hold on. This is my way home. That's why I turned here (laughter). INSKEEP: The force of habit was too strong to break. Webster County, Ky. , does not want to break its coal habit. Though one mine closed here, another has been producing coal since 1967. INSKEEP: We reached it by taking a steel elevator straight down. GARY THWEATT: We're 530 feet right here. INSKEEP: We rode down with Gary Thweatt, the mine supervisor. THWEATT: I still get excited every day. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEVATOR CHIME) INSKEEP: The underground tunnels spread out like a street grid. You turn left. You turn right. And at the end of one street, a machine faced a black rock wall. THWEATT: See those teeth? It's going to knock the coal down, load it in the conveyor and it'll come back the conveyor into the shuttle car. INSKEEP: In the dim light, we saw the dark glitter of coal.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. This week, we're going to bring you a conversation I had in front of a live audience with Richard Thaler, taped on Halloween at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, D. C. Richard is a professor of behavioral sciences and economics at the University of Chicago and is a well-known author. His latest book is called \"Misbehaving: The Making Of Behavioral Economics. \"(APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: I want to start by asking Richard a real soft-ball question. Your friend whose name is Daniel Kahneman - he won the Nobel prize in economics some years ago - world-famous psychologist, brilliant author. And Danny Kahneman was once asked to describe Richard Thaler to a journalist. And he said that Richard's dominant characteristic, the thing that makes him stand out, is that Richard is lazy. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: Can you tell me, Richard, why Danny said that and also why he insists that this was a compliment? RICHARD THALER: Yeah, what's worse is A, Danny is my best friend, and B, he this was my best quality. (LAUGHTER)THALER: To this day, Danny defends this. And he defends A, that it's true, and B, that it's a compliment because he says that it means I'm only willing to work on things that are important. The truth is I'm only willing to work on things that are fun. And that's why I'm here today because I think we're going to have fun. VEDANTAM: I think that's exactly right. So I first started talking to Richard maybe about 10 years ago. Let me just ask you to give us a short introduction. What is behavioral economics and why has it made such a splash, or why has it been so controversial over the last 15 or 20 years? How is it different than garden-variety economics? THALER: You know, probably some time in your distant past all of you have had a class in economics. And you know that standard economics assumes that people are highly rational creatures capable of complex calculations, devoid of emotion, never having any self-control problems. And they're complete jerks. So I call these fictional creatures econs (ph). That's short for Homo economicus (ph). . . (LAUGHTER)THALER: . . . The Latin term. And I believe that for the last 50 or 60 years, economists have devoted themselves to studying fictional creatures. They might as well be studying unicorns because there are no econs. Well, there are a few economists I know who are close. But basically, they don't exist. And so we have very fancy models of fictional creatures. And the people I know have trouble figuring out how to divide a check if there are more than three people. . . (LAUGHTER)THALER: . . . Occasionally - just occasionally - overeat or overdrink, have trouble saving for retirement, and contrary to economic theory, some at least are willing to donate to National Public Radio. . . (LAUGHTER)THALER: . . . Which any economist will tell you is a completely irrational thing to do because you can listen to it for free. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So. . . (APPLAUSE)THALER: OK. VEDANTAM: So when I first started talking to Richard about 10 years ago, it was for a topic that was called mental accounting. And Richard explained to me that mental accounting is something that we all do in everyday life, and one of the things that I noticed is as soon as Richard started talking, I started thinking of examples from my own life where mental accounting was playing a really, really big role. Let me just start by having you tell us what mental accounting is, Richard. THALER: So a basic concept of economics is that money is fungible, which means that there are no labels on it. There's a video of Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman talking. And Gene Hackman is telling this story about when they were young actors. Hackman goes to visit Dustin Hoffman in his little apartment in Pasadena. Dustin Hoffman has asked him to borrow some money. And then Hackman goes into his kitchen, and he sees these mason jars that have labels on them. And one is rent, and one is utility, and there was nothing in the jar labeled food. (LAUGHTER)THALER: And so Hackman says, you don't need any money; you've got lots of money in all these jars. And Hoffman says, yeah, but there's nothing in the food jar. And so that's mental accounting, right? And it used to be, like, certainly in my grandparents' generation, that that's literally how people did it. But we still do it mostly in our heads. And it can make us do all kinds of funny things. VEDANTAM: So one of the things that's happened over the years is that Richard has actually played a psychotherapist for many people who come to him with their economics problems. And I'm actually going to do the same thing here. One of the things I've noticed about myself is that my wife and I, we share our finances. So we have a joint checking account. We sort of draw from the same pool of money. But I've noticed that when I go to restaurants, I really like it when my wife pulls out her credit card and pays for the bill. Now, I am effectively still paying for it. . . (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: . . . But it significantly increases my satisfaction with the meal. . . (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: . . . Not to have to pull out my own credit card. THALER: OK, so - all right, so here's something that would be even better. VEDANTAM: Yeah. THALER: Assuming you and your wife trust one another. . . VEDANTAM: Yes. THALER: . . . I recommend that you each get separate checking accounts. VEDANTAM: What? THALER: You can still have - my wife and I have this arrangement. So we each have a separate checking account and a joint checking account. And splurges - if I buy myself a new set of golf clubs that I desperately need, or she buys her fourth camera. . . VEDANTAM: Right. THALER: . . . Because she travels the world taking pictures - I don't see that. VEDANTAM: So the splurges come out of your individual checking account. THALER: Exactly. And gifts - so if your wife picks up the tab, it will come from her account. VEDANTAM: That's even better. THALER: Even better. VEDANTAM: That's really a good idea. THALER: And, I mean, this is a recipe for marital harmony. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: One of the findings of mental accounting is that people keep tabs in their head about how much money they need to make on an annual basis or a monthly basis, or even sometimes on a daily basis. And one of the things that you explained to me was this might explain why it's sometimes difficult to catch a cab on a rainy evening. Can you tell us why mental accounting might make it harder for us to catch cabs on rainy evenings? THALER: So this is a study that some friends of mine and I did a long time ago in New York. And we were taking a lot of cabs, and we would talk to the cabdrivers. And we would ask them, how do you decide how long to work? They rent the cab for 12 hours, which is a long time to drive in Manhattan. And then they have to take it back within the 12 hours. And a lot of them would say, well, what we do - I set a target. So renting the cab costs me 100 bucks, and then I have to fill the tank up. Let's say that's another 25 bucks. So I want to make a certain amount above that - say $100. And when I hit that, I go home. Now an implication of that is on days like rainy days, where there's lots of demand, they hit their target early, and they go home. Now what would an econ (ph) do? An econ (ph) would drive more on the busy days, and on the sunny day when nobody needs a cab because they're walking, he would go out for a walk himself. Again, if we go back to getting along with your spouse, imagine the guy comes home at 2 in the afternoon, and his wife says, how come you're home so early? And he says, because I didn't make any money. Right, I mean, this is not going to go over well. VEDANTAM: No it won't. Right. THALER: So you've got to go out there and drive around for three more hours, burning gas, not making any money. VEDANTAM: Right, but the interesting thing, of course, is that standard economics would predict that people actually would act rationally - that they would actually work more when the demand is higher, and they would work less when the demand is lower. And of course, what we find is exactly the opposite. THALER: Exactly. VEDANTAM: One of the interesting implications of mental accounting is that where the source of people's money ends up changing how they spend the money. So there was a study by Viviana Zelizer, I believe at Princeton University, looking at prostitutes in Oslo. And what she found is that the sex workers were willing to spend money that they received in the form of welfare checks or other kinds of, you know subsidies, on things like rent and important things. But they spent the money that they earned from sex work - they were far more likely to spend that on drugs and alcohol. The source of the money determines how you actually spend the money. I saw a clip from a video - it's called \"Welcome To Me,\" staring the comedian Kristen Wiig - about a woman who suddenly wins a huge amount of money. And I'm going to play the clip for you. And I want you to talk about this idea. So if we could play the video, please. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"WELCOME TO ME\")ISA FREELING: (As lottery announcer) Fourteen, there's 57, 15 and 54 and 39. UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: Thanks for calling the California lottery. If you're calling to report a winning, just say, I'm a winner, at any time. KRISTEN WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) I'm a winner at any time. WES BENTLEY: (As Gabe Ruskin) What's your name? WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) My name is Alice Klieg. I won $86 million. JOAN CUSACK: (As Dawn Hurley) Do you think she really won the lottery? Seriously, can someone google that? JAMES MARSDEN: (As Rich Ruskin) You must be the big winner. Hi, I'm Rich. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Me too. I want a talk show with me as the host. JENNIFER LEIGH: (As Deb Moseley) Do you want to talk about current events? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Alice Klieg) No. BENTLEY: (As Gabe Ruskin) What kind of stuff do you want to talk about? WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Me. How much will that cost? MARSDEN: (As Rich Ruskin) Fifteen million dollars. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Oh, and I want to come in on a swan boat. TIM ROBBINS: (As Dr. Daryl Moffet) You're off your meds, you're living in a reservation casino, and you're hosting your own talk show. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) It's a new era - 86-million-dollar Alice. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Stage Tech) We go live in five, four, three. . . MARSDEN: (As Rich Ruskin) What is she doing? CUSACK: (As Dawn Hurley) I think she's a little frozen. BENTLEY: (As Gabe Ruskin) You're on TV now. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Hello, I'm Alice Klieg, and welcome to me. VEDANTAM: So, Richard, why is this? Why is it that when we receive money from certain sources, the way we think about spending that money changes dramatically? THALER: You know, one of my colleagues - my fellow troublemakers - is David Laibson, who's just become the chairman of the Harvard economics department. He used to be one of my proteges. Now, you know - anyway. (LAUGHTER)THALER: Some of my friends had a roast for me a couple weeks ago because I had a big birthday. And he was telling the following story. A bunch of us were invited to Washington - must have been 15 years ago, when David was a struggling young assistant professor - and did something for the National Institute of Health. And they give us a $200 honorarium for the day. So I was saying, you know, this is ridiculous. We don't work for $200 a day. We have to go out and spend this money on dinner. And so we went out and had a good dinner - you could get quite a good dinner for $200 15 years ago. Now, David was not happy about spending $200 on dinner. And he now claims it was more like 300 when I got done with the wine. (LAUGHTER)THALER: But, you know, this was my way of thinking - I'm not going to work for $200, but I'm happy to have a good dinner as a result of helping out the NIH. VEDANTAM: Yeah. So studies have found also, for example, that if you want to reward employees at the end of the year, giving them a cash bonus is very different than giving them a vacation, that even though you are giving them the same amount of money - you're giving them, let's say, $500 as a bonus versus $500 as a vacation - people report being significantly happier when you give them the vacation than when you give them the cash. THALER: Yeah. VEDANTAM: Why is that? THALER: Well, because if you give them the vacation, they get to go guilt-free. I rediscovered this last week with my daughter, and I made a mistake. And it's a mistake I, of all people, shouldn't have made, but I had good reasons. And I was well intentioned. So my daughter's a Mets fan, and one of the Mets's pitchers happens to be a neighbor. So she was an avid Mets fan, and I thought it would be nice to buy her two tickets to one of the first-round games when her neighbor was pitching. But it was - I got this idea late. So I went online, and I found that I could get tickets for about $400. And - but I didn't have time to buy the tickets and mail them to her, so I sent her an email with a link to this website saying look, it looks like you can get tickets for 400 each. I'm going to send you $1,000. Buy two tickets on this website. And she had already expressed great excitement about getting to go to this game. So I sent her that email. I get back a text - LOL. This is just like one of the examples from your book. (LAUGHTER)THALER: If you send me $1,000, I'm not going to spend it on baseball tickets. (LAUGHTER)THALER: So - now, she would have been happy if I had sent her the tickets. For sure, they would have gone to the game. But I send her the $1,000, nothing. So I didn't send her the thousand. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: More of my conversation with behavioral economist Richard Thaler after this.

(MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Back in the 1970s, Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel conducted a series of experiments that came to be known as the marshmallow test. Small children were put in a room and told they could either get one marshmallow right away, but if they stayed in the room and didn't eat the marshmallow, they would get a second. Children who tried not to eat the first marshmallow came up with ways to distract themselves. Watching these children on video is hilarious. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPERIMENT VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All right, here's the deal - marshmallow for you. You can either wait and I'll give you another one if you wait, or you can eat it now. When I come back, I'll give another one so then you'll have two. But stay in here and stay in the chair until I come back, OK? VEDANTAM: I played Richard Thaler a video of a marshmallow test in progress where a small boy tries desperately not to eat the marshmallow placed in front of him. At one point, he leans lovingly into the marshmallow and takes a great big sniff and then sadly looks away. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPERIMENT VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: How'd you do? Did you do good? You did? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You wanted to eat it, didn't you? Yeah. So did I tell you I'd give you another one? OK. Now you can have both. VEDANTAM: The excited boy crams both marshmallows, chipmunk-style, into his mouth. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So talk about self-control, Richard. Why have classical economics ignored the idea that humans have trouble with self-control? THALER: So economic theory says that we optimize and that we always choose what's best for us, so that includes self-control. And so, you know, in these experiments, if you'd rather have two marshmallows than one, you should be willing to wait ten minutes. But, as you know, obviously, kids have less self-control than adults, so this experiment kind of exaggerate that. But what you get from those videos, those precious videos, is the real important idea, which is that self-control is work. Resisting temptation is work. This is important, you know, 30 percent of Americans are obese. Half of Americans are not saving enough for retirement. So these are enormous problems that we, as a society, face. And they are, at their core, because exerting self-control is difficult. In some of these marshmallow experiments, they used Oreos. And my favorite one of these - in one condition, there was a kid and he had three Oreos in front of him. And he could have one now, but he was looking at the three. And what he does is, as soon as the person leaves the room, he opens up the Oreos, licks out the middle and then puts them back together. (LAUGHTER)THALER: And I have a deep suspicion - these were done many years ago at Stanford - I'm pretty sure that guy is Bernie Madoff. But. . . (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: There's interesting work that you've cited by George Loewenstein and others, looking at the difference between hot and cold emotional states, which is that if you ask me right now, would you be able to resist having dessert at lunch, I would say, yeah, sure, I can probably resist having dessert at lunch. But an hour-and-a-half from now, when I'm really hungry, and I'm sitting down at the table, and there's desert in front of me, the person who I am at that point is very different than the person I am right now. THALER: Right. So, you know, we can all relate to that. We all know the hazards of going to the grocery store hungry. And let's say you're there on Thursday, and you missed lunch. And it's 6 o'clock. And you're buying dinner not just for tonight, but also for Saturday. Now, your hunger now should not affect the size of the roast you buy for Saturday. But, you know, you'll buy a bigger roast. VEDANTAM: Yeah. The other thing of course we often do sometimes when we have problems with self-control is that we try and have an external enforcer. We try and appoint somebody who will help us run that kind of self-control. This of course goes back to the old idea, the myth of Ulysses who was sailing by the sirens. He was afraid he was going to drift close to the sirens. And so Ulysses had his men bind him to the mast of his ship, so they would be able to sail close to the sirens and hear the sirens' song without actually being tempted to go toward the sirens. So people have tried variations of this on all kinds of things to try and address our - the temptations we expect to face in the future. I came by a very nice clip from the TV show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" where Larry David is essentially asked to be the enforcer for one of his friends. Take a look at the clip. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM\")SUSIE ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) So are you hungry? LARRY DAVID: (As Larry David) Starving. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green)  Good, we've got a great meal. And some fabulous desserts, which by the way, I need you to keep me away from no matter what. DAVID: (As Larry David) OK. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) Yeah, 'cause I put a lot of time into this. I need, like, a dessert referee. DAVID: (As Larry David) All right. I'm your guy. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green)  You promise? DAVID: (As Larry David) Yeah, I promise. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) OK, I'm counting on you. DAVID: (As Larry David) (Laughter)ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) (Laughter) No, I'm just going to have a bite. DAVID: (As Larry David) Oh no, no, no. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) Just a bite, come on. DAVID: (As Larry David) You know what, you told me specifically not to let you have any dessert. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) I appreciate it, Larry, but I changed my mind. DAVID: (As Larry David) Yes, yes, yes, but you said no matter what. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) But you know what? I'm changing it. And this is now I'm saying thank you for helping me, I'm going to have some cake. DAVID: (As Larry David) No, no, but you can't change it. That's why you say no matter what. This is the what. That's why you asked me and not these other people - because you knew I wouldn't let you. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) Larry, give me the cake. DAVID: (As Larry David) She told me not to let her have the cake. She said no matter what. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: So. . . THALER: That is the hot-cold empathy gap. So when she was in the cold state, she didn't want any dessert. When she was staring the desert in the face, you know, let me at it. (APPLAUSE)VEDANTAM: Thank you all so much, and thanks to Richard Thaler. (MUSIC)VEDANTAM: That was behavioral economist Richard Thaler.

I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  Welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. This week, we're going to bring you a conversation I had in front of a live audience with Richard Thaler, taped on Halloween at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, D. C. Richard is a professor of behavioral sciences and economics at the University of Chicago and is a well-known author. His latest book is called \"Misbehaving: The Making Of Behavioral Economics. \" (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: I want to start by asking Richard a real soft-ball question. Your friend whose name is Daniel Kahneman - he won the Nobel prize in economics some years ago - world-famous psychologist, brilliant author. And Danny Kahneman was once asked to describe Richard Thaler to a journalist. And he said that Richard's dominant characteristic, the thing that makes him stand out, is that Richard is lazy. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: Can you tell me, Richard, why Danny said that and also why he insists that this was a compliment? RICHARD THALER: Yeah, what's worse is A, Danny is my best friend, and B, he this was my best quality. (LAUGHTER) THALER: To this day, Danny defends this. And he defends A, that it's true, and B, that it's a compliment because he says that it means I'm only willing to work on things that are important. The truth is I'm only willing to work on things that are fun. And that's why I'm here today because I think we're going to have fun. VEDANTAM: I think that's exactly right. So I first started talking to Richard maybe about 10 years ago. Let me just ask you to give us a short introduction. What is behavioral economics and why has it made such a splash, or why has it been so controversial over the last 15 or 20 years? How is it different than garden-variety economics? THALER: You know, probably some time in your distant past all of you have had a class in economics. And you know that standard economics assumes that people are highly rational creatures capable of complex calculations, devoid of emotion, never having any self-control problems. And they're complete jerks. So I call these fictional creatures econs (ph). That's short for Homo economicus (ph). . . (LAUGHTER) THALER: . . . The Latin term. And I believe that for the last 50 or 60 years, economists have devoted themselves to studying fictional creatures. They might as well be studying unicorns because there are no econs. Well, there are a few economists I know who are close. But basically, they don't exist. And so we have very fancy models of fictional creatures. And the people I know have trouble figuring out how to divide a check if there are more than three people. . . (LAUGHTER) THALER: . . . Occasionally - just occasionally - overeat or overdrink, have trouble saving for retirement, and contrary to economic theory, some at least are willing to donate to National Public Radio. . . (LAUGHTER) THALER: . . . Which any economist will tell you is a completely irrational thing to do because you can listen to it for free. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So. . . (APPLAUSE) THALER: OK. VEDANTAM: So when I first started talking to Richard about 10 years ago, it was for a topic that was called mental accounting. And Richard explained to me that mental accounting is something that we all do in everyday life, and one of the things that I noticed is as soon as Richard started talking, I started thinking of examples from my own life where mental accounting was playing a really, really big role. Let me just start by having you tell us what mental accounting is, Richard. THALER: So a basic concept of economics is that money is fungible, which means that there are no labels on it. There's a video of Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman talking. And Gene Hackman is telling this story about when they were young actors. Hackman goes to visit Dustin Hoffman in his little apartment in Pasadena. Dustin Hoffman has asked him to borrow some money. And then Hackman goes into his kitchen, and he sees these mason jars that have labels on them. And one is rent, and one is utility, and there was nothing in the jar labeled food. (LAUGHTER) THALER: And so Hackman says, you don't need any money; you've got lots of money in all these jars. And Hoffman says, yeah, but there's nothing in the food jar. And so that's mental accounting, right? And it used to be, like, certainly in my grandparents' generation, that that's literally how people did it. But we still do it mostly in our heads. And it can make us do all kinds of funny things. VEDANTAM: So one of the things that's happened over the years is that Richard has actually played a psychotherapist for many people who come to him with their economics problems. And I'm actually going to do the same thing here. One of the things I've noticed about myself is that my wife and I, we share our finances. So we have a joint checking account. We sort of draw from the same pool of money. But I've noticed that when I go to restaurants, I really like it when my wife pulls out her credit card and pays for the bill. Now, I am effectively still paying for it. . . (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: . . . But it significantly increases my satisfaction with the meal. . . (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: . . . Not to have to pull out my own credit card. THALER: OK, so - all right, so here's something that would be even better. VEDANTAM: Yeah. THALER: Assuming you and your wife trust one another. . . VEDANTAM: Yes. THALER: . . . I recommend that you each get separate checking accounts. VEDANTAM: What? THALER: You can still have - my wife and I have this arrangement. So we each have a separate checking account and a joint checking account. And splurges - if I buy myself a new set of golf clubs that I desperately need, or she buys her fourth camera. . . VEDANTAM: Right. THALER: . . . Because she travels the world taking pictures - I don't see that. VEDANTAM: So the splurges come out of your individual checking account. THALER: Exactly. And gifts - so if your wife picks up the tab, it will come from her account. VEDANTAM: That's even better. THALER: Even better. VEDANTAM: That's really a good idea. THALER: And, I mean, this is a recipe for marital harmony. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: One of the findings of mental accounting is that people keep tabs in their head about how much money they need to make on an annual basis or a monthly basis, or even sometimes on a daily basis. And one of the things that you explained to me was this might explain why it's sometimes difficult to catch a cab on a rainy evening. Can you tell us why mental accounting might make it harder for us to catch cabs on rainy evenings? THALER: So this is a study that some friends of mine and I did a long time ago in New York. And we were taking a lot of cabs, and we would talk to the cabdrivers. And we would ask them, how do you decide how long to work? They rent the cab for 12 hours, which is a long time to drive in Manhattan. And then they have to take it back within the 12 hours. And a lot of them would say, well, what we do - I set a target. So renting the cab costs me 100 bucks, and then I have to fill the tank up. Let's say that's another 25 bucks. So I want to make a certain amount above that - say $100. And when I hit that, I go home. Now an implication of that is on days like rainy days, where there's lots of demand, they hit their target early, and they go home. Now what would an econ (ph) do? An econ (ph) would drive more on the busy days, and on the sunny day when nobody needs a cab because they're walking, he would go out for a walk himself. Again, if we go back to getting along with your spouse, imagine the guy comes home at 2 in the afternoon, and his wife says, how come you're home so early? And he says, because I didn't make any money. Right, I mean, this is not going to go over well. VEDANTAM: No it won't. Right. THALER: So you've got to go out there and drive around for three more hours, burning gas, not making any money. VEDANTAM: Right, but the interesting thing, of course, is that standard economics would predict that people actually would act rationally - that they would actually work more when the demand is higher, and they would work less when the demand is lower. And of course, what we find is exactly the opposite. THALER: Exactly. VEDANTAM: One of the interesting implications of mental accounting is that where the source of people's money ends up changing how they spend the money. So there was a study by Viviana Zelizer, I believe at Princeton University, looking at prostitutes in Oslo. And what she found is that the sex workers were willing to spend money that they received in the form of welfare checks or other kinds of, you know subsidies, on things like rent and important things. But they spent the money that they earned from sex work - they were far more likely to spend that on drugs and alcohol. The source of the money determines how you actually spend the money. I saw a clip from a video - it's called \"Welcome To Me,\" staring the comedian Kristen Wiig - about a woman who suddenly wins a huge amount of money. And I'm going to play the clip for you. And I want you to talk about this idea. So if we could play the video, please. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"WELCOME TO ME\") ISA FREELING: (As lottery announcer) Fourteen, there's 57, 15 and 54 and 39. UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: Thanks for calling the California lottery. If you're calling to report a winning, just say, I'm a winner, at any time. KRISTEN WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) I'm a winner at any time. WES BENTLEY: (As Gabe Ruskin) What's your name? WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) My name is Alice Klieg. I won $86 million. JOAN CUSACK: (As Dawn Hurley) Do you think she really won the lottery? Seriously, can someone google that? JAMES MARSDEN: (As Rich Ruskin) You must be the big winner. Hi, I'm Rich. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Me too. I want a talk show with me as the host. JENNIFER LEIGH: (As Deb Moseley) Do you want to talk about current events? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Alice Klieg) No. BENTLEY: (As Gabe Ruskin) What kind of stuff do you want to talk about? WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Me. How much will that cost? MARSDEN: (As Rich Ruskin) Fifteen million dollars. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Oh, and I want to come in on a swan boat. TIM ROBBINS: (As Dr. Daryl Moffet) You're off your meds, you're living in a reservation casino, and you're hosting your own talk show. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) It's a new era - 86-million-dollar Alice. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Stage Tech) We go live in five, four, three. . . MARSDEN: (As Rich Ruskin) What is she doing? CUSACK: (As Dawn Hurley) I think she's a little frozen. BENTLEY: (As Gabe Ruskin) You're on TV now. WIIG: (As Alice Klieg) Hello, I'm Alice Klieg, and welcome to me. VEDANTAM: So, Richard, why is this? Why is it that when we receive money from certain sources, the way we think about spending that money changes dramatically? THALER: You know, one of my colleagues - my fellow troublemakers - is David Laibson, who's just become the chairman of the Harvard economics department. He used to be one of my proteges. Now, you know - anyway. (LAUGHTER) THALER: Some of my friends had a roast for me a couple weeks ago because I had a big birthday. And he was telling the following story. A bunch of us were invited to Washington - must have been 15 years ago, when David was a struggling young assistant professor - and did something for the National Institute of Health. And they give us a $200 honorarium for the day. So I was saying, you know, this is ridiculous. We don't work for $200 a day. We have to go out and spend this money on dinner. And so we went out and had a good dinner - you could get quite a good dinner for $200 15 years ago. Now, David was not happy about spending $200 on dinner. And he now claims it was more like 300 when I got done with the wine. (LAUGHTER) THALER: But, you know, this was my way of thinking - I'm not going to work for $200, but I'm happy to have a good dinner as a result of helping out the NIH. VEDANTAM: Yeah. So studies have found also, for example, that if you want to reward employees at the end of the year, giving them a cash bonus is very different than giving them a vacation, that even though you are giving them the same amount of money - you're giving them, let's say, $500 as a bonus versus $500 as a vacation - people report being significantly happier when you give them the vacation than when you give them the cash. THALER: Yeah. VEDANTAM: Why is that? THALER: Well, because if you give them the vacation, they get to go guilt-free. I rediscovered this last week with my daughter, and I made a mistake. And it's a mistake I, of all people, shouldn't have made, but I had good reasons. And I was well intentioned. So my daughter's a Mets fan, and one of the Mets's pitchers happens to be a neighbor. So she was an avid Mets fan, and I thought it would be nice to buy her two tickets to one of the first-round games when her neighbor was pitching. But it was - I got this idea late. So I went online, and I found that I could get tickets for about $400. And - but I didn't have time to buy the tickets and mail them to her, so I sent her an email with a link to this website saying look, it looks like you can get tickets for 400 each. I'm going to send you $1,000. Buy two tickets on this website. And she had already expressed great excitement about getting to go to this game. So I sent her that email. I get back a text - LOL. This is just like one of the examples from your book. (LAUGHTER) THALER: If you send me $1,000, I'm not going to spend it on baseball tickets. (LAUGHTER) THALER: So - now, she would have been happy if I had sent her the tickets. For sure, they would have gone to the game. But I send her the $1,000, nothing. So I didn't send her the thousand. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: More of my conversation with behavioral economist Richard Thaler after this.

(MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Back in the 1970s, Stanford psychologist Walter Mischel conducted a series of experiments that came to be known as the marshmallow test. Small children were put in a room and told they could either get one marshmallow right away, but if they stayed in the room and didn't eat the marshmallow, they would get a second. Children who tried not to eat the first marshmallow came up with ways to distract themselves. Watching these children on video is hilarious. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPERIMENT VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All right, here's the deal - marshmallow for you. You can either wait and I'll give you another one if you wait, or you can eat it now. When I come back, I'll give another one so then you'll have two. But stay in here and stay in the chair until I come back, OK? VEDANTAM: I played Richard Thaler a video of a marshmallow test in progress where a small boy tries desperately not to eat the marshmallow placed in front of him. At one point, he leans lovingly into the marshmallow and takes a great big sniff and then sadly looks away. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPERIMENT VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: How'd you do? Did you do good? You did? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You wanted to eat it, didn't you? Yeah. So did I tell you I'd give you another one? OK. Now you can have both. VEDANTAM: The excited boy crams both marshmallows, chipmunk-style, into his mouth. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So talk about self-control, Richard. Why have classical economics ignored the idea that humans have trouble with self-control? THALER: So economic theory says that we optimize and that we always choose what's best for us, so that includes self-control. And so, you know, in these experiments, if you'd rather have two marshmallows than one, you should be willing to wait ten minutes. But, as you know, obviously, kids have less self-control than adults, so this experiment kind of exaggerate that. But what you get from those videos, those precious videos, is the real important idea, which is that self-control is work. Resisting temptation is work. This is important, you know, 30 percent of Americans are obese. Half of Americans are not saving enough for retirement. So these are enormous problems that we, as a society, face. And they are, at their core, because exerting self-control is difficult. In some of these marshmallow experiments, they used Oreos. And my favorite one of these - in one condition, there was a kid and he had three Oreos in front of him. And he could have one now, but he was looking at the three. And what he does is, as soon as the person leaves the room, he opens up the Oreos, licks out the middle and then puts them back together. (LAUGHTER) THALER: And I have a deep suspicion - these were done many years ago at Stanford - I'm pretty sure that guy is Bernie Madoff. But. . . (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: There's interesting work that you've cited by George Loewenstein and others, looking at the difference between hot and cold emotional states, which is that if you ask me right now, would you be able to resist having dessert at lunch, I would say, yeah, sure, I can probably resist having dessert at lunch. But an hour-and-a-half from now, when I'm really hungry, and I'm sitting down at the table, and there's desert in front of me, the person who I am at that point is very different than the person I am right now. THALER: Right. So, you know, we can all relate to that. We all know the hazards of going to the grocery store hungry. And let's say you're there on Thursday, and you missed lunch. And it's 6 o'clock. And you're buying dinner not just for tonight, but also for Saturday. Now, your hunger now should not affect the size of the roast you buy for Saturday. But, you know, you'll buy a bigger roast. VEDANTAM: Yeah. The other thing of course we often do sometimes when we have problems with self-control is that we try and have an external enforcer. We try and appoint somebody who will help us run that kind of self-control. This of course goes back to the old idea, the myth of Ulysses who was sailing by the sirens.

ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) Just a bite, come on. DAVID: (As Larry David) You know what, you told me specifically not to let you have any dessert. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) I appreciate it, Larry, but I changed my mind. DAVID: (As Larry David) Yes, yes, yes, but you said no matter what. ESSMAN: (As Susie Green) But you know what? I'm changing it. And this is now I'm saying thank you for helping me, I'm going to have some cake. DAVID: (As Larry David) No, no, but you can't change it. That's why you say no matter what.

DAVID: (As Larry David) She told me not to let her have the cake. She said no matter what. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: So. . . THALER: That is the hot-cold empathy gap. So when she was in the cold state, she didn't want any dessert. When she was staring the desert in the face, you know, let me at it. (APPLAUSE) VEDANTAM: Thank you all so much, and thanks to Richard Thaler. (MUSIC) VEDANTAM: That was behavioral economist Richard Thaler.

It's a continuation of a recent rough patch on Wall Street. Already this year, both the Dow and the S&P are down more than 7 percent. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins us now to discuss the sour mood among investors. Hey, JimJIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. SHAPIRO: How bad was it today? ZARROLI: Oh, your basic lousy damn on Wall Street - a lot of stocks down, consumer stocks down. You even saw, you know, some of the big, hot stocks of last year falling even further - Amazon down 5. 8 percent, Facebook down 4 percent, big drops in small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000, which is an index of small-cap stocks, is now down 22 percent, which is what we officially call a bear market. So it's just one of those days when, you know, nothing was good, and it's just a continuation of what we've seen in the past few days. The first week of the year was bad and now that's continuing. A lot of investors just, you know, don't see anything to be happy about. SHAPIRO: It seems so weird because we have a lot of evidence that the economy on the whole is doing pretty well. There was just a good jobs report. I mean, why is Wall Street not feeling the joy? ZARROLI: Well, the jobs report is backward-looking, of course, and investors are worried about the future. You know, I think they see we've had some weak corporate profits in a lot of different sectors, banking, especially energy. And also, you know, economies all over the world are weakening - too much capacity, not enough demand. You have hot growth countries like China slowing down and then other countries like Brazil entering a deep recession. So there's less spending, less demand for U. S. products, and that's, you know, hurting everybody. And investors look at this and say, yeah, you know, the U. S. economy may be doing OK now, but how long is that going to last? SHAPIRO: You mentioned energy, and I want to ask about oil prices, which have been falling, which seems great for consumers who are buying gas at under $2 a gallon. But why is that worrisome for investors? ZARROLI: Yeah, and that was really what seemed to touch off the real decline in stocks today. I mean, oil keeps falling. We actually had something of a rally early in the day, and then we had a report saying oil inventories were a lot higher than expected, which is something that always affects prices. And after that, we saw West Texas Intermediate falling below $30 a barrel, which is another bad milestone. And, you know, of course, this is very good for consumers, but it is a disaster for countries that depend on oil revenues. And it's also a disaster for energy companies. I mean, we're starting to see a rise in bankruptcies in the oil and gas sector, and it's hurting states that has to do - that depend on energy. SHAPIRO: Should Americans worry that this might be a sign that the U. S. economy is slowing? ZARROLI: Well, it was funny, I was watching today and a lot of stock market pundits are now sort of officially talking about recession, using that word. But you don't hear that from economists, really. And it sort of is a reminder of the fact that the stock market is not the same as the economy. I mean, you can have the stock market going down when the economy is not. There's an old saying, the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). ZARROLI: You know, so it can go down when the economy is still doing OK, and - but it is something to watch, definitely, on where the market is going. And I think right now a lot of investors are worried about what's ahead. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York where Wall Street had more steep losses today. Thanks, Jim. ZARROLI: You're welcome. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Markets tumbled today, hard. It's a continuation of a recent rough patch on Wall Street.

SHAPIRO: How bad was it today? ZARROLI: Oh, your basic lousy damn on Wall Street - a lot of stocks down, consumer stocks down. You even saw, you know, some of the big, hot stocks of last year falling even further - Amazon down 5. 8 percent, Facebook down 4 percent, big drops in small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000, which is an index of small-cap stocks, is now down 22 percent, which is what we officially call a bear market. So it's just one of those days when, you know, nothing was good, and it's just a continuation of what we've seen in the past few days. The first week of the year was bad and now that's continuing. A lot of investors just, you know, don't see anything to be happy about. SHAPIRO: It seems so weird because we have a lot of evidence that the economy on the whole is doing pretty well. There was just a good jobs report. I mean, why is Wall Street not feeling the joy? ZARROLI: Well, the jobs report is backward-looking, of course, and investors are worried about the future. You know, I think they see we've had some weak corporate profits in a lot of different sectors, banking, especially energy. And also, you know, economies all over the world are weakening - too much capacity, not enough demand. You have hot growth countries like China slowing down and then other countries like Brazil entering a deep recession. So there's less spending, less demand for U. S. products, and that's, you know, hurting everybody. And investors look at this and say, yeah, you know, the U. S. economy may be doing OK now, but how long is that going to last? SHAPIRO: You mentioned energy, and I want to ask about oil prices, which have been falling, which seems great for consumers who are buying gas at under $2 a gallon. But why is that worrisome for investors? ZARROLI: Yeah, and that was really what seemed to touch off the real decline in stocks today. I mean, oil keeps falling. We actually had something of a rally early in the day, and then we had a report saying oil inventories were a lot higher than expected, which is something that always affects prices. And after that, we saw West Texas Intermediate falling below $30 a barrel, which is another bad milestone. And, you know, of course, this is very good for consumers, but it is a disaster for countries that depend on oil revenues. And it's also a disaster for energy companies. I mean, we're starting to see a rise in bankruptcies in the oil and gas sector, and it's hurting states that has to do - that depend on energy. SHAPIRO: Should Americans worry that this might be a sign that the U. S. economy is slowing? ZARROLI: Well, it was funny, I was watching today and a lot of stock market pundits are now sort of officially talking about recession, using that word. But you don't hear that from economists, really. And it sort of is a reminder of the fact that the stock market is not the same as the economy. I mean, you can have the stock market going down when the economy is not. There's an old saying, the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). ZARROLI: You know, so it can go down when the economy is still doing OK, and - but it is something to watch, definitely, on where the market is going. And I think right now a lot of investors are worried about what's ahead. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York where Wall Street had more steep losses today. Thanks, Jim.

Now to something else we heard from the president last night. He said the United States has the strongest and most durable economy in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: More than 14 million new jobs - the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s. An unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. (APPLAUSE)GREENE: We should remember President Obama came into office as the U. S. was entering a pretty terrible recession. But many Americans are still struggling economically today. And let's bring in NPR's Scott Horsley here. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So is the president painting an accurate picture here? HORSLEY: Well, the U. S. economy is still the largest in the world. China's economy is growing faster, though, as we have been painfully reminded in recent weeks, it's not growing as fast as it was. GREENE: Right. HORSLEY: And American employers have been adding jobs for 70 consecutive months. That is the longest expansion on record. The job gains over the last couple of years were the largest since the late-1990s. And unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent during the downturn, is now down to 5 percent. Also, automakers did have a very good year in 2015, selling a record 17 and a half million cars and trucks. And the president touted the rebound in auto manufacturing as part of a broader manufacturing renaissance. Factories have added close to 900,000 jobs over the last six years. Although, factory hiring slowed last year partly in response to the sales slowdown elsewhere around the world. GREENE: Well, Scott, one other thing the president did, I mean, he sorted of pointed to the gloominess that we have been hearing from some Republicans. And this was a way - this speech - to kind of counter that argument. Let's give a listen here. (SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)OBAMA: Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. GREENE: Peddling fiction, Scott? HORSLEY: Well, the White House has been critical of Republicans for their gloomy message on the economy. And certainly by many objective measures the economy is in much better shape now than when the president came into office. There are, however, some blemishes on that record. Wage growth is still pretty sluggish at two and a half percent, although wages did grow faster than inflation last year. Participation in the labor force is somewhat depressed. That's partly, but not entirely, a result of baby boomers retiring. Overall economic growth is still pretty lackluster. And income inequality has widened. The president says those are results of long-running trends that began before the great recession and that continue today. GREENE: All right. Lots of different objective measures in some ways telling different stories at times. You know, objective measures aside, there are a lot of Americans who are still worried about the economy and many still worried about their job security. And no one seems to disagree with that. The president acknowledged that last night. So what? I suppose that the parties just can't come together on a solution? HORSLEY: Well, the president did find some common ground and highlighted a few areas of bipartisan agreement, citing, for example, worker training and education as something that's important. He praised the Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan for supporting expanded tax credits for low income workers who don't have children. Those folks don't get a lot of tax help right now. But he also highlighted very partisan disagreements about the government's role in setting the rules of the road and providing a social safety net. He highlighted the Affordable Care Act, for example. But he said, I'm guessing we're not going to agree on health care anytime soon. That's one statement of the president's that is undoubtedly true. GREENE: All right. We have been speaking about the State of the Union speech with NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks as always. HORSLEY: My pleasure, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  All right.

It was another rough day for the stock market. Today the major U. S. indexes fell more than 2 percent. At one point, the Dow was down more than 500 points. Oil closed below $30 a barrel for the first time in a dozen years. NPR's John Ydstie joins us to sort things out. Hi John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi Ari. SHAPIRO: Yesterday everybody breathed a sigh of relief when stocks rose. What caused the big selloff today? YDSTIE: Three things - China, oil and the Fed. And let's talk about China first. SHAPIRO: OK. YDSTIE: There was another big selloff in the Chinese market today. It is now down more than 20 percent from a recent high. Everybody agrees that market was overvalued so U. S. markets should be able to ignore it. But U. S. investors are rightfully concerned about a slowdown in economic growth in China. And that slowdown is behind the big drop in oil prices because a slower Chinese economy means less demand for oil. SHAPIRO: OK. Let's talk about oil prices. One the one hand, low oil prices are good for the U. S. economy because consumers have more money to spend when gas is cheap. Why is this bad for the markets, though? YDSTIE: You're right. Lower oil is a net plus for the economy. But remember, the stock market is not the U. S. economy and there are lots of big oil companies embedded in those market indexes. So when the price of oil falls, the value of their shares fall. Just this week, Marathon Oil's stock fell about 25 percent and other companies have lost ground, too. That's weighed very heavily on these market indexes. SHAPIRO: Let's talk a little bit more about the weakness in the Chinese economy. Why are investors so worried about that? YDSTIE: Well, for one thing, they're concerned about U. S. exports. And there's no doubt they've been hurt. But exports overall are a small share of the U. S. economy, and only about 7 percent of our exports go to China. On the other hand, China has been a huge engine of growth for the global economy and is a more important market for many other countries, especially commodity producers. So its slowdown is contributing to a weaker global growth. And there's a concern that could spread to the U. S. Now, the U. S. economy has been doing OK and creating a lot of jobs. But there was a weak retail spending report today, and that fueled worries about U. S. growth. SHAPIRO: John, at the beginning of this conversation, you said it's China, oil and the Federal Reserve. What's going on with the Fed? Why is this a factor? YDSTIE: Well, the Fed has been pumping money into the economy and holding interest rates low, and a lot of that money ended up in stocks over the past seven years. So the stock market has grown much faster than the economy. That's convinced lots of people that stocks were overvalued. And when you look around, there's been a big selloff not just in energy stocks but in biotech stocks and chipmakers and banks, for instance. Now, now that the Fed is raising interest rates, that cheap money that's been supporting those stocks is going away and investors are reassessing the real value of these companies, and that's pushing stocks lower. SHAPIRO: Does that suggest that the Fed is unlikely to raise rates again this year? YDSTIE: Well, there was a lot of speculation about that today. Many analysts had thought another rate hike would come in March, but they're now saying that's much less likely. SHAPIRO: Briefly - what should ordinary investors do about this? YDSTIE: Well, if you're saving for retirement, just don't check your 401(k). SHAPIRO: (Laughter). Just don't look at it. YDSTIE: It'll make for a much happier weekend.

Gun control advocates have been trying to get investors to divest from owning stock in these companies. Now the public advocate in New York City wants to include retailers in that effort. But, as NPR's Joel Rose reports, some economists doubt divestment will work. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: After years of trying and failing to push new laws through Congress, gun control advocates are targeting American firearms makers from a different angle. LEAH GUNN BARRETT: Cause the only thing they really understand is money. ROSE: Leah Gunn Barrett is a gun control advocate in New York. She's also part of a national coalition called the Campaign to Unload, which encourages individual and institutional investors across the country to pull their money out of gun stocks. BARRETT: You may not even know that your 401(k) has gun stocks in it so asking the question is very, very important not only for individuals but for public pension funds. And so it's really raising the issue and making gun stocks toxic. ROSE: Make the industry toxic enough, the argument goes, and the gun companies will feel pressure to drop their opposition to new regulations including universal background checks for gun sales. The divestment camp has claimed some victories after mass shootings in Connecticut and California. Big institutional investors like CalSTRS, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, and pension funds in New York and Philadelphia have dropped their holdings in gun companies. But the stock price of those gun companies has not gone down. In fact, since the Sandy Hook shootings in 2012, stock in Sturm Ruger and Smith & Wesson has mostly gone up. ANDREA JAMES: If it's made to be punitive, it's not going to work. ROSE: Andrea James is a firearms industry analyst at Dougherty & Co. She says gun stocks have performed well because sales have been brisk. A. JAMES: When the divestment happens I don't think it really affects the underlying business, meaning the amount of firearms they sell. So over time the stock market, you know, in a free and open market, other shareholders will come and take their place. ROSE: Including investors who want to hold gun stocks as an expression of support for Second Amendment rights. But supporters of divestment say this latest push is different because it's aiming beyond just the gun companies themselves. New York Public Advocate Letitia James is pushing the city's largest pension fund to divest from national retailers that sell firearms, including Wal-Mart, Dick's Sporting Goods and Cabela's. LETITIA JAMES: It really sends a strong moral message that public dollars should not be used to prop up an industry that has caused so much carnage on the streets of New York City and other urban centers across this nation. ROSE: James and other divestment supporters point to the success of past campaigns against the tobacco and coal industries and especially the push to end apartheid in South Africa. But even in that famous campaign, some economists question whether divestment had the kind of impact its supporters claimed. PAUL WAZZAN: Well, unfortunately, it does not have an effect. ROSE: Paul Wazzan is an economist at the Berkeley Research Group in California. He's studied the divestment campaign against companies that did business in South Africa in the 1980s and '90s. He says there was no measurable effect on their stock prices. WAZZAN: But it does generate a lot of press and interest and the political pressure starts to build, and that did ultimately have an effect. It's not what our paper was about, but I think the political pressure ultimately did have an effect on these companies.

That is the slowest pace of growth in 25 years. YUKON HUANG: Next year, they're going to say it's the lowest it's been for 26 years because its slow-down is going to continue. It's a maturing, upper-income country now. SIEGEL: That's Yukon Huang of the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He used to be the World Bank's country director for China, and he joined us to describe the major transformation that's underway in China's economy. HUANG: The manufacturing sector is shrinking and its services, its retail, financial services, health, education, they're starting to take off. SIEGEL: If I'm, say, a factory worker in a Chinese city, what would I be experiencing that reflects these changes? HUANG: Well, if you go to some of the more dynamic regions in China, particularly in the south, in Guangdong Province, you have companies which formally specialize, let's say, in shoes or in textiles. They're starting to either move to cheaper centers abroad or they're relocating their factories in the interior of China where wages are much less. This creates a lot of hardships because some people are losing their jobs, some people don't want to move and this is creating social problems in the country. SIEGEL: So a lot of Chinese workers these days would be thinking of workers in wherever - Vietnam, and thinking, their low wages are costing me my job. HUANG: Well, I think that would be a concern, but we have to remember something quite different is going on in China in terms of the employment market. Here's a country where wages have been increasing by about 10 percent to 12 percent a year for a decade and a half. You compare that with the rest of the world where people count themselves lucky if they get a wage increase of 2 percent to 3 percent. But this is starting to change. So those which are unfortunate have to find another job. They can still find another job, but in many cases the new job doesn't pay them as much as the previous one. SIEGEL: Well, these are the consequences of the move away from manufacturing that you're describing. What about the increase in service sector jobs? How would I, as a Chinese consumer, experience that these days? HUANG: Well, Chinese long ago moved up from the stage where the basic concern was trying to feed themselves. They're now very large segment of whatever you would call the middle class, perhaps 250 million of them. So they're looking for more sophisticated products. And if you go to China these days, you see lots of new malls, explosion in terms of restaurants, a lot of tourist activities. Financial services is booming. Today you read about equity markets and its collapse since the headline. The actual more dominant financial activity in China is that everyone's buying via the Internet. The Amazons that we think about here the United States, multiply that two or three times and you get what's happening in the retail sector in China. SIEGEL: And shopping via Internet there can be shopping very fast. HUANG: Shopping can be very fast. It's very easy access. The choices are enormous. If you want to buy a shoe, if you want to buy a table, you can have it delivered in two or three hours. So this is a very dramatic change in the way the Chinese buy, and this is what's happening in terms of this financial services sector in China. SIEGEL: Now, China over the past few decades has moved. Tens - or, hundreds of millions of people out of rural poverty into modern lives in cities. Does the slowdown in economic growth in China mean that that process will have to slow down also or that it can't continue, or can keep up at that pace? HUANG: This is a big question in China. Twenty years ago, China was 20 percent urban. Now it's 55 percent urban. Many of these people have gone to the large cities along the coast - the Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen. So these cities are 20 million, 25 million. Most people would think cities of 20 million, 25 million would be actually enormous, too big. So the government's saying to its citizens, you can move to smaller cities. So this is a big predicament because the best-paying jobs, demand for workers, the high productivity activities, they all lie in these big cities. So the question for the government, question for the people is, can I free up and allow people to move wherever they want to? But if they did, these very large cities would get much larger. SIEGEL: Yukon Huang, thank you very much for talking with us today. HUANG: Pleasure, thank you. SIEGEL: Yukon Huang of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   The Chinese today reported that economic growth for 2015 was 6. 9 percent. That is the slowest pace of growth in 25 years. YUKON HUANG: Next year, they're going to say it's the lowest it's been for 26 years because its slow-down is going to continue. It's a maturing, upper-income country now. SIEGEL: That's Yukon Huang of the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He used to be the World Bank's country director for China, and he joined us to describe the major transformation that's underway in China's economy. HUANG: The manufacturing sector is shrinking and its services, its retail, financial services, health, education, they're starting to take off. SIEGEL: If I'm, say, a factory worker in a Chinese city, what would I be experiencing that reflects these changes? HUANG: Well, if you go to some of the more dynamic regions in China, particularly in the south, in Guangdong Province, you have companies which formally specialize, let's say, in shoes or in textiles. They're starting to either move to cheaper centers abroad or they're relocating their factories in the interior of China where wages are much less. This creates a lot of hardships because some people are losing their jobs, some people don't want to move and this is creating social problems in the country. SIEGEL: So a lot of Chinese workers these days would be thinking of workers in wherever - Vietnam, and thinking, their low wages are costing me my job. HUANG: Well, I think that would be a concern, but we have to remember something quite different is going on in China in terms of the employment market. Here's a country where wages have been increasing by about 10 percent to 12 percent a year for a decade and a half. You compare that with the rest of the world where people count themselves lucky if they get a wage increase of 2 percent to 3 percent. But this is starting to change. So those which are unfortunate have to find another job. They can still find another job, but in many cases the new job doesn't pay them as much as the previous one. SIEGEL: Well, these are the consequences of the move away from manufacturing that you're describing. What about the increase in service sector jobs?

Commodities are basic goods sold at high volumes. One huge commodity is oil. And most of us have seen the result of oil price decline since gas prices have also plunged - good for drivers. But prices of commodities are falling too, and that may tell us something about the broader economy. David Wessel is on the line. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to the Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: Does something seem out of the ordinary here? WESSEL: Absolutely. Commodity prices rose pretty steadily from the late '90s until the financial crisis in 2008, in part because there was so much demand from China and other really booming emerging markets. Prices turned around five years ago. An index that Bloomberg compiles that tracks all sorts of commodity prices from oil to cotton to cattle is 50 percent lower than it was five years ago. But what's really unusual is the speed of the decline in the past few months. The price of copper has fallen by 25 percent in the last year. And here's just one amazing example. Two years ago, you could buy, if you wanted one, a barrel of high-sulfur North Dakota crude oil for about $48 a barrel - a year ago, $13. 50 a barrel. Last week, one firm said it would pay customers 50 cents a barrel to take the stuff away. INSKEEP: Wow. So I'm just thinking about this - basic economic supply and demand. I'm thinking if the economy around the world is growing, the commodity prices generally ought to go up. So what's it mean that they're dropping so fast? WESSEL: Well, they always go up and down. When they go up, producers expand supply and overdo it. Then they go down, and then they come to their senses and prices go up again. But the worry now is that there's something more than supply going on - that it's a sign that industrial demand for energy, minerals, other commodities is waning. The global economy may be slowing more than had been anticipated. And that's particularly worrisome because we're at a time when governments have so much debt, they can't do much to fight recession if we get another one. And central banks, like the Federal Reserve, have rates so close to zero that there's not much more they can do. INSKEEP: You know, I'm wondering how big a role China plays here. This is an economy that not only is in trouble, but that's in transition - that was trying to keep itself out of the Great Recession with massive, massive investments. And that's changing now. WESSEL: Right. One huge worry in the world economy's that China is so big, when it slows a little bit, everybody else gets affected. So China is making a transition from an industrial to a service economy. That means less demand for commodities. And the pace of growth is slowing there. They just reported the pace of growth in 2015 was the slowest in 25 years. So that reduces demand for stuff from places like Australia and Africa and Canada. So the whole world is feeling that slow-down. INSKEEP: Given all of this, though, can American consumers at least enjoy the low prices for a while? WESSEL: Well, I don't know what's going to happen with commodity prices. Sometimes when something falls a lot, it then - the markets change their mind and it goes up. But for now, if you're working in the oil industry or mining or agriculture, things are just bad. But the U. S. as a whole is more of a commodity buyer than a seller, so low prices are a plus, as long as they don't fall so fast and so far that they trigger some big financial problems. Like, we've seen some banks say that they're worried if oil prices keep falling, they're going to have a lot of bad loans.

Now that the price of crude has plunged to prices not seen since the early 2000s, Alaska is facing a $3. 5 billion deficit - that's two-thirds of the state's budget. As Alaska Public Media's Rachel Waldholz reports, lawmakers gathering in Juneau today face some unpopular choices - like charging Alaskans an income tax. RACHEL WALDHOLZ, BYLINE: To understand why Alaska has a budget problem, stop by any gas station. In Anchorage, gas sells for $2. 30 a gallon. A year and a half ago, people here were shelling out more than $4 a gallon. And that's the problem. Tour guide Lynn Jablonski stopped to fill up her car. LYNN JABLONSKI: It's a mixed feeling, right? Because it's a great thing when I look at my credit card bill, but it's not so good for the state that oil prices are so low. WALDHOLZ: As crude price have dropped, the state's state budget has tanked, so America's most oil-dependent state is trying to figure out what to do. Alaska always knew this day would come. When companies struck oil in Prudhoe Bay in 1968, leaders worried how to manage the windfall. JAY HAMMOND: You've got to remove the money, put it behind a rope where you cannot utilize it for flamboyant expenditure. WALDHOLZ: That was Jay Hammond, Alaska's governor, speaking in 1980. Hammond helped create the Permanent Fund - call it Alaska's retirement account. Each year, a share of oil money is set aside, and the fund has grown to about $50 billion. And the state isn't allowed to touch it - just the earnings. Hammond saw it as a source of income for when oil ran out. In the last 40 years, those earnings have been used for pretty much just one thing - everyone in the state receives an annual share. Last year's check was more $2,000. If the state wants to use the fund's earnings to cover the deficit, it will reduce that dividend. Back at the gas station, Dave Neibert filled up his tank. He puts his daughter's check each year into a college fund. DAVE NEIBERT: I'm a long-term Alaskan - been here my whole life. And I've gotten every one of the Permanent Fund checks. So I think they can look elsewhere. WALDHOLZ: There aren't many places to look. Alaska remains the only state without either an income or a sales tax. Even if it had both, the tax base isn't big enough - only about 740,000 people live here. With oil down, earnings on the state savings are now the single largest source of income. Alaska Governor Bill Walker wants to turn those savings into a kind of endowment to generate a fixed income. BILL WALKER: It basically puts Alaska on an allowance, and so we stop making our day-to-day decisions in government based upon the price of oil. WALDHOLZ: The plan wouldn't solve all the budget problems, so Walker has proposed new taxes, including the first income tax since 1980. That's a tall order any time, and this is an election year. The legislature's Republican majority opposes new taxes and wants deep cuts first. Democrats, like State Senator Bill Wielechowski, argue that before the state goes after Alaskans' PFD - or Permanent Fund Dividend - it should demand more of its biggest industry. BILL WIELECHOWSKI: So I have a hard time going back to my constituents and saying, yeah, I'm sorry, we've got to take your PFD so I can continue giving tax credits to the largest, wealthiest corporations in the history of the world. That's not going to fly in my district. WALDHOLZ: It's not clear it will fly anywhere. But if it does, the last frontier could find its feet a little less tied to the price at the pump.

It has driven down gas prices. But that's not the only thing it's done. Jet fuel costs are less too, and that translates into lower airfares. The U. S. government just reported the biggest price drop in international fares in nearly three years. And domestic fares are falling too. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: To find out what's going on with airfares, we went to a startup named Hopper. It makes a popular travel app for your phone. The company's headquarters is next to the MIT campus in a converted old brick industrial building. PATRICK SURRY: We're here in Cambridge, Mass. in the Kendall Boiler and Tank building. ARNOLD: So they used to actually make boiler tanks in here for heating? SURRY: I guess so, yeah. You can still see some of the machinery up in the rafters here. ARNOLD: Patrick Surry is the chief data scientist at Hopper. SURRY: We built an app that helps consumers save money on airfare. Our mission in life is to help people understand when the best time is to buy their ticket. Should they buy it now or is it likely to go down in the future and you should wait? ARNOLD: To do that, Hopper collects data on the minute-to-minute prices that airlines are offering on their tickets. So that is lots of data. SURRY: We've got an archive of several trillion price points. We collect about 2 or 3 billion priced trips every day for markets all around the world. ARNOLD: Surry says he's not looking at last-minute business travel but rather prices that everyday people pay to, say, book a vacation in advance. And for those fares. . . SURRY: Well, airfares are trending down, as we're seeing about 14 or 15 percent lower this year than we have in the past. ARNOLD: That's a big drop in prices. In fact, the federal government just yesterday released data on international travel showing a similar 15 percent drop - the biggest calendar-year decline in fares since the index was first published in 1987. And of course on more competitive routes where discount airlines such as JetBlue, Spirit and Southwest are competing, we're seeing even bigger price drops. George Hobica runs a website called Airfarewatchdog. GEORGE HOBICA: Dallas to almost anywhere in the United States, you can fly on certain days for $40 each way. San Francisco to Las Vegas is $67 round-trip. And the reason they can afford to do that is because oil prices are going down. ARNOLD: Still, based on the math of just how much jet fuel prices have dropped, Patrick Surry says that airlines could be passing on more savings to customers. But instead, he says airlines are keeping some of those profits for themselves. And actually, that's a good thing, at least according to the industry. John Heimlich is the chief economist with the trade group Airlines For America. JOHN HEIMLICH: In this industry, given its history of boom and bust, if you have one very good year, you really need to take advantage of it and get your house in order. ARNOLD: Heimlich says 9/11 and then the Great Recession coupled with high fuel prices up until recent years, all of that pummeled the airlines. Many were losing billions of dollars. And so they've needed those extra profits to dig out of a really big hole. HEIMLICH: Ten airlines combined, including their merged partners, over the last almost six years, paid down 52. 5 billion in debt. ARNOLD: Meanwhile, he says the airlines have been hiring more people and buying more planes. OK, but if you want to take a trip to Hawaii, is now the time to buy the ticket? DARA CONTINENZA: So this is a Hawaiian Airlines fare, and this is actually kind of what our algorithm shows. ARNOLD: Back at the startup company Hopper, Dara Continenza has pulled up a price projection chart for Los Angeles to Honolulu. Hopper's computers here are taking those billions of data points from recent years to predict whether fares like this one will go up or down. CONTINENZA: Right now, we're showing about 680, and we think that they're going to fall about $200 less than what we're showing now. ARNOLD: So Hoppers app is telling people, at least on this fare, now is a good time to play that game of chicken with the airlines and wait for the price to drop before you buy.

ARNOLD: Meanwhile, he says the airlines have been hiring more people and buying more planes. OK, but if you want to take a trip to Hawaii, is now the time to buy the ticket? DARA CONTINENZA: So this is a Hawaiian Airlines fare, and this is actually kind of what our algorithm shows. ARNOLD: Back at the startup company Hopper, Dara Continenza has pulled up a price projection chart for Los Angeles to Honolulu. Hopper's computers here are taking those billions of data points from recent years to predict whether fares like this one will go up or down. CONTINENZA: Right now, we're showing about 680, and we think that they're going to fall about $200 less than what we're showing now. ARNOLD: So Hoppers app is telling people, at least on this fare, now is a good time to play that game of chicken with the airlines and wait for the price to drop before you buy.

This year, the World Economic Forum coincides with what's been a wild ride on the world's markets, and China is at the center of it all. To delve into China's message there at Davos, we turn to Amy Wilkinson. She teaches at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and she also has a book out called \"The Creator's Code,\" which is all about entrepreneurs. Good morning. AMY WILKINSON: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now from where we sit, it's been kind of a scary week. Markets in Asia finished up today but had huge, huge losses earlier. China, both its entrepreneurs and its top politicians, obviously, they're trying to sell their story. They're trying to control their economy. Nobody's absolutely sure they can. Are you seeing, say, economists and entrepreneurs seeming to relax? Are people buying it? WILKINSON: So I participated yesterday in a panel on made in China. The question is what does that mean, the brand of made in China? The Chinese officials were trying to put forward the idea that made in China is a high quality type product, and the cost advantage of China is still there, and that what you see is what you get. MONTAGNE: So the message is China is trans - has to and is transforming itself. WILKINSON: Yes, I think the message that the Chinese here at Davos are putting forward is that they are in a transformational period for their economy. They're moving towards more of a consumer and consumption-driven economy. That's a bumpy ride, but they will get there. And they are taking the steps to try to make the world feel like it's going to work. MONTAGNE: You have spent a lot of time interviewing Chinese entrepreneurs. I'm wondering what characteristics you've found in them and, you know, what you draw from those conversations about China's future. WILKINSON: I feel very encouraged about the innovation economy in China. In fact, if you look at some of the examples, WeChat, their messaging and text voice company, it's an unbelievable innovation platform where you could order a car, find a date, make a doctor's appointment, order food, track your fitness goals. It is really ahead of the United States in many ways. And so, you know, an example like that or EHang, which is a drone company, the Chinese have designed a drone that can actually fly a person in it. We don't see that in the United States, and so the innovation economy in China is certainly rapidly moving forward. MONTAGNE: And generally speaking, what is the mood there this week in Davos? Because again, it has been a rough few weeks. WILKINSON: It has been an up-and-down few weeks, and I would say the commentary is coming in from all different angles here. Some people are doom and gloom. Some people are quite optimistic. It really depends on who you are speaking with here. MONTAGNE: All right, well, thank you very much for joining us.

S. companies can do with Iran now that international sanctions have been eased. Even as other countries relax the rules, there are still U. S. trade laws on the books aimed at pressuring Iran on human rights and links to terror. American companies can now import things like pistachios and carpets, but many are eager for more opportunities. And as NPR's Jackie Northam reports, they're turning to their lawyers for answers. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Zachary Brez is a sanctions and international risk lawyer at Ropes and Gray in New York. He says he's been swamped with calls since the nuclear deal lifted U. N. economic sanctions against Iran last weekend. ZACHARY BREZ: Since Saturday, it's been a little nuts. NORTHAM: Brez's phone lines have been lit up with clients asking about the possibility of doing business in Iran. BREZ: On Tuesday, I was on the phone with clients from 8 a. m. through 11 p. m. , advising on the issues, thinking about next steps, thinking about how it's going to impact their business and trying to give them some guidance on where to go from here. NORTHAM: The problem is that American companies still face more restrictions on trade with Iran than other countries. That's because of U. S. sanctions still in place, and the government will go after companies violating those sanctions. But the Treasury Department did loosen some restrictions on what U. S. companies can do through foreign subsidiaries. Brez is fielding calls from an array of industries. BREZ: Medical device commodities, pharma, retail, shipping, you name it. NORTHAM: Brez says navigating the sanctions can be tricky. For example, any Iranian employee or a vendor, even a customs officer, could be on the list of banned individuals, a list that's updated by the Treasury Department every night. BREZ: And that list reflects who you can and cannot do business with. And while over the weekend some 200 names were removed from it, there are still another 5,000 names that are on it. NORTHAM: There are other challenges in dealing with Iran. Corruption is endemic, U. N. sanctions could snap back if Iran defaults on its nuclear agreement, and European and Asian companies face fewer restrictions, giving them an edge. It makes you wonder if doing business in Iran is worth it. BREZ: That's literally the million dollar question. Iran, at least anecdotally, is a country with Western tastes for the arts, for entertainment, for retail with a young population that has money to spend. Some consider it maybe the last untapped developing economy. NORTHAM: Brez tells clients they better make sure any venture is going to be worth the money. BREZ: There's a lot of ways to have a foot fault, and so I often say to clients, look, there's a lot of ways you're going to mess this up, lot of ways you get can into trouble. It's not worth doing it for $10,000. NORTHAM: Brez says some clients will tell him if there's even a 1 percent chance they'll get in trouble, they won't do it. BREZ: I've had other clients who say, it's just as risky for me to do business in Illinois or in New Jersey, I might as well do business in all the markets in the world where I've got a chance to make a buck. NORTHAM: Brez says those business folks are obviously more willing to take a risk than the lawyers who advise them. Jackie Northam, NPR News.

Drivers love the savings, but those working to stop urban sprawl say cheap gas is hurting their efforts. From member station WOSU, Mandie Trimble reports. MANDIE TRIMBLE, BYLINE: At $1. 22 a gallon, a gas station on Columbus' southwest side is drawing customers from all parts of the city. Stan Cartwright drove there from across town. STAN CARTWRIGHT: I came here for the gas price. I live on the east side and so, you know, I had to make a little bit of a commute, but it was worth it. TRIMBLE: The bargains aren't just in Columbus. Drivers all around the state are saving money. Gasbuddy. com petroleum analyst Patrick DeHaan. PATRICK DEHAAN: Prices in Ohio tend to be very, very competitive. TRIMBLE: DeHaan says demand is weak because, well, it's winter - think snowstorms. And Canada, just on the other side of Lake Erie, has dirt cheap crude oil. DEHAAN: The region's refineries have been doing a very good job at processing. Some of the Canadian varieties of crude oil that are being processed cost today as little as $11 to $12 a barrel, and that is incentivizing them to process as much as possible, thereby increasing gasoline supply, which is, yes, weighing on prices. TRIMBLE: So what are the upsides for Columbus? For one thing, consumers have more to spend, like Scott Stewart who was also buying gas the other day. He hopes to use his savings to spread more money around at other businesses. SCOTT STEWART: Going out to dinner with my family, I'll - even if it's just ordering pizza or if we're going to the movies, I'll spend it. TRIMBLE: And it's not just consumers who are saving. Bill LaFayette, owner of Regionomics, a Columbus economic analysis firm, says the cheap gas has lowered costs for grocery stores, distributors and warehouse companies. BILL LAFAYETTE: That means that your profits go up and you might be able to pass those savings along to your customers and attract more of them. TRIMBLE: But not everyone here is thrilled to see cheap gas. CLEVE RICKSECKER: Low gas prices are a double-edged sword, aren't they? TRIMBLE: Cleve Ricksecker directs two downtown Columbus Special Improvements Districts. RICKSECKER: People love saving money, but low energy prices, low gas prices are a nightmare for cities. TRIMBLE: Columbus has made great strides in recent years in attracting more residents and businesses downtown. Now Ricksecker fears a reversal. RICKSECKER: With the fall of gas prices, in a place like Columbus and most Midwestern cities, it really is going to encourage more sprawl. TRIMBLE: Sprawl can mean more traffic jams and air pollution, but he says only a spike in the price of gas would change the equation when people are making decisions about where to live and work.

But the island commonwealth is facing a storm of a different sort, a financial one, some $72 billion in debt. Today, there was a little good news for Puerto Rico. Its largest power utility reached a deal with lenders to keep it from defaulting on some debt, at least through February 12. Some had warned a default for the utility could have led to electricity blackouts for the island where 3. 5 million people live. Despite the deal, the agency's future remains uncertain. Because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, the U. S. Congress plays a major role in the island's affairs, and lawmakers are divided about what to do. We wanted to know more, so we've called Rosario Rivera. She is an economist, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. And she joins us by phone from Caguas, Puerto Rico. Professor Rivera, thank you so much for speaking with us. ROSARIO RIVERA: Thanks to you for the invitation. MARTIN: So how did it get to this point? Can you explain that in a way that we can understand if we haven't been following this closely? RIVERA: Wow. Well, you started saying that this was a storm of financial proportions. Well, it all started with a storm of economic proportions. And this financial crisis is just an expression of a deeper crisis, which is the collapse of the economic structure since 2006 that we hit a recession. MARTIN: Let me ask you this, though. It's been reported that Puerto Rico has been using the debt that it owes on bonds to make it look as if it had a balanced budget for some time now. Why is that? RIVERA: Well, because there is a part in our constitution that requires that we must present a balanced budget every end of fiscal year. So if there is a deficit, you should cover it with either more taxes or cutting spending or issuing debt. So what have been happening in the past, maybe, 20 years is that we have been covering those deficits strictly with debt - strictly with debt. And it just hits us in the face that all the debt that we have accumulated is bigger than our capacity to raise taxes. MARTIN: How has this been playing out there? I know that we are seeing, you know, a lot of out-migration. I know that people from island who can have been leaving and trying to get jobs in other places. But how else are you seeing it play out for people who are living there who are staying? RIVERA: It's very difficult because the weight of the tax system is only on the shoulders of the working class, and that is a shrinking class. So it's very hard on us. MARTIN: The creditors point out that the government issued $120 million in Christmas bonuses in December to government employees while the island is missing other debt payments. Can you talk a little bit about that? RIVERA: We can no longer do those things because those are politically motivated decisions. OK? I have mixed feelings on that issue because $120 million on Christmas bonuses in a time where the economy is not moving - it might be of a little help. But still, $120 million that don't go into the economy - well, we don't have them either in the treasury department. So it's those kind of decisions that have brought us here. MARTIN: Here on the mainland, the Republicans in Congress seems to be inclined to ask the federal government to take over Puerto Rico's finances. The Democrats in Congress seem to be inclined to allow the commonwealth to restructure and shed some of the debt through bankruptcy, which the federal law currently prohibits. What would be the reaction to those various scenarios there in Puerto Rico? Do people - is either of those scenarios considered more appealing than the other? RIVERA: Well, the scenario of bankruptcy is considered more appealing to us because it might make us able to pay attention to the economy. The other scenario, it means the return to the relationship previously of the conception of the commonwealth and the new relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. It would mean that we are not, basically, to be able to dictate public policy anymore. But right now, the situation is so, so stressed up that what we haven't had is either we restructure or either we default or either we just close government or just cut so drastically the public services that we are going to have a social crisis in Puerto Rico as we have never seen before. MARTIN: That's economist Rosario Rivera. She is a professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey, and she was kind enough to join us from Caguas, Puerto Rico. Professor Rivera, thank you so much for speaking with us once again. RIVERA: Thanks to you. Have a good afternoon.

The lousy performance of the stock market so far this year suggest a coming recession. But a closer examination by NPR's John Ydstie suggests that doesn't seem likely. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: As the old saying goes, the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. In other words, sharply falling stock markets are crying wolf about half the time. Dyke Messinger runs a small manufacturing company in Salisbury, N. C. He thinks stock investors have been overreacting during this sell-off. DYKE MESSINGER: It is bizarre to me when we see what we believe is good core strength in the U. S. market. YDSTIE: Messinger's market is the construction industry. His company, Powercurbers, manufactures machines that contractors use to build curbs and gutters for housing developments and commercial buildings. MESSINGER: Everybody is a bit on pins and needles due to the changing world economy. But there's still pent-up demand for housing and commercial construction. YDSTIE: Those sectors performed weakly in the U. S. coming out of the recession but are doing much better now. Messinger's business is actually a good reflection of the situation facing many U. S. manufacturers. He exports a lot of his machines. About 30 percent of his sales are to international customers, including oil-producing countries in the Middle East, so the plunge in oil prices has hurt his business. His international sales have fallen sharply, so he knows the global economy can hurt as growth. MESSINGER: I know a lot of what happens in the United States depends upon what's going on in China and other countries. But if I had some spare money, I think I'd be buying U. S. stocks. YDSTIE: Messinger says, for his company, growth in the U. S. economy will more than offset lost business abroad. Economist Sara Johnson also believes the U. S. stock market is not accurately predicting the U. S. economy in 2016. SARA JOHNSON: I think financial markets have overreacted. YDSTIE: Johnson is senior research director for global economics at IHS. She points to strong U. S. job growth as evidence the domestic economy remains on track despite global weakness. And she says concerns that the U. S. is vulnerable to the slow-down in Chinese growth are overblown. JOHNSON: While it certainly is creating some turmoil in financial markets, the real economic consequences for the U. S. are limited. YDSTIE: For one reason - total exports represent only about one-eighth of the U. S. economy, and less than 10 percent of those exports go to China. So the vast majority of U. S. economic activity is generated inside U. S. borders. And Johnson sees a positive picture for this year, helped by the deep decline in oil prices. She acknowledges that plummeting oil prices hurt the U. S. economy last year, decimating energy companies and sparking huge layoffs. But she says 2016 will be different. JOHNSON: The U. S. is a net importer of crude oil, so the drop in prices is a substantial gain to U. S. consumers. YDSTIE: That's been the conventional wisdom, but some economists have begun to doubt that low oil prices are a net positive for the U. S. economy. After all, because of the shale revolution, the U. S. has become the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas. That means energy price drops have a bigger negative impact on American companies and workers than before.

It shut down cities and towns from Kentucky to Long Island. It even earned the nickname Snowzilla. But it probably won't be remembered as a major economic event. NPR's Yuki Noguchi explains why. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Scott Bernhardt can make an educated guess about how much a crippling blizzard is likely to cost. He factors in historic data about retail spending, productivity and previous storms. SCOTT BERNHARDT: New York City, for example - the basic metric up to the first three or four inches is a million dollars an inch. NOGUCHI: Bernhardt is president of Planalytics, a group that studies the economic impact of the weather. He says the fact that last week's blizzard hit the East Coast over a weekend meant it was less disruptive and costly. BERNHARDT: It could've been far, far worse had it hit in December, had it hit on a weekday. All of those things would've been far worse. NOGUCHI: Bernhardt says it will take a month for cities to tally their plowing costs and longer for the insurance industry to get a sense of property damage, especially along flooded parts of the Jersey Shore. But so far, he estimates Snowzilla caused an $850 million economic loss. That only includes losses that won't be made up when the effects of the snow have cleared. BERNHARDT: If you were unable to get on a flight on Saturday but were able to get on on Monday, we don't count that. NOGUCHI: Cost estimates very. Moody's Analytics $3 billion estimate doesn't include infrastructure damage but includes lost productivity that won't be made up through overtime or telework. Chris Christopher is director of Consumer Economics at IHS Global Insight. He says people who work in retail and restaurants sustained the biggest losses. CHRIS CHRISTOPHER: Hourly wages - those people won't get paid. NOGUCHI: Or, as he puts it, no one is going to go out and order two dinners to make up for the one they didn't eat. He estimates losses will reach about $2 billion - not enough to make a dent in the nation's quarterly economic numbers. He says Snowzilla's damage doesn't compare to hurricane Sandy or even last year's polar vortex, a bitter cold streak that lasted weeks. He admits, however, that estimating weather cost is not an exact science. CHRISTOPHER: There's a lot of guessing of what we're doing here. NOGUCHI: For example, how many people were able to telework during and after the storm? And while stores were closed and many people stayed home, power and Internet access remained on for most households. CHRISTOPHER: We do expect e-commerce retail sales to sort of pick up a little bit in January because of this.

The French company Total says it will buy crude from the National Iranian Oil Company. There's already a glut of oil on the market. Many Americans are filling their gas tanks for less than $2 a gallon these days. The government says overall, drivers saved $100 billion on gas last year. You might think that would be good for the U. S. economy. Actually, it might not be, as NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Can you fill it up with regular, please? OK. I just pulled in to fill up my car with gas, and it's a-buck-75 a gallon, which is super awesome. Wait to minute. Or is it? VIPIN ARORA: What I've been asking for the last couple years is, is it possible that lower oil prices could actually hurt the U. S. economy? ARNOLD: That's Vipin Arora. He's an economist with the U. S. Energy Information Administration, and he's about to rain on our cheap gas parade. He says this is his research. It's not the government's official word on the matter. But he's finding that cheap gas might be bad for America. Now, just asking that question is. . . ARORA: Completely the opposite of the way most of us have been trained to think about this and have thought about it for years. And I think the answer could be yes, that lower oil prices could actually hurt the U. S. economy. ARNOLD: That's because drivers, of course, like cheap gas, but. . . ARORA: The guy sitting on the oil rig in Texas doesn't really like cheap gas. That's really the problem. And then all the folks that are supplying them with materials and the hotels that have set up shop and the restaurants that have gone there. . . ARNOLD: Arora analyzed government data, and he says what's changed is that the oil and gas industry as a share of GDP has about doubled in the past decade. And now that it's gotten so big, it's changed this basic equation about whether cheap gas overall is a good thing. ARORA: The benefits to consumers could be around 140 billion from gasoline savings. But the losses on the other side due to lower production, less investment, less buildout of infrastructure could be around that amount. So we're kind of at a wash. ARNOLD: This might help to explain why the economy still isn't exactly charging forward even with the stimulus of cheap energy. But Arora himself stresses that this question needs more study. The research firm Moody's Analytics says its analysis finds that cheap oil and gas are still a net positive, and plenty of experts remain in that camp. Philip Verleger is an economist and consultant who tracks energy markets. PHILIP VERLEGER: The bottom line is the United States economy is much better off with low-price energy than it would be with high-price energy. ARNOLD: But then why isn't the economy getting more of a boost? The government says the average household saved $700 last year on cheaper gas. But the Commerce Department also says 2015 had the weakest retail sales growth in six years. So why not more growth from that extra spending money? Philip Verleger. . . VERLEGER: I think the mistake everybody makes when they say that there's been no impact from the low price of energy is to fail to sort of understand that the economy would be much worse off right now had we not had this decline in the price of oil. ARNOLD: And then there's this question. Oil prices are down, but why? JIM BIANCO: There's an old adage I've heard that the day that the price of oil falls, you might not like the reason. ARNOLD: Jim Bianco is president of Bianco Research. He says a slowdown in China and elsewhere around the world is driving down the price of not just oil but other commodities, too - copper, aluminum. And some investors are worried that the global slowdown will hurt the U. S. , too. ARNOLD: The fear is it's part of a larger whole. You cannot look at it in a vacuum. ARNOLD: But so far, there's not a lot of evidence that the U. S. is getting sucked into all that trouble abroad. Job growth in the U. S. remains pretty solid. The economic recovery here is continuing. And some analysts think we might actually see a bigger boost from cheaper energy later this year. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

VERLEGER: I think the mistake everybody makes when they say that there's been no impact from the low price of energy is to fail to sort of understand that the economy would be much worse off right now had we not had this decline in the price of oil. ARNOLD: And then there's this question. Oil prices are down, but why? JIM BIANCO: There's an old adage I've heard that the day that the price of oil falls, you might not like the reason. ARNOLD: Jim Bianco is president of Bianco Research. He says a slowdown in China and elsewhere around the world is driving down the price of not just oil but other commodities, too - copper, aluminum. And some investors are worried that the global slowdown will hurt the U. S. , too. ARNOLD: The fear is it's part of a larger whole. You cannot look at it in a vacuum. ARNOLD: But so far, there's not a lot of evidence that the U. S. is getting sucked into all that trouble abroad. Job growth in the U. S. remains pretty solid. The economic recovery here is continuing. And some analysts think we might actually see a bigger boost from cheaper energy later this year.

Today, he's in France where he's been shopping for cars, planes and other goods. We're going to hear now from a French-Iranian lawyer who's been representing French companies in their negotiations with Iran, Ardavan Amir-Aslani. Mr. Amir-Aslani, welcome to the program. ARDAVAN AMIR-ASLANI: Thank you very much. Thank you for having. SIEGEL: And let's talk first about cars. Peugeot evidently plans to start manufacturing 200,000 cars a year near Tehran. How important is the Iranian market to Peugeot? AMIR-ASLANI: It is an important. As a matter of fact, prior to the sanctions being imposed upon Iran in relation to the nuclear quest of this country, Peugeot was massively involved in Iran. It was the second-largest market. SIEGEL: How long ago did they leave? AMIR-ASLANI: They were out since 2012. SIEGEL: So I assume that the commercial infrastructure, to resume business, is pretty well still there in Iran. AMIR-ASLANI: I don't think that one can talk about commercial infrastructure in Iran. As a matter of fact, doing business with Iran is still extremely difficult. We should remember that only nuclear-related sections have been removed. All U. S. sanctions for terrorism, for human rights issues are still in place, which basically forbids all U. S. persons, whether entities or individuals, based in the United States from getting involved in Iran. This has, also, an impact on the banking sector because, you know, French banks are very weary of getting involved in Iran. They're scared of American sanctions. I mean, they have been strong hit by the United States. BNP Paribas, the - France's largest bank had to pay $9 billion penalty for its involvement with Iran. So although the sanctions have been removed, French banks and European banks in general are very hesitant in relation to the Iranian market. SIEGEL: The nuclear agreement with Iran provides for a re-imposition of sanctions if Iran commits violations. Do the deals that are being discussed - do these strike you as arrangements that the French would be willing to pull away from if there were such a violation? AMIR-ASLANI: They have to, of course, take this into consideration. If the snapback clause were to be enforced, this would imply that this would have to stop until sanctions are removed again. So it is an issue. The Iranians, from an ideological point of view, do not want any references to sanctions made in the contractual framework. So what everybody is trying to understand is how they can (unintelligible) this issue. And there is belief that the notion of force majeure - legal term - it talks about acts of God, such as, you know, earthquakes and that kind of stuff - may cover this eventuality. SIEGEL: Is this a huge breakthrough day for business between Iran and France, or is this an expression of intentions but there are so many obstacles in front of the two countries that it's possible little will come of it? AMIR-ASLANI: No. There are obstacles out there, and the obstacles are quite substantial. But this is the first time ever that the current Iranian president has traveled to Europe. A couple of months ago, it was basically out of the question for any French company to sign any kind of a contract with Iran because of the sanctions. Now here he is, back in town, signing deals with Airbus, the largest European aircraft manufacturing company, with Vinci SA (ph), the largest construction company in the world. It's going to be a landmark event. It's going to milestone as far as the regions of Iran and Europe are concerned. SIEGEL: Are the French confident that it's really Mr. Rouhani who calls the shots here and that they can do business with Iran without having an understanding with the supreme leader who really seems to run things in Iran? AMIR-ASLANI: The French, as well as everybody else in Europe, understands that genuine power and authority and absolute authority and absolute veto power - whatever decision the Iranian government's going to make resides solely with the supreme leader. But they also know the supreme leader. But they also know that a supreme leader is behind Rouhani and his reforming moderate campaign. At the end of the day, everyone is making the bet that all the centers of power in Iran are behind the current government of Rouhani because without him being able to open up the country, basically speaking, the regime is doomed. SIEGEL: Mr. Amir-Aslani, thank you very much for talking with us. AMIR-ASLANI: Thank you for having had me. SIEGEL: That's Ardavan Amir-Aslani. He's a Franco-Iranian lawyer who represents French companies turning to Iran. He spoke with us from Paris.

NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The president made the announcement at an event celebrating the seventh anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The law extended the period in which a pay discrimination suit can be filed. But he says that's only part of the equation.

That's where we try to understand stories we'll be hearing more about by parsing some of the words associated with those stories. And two words we think we might hear this week are full employment. And the reason is that later this week, the Labor Department will release the latest jobs data. That's expected to show that employers added even more workers in January. So this week, full employment is a phrase that economists use to explain how the job market recovers from a recession. But NPR's senior business editor, Marilyn Geewax, is here to tell us why full employment doesn't tell the full story for millions of Americans who are still out of work or people looking for something better than part-time work. Marilyn, thanks so much for joining us. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. It's good to be with you. MARTIN: So what is full employment? GEEWAX: Well, that phrase basically means that the number of people seeking jobs is in balance with the number of job openings. So it doesn't mean that unemployment is zero - that's never realistic - but you can get pretty low. MARTIN: So if economists don't mean zero unemployment when they use the phrase full employment, what do they mean? GEEWAX: (Laughter) So - well, in their math, it's about 4. 6 to 5 percent because that's where you have churn in the market. Some people are quitting, some people are getting hired. But there's churn, but not despair. And in December, we saw the national rate was 5 percent, and a lot of predictions are that it'll be 4. 6 percent by the middle of the year. So bingo, we're there. MARTIN: But does that mean that most people who want a job can get one? In fact, we've already seen stories, for example, in the media about how certain workers are still having a really difficult time finding a job. Like minority teenagers, for example - the unemployment rate is quite high. Women over a certain age, the unemployment rate is still quite high. Is it really fair to use the term full employment when that doesn't really seem to match the reality that a lot of people are experiencing? GEEWAX: Those words can hit hard, and they can hurt because it sounds like well, you're - you must be doing something wrong. But really, unemployment is very regional. In West Virginia, I looked at some statistics, there are counties where the unemployment rate is 13 percent. That's Depression level. You know, and meanwhile in California's Silicon Valley, there's virtually no unemployment. And as you say, you point out that the difference is based on age - black teenagers, unemployment rate is 21 percent. For women of any color, if you're over 50, studies show you have a tough time getting back into the workforce. You become long-term unemployed. It can take months, years. And besides age and location, more than anything, education determines your unemployment rate. For college graduates, it's 2. 3 percent unemployment. For high school dropouts, 7 percent. So that's a huge difference. MARTIN: So before we let you go, is what economists now call full employment something that a lot of Americans are going to still experience as something very unsatisfying? GEEWAX: Right, exactly. The jobs (laughter) you know, if you're a 30-year-old with a college degree and a U-Haul, you are all set. You can find jobs. If you want to go to night school and you want to move, you can be part of that full employment economy. But the reality for a lot of people is that's very hard, especially women in their 50s. They tend to be at the center of kind of an ecosystem financially, emotionally, where they have aging parents depending on them, children depending on them, grandchildren. So it's tough to move, and that's why it hurts to hear those words like full employment. MARTIN: That's NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Marilyn, thanks so much.

The Labor Department reported that 151,000 jobs were added in January. That's fewer than expected, but at the same time, the unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Earlier today, President Obama walked into the briefing room to crow somewhat about the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: The United States of America right now has the strongest and most durable economy in the world. I know that's still inconvenient for Republican stump speeches as their doom and despair tour plays in New Hampshire. I guess you cannot please everybody. GLINTON: There was a lot of good news in the report. Hours were up, and pay went up. That hasn't happened in years. But - now, come on, with this economy, you were expecting a but, weren't you? IMARA JONES: One of the problems is that we continue to have a tale of two economies. GLINTON: Imara Jones is an economist and writer. JONES: We have an economy that is mostly true for people who are white, have good educations and are tied to those sectors that are flourishing in the global economy. And then we have the economy of everyone else that has been left out and left behind. GLINTON: One of the groups left behind - African-Americans. The unemployment rate for African-American men is twice what it is for whites and it actually went up last month. Lowell Blackmon is 20 years old. He's working to get a GED, and he's looking for a job. LOWELL BLACKMON: Right now, any type of job that, you know - that can pay me. I'm good with my hands so I like to work a lot 'cause they got a lot of jobs out here. You just got to have your stuff and be able to do it. GLINTON: Valerie Johnson is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. She says part of the reason that the unemployment rate for blacks went from 8. 3 percent to 8. 8 percent is because more blacks were looking for work. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In the audio of this story, we misidentify economist Valerie Wilson as Valerie Johnson. The name identifiers in the transcript have been corrected. ]VALERIE WILSON: Perhaps people who were previously unemployed, you know, were encouraged by last month's numbers and are now looking for employment. GLINTON: And so you think that that 8. 8 is a good sign? WILSON: I will never call 8. 8, (laughter), percent unemployment good but it's moving in the right direction. GLINTON: Johnson says there is some good news for everyone in this jobs report. WILSON: We still maintain that roughly 2 to 1 ratio between black and white unemployment. So that disparity is very persistent and it's present whether we're in a recession or whether we're in a recovery. It's present at all levels of education, so college graduates have a nearly 2 to 1 unemployment rate ratio. GLINTON: Gwendolyn Cole is one of the workers headed in the right direction, she hopes. She's been out of a job for two years but now she's got an interview with the utility company Pepco. GWENDOLYN COLE: So I'm so happy about it 'cause I did 15 years with D. C. Public Schools and then I turned around and did 15 years as a home child care provider. So I went into electronics, and it's a wonderful field because it's more data entry, customer service. GLINTON: Cole's work history shows why many African-Americans are struggling to make their way out of the last recession, says Imara Jones. JONES: African-Americans are more likely to be teachers and firefighters and police than their white counterparts in part because of the strong antidiscrimination laws that exist for government jobs that you don't have in the private sector. GLINTON: Jones says there is still a lot of good news, but a lot of people, especially African-Americans, aren't feeling it yet. JONES: Once you have labor force participation going up, unemployment coming down, wages going up and hours going up, that's the sign of a recovery, but we're not there yet. GLINTON: But all the economists say we're getting closer, one little step at a time. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

I'm good with my hands so I like to work a lot 'cause they got a lot of jobs out here. You just got to have your stuff and be able to do it. GLINTON: Valerie Johnson is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. She says part of the reason that the unemployment rate for blacks went from 8. 3 percent to 8. 8 percent is because more blacks were looking for work. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In the audio of this story, we misidentify economist Valerie Wilson as Valerie Johnson. The name identifiers in the transcript have been corrected. ] VALERIE WILSON: Perhaps people who were previously unemployed, you know, were encouraged by last month's numbers and are now looking for employment. GLINTON: And so you think that that 8. 8 is a good sign? WILSON: I will never call 8. 8, (laughter), percent unemployment good but it's moving in the right direction. GLINTON: Johnson says there is some good news for everyone in this jobs report. WILSON: We still maintain that roughly 2 to 1 ratio between black and white unemployment. So that disparity is very persistent and it's present whether we're in a recession or whether we're in a recovery. It's present at all levels of education, so college graduates have a nearly 2 to 1 unemployment rate ratio. GLINTON: Gwendolyn Cole is one of the workers headed in the right direction, she hopes. She's been out of a job for two years but now she's got an interview with the utility company Pepco. GWENDOLYN COLE: So I'm so happy about it 'cause I did 15 years with D. C. Public Schools and then I turned around and did 15 years as a home child care provider. So I went into electronics, and it's a wonderful field because it's more data entry, customer service. GLINTON: Cole's work history shows why many African-Americans are struggling to make their way out of the last recession, says Imara Jones. JONES: African-Americans are more likely to be teachers and firefighters and police than their white counterparts in part because of the strong antidiscrimination laws that exist for government jobs that you don't have in the private sector. GLINTON: Jones says there is still a lot of good news, but a lot of people, especially African-Americans, aren't feeling it yet. JONES: Once you have labor force participation going up, unemployment coming down, wages going up and hours going up, that's the sign of a recovery, but we're not there yet. GLINTON: But all the economists say we're getting closer, one little step at a time. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

There are lots of reasons for the gender gap. But Martin says a stubborn small part is still discrimination.

LUDDEN: States are trying to combat that unconscious bias in all kinds of ways. At least five have banned companies from retaliating if workers talk about their pay and compare notes.

It's the last one before the New Hampshire primary. Throughout the campaign season, NPR's politics team has been fact checking what the candidates are saying. It's a feature we call Break It Down. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: For our friends in the press who place a high premium on accuracy, let me say - there you go again. I can't help it. There you go again. MARTIN: While a lot of attention was focused on the arguments over experience - with Sen. Marco Rubio taking hits from the governors on stage - a lot of policy issues were debated, including discussion of the candidates' various tax plans. Here's Donald Trump in the debate last night on ABC News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations. MARTIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been digging into all this. She's here in the studio now. So Donald Trump says the U. S. is the most taxed country in the world. Is he right? DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: No. (Laughter) Flat out no. So the best data on this is from the OECD, which is a group of mostly advanced economies. And according to them, when you're looking at countries with the highest tax rates, the U. S. is about middle of the pack. And if you look at tax revenue, how much the governments take in, the U. S. is actually close to the bottom of the pack. And this is tax revenue as a share of GDP. So that's at about 26 percent in the U. S. compared to Denmark at the other end of the spectrum, which is more than 50 percent. So the U. S. really doesn't take in a whole lot of tax revenue. MARTIN: So are we talking about personal income tax here? Well, what about the corporate taxes? KURTZLEBEN: On corporate taxes - this is true. The U. S. really does have a pretty high corporate tax rate. According to the Tax Foundation, the U. S. has the third-highest corporate tax rate in the world. MARTIN: So Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, also talked about the impact of taxes in his state. Let's listen to what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS CHRISTIE: After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires, we lost - in the next four years, $70 billion in wealth left our state. It left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly. KURTZLEBEN: So what he's talking about is what was called the, quote unquote, \"millionaire's tax. \" It was instituted in New Jersey in 2004. This was well before Chris Christie took office. And he is citing a 2010 paper from Boston College, which did find that $70 billion in wealth left the state between 2004 and 2008. But as with all these things, it's not entirely that simple. For example, the author of the paper later cautioned that taxes were just one part of the story, one potential factor in that. MARTIN: So let's talk about Marco Rubio for a minute. As we mentioned, he was heavily criticized by the various governors on stage for not having as much experience in leadership and decision-making as they do. Now he struggled to hit back, but he did get in this swipe about how Chris Christie managed the finances of New Jersey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey, they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem. We don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state. MARTIN: Is that a fair charge against Chris Christie? KURTZLEBEN: I mean, it is true that New Jersey was downgraded nine times during Gov. Christie's tenure in office. However, that's from three different rating agencies, so each of them downgraded New Jersey three times. And this does give Christie the worst record of any governor on that stage in this sense. A couple of quick caveats on this. One, credit rating agencies are taking a long view here. They're looking at a state's long-term fiscal health beyond when Christie may be out of office. And the other thing, governors don't exactly have direct control over their state's economy, so it's hard to really say a downgrade is entirely a governor's fault. MARTIN: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. She's breaking down some of the policy discussion at last night's Republican debate. Danielle, thanks so much for joining us. KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

When consumer confidence is down in China, it's bad news for the rest of the world, too. That's because of how much China drives global growth. NPR's Frank Langfitt explains that for its economy to stay on track, leaders in China say consumers will have to spend more and more. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Jia Wangxing had his heart set on buying a BMW X5 last year. The SUV lists for $115,000, and it would have sent a message to his friends and clients. I've made it. But he put off the purchase not because Jia, who runs a company that trains salespeople, didn't have the cash but because, like a lot of people these days, he's concerned about where China's economy is headed. JIA WANGXING: (Through interpreter) Many of my friends are saying, in recent years, they spend a certain amount of money annually, but this year, they became very cautious because China's economic development is not stable now. Many people are a bit worried. LANGFITT: And those worries don't seem to be going away. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, sentiment here has been dropping steadily since last spring. SHAUN REIN: Consumer confidence is probably the worst that I've ever seen in my two decades in China. LANGFITT: Shaun Rein runs China Market Research Group. His company surveys thousands of people in 15 Chinese cities. REIN: The real crisis of confidence started last July after the stock market collapse. Consumers, until then, were still pretty confident about the overall economy. LANGFITT: The Shanghai Composite plunged 43 percent in less than two months, which sent markets spiraling down in the U. S. and elsewhere. Rein says worries here went deeper than just lost money and frightening headlines. REIN: It wasn't the price and the volatility that was concerning. It was the government response. It really seemed that the technocrats who everybody believed knew how to run an economy well all of a sudden were  confused and lost. LANGFITT: After all, the Chinese government had created the bull market. State media encouraged investors to pour money into stocks, but once the market turned, officials seemed to have no clue how to halt the slide. Frazier Howie says the government also bungled a currency devaluation that spooked investors around the world. Howie's written a number of books on China's financial system. FRAZIER HOWIE: We've gone from a long period of certainty to one of uncertainty, and you see a government making policy on the hoof and unable to respond in a sensible way. LANGFITT: This is new. Chinese people have trusted the communist party to manage the economy effectively, which, for decades, it largely has. With the value of China's currency down more than 5 percent since summer, Howie says more Chinese people are looking to invest elsewhere. HOWIE: As the economy has weakened and as, ultimately, the China model has rolled over and has run its course, people are now looking at China and saying, I want my money out of China. What that has resulted in is something like a trillion dollars of capital has left China in the past year. LANGFITT: William Fang would like more of his money to head in that direction. He works in Internet finance at Lujiazui, Shanghai's Wall Street. Fang says many of his friends want to dump assets that are held in the Chinese currency, the renminbi, because they think it will lose even more value as the economy cools. WILLIAM FANG: (Through interpreter) In the last couple of years, people started to tell me to change renminbi into U. S. dollars and buy assets denominated in U. S. dollars. More and more, people are doing it. If I wasn't under pressure to buy a car and an apartment, I would have probably changed half my assets into U. S. dollars or other currencies. LANGFITT: For all the worry over China these days, it's worth remembering the economy is still growing, at least officially, at nearly 7 percent a year. And Chinese consumers are still spending. Josh Gartner says consumption in advance of this week's Lunar New Year holiday has been healthy. Gartner's a spokesman for jd. com, one of China's leading e-commerce companies. JOSH GARTNER: We see pretty strong sales in a number of specific areas like wine for the celebration, but we also see pretty strong sales in products like cell phones, where people want to go home with the newest product. LANGFITT: And show off to their family members and friends back home. If China's to thrive, its leaders here say it must convert from an old, industrial economy to one driven by consumer spending, but to make that transition, consumers will need to have more confidence in where the country is headed.

She acknowledged that the U. S. economy is facing a higher level of risk than just a few months ago. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Yellen was on Capitol Hill giving her semi-annual report to Congress on the health of the U. S. economy, and here's what she had to say in her opening statement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth. YDSTIE: Yellen blamed the sharp decline in stock prices, less available credit, weak global growth and a further strengthening of the dollar, which hurts U. S. exports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity in the labor market. YDSTIE: Not a very sunny outlook. But, ironically, that's what investors were looking for - an expression from Yellen that she sees the same headwinds for the economy that they do. As investors see it, Yellen's acknowledgment of these economic headwinds makes it less likely that the Fed will raise interest rates again anytime soon. But Yellen walked a fine line in the hearing. She didn't explicitly take another interest rate hike off the table. And in response to a question about whether recent market turmoil had convinced policy-makers to put off thoughts of further interest rate hikes, Yellen said. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: I think the answer is maybe, but the jury is out. We've continued to see progress in the labor market. Over the last three months, there've been 230,000 jobs per month averaging through. YDSTIE: And, Yellen said, while economic growth was disappointing at the end of last year, she expects it to pick up, helped by lower oil prices. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: If you look at the difference in oil prices now relative to 2014, for the average American household, we're looking at a savings of a thousand dollars a year. YDSTIE: Yellen said that's boosting consumer spending. Wall Street responded positively to Yellen's testimony, but lost its gains later in the day. Also today, Yellen faced consistent questioning from African-American lawmakers about the continued high rates of unemployment in their communities, even as the national unemployment rate is at 4. 9 percent. Here's Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEITH ELLISON: White unemployment in Minnesota is 2. 9 percent as of December 2015, but black unemployment is 14. 1. What can we do about it? YDSTIE: Yellen responded that the Fed's main tool, manipulating interest rates to boost employment across the economy, could not be targeted at one group. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: The Fed, of course, has a role to play, but job training, educational programs, programs that address other barriers in the labor market, this is Congress's job to address. YDSTIE: Yellen will visit the Senate tomorrow. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   A reality check today from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. She acknowledged that the U. S. economy is facing a higher level of risk than just a few months ago. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Yellen was on Capitol Hill giving her semi-annual report to Congress on the health of the U. S. economy, and here's what she had to say in her opening statement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JANET YELLEN: Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth. YDSTIE: Yellen blamed the sharp decline in stock prices, less available credit, weak global growth and a further strengthening of the dollar, which hurts U. S. exports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YELLEN: These developments, if they prove persistent, could weigh on the outlook for economic activity in the labor market. YDSTIE: Not a very sunny outlook. But, ironically, that's what investors were looking for - an expression from Yellen that she sees the same headwinds for the economy that they do. As investors see it, Yellen's acknowledgment of these economic headwinds makes it less likely that the Fed will raise interest rates again anytime soon. But Yellen walked a fine line in the hearing. She didn't explicitly take another interest rate hike off the table. And in response to a question about whether recent market turmoil had convinced policy-makers to put off thoughts of further interest rate hikes, Yellen said. . .

This is after 15 years of receiving almost entirely good news. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACK DALRYMPLE: It seems strange to hear that things have gone in the other direction. SHAPIRO: That's North Dakota's Governor Jack Dalrymple announcing that the formerly booming oil state now has a $1 billion budget deficit. Low oil and agriculture prices have become a big problem. Prairie Public Radio's Emily Guerin reports on how residents are handling the sudden downturn. EMILY GUERIN, BYLINE: How much should a farmer get paid for his wheat? It's actually a complicated question. And there's a whole laboratory at the Southwest Grain elevator in Taylor, N. D. dedicated to answering it. First, a machine shakes a sample of the farmer's wheat to remove stuff that shouldn't be in there - corn kernels, fungus. Next, a few lab tests to determine the quality - protein, moisture, gluten. Then the big moment when the farmer finds out how much he's going to get paid for a year's worth of work. JUSTIN BINSTOCK: Four dollars and forty cents. GUERIN: Four-forty a bushel. At that price, farmer Justin Binstock (ph) is losing money. He needs more like 6. 25 just to break even. BINSTOCK: Wheat - it's disgusting. Next year, I don't think I'm planting any of it. GUERIN: He's only here because he needs cash to pay off some debts. BINSTOCK: Yeah, I'm down to the bottom of the barrel here. That's why I'm bringing in the wheat. GUERIN: Farmers across North Dakota have seen their incomes fall by a third since 2013. And that has ripple effects across this rural economy. BRENT SANFORD: Nobody's real exuberant right now and optimistic and happy about the economy when the oil's $35 and wheat and cattle are down. GUERIN: Brent Sanford owns S & S Motors in Watford City. It's as commodity-dependent as a car dealership can be. His customers fall into the three categories hit the hardest - farmers, ranchers and oil workers. But at the height of the oil boom, there was a lot of money in this community. SANFORD: Everybody has switched from traditional car like a Chevy Impala, Ford Taurus to SUVs with heated leather or pickups with heated leather. GUERIN: Now profits are down 50 percent. SANFORD: People don't tend to make big purchases when there's that much negative news. GUERIN: Some North Dakotans never made big purchases because they didn't trust that the good times would last. Take farmer and rancher Lorin Dvirnak. LORIN DVIRNAK: We're down to earth. We don't like to overextend ourselves. GUERIN: Dvirnak gets a monthly check from an oil company for the wells on his property. But he was very cautious with his oil money even before that check started shrinking. Oil prices have dropped by two thirds in the past year and half. It's Dvirnak's grandchildren who may be affected. They'll inherit the oil money one day from the wells. Wells that are named after them. There's the Naudia (ph), the Ben (ph). DVIRNAK: They got their wells named first. GUERIN: And the Mike (ph) and Lucas (ph). DVIRNAK: Mike and Lucas are a little upset that they have to share a well. GUERIN: The Dvirnaks weren't sure they'd get another oil well. So they decided to make the two boys share. North Dakota practicality, that's what's gotten this commodity-dependent state through booms and busts before. DVIRNAK: We'll just keep going. We always have in the past. GUERIN: That seems to be the message from Governor Jack Dalrymple too. Here he is last week announcing his plan to plug the $1 billion hole in the state budget. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DALRYMPLE: Thanks to our strong cash reserves and the diversification of our economy, we will be able to weather this downturn in commodity prices. GUERIN: But the state's economy isn't that diversified, not compared to oil states like Texas and California. More than 60 percent is based on agriculture and energy. The next largest sector is federal payments. That means when all the commodity prices drop like they have now, there's just not much to fall back on. For NPR News, I'm Emily Guerin.

He's director at the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to the Wall Street Journal. Hey, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: Morning. So I gather when financial markets really take a fall, it shows a deepening pessimism among investors. What has so many people so gloomy right now? WESSEL: Well, I think it started with China - a slowdown there, and the government's ham-fisted response - and with a surprisingly sharp and persistent drop in oil prices, both because there's more oil production, but also signs that there's less demand, which is a symptom of less demand for everything in the world economy. But what's interesting is the overall stock market has now fallen more than the energy sector, and bank stocks have fallen even more than that, partly because they lent so much money to the energy industry and partly because interest rates are so low they're finding it hard to make money. It's a vicious cycle, you know. China buys less commodities, that hurts the countries that export them, that hurts the big companies that sell to consumers in those countries. There's a real whiff of panic here. I think sometimes investors move in herds, and that surely seems to be what's going on now. Everything is just bad news, and that leads people to sell. GREENE: And just to clarify, when you say overall stock market, we're talking about markets around the world - the United States and others. WESSEL: Yes, the U. S. , Asia and the U. S. - and Europe. GREENE: Well, let me ask you this. I mean, this pessimism - and you talk about it kind of beginning with China and the economic troubles there - I mean, is this reflecting actual signs of weakness in economies or is it more of a perception of them? WESSEL: Maybe. GREENE: Could be either way. WESSEL: The rest of the world looks pretty lousy, particularly the big emerging markets. You know, there was this acronym for the fast-growing countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa - it was called the BRICS. Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary, joked yesterday that BRIC now stands for Bloody Ridiculous Investment Concept. GREENE: (Laughter) Man, I don't like that as much as the old way of using BRIC. WESSEL: But basically, what's interesting is the U. S. so far, particularly the job market, has actually been looking stronger, despite some weakness in manufacturing. The official unemployment rate is down to 4. 9 percent. Broader measures are down. Hiring has been brisk. There was data out this week that shows that more workers are confident enough about the job market to voluntarily quit their jobs than at any time since 2007. Olivier Blanchard, who used to be the economist at the International Monetary Fund put it to me this way. He said, I think the U. S. economy's OK. I think markets are overreacting. But the markets make me re-examine my forecast, and I know that when stock prices, oil prices and all that fall a lot, that can spill over and cause problems for the rest of the economy. GREENE: So it really can be a vicious cycle. WESSEL: Yeah. GREENE: Even if there's not actual weakness, sort of the perception of weakness can actually lead to weakness itself in one big cycle. Well, let me ask you this. I mean, if things do turn really badly - you know, if we look back to 2008 when the world plunged into recession, governments around the world really came to the rescue with tax cuts and spending increases and interest rate cuts. Could all that happen again? WESSEL: Well, I think that's the problem. You know, the fed has started to raise interest rates. Janet Yellin in testimony yesterday on Capitol Hill exuded caution. But interest rates here and around the world are very low. It's hard to get them lower. The textbook answer is more government spending and more tax cuts, but a lot of governments have so much debt, and there's so much political resistance here in the U. S. to bigger deficits, it's not clear that government spending can march in here either. GREENE: All right, David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome. GREENE: That's David Wessel.

He would do that in part by imposing a small fee, or tax, on some financial institutions. He'd use the revenue to pare down student debt and provide free tuition at public colleges. One big question, though, is how much money we're actually talking about. Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Sanders calls his idea a speculation tax, but it would apply to all trades involving stocks, bonds and derivatives. And he says it would be a way for taxpayers to get something back for the money they lent big banks during the financial crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it's Wall Street's time to help the middle class. ZARROLI: Sanders spoke after the New Hampshire primary. The idea of a financial transactions tax is not new. Versions of it were proposed by John Maynard Keynes and Nobel prize-winning economist James Tobin. The U. S. actually had such a tax until 1966. And today, many countries, including Great Britain, impose one. Sanders says reinstating such a tax in the U. S. would accomplish two goals. First, it would cut down on unnecessary trading that can destabilize the markets. Len Burman of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says an argument can be made that a lot of computer-generated, high-speed trading serves no economic purpose. LEN BURMAN: These high-frequency traders make enormous amounts of money, billions and billions of dollars, and do actually nothing of any social value for the economy. There's kind of the modern-day equivalent of skimming pennies out of the till. ZARROLI: A tax on high-frequency trading has been proposed by Hillary Clinton. But unlike Sanders' plan, it wouldn't apply to other kinds of transactions. How much revenue would be raised by these taxes is unclear. Robert Pollin of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst says the speculation tax proposed by Sanders would cut trading by a lot. But even so a lot of money would come in. ROBERT POLLIN: I would estimate that given the tax rates in the Sanders' bill, it would be in the range of $340 billion a year in revenue. ZARROLI: The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, estimates that the revenue would be a small fraction of that. The estimates vary in part because no one knows for sure how Wall Street would respond. John Cochrane of the Hoover Institution says that if a transaction tax is imposed, investors will do what they can to avoid it. They can go to overseas markets to trade, for instance. JOHN COCHRANE: Many things are traded internationally. So you want to buy and sell a German bond, well, you can do that in the U. S. You can do it in London. You can do it in France. ZARROLI: In fact, France, Germany and the rest of the EU are about to impose a tax of their own. But, Cochrane says the point is that a lot of people would find ways to get around the tax. COCHRANE: I mean, the cleverness of our financial engineers shouldn't be underestimated. ZARROLI: There's another argument against the tax. Although it would be imposed on big Wall Street firms, Len Burman says some of the pain would probably end up getting passed on to small investors. BURMAN: Well, there's a lot of trading that's done for people's retirement accounts, and that would be affected by this money that's in your life insurance or other insurance plans that's invested in Wall Street that would be affected by the tax. ZARROLI: The Sanders campaign says if Wall Street firms end up passing on the tax, there would be tax credits to offset the cost for low- and moderate-income individuals. It also says the tax would benefit pension funds by cutting back on unnecessary trades that drive up pension expenses. In the meantime, it would raise a lot of revenue for education, even if it's not clear exactly how much. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: And later today on All Things Considered, we'll look at the generation gap among women in their support of Hillary Clinton. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has promised to get tough on Wall Street if he is elected president. He would do that in part by imposing a small fee, or tax, on some financial institutions. He'd use the revenue to pare down student debt and provide free tuition at public colleges. One big question, though, is how much money we're actually talking about. Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Sanders calls his idea a speculation tax, but it would apply to all trades involving stocks, bonds and derivatives. And he says it would be a way for taxpayers to get something back for the money they lent big banks during the financial crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BERNIE SANDERS: The American people bailed out Wall Street. Now it's Wall Street's time to help the middle class. ZARROLI: Sanders spoke after the New Hampshire primary. The idea of a financial transactions tax is not new. Versions of it were proposed by John Maynard Keynes and Nobel prize-winning economist James Tobin. The U. S. actually had such a tax until 1966. And today, many countries, including Great Britain, impose one. Sanders says reinstating such a tax in the U. S. would accomplish two goals. First, it would cut down on unnecessary trading that can destabilize the markets. Len Burman of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center says an argument can be made that a lot of computer-generated, high-speed trading serves no economic purpose. LEN BURMAN: These high-frequency traders make enormous amounts of money, billions and billions of dollars, and do actually nothing of any social value for the economy. There's kind of the modern-day equivalent of skimming pennies out of the till. ZARROLI: A tax on high-frequency trading has been proposed by Hillary Clinton. But unlike Sanders' plan, it wouldn't apply to other kinds of transactions. How much revenue would be raised by these taxes is unclear. Robert Pollin of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst says the speculation tax proposed by Sanders would cut trading by a lot. But even so a lot of money would come in. ROBERT POLLIN: I would estimate that given the tax rates in the Sanders' bill, it would be in the range of $340 billion a year in revenue. ZARROLI: The Tax Policy Center, on the other hand, estimates that the revenue would be a small fraction of that. The estimates vary in part because no one knows for sure how Wall Street would respond. John Cochrane of the Hoover Institution says that if a transaction tax is imposed, investors will do what they can to avoid it. They can go to overseas markets to trade, for instance. JOHN COCHRANE: Many things are traded internationally. So you want to buy and sell a German bond, well, you can do that in the U. S. You can do it in London. You can do it in France. ZARROLI: In fact, France, Germany and the rest of the EU are about to impose a tax of their own. But, Cochrane says the point is that a lot of people would find ways to get around the tax.

There was some relief yesterday when stocks rallied. But overall, the stock market has lost 10 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, while the financial markets have been flashing warning signs, the broader economy keeps chugging along. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says it's pretty clear the financial markets have been trying to tell us we're headed for a recession. LIZ ANN SONDERS: You could argue the market is trying to tell us that, but I think the market is probably not right. YDSTIE: Because, Sonders says, the signals from the real economy are telling us there's no recession in sight. Job creation continues, wage growth shows signs of picking up, and retail spending rose at a healthy pace in January. David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors says that's partly because of a windfall consumers have gotten as the price of gasoline has dropped a dollar and a half per gallon. DAVID KOTOK: Somewhere around $200 billion a year in spending power has been restored to households in America. YDSTIE: So far, Americans have spent only about a third of the windfall, using the other two thirds to pay down debt and add to savings. Of course, Kotok says, the oil and gas industry has been battered, and that's been a huge driver of the losses in stock market indexes. Manufacturers whose exports have been hurt by weak global growth have also suffered. But he says, the indexes also contain companies that are thriving, like the U. S. auto companies. KOTOK: In the last six weeks, markets have focused on the bad and ignored the good. Will that change? I think so. YDSTIE: And yesterday, the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 shot up 2 percent, and oil prices recovered as well. But there's another element that's been weighing on the market, says Kotok, central bank policy, specifically, the move by European and Japanese central banks to push interest rates into negative territory. KOTOK: I think negative interest rates have a risk component. We do not know how they're going to play out. YDSTIE: But it's widely expected they'll hurt bank profits. And there's fear that if the U. S. economy falters, the Federal Reserve might adopt negative interest rates, too. The concern about bank earnings has battered their share prices. Kotok says that may not have been fair to U.

In just the last few years, more than three dozen companies have declared bankruptcy. That's a big turnaround from where coal used to be. For decades, it was the go-to fuel for generating electricity. NPR's Jeff Brady reports. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The connection between coal and generating electricity goes way back to the late 1800s. A good place to get a sense of that history is in the small town of Sunbury, Pa. , specifically at the corner of Fourth and Market. That's where I met hotel owner Meghan Beck. MEGHAN BECK: And this is the place where, in July 4, 1883, Thomas Alva Edison lit the hotel with the first commercial three-wire electric system. BRADY: The famous inventor chose Sunbury for his lighting system because the existing gas lamps in town were expensive to operate. There was plenty of cheap coal nearby, and Edison used that to power his generators. Standing in one of the hotel's long hallways, Beck says this part of central Pennsylvania has long been coal country. BECK: You know, it was a huge part of our economy in this area. We actually have a power plant just across the river that was coal-fired up until a year ago. BRADY: That plant and its huge smokestacks that can be seen for miles is a local landmark. It delivered electricity to this region for more than six decades. But now things are about to come full circle, and the lights in Beck's hotel may once again be powered by gas. Right next to that old coal plant, crews are building a brand new natural gas power plant. The operators want it built by the end of next year, which means crews keep working even when it's raining and cold outside. DAVE MEEHAN: We have an old saying that the heat's in the tools. And these guys are very professional, and they come prepared to work in any kind of weather. BRADY: That's Dave Meehan, president of Sunbury Generation. The crews are laying the foundation. When it's done, it'll take up a lot less space than the coal plant it replaced. And it'll be more efficient in a number of ways. MEEHAN: With coal, you're just feeding the monster all the time. You're filling the bunkers up with coal and running them out and generating steam, so you're kind of forced to have a long-term view that you're going to burn all the time. BRADY: A natural gas plant is more nimble. It can shut down and fire back up more easily to meet the region's fickle power demands. It's easier on the environment, too. There's no coal ash to deal with. It uses a lot less water from the nearby Susquehanna River, and it emits less pollution. And here's the kicker. Meehan says the gas plant will produce more than twice as much electricity as the old coal plant, enough to power a million homes. MEEHAN: Gas has taken more and more market share from coal, and that's a reality that is here to stay, so positive for gas, negative for coal. BRADY: U. S. coal production peaked in 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration. It's been on a downhill slide since. Just last year, it fell 10 percent. That's hurt companies and the communities where they operate. LUKE POPOVICH: Right now I think we are simply in a survival mode. BRADY: Luke Popovich is spokesman for the National Mining Association. In part he blames environmental regulations over the decades. But the coal industry's problems go beyond that. Despite falling demand here in the U. S. , the industry thought global demand would continue to rise. Popovich says coal companies borrowed a lot of money to prepare for that new business, but that business never came. POPOVICH: Now they are faced with paying off those debts at the same time that prices for all fossil fuels, not just coal but natural gas and oil, have virtually collapsed. BRADY: Coal's problems don't stop there. The renewable energy building boom also is competing with coal. Once solar and wind projects are built, the power is cheap to produce. Coal analyst Andy Roberts is with the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. ANDY ROBERTS: Gas puts the immediate threat to coal, but the combination of gas and renewables places a longer-term threat to cold. BRADY: Roberts says last year was tough for coal companies, and the future likely will be even more painful. ROBERTS: Probably, over the long, long time, only the strongest of them are going to survive. BRADY: One way to become strong is to declare bankruptcy. Arch Coal is going that route. The company filed bankruptcy in January and plans to shed more than $4. 5 billion in debt. Executives hope that will position Arch Coal to be one of the few companies that will survive the tough years ahead. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

It come (ph) from a prominent source. Neel Kashkari had an extremely close look at the financial crisis that sparked the Great Recession. He ran the massive government bailout of financial institutions. Today he is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis that's part of the nationwide Fed banking system. And he made news this week by saying that reforms since the financial crisis did not go far enough. Let me just get you to state the problem, if I can. You said major banks are still too big to fail. What do you mean? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we still have these giant banks in the center of our financial system. There have been big reforms through the Dodd-Frank Act to make the banks safer, and they are stronger and safer. They have more capital to absorb potential losses and they've got more liquidity so they can fund themselves. But if there were another crisis and banks ran into trouble, I'm afraid that taxpayers would have to step in again and bail out these banks. So we have not solved the problem, and we need to. INSKEEP: Haven't you just stated what the solution was, at least according to the Obama administration and its supporters in Congress? The supporters of the Dodd-Frank legislation, as it was called, imposed these stress tests on banks, made sure they were in a stronger position and essentially said they would not fail. KASHKARI: Well, unfortunately, I don't think we've gone far enough. I think these crises come. They're not what you're expecting. They surprise us and then they can overwhelm these defenses. And so we need to be honest with the American people - that if there were a crisis today and many banks ran into trouble, it's very likely we'd have to turn to the taxpayers to bail the banks out again. And I don't think most Americans think that's acceptable. INSKEEP: Would you throw out a few names of banks that you're thinking of when you're thinking of banks that are still too big to fail? KASHKARI: Sure. I mean, banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and others. INSKEEP: And so what do you want to happen to those banks? KASHKARI: Well, we're launching a research program to bring experts from around the country who have serious proposals - the proposals include breaking up the banks into smaller, less important entities. Putting so much capital in the banks that you regulate them like a nuclear power plant, turn them into a utility so they almost virtually cannot fail or even taxing leverage so that if - the risks move from banks to nonbanks or insurance companies - that you can capture that wherever it goes. There are transformational solutions out there that, in my view, have not been given serious consideration. INSKEEP: Why is it that you think the executives in charge of some of these large banks are not taking those steps themselves if they look around and see that they're necessary, as you seem to think they are necessary? KASHKARI: Well, it's not in their financial interest. It's in their financial interest and there shareholders' interest to grow as large as possible. And unfortunately, the risks are then borne by society. INSKEEP: Some people may look at your resume and wonder if your views have changed over time. Didn't you used to work for Goldman Sachs? KASHKARI: I did and then I went to the Treasury Department under President Bush, and the financial crisis hit. And I was one of the first responders helping to stabilize that terrible financial crisis from triggering another Great Depression. In that experience, I learned how devastating these crises are. I learned how much risk there actually is in the financial system and so I applauded the reforms in Dodd-Frank, but I didn't know if they had gone far enough. Now, six or seven years later, I think it's time to go forward and make more transformational reforms. INSKEEP: Meaning, when you worked at Goldman Sachs, you didn't see the world quite this way? KASHKARI: I did not. INSKEEP: And it was the financial crisis that changed that? KASHKARI: It absolutely was. And it's the experience of how hard it was to stabilize the crisis and how devastating the crisis was for millions of Americans. And that's thing - an analogy I used in the speech I gave yesterday is that these big banks are like nuclear reactors. If a nuclear reactor melts down, it's truly devastating for society. Given that cost, governments will do whatever they have to to try to stabilize the reactor before it melts down. Well, there's a similar thing in big banks. If a big bank fails and if there's risk in the economy, it could trigger contagion to other banks, and it could lead to a widespread downturn. You know, our economic crisis in 2008 - it inflicted tens of trillions of dollars of harm to American families and to the American economy - tens of trillions of dollars. That downside risk - we need to do more to take it off the table. INSKEEP: And then you were involved in that bailout that you don't want to happen again. Are you saying that that bailout, given the crisis, was the right thing but that ever doing that again would be the wrong thing? KASHKARI: Yeah. We never want to be in a situation where we are forced to do that again. We were forced to do it in 2008. We hated it, but it was the right thing to do at the time. Let's make sure that we improve conditions so policymakers in the future are never put in that position again. INSKEEP: You know, I'm curious if breaking up the banks would really make all that much difference. I'm thinking of a historical analogy. There was a time when there was an oil company, Standard Oil, that was considered massively too powerful and so it was broken up into a number of other giant oil companies which remain giant today and hugely influential. If you took Goldman Sachs and made four Goldman Sachses out of it, would they really lose that much influence or really be no longer too big to fail? KASHKARI: Well, it's not the influence that I'm trying to solve. I look at analogy of the tech bubble. We had this big boom in the '90s. It all crashed in 2000. That was devastating for Silicon Valley, but there was no risk of an economic collapse for the broader country. We need our big banks and our banking system to be able to have that type of a shock without bringing the rest of the country down with them. INSKEEP: Although the person at the top of your pyramid, Janet Yellen, the Fed chair said just last week that banking since the crisis is more resilient and stronger than it was. Are - is she mistaken? KASHKARI: No, I agree with the chair. I agree with Chair Yellen. The question I'm asking is - have we gone far enough to avoid bailouts? I think we have to go quite a bit further. Even last week, Chair Yellen said it's too soon to declare victory on too big to fail. INSKEEP: I want to remind people that you're a Republican. You once ran for governor of California as a Republican. You were appointed to a high position by a Republic president. But of the various presidential candidates, the one who has spoken most openly in favor of your proposal this week is Bernie Sanders, Democratic Socialist of Vermont. What do you make of that? KASHKARI: The Federal Reserve is nonpolitical. It's nonpartisan. I'm in a completely nonpartisan role. But I want as many people across the political spectrum as possible to be supportive of these ideas. And so I would welcome everybody who cares about these ideas to speak up. INSKEEP: Neel Kashkari is president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. Thanks very much. KASHKARI: Thanks for having me.

KASHKARI: Sure. I mean, banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and others. INSKEEP: And so what do you want to happen to those banks? KASHKARI: Well, we're launching a research program to bring experts from around the country who have serious proposals - the proposals include breaking up the banks into smaller, less important entities. Putting so much capital in the banks that you regulate them like a nuclear power plant, turn them into a utility so they almost virtually cannot fail or even taxing leverage so that if - the risks move from banks to nonbanks or insurance companies - that you can capture that wherever it goes. There are transformational solutions out there that, in my view, have not been given serious consideration. INSKEEP: Why is it that you think the executives in charge of some of these large banks are not taking those steps themselves if they look around and see that they're necessary, as you seem to think they are necessary? KASHKARI: Well, it's not in their financial interest. It's in their financial interest and there shareholders' interest to grow as large as possible. And unfortunately, the risks are then borne by society. INSKEEP: Some people may look at your resume and wonder if your views have changed over time. Didn't you used to work for Goldman Sachs? KASHKARI: I did and then I went to the Treasury Department under President Bush, and the financial crisis hit. And I was one of the first responders helping to stabilize that terrible financial crisis from triggering another Great Depression. In that experience, I learned how devastating these crises are. I learned how much risk there actually is in the financial system and so I applauded the reforms in Dodd-Frank, but I didn't know if they had gone far enough. Now, six or seven years later, I think it's time to go forward and make more transformational reforms. INSKEEP: Meaning, when you worked at Goldman Sachs, you didn't see the world quite this way? KASHKARI: I did not. INSKEEP: And it was the financial crisis that changed that? KASHKARI: It absolutely was. And it's the experience of how hard it was to stabilize the crisis and how devastating the crisis was for millions of Americans. And that's thing - an analogy I used in the speech I gave yesterday is that these big banks are like nuclear reactors. If a nuclear reactor melts down, it's truly devastating for society. Given that cost, governments will do whatever they have to to try to stabilize the reactor before it melts down. Well, there's a similar thing in big banks. If a big bank fails and if there's risk in the economy, it could trigger contagion to other banks, and it could lead to a widespread downturn. You know, our economic crisis in 2008 - it inflicted tens of trillions of dollars of harm to American families and to the American economy - tens of trillions of dollars. That downside risk - we need to do more to take it off the table. INSKEEP: And then you were involved in that bailout that you don't want to happen again. Are you saying that that bailout, given the crisis, was the right thing but that ever doing that again would be the wrong thing? KASHKARI: Yeah. We never want to be in a situation where we are forced to do that again. We were forced to do it in 2008. We hated it, but it was the right thing to do at the time. Let's make sure that we improve conditions so policymakers in the future are never put in that position again. INSKEEP: You know, I'm curious if breaking up the banks would really make all that much difference. I'm thinking of a historical analogy. There was a time when there was an oil company, Standard Oil, that was considered massively too powerful and so it was broken up into a number of other giant oil companies which remain giant today and hugely influential. If you took Goldman Sachs and made four Goldman Sachses out of it, would they really lose that much influence or really be no longer too big to fail? KASHKARI: Well, it's not the influence that I'm trying to solve. I look at analogy of the tech bubble. We had this big boom in the '90s. It all crashed in 2000. That was devastating for Silicon Valley, but there was no risk of an economic collapse for the broader country. We need our big banks and our banking system to be able to have that type of a shock without bringing the rest of the country down with them. INSKEEP: Although the person at the top of your pyramid, Janet Yellen, the Fed chair said just last week that banking since the crisis is more resilient and stronger than it was. Are - is she mistaken? KASHKARI: No, I agree with the chair. I agree with Chair Yellen. The question I'm asking is - have we gone far enough to avoid bailouts? I think we have to go quite a bit further. Even last week, Chair Yellen said it's too soon to declare victory on too big to fail. INSKEEP: I want to remind people that you're a Republican. You once ran for governor of California as a Republican. You were appointed to a high position by a Republic president. But of the various presidential candidates, the one who has spoken most openly in favor of your proposal this week is Bernie Sanders, Democratic Socialist of Vermont. What do you make of that? KASHKARI: The Federal Reserve is nonpolitical. It's nonpartisan. I'm in a completely nonpartisan role. But I want as many people across the political spectrum as possible to be supportive of these ideas. And so I would welcome everybody who cares about these ideas to speak up. INSKEEP: Neel Kashkari is president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. Thanks very much. KASHKARI: Thanks for having me.", "section": "Business", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

In the last few years, more than 30 cities and towns have set a minimum wage higher than the federal law. And some places, like L. A. and Seattle, are on a path to make their minimums $15 an hour. It's a move supported by the Obama administration, which has had zero success getting Congress to increase the federal minimum wage of $7. 25 an hour. Joining me now in the studio is Labor Secretary Thomas Perez to talk more about it. Welcome. THOMAS PEREZ: Pleasure to be with you and your listeners. CORNISH: Now, is this essentially admitting defeat, right? If Congress won't work with you, is the administration left to kind of nibble around the edges at that this issue and just boost the efforts down at cities and state level? PEREZ: Well, we're certainly not admitting defeat. We're continuing to fight for the 12 by 20 minimum wage proposal of Congressman Bobby Scott and Sen. Patty Murray. And at the same time, we're setting the example at the federal government. So if you want to do business with the federal government, you have to pay a decent minimum wage - $10. 10 - now it went to $10. 15. And we're continuing to work with state and local governments to do the same. And when I listened to the story that your listeners just heard about Alabama, you know, this is, frankly, you know, rank hypocrisy and destructive politics at its worst. And what it really is is that the same powerful, Tea-Party-inspired forces who've stymied process here in Washington have taken their case out to the states, and a number of states are fighting progress. And for me, the irony is that the Republican Party, which, you know, believes in limited government, local control and respecting the will of people, they do so until the will of the local people - they're trying to fight inequality, like the people in Birmingham. CORNISH: But as you said, it works both ways, right? Local control states or local control - they can decide what's right for their job market. And maybe that means some of them don't want cities creating a patchwork of policies within their borders. PEREZ: Well, actually, in Alabama, under the Alabama Constitution, as I understand it, Birmingham has home rule. And the irony of it is, you know, the congressman - or the House representative, Mr. Faulkner, who we heard from a few minutes ago, I mean, he represents Mountain Brook. The poverty rate in Mountain Brook is 2. 6 percent. It's 97 percent white community. The median household income is the highest in the state of Alabama. The poverty rate in Birmingham is 31 percent. It's 70 percent African-American. They have a poverty rate of 31 percent, a childhood poverty rate of 50 percent. I think, with all due respect to Rep. Faulkner, that the people of Birmingham are in the better position to determine what's best for Birmingham. And I found it ironic - he said, I don't know if cities are equipped to analyze and determine what the appropriate minimum wage is or what those impacts are. With all due respect, I think the people of Birmingham are pretty smart. I think the minimum-wage workers who've been working a full-time job and getting their food at the food pantry, they're pretty smart. I think the representatives there can do that. CORNISH: But to stop you here for a second, because this data is not settled yet, right? I mean, we have cities that have just started passing these things, and we're just now really weighing the effects. And, you know, is there a danger in creating competition between suburban, urban, rural areas, right, where you have - a company or employers can move out of a city, right? Back to where you started - hurting the workers you're worried about. PEREZ: Actually, the first experiment in this, Audie, occurred in a community in New Jersey, which was right across the border from a community in Pennsylvania. One community raised their minimum wage. And the argument against it was the community with a higher minimum wage is going to get hurt. An economist who later became the president's chief economic advisor, Alan Krueger, studied that issue under the theory that Mr. Faulkner was right. What he found was Mr. Faulkner was not right. People said, oh, that's only one community, so the replicated this study in 250 to 300 match-paired communities and found that when you raise their minimum wage by reasonable rates, which is what they're doing in Birmingham, it doesn't have that impact. And what it does is it produces a workforce that's more loyal because they're getting paid a decent wage. It's Henry Ford economics. When you put money in people's pockets, they spend it. It creates shared prosperity. So this is really - aside from being rank hypocrisy, this is bad economics. CORNISH: But before I let you go, essentially what we're witnessing is a national public policy experiment, right? We're really going to know in a few years how this is all going to play out if we have different cities and states and towns doing different things here. PEREZ: Well, we've already seen it. And what's important to keep in mind on the minimum wage is that there's been overwhelming bipartisan consensus historically. Every president except two since FDR, who signed the first minimum wage bill, has raised the minimum wage. Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska, Alaska raised the minimum wage by voter referendum. People understand that you can't make a living off of $7. 25 an hour. And the people of Birmingham made the right call. And the people in the suburb next door shouldn't be able to overturn them. That's not fair. CORNISH: That U. S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez. Thank you for coming in to speak with us. PEREZ: Pleasure to be with you and your listeners.

KYLE GASSIOTT, BYLINE: The fight to increase the minimum wage in Alabama boiled over last week in the wealthy city of Mountain Brook near Birmingham. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We are here as representatives, citizens telling the state legislature, take your minimum-wage-picking hands out of our pockets. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Amen. GASSIOTT: These protesters are mad that the Republican-controlled Alabama House of Representatives just passed a bill to prevent local governments from setting their own minimum wage. The legislature took up the matter after the Birmingham City Council voted to raise the minimum wage from 7. 25 to 10. 10 an hour beginning next year. The protest happened here because it's where the bill's sponsor, David Faulkner, lives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID FAULKNER: This bill is to help. It is to help maintain jobs for all Alabamians and those that make minimum wage. GASSIOTT: Faulkner says the bill isn't about keeping the minimum wage low but having it be uniform statewide. Otherwise, he worries businesses will move to places where they can pay their workers less or that their workers will leave. FAULKNER: If the minimum wage needs to be raised higher than the federal government sets it, then we, as a state, need to look at that, and we need to determine, should the minimum wage be raised or not?

He says a higher wage would help get some workers get out of poverty. Austin says the opposition to the bill is a civil rights issue, like when the state fought efforts to desegregate the University of Alabama.

Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says that if he is president, one of his first acts will be to break up big banks. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, says big banks are just part of the problem. And she focuses a lot on what's called shadow banking. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, the shadow banking system contains trillions of dollars in assets, much of it held by financial firms like hedge funds, which are less regulated than traditional banks. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hillary Clinton has faced plenty of criticism about her ties to the financial industry. And she has responded with a series of proposals that she says are meant to get tough on Wall Street. At a recent town hall in New Hampshire, Clinton said going after the big banks isn't enough to prevent the kinds of activities that sank the economy in 2008. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: There were a lot of bad actors. And if all you do is look over here, I'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. ZARROLI: Just what constitutes the shadow banking sector is open to some interpretation. But it's generally considered to consist of financial institutions that perform a lot of the same functions as banks without being regulated the same way. Dennis Kelleher, who heads the reform group Better Markets, says money market funds are one example. DENNIS KELLEHER: They are sold and marketed as incredibly stable funds where you put in a dollar you get a dollar out. But there's no guarantee of that. And there's no deposit insurance of that as there is in a regulated bank. ZARROLI: Like banks, money market funds take in money from customers and then lend it out again by buying bonds, for instance. But unlike commercial banks, their holdings aren't insured. The same is true of hedge funds and private equity firms. NYU economics professor Lawrence White says, in a crisis, of a lot of people could try to withdraw their money from these places at the same time. LAWRENCE WHITE: If the holders of those short-term claims on these shadow banks start to become nervous, we can see runs. And that's exactly what happened in 2008. ZARROLI: Some people say these shadow banks represent a big potential liability for the financial system and for the economy. And Clinton has proposed steps to regulate these shadow banks more tightly, such as requiring certain funds to hold more capital on hand. For his part, Bernie Sanders doesn't emphasize shadow banking as much. But he says his overall platform would be much tougher against Wall Street than Clinton's would be. Lawrence White says Clinton has a point. Shadow banking is still risky. WHITE: But that shouldn't blind us to the fact that the regulatory system is much tougher and robust today than it was eight years ago - no question in my mind about that. ZARROLI: White says, for example, the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill set up an oversight council that can actually shut down firms that pose a risk to the system. Even so, White says, the regulatory changes probably haven't gone far enough. Anat Admati, finance professor at Stanford, says Clinton overlooks the fact that there are already regulations on the books to address the risks of shadow banking. It's just that regulators don't always enforce them. ANAT ADMATI: Yes, we know that there are all these risks, but we also have some tools to deal with them right now. So what is she saying to the fact that the regulators are not doing it right now? ZARROLI: Admati also notes that shadow banking shouldn't be viewed as separate from the rest of the banking system. Many large bank holding companies own hedge funds and money market funds. So they're deeply involved in shadow banking, too. And the bigger those banks get, the riskier they are to the financial system. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Let's listen to an effort to broaden the debate over banking.

So what is she saying to the fact that the regulators are not doing it right now? ZARROLI: Admati also notes that shadow banking shouldn't be viewed as separate from the rest of the banking system. Many large bank holding companies own hedge funds and money market funds. So they're deeply involved in shadow banking, too. And the bigger those banks get, the riskier they are to the financial system. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.", "section": "Politics", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Have we recovered from the Great Recession, or is it still hard times? Well, according to a new reports released today by the economic innovation group, it depends on where you live - what ZIP code. The report looks at inequality through a spatial lens, and it shows that the recovery has left behind many poor areas. Joining us now is a John Lettieri, cofounder of the Economic Innovation Group and one of the lead authors of the report. Welcome to the program. JOHN LETTIERI: Thank you. SIEGEL: There are lots of studies of inequality. You look at something a little different - the geography of economic well-being and distress. What did you find? LETTIERI: We found some really startling results. First and foremost, we're looking at the recovery years here. This dataset starts in 2010 - so after the recession is over. And what we find is that not only does the recovery not lift distressed communities, it actually bypasses them altogether. In the worst decile of the country in terms of ZIP code. . . SIEGEL: The bottom percent. LETTIERI: The bottom 10 percent -  the recession continues at a pretty breakneck pace. You see double-digit loss in employment. You see significant loss in business establishments - again, double digits. This just does not mirror what's happening in the rest of the country. So those that were most vulnerable before the recession are worse off after those early years of the peak recovery. SIEGEL: And you would say that 50 million Americans live in distressed ZIP codes. You've mentioned a couple of the measures of life there that are different. The number of people who've finished high school - very different from elsewhere in the country. LETTIERI: Exponentially different. If you look at the topmost prosperous and the bottommost distressed, it really is like looking at two different countries. In the most-prosperous ZIP codes, you're unlikely to run into somebody who hasn't graduated from high school. You're unlikely to see a vacant home. Your're unlikely to run into somebody who lives below the poverty rate. All of those factors are inverted in the bottom decile, where you have the vast majority of adults out of work. You have establishments eroding very quickly. SIEGEL: One in 7 houses vacant. LETTIERI: One in 7 houses vacant. And during the years we looked at, 1 in 10 businesses closing down. So these really are poles apart. I guess on the brighter side, the most prosperous decile is also the most populous. So of any category, that's where the most people in America live. And that's something we find, generally, in the report, is that prosperity is more broadly found than distress. SIEGEL: Yeah. The prosperous cities you find are typically newer cities that are outside old core cities. You write at one point that there is only one core city that ranks as a prosperous area in the United States of America. Just wait for five seconds to tell us so people can guess. They won't. LETTIERI: It's Bismarck, N. D. SIEGEL: Bismarck, N. D. , is the only prosperous core city in U. S. LETTIERI: That's right. When we look at prosperity in cities, they tend to be small cities. They tend to be on the outskirts of fast-growing metro areas. They tend to be on the outskirts of metro areas that experienced a harsh recession. SIEGEL: What can the country use with this data that you've come up with? LETTIERI: Well, where we start is really an important foundational point, which is, place truly does matter. Where you start has an enormous impact on where you end up in life. We know that better than ever before thanks to (unintelligible) and some other very interesting analysis we've seen in recent years. SIEGEL: Where you start, meaning what neighborhood, what ZIP code you're from. LETTIERI: What ZIP code - that's right. And so understanding more about the variant experiences of the post-Great Recession economy from geography to geography, from ZIP code to ZIP code, is important to understanding what kind of intervention, if any, you need from a policymaking standpoint. That really starts with understanding what the experiences are of these people on the ground in their neighborhood. SIEGEL: John Lettieri, thanks a lot for talking with us. LETTIERI: Thank you.

What about the 500-euro note? The European Central Bank right now is talking about getting rid of the big note, which is a controversial move for some countries tied to the euro, especially Germany. Critics of the 500-euro note saying it's the currency of choice for organized crime groups looking to use cash for drug trafficking, corruption, money laundering, even for terrorist activities. Some even call the 500 euro the bin Laden. Meanwhile, supporters of the 500 note fear the move is a step toward getting rid of all cash transactions. Peter Sands is a former bank executive who's now a senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He wrote a report on why such high-dollar currency should be eliminated to make it tougher for criminals to transfer funds. And Peter Sands joins us now. Thanks for being with us. PETER SANDS: Hi. WESTERVELT: What's your evidence that these big bills do in fact fuel criminality and corruption and even terrorism? Do we have hard evidence of that? SANDS: I don't think it's right to say they necessarily fuel or encourage them. What high-denomination notes are doing is making it easier for the criminals to do what they want to do. And by taking them away, you're simply making their lives harder. People underestimate how sort of heavy cash is. If you want to move a million dollars in $20 bills, it weighs 110 pounds. It's actually pretty hard for a single individual to carry surreptitiously 110 pounds. In 500-euro notes, that's less than 4 pounds. WESTERVELT: There's been some strong pushback, especially from Germany. Why are the Germans been so strong in support of the big note? SANDS: It's funny that high-denomination notes in almost every currency carry symbolism to people. And I think that is certainly true in Germany. You know, Germany's history with currency has had its up and downs from the sort of terrible disaster the Weimar Republic to the Deutsche mark being very much a symbol of the resurgence of Germany in the postwar era. WESTERVELT: One of the main arguments is that restricting cash could force that money back into banks, which is as we've seen in the past not always as reliable or 100 percent reliable. SANDS: Well, for all the mistakes and gaps in the scrutiny and surveillance systems the bank have, at least they have some. The reality is we have no idea what's happening in the criminal flows of cash because cash is completely anonymous and leaves no transaction record. WESTERVELT: And aren't there legitimate reasons for carrying 500-euro notes? SANDS: Look, there are some legitimate reasons. People like high-denomination notes for giving gifts. They like it as emergency money when they're traveling. But you've got to trade that off against the fact that when we do seizures of drug trafficking or human traffickers or you're looking at the way that terrorist organizations finance themselves, you will find that a very large percentage of what is going on is being driven by high-denomination notes. WESTERVELT: What about here in the U. S. ? Is the Ben Franklin in any danger? SANDS: I think there should be a debate as to the level of issuance and the role of the hundred-dollar bill. There are about 30 hundred-dollar bills for every U. S. citizen, yet the role they play in everyday life is extremely small. Around 5 percent of American adults have a hundred-dollar bill in their pocket at any one time. Yet somebody is holding those bills. And if you look at the data on seizures of drug cash, say, crossing the U. S. -Mexican border, the stuff that gets seized is almost invariably in hundred-dollar bills.

Once coal companies finish with the land, they're supposed to restore it. But as the coal industry declines, it looks like it may not have the funding to keep up those promises. Inside Energy's Leigh Paterson reports from Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the country. DANELLE WILKERSON: Anybody been to an open-pit coal mine - no - all a bunch of newbies - all right. LEIGH PATERSON, BYLINE: Our tour guide was an enthusiastic schoolteacher named Danelle Wilkerson. She spent a summer mining coal. WILKERSON: We're heading north of Gillette to Eagle Butte Coal Mine. It's owned by Alpha Natural Resources. PATERSON: Eagle Butte is one of a dozen mines in Wyoming's coal-rich Powder River Basin, known as the PRB. Wilkerson pointed out some mounds of dirt and rocks that she said would be used in final reclamation later on. WILKERSON: The reclamation is really a great process. They do a good job of putting the land back, I believe, better than the way they found it. PATERSON: I've heard this over and over, that after reclamation, the land is better than before. But I took that tour two summers ago, before Alpha Natural Resources declared bankruptcy and before reclamation became a real concern. So I'm back in Gillette and decided to pull over to revisit Eagle Butt. Even though Alpha is in bankruptcy, mining hasn't stopped. The scale of the mine, it's hard to grasp even in person. From this distance, massive haul trucks sort of look like little Tonka trucks. And to clean up after mining operations here and at a second mine that Alpha owns nearby, it would cost over $400 million. But there's a problem. Alpha, like most other large coal companies operating in Wyoming, never had to set aside money for future cleanup thanks to something called self-bonding. And it's kind of a slippery term, basically an assurance to pay based on a company's financial health. CLARK WILLIAMS-DERRY: A self-bond isn't much more than a wink and a promise. PATERSON: Clark Williams-Derry is with the Sightline Institute, a Seattle-based think tank that focuses on sustainability. WILLIAMS-DERRY: A promise that yeah, when the time comes, yeah, you'll be good for it. PATERSON: But some of these companies may no longer be good for it. Federal regulations require that a company pass a test of financial strength in order to qualify for self-bonding. But in September, a second major coal company, Arch Coal, was reapproved to self-bond and declared bankruptcy four months later. WILLIAMS-DERRY: So then that raises the question - well, who is going to for cleanup? Is it going to be you and me? Is it going to be the general public? Is it going to be adjacent landowners? PATERSON: These questions extend far beyond the Powder River Basin. Three-quarters of Wyoming's cleanup costs are self-bonded. And in Colorado, North Dakota, Indiana and Texas, in each state, it's more than half. But Greg Conrad says he doesn't sense that there is a huge crisis yet. GREG CONRAD: I think we're still trying to get a handle on that. But what I will say is it doesn't appear that the sky is falling. PATERSON: As the head of the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, Conrad deals with departments all over the country. He says regulators might hesitate to make coal companies put real money aside for fear that the additional expense could put them out of business, bringing mining and ongoing reclamation to a halt. In some states coal is key to revenue, money for school construction, jobs and a way of life. Conrad said for all those reasons, regulators are wary to, quote, \"push that button. \"CONRAD: We don't want that scenario. We just don't want to go there. PATERSON: It's a complex issue full of lawyers, Chapter 11 filings and corporate press releases. But on the ground, in coal communities, reclamation matters. DAVE EDWARDS: And this is a feed pickup right here. PATERSON: Dave Edwards and his son Kean are ranchers near Gillette. They live right across the street from a coal mine and have watched it grow. EDWARDS: From the day they started building it 'til now. PATERSON: The Edwards lease reclaimed land from the coal company to graze their cattle. Dave Edwards also works on some reclamation himself. EDWARDS: We're sitting here looking right now at some dozers shoveling down some spoil piles. PATERSON: The reclaimed land blends in with the rest of the prairie but is slightly flatter, more manicured, a little bit like a golf course. The Edwards expect this reclamation will continue. Someday, Dave says the ground will be grazed by livestock and wildlife. EDWARDS: Mule deer, rabbits, sage grouse. Bald eagles will be roaming and hunting these areas. Yeah, hopefully my grandkids are watching all of it. PATERSON: But for the moment, predicting the future for coal cleanup is nearly impossible. Wyoming has over $2 billion in reclamation costs backed by self-bonds. And right now, the coal industry is showing no sign of a comeback. For NPR News, I'm Leigh Paterson.

In fact, average student loan debt in the U. S. has tripled since the mid-1990s. That's a much talked about problem. And as part of our money and life coverage, we're taking a look at how to tackle that debt when you're just starting out after college. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has more. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Samuel Smith graduated with a master's in engineering from Cornell and landed a job at a software firm in Austin. But he owes $190,000 in student loans. That means he's paying almost $2000 a month in loan payments. After rent and food, he says he doesn't have much left over. SAMUEL SMITH: I don't even own a TV. You know, it'd be nice to go out for drinks once in a while. NOGUCHI: When I ask about his carefree 20s, Smith laughs bitterly. Replacing the tires on his car wiped out his checking account and ran up credit card debt. And all this has become a psychological burden. SMITH: The best way I can handle it is to try to not think about it because when I do start thinking about it, I have some serious panic attacks. For the past couple of days, I have been in panic attacks. NOGUCHI: Experts say studies show rising student debt is limiting people's career options. They decide against grad school or feel they can't afford lower-paying public service jobs or the risk of starting a new business. That's a problem because new companies create new jobs. Chris Costello is CEO of Blooom, a personal finance advice firm targeting lower-net worth people. CHRIS COSTELLO: Probably the number one question we get asked from our clients goes something like this - I've got student loan debt. Should I be contributing to my 401(k)? NOGUCHI: Many people think they need to pay off the loans first. But Costello says that's the wrong call. He says if your employer matches contributions to a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b), do it. That's potentially thousands of dollars of free money, and it'd be crazy not to take it. COSTELLO: Please, please do not leave those free dollars on the table. NOGUCHI: Then Costello advises paying off the debt with the lowest balance - not necessarily the one with the highest interest rate. COSTELLO: It's called the debt snowball method, and it's an easy way to kind of build momentum and mental confidence that you're actually making progress in getting debts paid off. NOGUCHI: Debt counselors also say you should see if you can qualify for loan forgiveness, refinancing or debt consolidation. We have a lot more on that at npr. org. Then, of course, you don't want to incur new debts, which means living below your means. Greg Deckard and his wife are trying to do all that. They live in Mobile, Ala. , and he recently went to school to get a software engineering degree. But now they owe $126,000 in student loans on top of a mortgage and daycare for two kids. GREG DECKARD: If I go with, like, a 20 or 25-year plan, then I'm in my 60s when I finish paying. And so I'm 42, and I have (laughter) very little saved for retirement. NOGUCHI: Let alone paying for his kids' college. Sheila Bair is former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, where she dealt with the aftermath of the mortgage crisis. Now she's the president of Washington College, and she's focused on the problem of student loan debt. She's frozen tuition increases at her school, and she criticizes student loan policies that make it too easy to borrow and too hard to pay back. Bair advocates having more federal loan programs that cap monthly loan payments based on income. SHEILA BAIR: That way students who want to be social workers or work for nonprofits in the inner city, they will only have to repay what they can afford to repay. NOGUCHI: That would benefit Rosette Cirillo, an inner-city teacher in Chelsea, Mass. , who's the first in her family to go to college. She jokes about the $120,000 in college and grad school debt. ROSETTE CIRILLO: Oh, it's my tax on trying to become part of the middle-class. NOGUCHI: And it's an especially annoying tax because she says even though she's making her payments, she often gets collections calls. CIRILLO: My phone buzzing in my desk while I was teaching 10 times a day, so there's no time to really stop thinking about it. NOGUCHI: Still, she tells her students to go to college because it leads to better careers. CIRILLO: I taught 12th grade last year and I told them the same thing - like, go. NOGUCHI: Go, but these days it's hard not to consider the price. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   More people have more student loan debt than at any time in history. In fact, average student loan debt in the U. S. has tripled since the mid-1990s. That's a much talked about problem. And as part of our money and life coverage, we're taking a look at how to tackle that debt when you're just starting out after college. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has more. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Samuel Smith graduated with a master's in engineering from Cornell and landed a job at a software firm in Austin. But he owes $190,000 in student loans. That means he's paying almost $2000 a month in loan payments. After rent and food, he says he doesn't have much left over. SAMUEL SMITH: I don't even own a TV. You know, it'd be nice to go out for drinks once in a while. NOGUCHI: When I ask about his carefree 20s, Smith laughs bitterly. Replacing the tires on his car wiped out his checking account and ran up credit card debt. And all this has become a psychological burden. SMITH: The best way I can handle it is to try to not think about it because when I do start thinking about it, I have some serious panic attacks. For the past couple of days, I have been in panic attacks. NOGUCHI: Experts say studies show rising student debt is limiting people's career options. They decide against grad school or feel they can't afford lower-paying public service jobs or the risk of starting a new business. That's a problem because new companies create new jobs. Chris Costello is CEO of Blooom, a personal finance advice firm targeting lower-net worth people. CHRIS COSTELLO: Probably the number one question we get asked from our clients goes something like this - I've got student loan debt. Should I be contributing to my 401(k)? NOGUCHI: Many people think they need to pay off the loans first. But Costello says that's the wrong call. He says if your employer matches contributions to a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b), do it. That's potentially thousands of dollars of free money, and it'd be crazy not to take it. COSTELLO: Please, please do not leave those free dollars on the table. NOGUCHI: Then Costello advises paying off the debt with the lowest balance - not necessarily the one with the highest interest rate. COSTELLO: It's called the debt snowball method, and it's an easy way to kind of build momentum and mental confidence that you're actually making progress in getting debts paid off.

S. economy might get dragged down by the rest of the world. Now those worries are on hold thanks to the latest report from the Labor Department. It shows employment rebounded last month with 242,000 new jobs. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: A month ago, a weaker-than-expected jobs report for January sparked fears that the U. S. economy might be stalling out. And combined with turmoil in world financial markets and weak global growth that hurt U. S. exports, there were even fears the U. S. might be heading for a recession. But Kevin Logan, chief U. S. economist at HSBC, says February's better-than-expected job gains suggest the moderate growth the U. S. has been experiencing remains on track. KEVIN LOGAN: Well, this is a positive sign that the domestic economy hasn't succumbed to these headwinds that seem to be blowing in from abroad. YDSTIE: Logan says another positive sign in today's report was a fifth-straight monthly increase in the size of the labor force. In February, it grew by more than half a million people. LOGAN: Labor market conditions are improving in a manner that more people feel that they can find jobs, and they are finding jobs. YDSTIE: Some of those people are older workers returning to the labor market. Others may be young people who delayed looking for a job after the Great Recession. LOGAN: A lot of younger people stayed in school. Well, maybe now they're finally coming out and finding the jobs that they hope to find. YDSTIE: That flow of Americans leaving the sidelines to enter the labor market meant the unemployment rate held steady at 4. 9 percent last month. On the negative side, wages ticked down a tenth of a percent last month after a big gain in January. That may be partly because a lot of the job creation last month was in sectors like retail with relatively low-paying jobs. Many analysts suggest the solid February job growth makes it more likely the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates again in June. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Over the past few decades, the city has become safer, richer and a lot more crowded. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, just 3 percent of apartments are vacant. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: This is 57th Street in Manhattan. It used to be known mainly for office space and retail stores, but now there are several slender new condo towers going up, some of them 80 or 90 stories high. All over Manhattan these days, you can see apartment buildings going up. And yet, it's never been harder to find a place to live. Alicia Glen is the city's deputy mayor for housing and development. ALICIA GLEN: Well, we are in an official housing crisis period in New York City. Our population is growing much more rapidly than our housing stock, and so we have a really imbalanced housing market. ZARROLI: Glen says in recent years, a lot of new people have moved into the city. And because of changes in rent control laws, the city has lost 250,000 affordable apartments over the past few decades. The result is a market that's tighter than ever. Ingrid Ellen, who teaches urban policy and planning at NYU, says after controlling for inflation, median rents have increased 12 percent in eight years at a time when incomes are up just 2 percent. INGRID ELLEN: Low-income households are struggling to pay their rent in every city in the United States. And what really makes New York City stand out is that moderate income renters are struggling. SIMON KAIS: Smells good. DAVID INFANTE: Yeah, I guess. ZARROLI: David Infante (ph) and Simon Kais (ph) are buddies from college. They're in their twenties and they both have pretty good jobs. Not long ago, they spent three days looking for an apartment in lower Manhattan. Kais said they wanted two bedrooms and a dishwasher, and they didn't want to have to walk up too many flights of stairs. KAIS: We didn't want to spend more than - I think $1,400 per person was the absolute limit. And those things combined with the dishwasher made things pretty hard in New York City. ZARROLI: Eventually, they found something in their price range, but it was in a gritty part of Brooklyn across from a hospital where they hear sirens a lot. INFANTE: If you, like, sort of did an exit poll on people who did five years in New York, 10 years in New York and decided to get out, housing and the constant runaround of it would probably be something that everyone cites, or at least most people. ZARROLI: City officials are worried that a lot of people will be driven from New York. Landlords typically demand that prospective tenants have $40,000 in annual income for every $1,000 in rent, which means a six-figure income will get you a pretty nice one-bedroom in much of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Again, Alicia Glen. GLEN: It may be hard for somebody who lives in the Midwest or the South to believe that you could make a $100,000 a year here and have a family and have a family of four and not be able to find an affordable place to live. But $100,000 a year could be a teacher and a nurse, and those people are the lifeblood of New York City. ZARROLI: Glen says new housing is being built in New York, but the high cost of construction and land makes it hard for developers to earn a profit except at the high end. Douglas Wagner, an executive at the real estate firm Bond New York says even as competition for affordable housing surges, there's an oversupply of expensive apartments, places that start at $8,500 a month. DOUGLAS WAGNER: Now especially in better buildings, there are a lot of empty apartments looking for tenants and, for the first time in some time, offering major incentives to get tenants to take apartments at this level. ZARROLI: Meanwhile, the house shortage is driving more and more middle-income New Yorkers into the further reaches of Brooklyn and Queens to find apartments, and a new wave of gentrification is threatening to displace a lot of low-income people from those neighborhoods. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. SHAPIRO: And tomorrow, we'll hear about Mayor Bill de Blasio's plant to build affordable housing in New York City. Long-term residents question whether the apartments will really be affordable. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   It has never been this tough to find a decent place to rent in New York City.

He wants to rezone some neighborhoods to allow more construction and to require developers to build more affordable housing.

It's a three-bedroom apartment. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Andy Cohen stands in a sunny vacant apartment in a building called the Bradford in Brooklyn. This neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, was once synonymous with crime and urban neglect, but a lot of young people have moved here in search of affordable rents, and the BRP companies where Cohen works saw an opportunity to build. COHEN: You know, there'd been a lot of disinvestment, but the bones were there. And it was a close commute to Manhattan. And we just thought it was a good bed for development. ZARROLI: BRP is a for-profit company, but many of the apartments it builds are set aside for low and moderate-income people with the help of tax credits and other government programs. Using developers like BRP, the de Blasio administration plans to build or preserve some 200,000 affordable apartments. Alicia Glen is the city's deputy mayor. ALICIA GLEN: We've put together what has been characterized as the most ambitious and comprehensive affordable housing plan in the country by far. ZARROLI: The plan would harness some of the intense development pressures sweeping the city. The mayor wants to rezone neighborhoods like these to make it easier for private developers to build. He would do this by modifying some of the zoning regulations that drive up costs, such as building height restrictions or the requirement that apartment buildings have underground garages. Jerilyn Perine of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a think tank, says a lot of these regulations are obsolete. JERILYN PERINE: The Department of City Planning now is really trying to sort of step back and say, there were things that were done, particularly in the mid-80s. They were good ideas. They were helpful then, but now we really need to make sure that we can add to our housing stock. ZARROLI: In exchange, the city would force developers that want to build in New York to construct more affordable apartments, says Alicia Glen. GLEN: It's both attacking it from a supply and demand perspective but then saying the market alone will not actually solve this problem. We need to aggressively subsidize and use every tool we have to make sure that we're bringing on enough affordable housing. ZARROLI: But surprisingly, the plan has encountered opposition in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. Buildings like the Bradford are designed to house people of different income levels. The days when large projects were built to house huge groups of poor people are long gone. Again, Andy Cohen. COHEN: We think, generally, it's better to have a mix of incomes living in, you know, a neighborhood rather than, you know, either a low or high income because you just get a more vibrant community. ZARROLI: The Bradford houses some very poor people, but the largest group of tenants are moderate-income, which, in New York, can mean an annual salary of $120,000 for a family of four, and the rent they pay to live there can reach $2,400 a month. That puts it well out of reach for a lot of the neighborhood's poorest residents, people like Rachel Rivera, a mother of six who showed up at a town hall meeting in East New York to protest the mayor's plan. Rivera, who lives on disability, says local landlords are already pushing people out of their apartments to lure newcomers with higher incomes. She worries that there won't be enough apartments for people like her under the rezoning plan. RACHEL RIVERA: What I'm worried about is that I get pushed out and I won't be able to afford these affordable housing that they're saying that they're going to put up. ZARROLI: City officials are aware of concerns like Rivera's, but they say allowing a mix of incomes is the best way to make sure buildings stay economically viable. They also say that by replacing some of the city's low-rise neighborhoods with higher density apartment towers, they will ultimately be able to build more low-income housing. A wave of development pressure is washing over New York. The challenge is to channel that pressure to build the kind of city New Yorkers want. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

NPR's John Ydstie continues our Money and Life coverage with advice from some people who've tried. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Dave Selden's business grew out of a passion he has for beer - glass after glass of beer. That became obvious when I ran across this video on his website. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)DAVE SELDEN: I was trying to drink a different beer every single day for 999 days I made it to - I don't know - 600-and-some-odd beers - so 660-some on consecutive days, which is crazy actually now that I say that out loud. YDSTIE: Back in 2009, Selden who lives in Portland, Ore. , had a public relations job. But he was writing a beer blog on the side, and he told me he started getting invited to lots of beer festivals. SELDEN: And I needed a way to kind of keep track of all the beers that I was trying at the time. And alcohol being what it is, sometimes my memory the next day wasn't great. YDSTIE: So Selden developed a pocket-sized paper notebook with a flavor wheel and other graphic aids to help him take good notes. He wanted it to look good, so he called a professional printer who told him he couldn't just print a few copies. So Selden decided to print a thousand and see if he could sell some. They sold out in two weeks, but Selden was still cautious. SELDEN: I would have thought the idea of this pocket notebook for beer tasting becoming a business was preposterous if you'd told me that at the time. YDSTIE: But he got a lot of encouragement. Friends said, why don't you make a tasting notebook for wine or coffee? He did. And now he's making about a dozen versions, including for cheese, hot sauce and cigars. Last year, the sales for Selden's company called 33 Books totaled around $300,000. Not bad for a one-man operation. And he's gone global. SELDEN: It's sold in stores all around the world. Yesterday I sent a bunch of books over to Germany and Switzerland, and I have some stuff going out to Taiwan today. YDSTIE: Selden has been growing his business for about seven years but only quit his day job three years ago. And he advises aspiring entrepreneurs to take it slowly. That's not necessarily the best advice for everyone. Maggie and Brian Harlow jumped in with both feet when they started a Signarama franchise in Louisville, Ky. , 13 years ago. They provide businesses with everything from refrigerator magnets to storefront signs crafted in their own workshop. MAGGIE HARLOW: We decided, well, in order to be successful - was give it everything we got - commit fully to it. BRIAN HARLOW: If we kept depending on a secondary income from somewhere else, we would never push hard enough on this. M. HARLOW: And we had to sort of live on beans and rice for little while and work really long hours. YDSTIE: And it worked for them. Last year, their firm of 19 employees generated revenues close to $2 million. Both Maggie and Brian caught the entrepreneurial bug from their parents. They are partners in this business, and evidence suggests that having a partner increase the odds of success. But Maggie says if your partner is your spouse, it can raise the stakes. M. HARLOW: Whatever interpersonal issues you have at home, they will be magnified at work. YDSTIE: In fact, soon after they were open, their sales were sparking higher, and they were moving to a new location and taking on more expense. It required a flood of quick decisions, and Maggie and Brian were overwhelmedM. HARLOW: We couldn't agree on the strategy. You know, do you hire this kind of person? Do we need to buy more equipment? There were so many decisions to be made. YDSTIE: So they found a business coach and met with her for several months to craft a plan. But Brian, who's a doer, got tired of the meetings. M. HARLOW: And he said, you know, I really am not enjoying this. I don't enjoy sitting and talking about this stuff. Why don't you go to the meetings, and then you guys decide what's going to happen or what is the best decision. I'll support it, and I'll get behind it. We'll make it happen. And I thought, well, that's awesome. YDSTIE: So Maggie took on the strategizing, which she loved, and Brian took charge of the implementing. Patricia Greene, a professor at Babson College which focuses on training entrepreneurs, says getting advice from someone like a business coach or advisory council is crucial. But, she says, the fundamental ingredient for a successful small business is a passion for what you do. PATRICIA GREENE: 'Cause anything that has to do with starting and growing a business, it's really hard work. And it takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort.

CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Ruben Valladares Martin makes bags - paper bags - all sizes and shapes. Out of his small family home near Havana's airport, Valladares and his 30 employees cut the paper, glue the corners and assemble the handles all by hand. RUBEN VALLADARES MARTIN: (Speaking Spanish).

I'm hosting the show this week from Youth Radio. It's a news organization for journalists as young as 14. Going back to the early '90s, this has been an outlet for students, getting them off sometimes troubled streets to tell stories about their communities. You know, adults talk a lot about issues affecting young people, education, race, social media. Well, this week we're going to let young journalists do the talking. I met up with one in downtown Oakland, where you can hear the economic revival. I was standing with reporter Seyni Alkabelon (ph) in front of an old building that will soon be a part of the Uber's headquarters. Seyni's 18-year-old. He's proud of his hometown, Oakland. It's a diverse city. It's going through this cultural and economic renaissance, but it is feeling the pressure of gentrification. And Seyni's seen his neighborhood change. SEYNI ALKABELON, BYLINE: There's a lot of families in West Oakland that are being pushed out because the prices are going up of housing. It's a miracle that my family is still there. I never thought that I'd walk into my liquor store - you know, which is where poor working-class people go to get small food items and things like that. But I never thought that I'd walk into my liquor store and I'd b the only person of color or black person there. GREENE: OK, so you're actually going to take me to an interview we're going to do together at the library? ALKABELON: Right, yeah. We're going to go see Dorothy Lazard, who is the head of the History Room at the Oakland Public Library. GREENE: Cool. DOROTHY LAZARD: So this is Oakland History Room. This is my lair, as it were. GREENE: Dorothy Lazard is a historian, though she knows the tension in present day Oakland firsthand as a black woman in an increasingly white neighborhood. She had some workers over to paint her house recently. An alarm went off. The police arrived, and she felt like they were skeptical that she was the homeowner. LAZARD: The entire encounter, he had his hand on his gun like he didn't believe that I actually lived there. ALKABELON: And does that affect your sense of belonging, where there's people who are in your neighborhood who are looking at you as if you're an outsider? LAZARD: No, it doesn't change my sense of belonging. If Oakland has - if seeing the changes in Oakland has done anything for me, it's confirmed for me that I will not be moved off by patch because I absolutely know how I got to be here. GREENE: It strikes me that we are sitting in one of America's most integrated cities at a moment when this country is confronting racism in a very real way. What do you think is at stake in Oakland? LAZARD: What would be at stake is if we missed the opportunity to be brave finally - 'cause Californians think they're tolerant when it comes to racial issues. And we're really not. Largely, we're avoidant. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I don't want you to make me feel uncomfortable. We need to start having some really hard conversations about how that racial climate you refer to makes us feel. GREENE: That was Dorothy Lazard of the Oakland Public Library along with Youth Radio reporter Seyni Alkabelon. Now, the economic changes in Oakland are fueled in part by the massive tech boom here in the Bay Area. And reporter Kasey Saeturn, who's is 20-years-old, has been looking at this region's incredibly expensive housing market, which has left many young people homeless. KASEY SAETURN, BYLINE: It's normal for millennials to still live at home these days. But what if you're a millennial who doesn't have a home to go back to? ALKEISHA PORTER: I didn't mind sleeping on a floor. I didn't mind sleeping on a couch. SAETURN: That's 23-year-old Alkeisha Porter. Growing up, she says she didn't like her mom's husband, and her dad had a drug problem. So at 16, she moved out. PORTER: I was basically just house hopping from friends to some family members. Hey, it was comfortable to me. It was not cold. I wasn't sleeping outside. SAETURN: Then Porter found an apartment for herself and her baby in a building located here on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco. Run by a nonprofit called Mercy, it provides subsidized affordable housing for low-income residents, including 25 apartments reserved for 18 to 24-year-olds. One of Porter's neighbors is Cinthia Mendoza. CINTHIA MENDOZA: This is my first dream, to be on my own, in my own apartment, paying rent, paying bills like a normal adult does. SAETURN: Domestic violence forced Mendoza out of her home and into foster care when she was 17. Now she's 21. Mendoza takes me up the elevator to show off her new apartment. MENDOZA: Behind the door there's a refrigerator - like, a huge one, which I've ever had in my life. Everything was brand-new when I got here. SAETURN: Mendoza is one of the lucky ones. There are far more low-income youth who need housing than they are subsidized apartments available. Technically, Mendoza and Porter could qualify for Federal Public Housing instead of living at Mercy. RON ASHFORD: Usually it's pretty easy. SAETURN: That's Ron Ashford, a director at the Federal Housing Authority. ASHFORD: They just need to go to the Housing Authority and apply. SAETURN: But the problem isn't applying. It's getting in. And young adults get lower priority. ASHFORD: Remember that you are competing against families who do not have a home and who are looking for public housing. When I was at New York City Housing Authority some 20 years ago, the waiting list was over 10 years. SAETURN: And in San Francisco, the waiting list is so long it's closed for the time being. There's another catch too, and it's kind of a big one. If you are a young person trying to take college classes, there are extra rules that limit your access to Section 8 Federal Housing. Eric Rice doesn't think this is fair. He's a professor of social work at the University of Southern California. He has a focus on homeless youth. ERIC RICE: We need to be rethinking some of these rules around housing for students because if we have students who are homeless, who are low-income, they need higher education as a long-term solution for alleviating their situation with respect to poverty. And we want to make that easier, not harder. SAETURN: It wasn't always this way. Before 2005, students didn't have to meet such strict rules, but then a housing scandal broke. Well-off college athletes in schools across the country were living in Section 8 public housing. After that the rules changed, affecting most full and part-time students. That's one reason local solutions like Mercy Housing have popped up. They welcome students even though they have to limit student residents to part-timers to qualify for federal tax credits. If you visit the Mercy apartments, you'll notice San Francisco City College is right across the street. That's on purpose, making it easy for the young residents to enroll if they choose to. And students don't have to worry about being kicked out of their homes just for taking a few classes. GREENE: That's reporter Kasey Seaturn. She's just one of the voices we'll hear this week as we broadcast from Youth Radio in Oakland, Calif. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And I'm David Greene in Oakland, Calif. I'm hosting the show this week from Youth Radio. It's a news organization for journalists as young as 14. Going back to the early '90s, this has been an outlet for students, getting them off sometimes troubled streets to tell stories about their communities. You know, adults talk a lot about issues affecting young people, education, race, social media. Well, this week we're going to let young journalists do the talking. I met up with one in downtown Oakland, where you can hear the economic revival. I was standing with reporter Seyni Alkabelon (ph) in front of an old building that will soon be a part of the Uber's headquarters. Seyni's 18-year-old. He's proud of his hometown, Oakland. It's a diverse city. It's going through this cultural and economic renaissance, but it is feeling the pressure of gentrification. And Seyni's seen his neighborhood change. SEYNI ALKABELON, BYLINE: There's a lot of families in West Oakland that are being pushed out because the prices are going up of housing. It's a miracle that my family is still there. I never thought that I'd walk into my liquor store - you know, which is where poor working-class people go to get small food items and things like that. But I never thought that I'd walk into my liquor store and I'd b the only person of color or black person there. GREENE: OK, so you're actually going to take me to an interview we're going to do together at the library? ALKABELON: Right, yeah. We're going to go see Dorothy Lazard, who is the head of the History Room at the Oakland Public Library. GREENE: Cool. DOROTHY LAZARD: So this is Oakland History Room. This is my lair, as it were.

Alberto Rodriguez - he left Cuba in the 1960s - says things can't get much worse there. ALBERTO RODRIGUEZ: The people are the ones that suffer. They're making $20 a month. You can't live on $20 a month. CORNISH: Leonardo Gordo has more recent memories of Cuba, having left just 14 years ago. He says he has faith that things will get better. LEONARDO GORDO: I know that at the end of the day it's up to the Cuban government to make the actual change for the Cuban people. But I think that President Obama's visit over there has had a positive impact the vast majority of Cubans in Cuba and Cubans in Miami. CORNISH: He's hopeful that Congress eventually will repeal the Cold War era economic trade embargo that separated the Cuban and U. S. economies. I ask Rachel DeLevie-Orey, a Cuba expert with the Atlantic Council, about the changing economic conditions, starting with whether she thought Congress would do that. RACHEL DELEVIE-OREY: I'm not optimistic that Congress will overturn the entire embargo in one night. But it is possible that they could chip away at it and sort of make allowances for different types of economic activity in Cuba. CORNISH: So, you know, I took a look at the Commerce Department fact sheet on this, and I see company names like Carnival Cruise Lines and Starwood Hotels and Resorts in terms of activity in Cuba thanks to this easing of restrictions. But outside of hospitality, who's benefiting here? DELEVIE-OREY: I think that one of the sectors we're seeing benefit most is this small emerging private sector in Cuba. Recently, certain small businesses have cropped up, things like hair salons, small gymnasiums, small restaurants. And so people who are able to get money back from their relatives who are living in Miami in Florida, anywhere in the United States, they're now able to receive unlimited remittances from that family. And that sort of served as seed money for these businesses. So that's been very helpful for small business owners. CORNISH: So what does that mean for Cuba? I mean, can they get more money from the international community? I mean, how could this affect them outside of the embargo? DELEVIE-OREY: I think one of the biggest things that could change is Cuba's access to the international financial institutions, like the IMF, like Inter-American Development Bank. And that's something that President Obama could really bring to the forefront as well. He can allow the United States to abstain from votes on this, which would allow Cuba access to assistance from these institutions, which would really help improve the Cuban economy. CORNISH: You've said that this means that Cuba won't necessarily be able to demonize the U. S. in the same way. But is there any sign that it really could have an effect on the economic and political climate inside of the country? DELEVIE-OREY: I think on the economic climate absolutely. I think that we are already seeing that President Obama lifted the remittance cap for Cuban-Americans, raised the remittance cap so that there is much more capital flowing into the country, especially as certain industries like telecom, hospitality, agriculture, are able to put more money into the Cuban economy. That's giving Cubans greater economic autonomy. And that's something that I think is in U. S. and Cuban interest to see expanded. CORNISH: When it comes to the Cuban economy itself, what are you looking for in terms of what Raul Castro might do, actual changes from Cuba's government? DELEVIE-OREY: Well, I think that Raul Castro has actually proven himself not to be the ideological twin of his brother, which is to say that he has opened up the Cuban economy little by little. And so that's going to mean sort of cleaning up the financial system, which means working on unifying the dual currency system, making the books more transparent, creating a legal structure which foreign companies will find trustworthy. And so all of these things are going to be important. And I think that we've seen a certain degree of willingness from Raul that we did not see from Fidel.

The town known for gambling is almost out of money. New Jersey lawmakers have a plan they say will get Atlantic City's finances under control. City leaders don't love the idea, but residents are hoping for anything that will change their luck. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Atlantic City is on an island between mainland New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean. After you've been here a while, the locals like to say you won't want to leave. AL BAILEY: We have an old saying. We got sand in our shoes. ROSE: Al Bailey (ph) was born and raised in Atlantic City. He has no plans to go anywhere, even though his real estate business is slow. But Bailey says he knows many people who can't afford to stay. BAILEY: A lot of people are walking away from their homes and just getting and leaving. They just can't make ends meet. ROSE: Last year, the Atlantic City area had the highest foreclosure rate, not just in New Jersey but in the whole country. That's partly because of lost casino jobs, and it's partly because of rising property taxes. That's been hard on people like 86-year-old William Cheetum (ph). He used to own a house on North Maryland Avenue. WILLIAM CHEETUM: We've been there for 50 years. The taxes just got to be getting too high for us. We was on a limited income. We were just taxed out of our home, basically. ROSE: The region's economy is trapped in a downward spiral, says Oliver Cooke, an economist at Stockton University. OLIVER COOKE: The big problem is the continuing decline in the casino industry. And now I think that has spiraled into a housing crisis and, of course, the fiscal crisis that the actually city of Atlantic City currently faces. ROSE: The casinos used to account for much of Atlantic City's tax revenue, but four of the city's casinos closed, leaving only eight in business. Two-thirds of the city's tax base has disappeared since 2010. To make up for the shortfall, Atlantic City raised taxes on its residents by a lot, but the city is still coming up short. How tenuous are the city's finances right now? DON GUARDIAN: You know, we could run out of money in about a month. ROSE: Mayor Don Guardian says without an infusion of cash, all nonessential city services will shut down on April 8. There was a tentative agreement with the state that was supposed to stabilize the city's finances, but Guardian says it's a bad deal for Atlantic City. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GUARDIAN: The final piece of legislation that the state presented to us was far from a partnership. It was absolutely a fascist dictatorship. ROSE: Guardian says the plan amounts to a total state takeover, one that would allow New Jersey lawmakers to sell off city assets and break contracts with the city's public-sector unions. Council President Marty Small says the city has been trying to avoid that by shrinking the government payroll. MARTY SMALL: Everyone wants to point to spending. I mean, it's not spending. The spending is lower. The budget is lower. ROSE: City leaders say they've cut about $25 million from the budget, but that leaves a deficit of more than 30 million this year and potentially hundreds of millions more going forward. Governor Chris Christie is defending the proposed state takeover. CHRIS CHRISTIE: I have to have the freedom to do what needs to be done down there to fix the problem - bloated salaries, bloated pensions, bloated agreements, be able to negotiate with creditors. I've got to be able to do all that. If I don't have the tools to do that, then why bother? ROSE: Without help from the state, Atlantic City could be looking at bankruptcy, and things may get worse before they get better. In the fall, New Jersey voters will decide whether to allow casinos in the northern part of the state closer to New York City. Oliver Cooke at Stockton University says that could take even more business away from Atlantic City. COOKE: Those dollars are going to end up somewhere else. You know, that's empty hotel rooms and empty gaming halls. ROSE: More empty houses, too. Joel Rose, NPR News, Atlantic City, N. J. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Atlantic City is on a long losing streak.

SHAHANI: That was Amanda Larsen, Eric Shannon and Lee Davidson. They each have some savings. They're tired of renting, and while people five or 10 years older may still be shell-shocked from the housing crash, this younger generation seems ready to start that new chapter, even if it didn't go well for their parents. LARSEN: You know, don't make some of the debt mistakes that they made. SHAHANI: Larsen, age 24 in Kansas City, recalls how her mom kind of messed up - took on larger loans that she could afford. And her mom warns her - stay within your limits. LARSEN: Get the exact number that you know you're going to be approved for and don't go above it. SHAHANI: For a few years, Lee Davidson, a 35-year-old in Tampa, felt like she had no business buying because her personal life wasn't where she wanted it to be. DAVIDSON: I'm single. I'm not with someone. I don't have a partner. I'm not married. I'm not anywhere near being married. SHAHANI: But now she realizes her career is solid, and it's time. In the years since the housing crisis, really good, free tools have come out - online calculators that help you calculate, based on your numbers - at what point does it make more sense to buy a home versus keep on renting? NPR gave the aspiring homeowners a homework assignment - try out the calculators. Did you have a chance to do the homework? DAVIDSON: I did. I was slammed at work, but I squeezed it all in. SHAHANI: Davidson was struck by the numbers that mattered. It's not just the sale price of the home and interest rate. It's also how many years you plan to stay. (SOUNDBITE OF SKYPE RING TONE)SHAHANI: Another part of the assignment was to get on Skype and talk directly with economist Jed Kolko. He helped create one of the calculators by the real estate company Trulia. And he explains to Davidson - whether you keep the home two years or 15 makes a huge difference in how much of it you own, the equity you're building. One big factor that calculator does not factor - human behavior. That is - how likely are you to save versus spend - to put your money into a mutual fund versus a frappucino. JED KOLKO: If you're the sort of person who has no trouble at all saving every month, then that advantage of homeownership might not mean that much to you. DAVIDSON: OK. I save, but I save minimally (laughter). SHAHANI: So buying a home could be a way to make you save. The calculators ask a kind of unfair question too. How much will the home you buy go up in value? That is really hard to know. Even the experts get it wrong. Eric Shannon is betting, optimistically, 10 percent appreciation every couple years. SHANNON: I'm seeing houses that are going on the market, and they're going off very soon thereafter. SHAHANI: But Kolko warns him - Tulsa is a one-industry town, the oil and gas industry, and it's hurting. So someone like Shannon, who works as an engineer there, could lose his job and see his home price crash too. Meanwhile, Amanda Larsen discovered she and her husband could buy bigger and still pay less than their current rent. He wants to buy and never move again, so now she is going to tell him. . . LARSEN: We can technically afford a little bit more. And this way, you get more of what you want, and I get more of what I want. SHAHANI: To try our the calculators for yourself and some other tools and tips on renting versus buying, visit the NPR Facebook group Your Money and Your Life. Aarti Shahani, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Renting is the new buying. That became a kind of mantra after the housing crisis. Many Americans stopped believing that owning a home was a way to build wealth. Things could now be changing a bit. And as part of a series we call Your Money And Your Life, NPR's Aarti Shahani reports that people who were kids during the crisis are now leading the pack when it comes to buying. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Here's a fun fact. Millennials are the single biggest group of home buyers in the U. S. - more than Gen Xers, more than boomers. It's the people 35 and under who are taking the leap. AMANDA LARSEN: Really, I really want a dog (laughter). And my husband won't let me have one until we have a house.

The company's trying to change its image by rolling out the new Acura NSX, the most expensive car being built by a major manufacturer in the U. S. From member station WOSU in Columbus, Mandie Trimble checks it out. MANDIE TRIMBLE, BYLINE: The Honda Performance Manufacturing Center is a new 184,000 square foot plant built in Marysville, Ohio, 45 miles northwest of Columbus. Honda already has a huge presence here, mass-producing safe, family-friendly Accords. But this is something different. Here, mechanics are using electric wrenches to help install an engine into a low, sleek body of a two-seat sports car. The hybrid will be marketed as the Acura NSX and it'll make its public debut in late April. Clement D'Souza is the project's chief engineer. CLEMENT D'SOUZA: You have three motors, a V6 six engine and a 9DCT transmission. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE REVVING)TRIMBLE: In other words, a whole lot of power. The Acura NSX can go from zero to 60 in three seconds. D'SOUZA: You have instant acceleration from the time you hit the gas pedal. The engine kicks in and the turbo backs it up so you're thrown in the back of your seat. TRIMBLE: That's the thrill of a supercar, which can leave a Tesla in the dust. Wealthy customers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars - millions even, for an exotic ride few others own. But at about $160,000, the Acura NSX is cheap compared with the supercars made in other countries. D'SOUZA: It's all this technology that you're adding to the car that brings it in that range, the same technology you'll see in a LaFerrari or a 918. JIM GILLETTE: The only downside that I would say that's potential is the proliferation of competing vehicles in the marketplace right now. TRIMBLE: Jim Gillette is an independent automotive analyst in Michigan. With names like Ferrari, Porsche and McLaren building hybrids too, Honda will face fierce competition. But, then again, it's got that big price advantage. GILLETTE: You're going to see a lot of people in the marketplace at the lower prices that may dream about a 918 or a LaFerrari but are going to be just as happy if not happier with the NSX. TRIMBLE: The biggest problem may be Honda's image. Gillette says Japanese cars are known for dependability, not high-performance. The first-generation NSX designed in the late 1980s didn't create much enthusiasm and Honda killed it off in 2005. GILLETTE: People have migrated to the German cars more in terms of excitement so I think that there clearly needs to be a move now on the part of Honda. TRIMBLE: Analyst Eric Lyman with truecar. com agrees. ERIC LYMAN: As the luxury market has gone more towards performance in the last decade or so, Acura's missed out on that. TRIMBLE: Honda's D'Souza says NSX's goal is to become a superstar, shining so brightly it acts like a halo. D'SOUZA: It will definitely help the brand. The technology in the supercar can be cascaded down to the rest of the Acura brand. TRIMBLE: Honda is hoping the hype will get people talking about Acura and then visiting dealerships.

The great recession nearly destroyed the RV industry in the U. S. , but now camper trailers and motor homes are hot again. We sent Frank Morris of member station KCUR RV shopping to find out more. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: RV outlets, like this sprawling dealership south of Kansas City run by Daryn Anderson, are hopping. DARYN ANDERSON: Business has been great - six straight record years and no end in sight. MORRIS: Sales here have roughly tripled since the bottom of the recession. Anderson is sitting in a brand-new building that's four times larger than the one it replaced. Out on the lot, it's cold, with a sharp wind blowing through rows of camper trailers, but customers like Grant and Cathy Lowe are buying. CATHY LOWE: We bought us a trailer. GRANT LOWE: We bought a second home that I think we're going to enjoy. It's everything we want, and we're real happy with it. MORRIS: The Lowes are in their 50s, and this camper figures large in their retirement plans. They intend to have it paid off before they quit working. And with interest rates and fuel prices low, they think they're in good shape. G. LOWE: Our jobs are very secure and stable. The economy seems to be, you know, on a pretty good rebound right now, so I think, you know, we feel safe that we can by this time. MORRIS: RVs range from small, teardrop-shaped trailers, little more than a dry place to sleep, to the ultra-high-end motor homes Clint Mooney sells. CLINT MOONEY: That's a 55-inch TV. This coach actually has four televisions - three inside and one outside. MORRIS: A big TV on the outside of the camper. Now, this $400,000 Winnebago looks like a bus with swirly designs. We open the door, and it's like walking into a fancy, spacious apartment. MOONEY: You have a nice, big shower with a seat. And then you have a stackable washer and dryer system. MORRIS: The front seats are wide, heated, massage-enhanced recliners sheathed in something called UltraLeather. MOONEY: These sell very well, actually. We have repeat customers that come back and buy them every two or three, four years. MORRIS: But just seven years ago - you know, the recession - RV sales tanked. In fact, when President Obama wanted to spotlight the worst of the economy, he went to the RV capital of the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It is good to be back in Elkhart. (APPLAUSE)MORRIS: Elkhart County, Ind. , where most American RVs are built. KYLE HANNON: It was a tough time. You know, a lot of companies were shut down. A lot of people had been laid off. Everybody knew somebody who was out of work. MORRIS: That's Kyle Hannon, President of the Elkhart Chamber of Commerce. He says unemployment more than quadrupled as dozens of manufacturers went under. Dealerships folded, too, like the one Renee Hinson's parents ran for decades near Grandview, Mo. RENEE HINSON: If you would've asked me, I would've thought we were sunk. MORRIS: She means the whole RV market. Now, Hinson is thrilled to be selling RVs again. HINSON: Having seen the business since the '70s forward, it's back to, like, the '70s. We've seen astounding growth - astounding growth. MORRIS: For one thing, around 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 each day, but that's not all that's driving the market expansion. The average age of an RV owner is now just under 50, according to an industry Association. And Hinson says she's selling campers to people in their 30s like never before. Meantime, RV companies keep hauling out new products, as you can see at the annual RV show show in Topeka, Kan. , where Greg Smith and his wife are shopping. Did you guys find something? GREG SMITH: Best one the house right there, that Montana. MORRIS: So wait, are you guys actually thinking about buying this thing? SMITH: Maybe not this one. I'm looking for something a little bigger. I need to put my four-wheeler in the back. MORRIS: So you want a toy hauler? SMITH: That's right. That's right (laughter). Yeah, we're looking for a toy haulers. MORRIS: Toy haulers are trailers or motor homes with garages built in. Smith is planning on spending upwards $100,000 on his. And with the broad smile on his face, it's easy to picture Smith enjoying a warm winter evening far from Topeka, out on the road with record numbers of his fellow Americans hauling a home away from home.

They can't afford their rent. One in 4 low-income families pays more than 70 percent of their income on rent, leaving little money for other bills, not to mention unplanned expenses. NPR's Pam Fessler has the second in our series about the lack of affordable housing and its impact on low-income tenants and landlords. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: I first met Meagen Limes outside the courtroom of the Landlord Tenant Branch of Washington, D. C. 's Superior Court. That's where tenants go when they've been sued by their landlords for not paying the rent. Limes wore a black apron and purple shirt with the logo of a local grocery store where she works part time. When asked by the judge why she owed more than $3,300, Limes said she was struggling to make ends meet. MEAGEN LIMES: And basically he was like, so the only reason why you're behind on rent is because you can't pay rent? And I was like, yeah, that's the only thing. And he said, well, send out a writ. And I was just like, wow. Like, is there anywhere I can get some help? FESSLER: The writ she's talking about is a writ of restitution. It directs the U. S. Marshals Service to begin eviction proceedings. When Limes mentioned this, it was a week after she was in court where we can't record. Instead, we sat in her three-bedroom apartment in southeast Washington where many of the city's poorest residents live. It felt like someplace people were just passing through - empty walls, plastic bins stuffed with clothes on the floor. Limes fully expected to be homeless any day. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Good morning. Today is Wednesday, March 9, 2016, and all evictions by the U. S. Marshals are going to take place in the southeast and southwest. . . FESSLER: Every morning she had to call the court to see if her apartment was scheduled for eviction that day. It can sometimes take weeks before the marshals actually show up at the door. LIMES: And it's, like, really scary. Like, I'm - I try so hard not to cry. Like, I would be like - oh, my God, if they come today, what am I going to do? FESSLER: Limes lives with her 4-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. LIMES: And I also have my niece. She's 18 and she's been going from house to house. So I told her just come stay with me until, you know, she get on her feet. FESSLER: Her ailing father was living there, too, although he died shortly after this interview. Limes is pretty typical of those who end up in rent court - single mother juggling a lot on her own. She says the father of one of her children is in prison. The other is a deadbeat dad. She lost a full-time job last October, and her new one is only 20 hours a week. At $10. 50 an hour, that's not nearly enough to cover her $1,275 a month rent. JUDITH BARTNOFF: They're living on a very tight margin. FESSLER: Judge Judith Bartnoff presides over the D. C. court that includes the Landlord Tenant Branch. She thinks many of the thousands of tenants who come before the court each year can afford their rent at some point but just barely. BARTNOFF: And if something happens, if somebody gets sick, if somebody gets hurt, if somebody loses their job, then it throws the whole system off. (CROSSTALK)FESSLER: Which is why the hallway outside the landlord Tenant court room is routinely packed with renters trying to work out a deal with their landlord's attorneys. Some offer payment plans so a tenant can catch up. But many renters just agree to move out, or like Meagen Limes, resign themselves to eviction, which doesn't solve a thing. MATTHEW DESMOND: It really drives people deeper into a state of hardship. FESSLER: Harvard sociologist Matthew Desmond spent more than a year following low-income renters and landlords in Milwaukee, which he details in his new book called \"Evicted. \" Desmond says evictions are not just a result of poverty but a cause, that it makes lives more unstable. People not only lose their homes. . . DESMOND: But you often lose your neighborhood and your school. You know, children often have to switch schools and miss long stretches. FESSLER: And families often end up in areas with more crime and poorer-quality housing. Meagen Limes is worried about that. She wants to move, but even studio apartments are $800 a month, which she can't afford. LIMES: It's like I'm stuck here. I don't know where else to go. I don't want to go to the shelter. I'm trying to get help, but I can't find help anywhere. FESSLER: She did get some temporary assistance from the city a few years ago. But permanent housing aid is almost impossible to find. Limes applied eight years ago for vouchers to help cover her rent. LIMES: And nothing. I'm still - what - 1,000-something. FESSLER: That's 1,000th on the waiting list. The city recently had to shut down the list because it had more than 70,000 names on it. Across the U. S. , only 1 in 4 people who qualify for public housing or vouchers actually gets them. Five weeks after my first visit with Limes, furniture was piled on the curb outside her apartment complex - mattresses, CDs, a flat-screen TV. Two other families had been evicted that day. But Limes was still waiting, worried that she and her kids would end up back in the city's homeless shelter where they lived in 2012. LIMES: It was hard, and it's, like, it was disgusting. And I don't want to put my kids in that situation again. FESSLER: But then a week later, she got a temporary reprieve. Limes received her earned income tax credit check from the IRS and was able to pay off what she owed. Now she's got to worry about next month's rent. Pam Fessler, NPR News. MCEVERS: Tomorrow on Morning Edition, we'll hear from a woman who says she's not paying her rent because of poor housing conditions. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:   There's a simple reason why hundreds of thousands of Americans face eviction. They can't afford their rent. One in 4 low-income families pays more than 70 percent of their income on rent, leaving little money for other bills, not to mention unplanned expenses. NPR's Pam Fessler has the second in our series about the lack of affordable housing and its impact on low-income tenants and landlords. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: I first met Meagen Limes outside the courtroom of the Landlord Tenant Branch of Washington, D. C. 's Superior Court. That's where tenants go when they've been sued by their landlords for not paying the rent. Limes wore a black apron and purple shirt with the logo of a local grocery store where she works part time. When asked by the judge why she owed more than $3,300, Limes said she was struggling to make ends meet. MEAGEN LIMES: And basically he was like, so the only reason why you're behind on rent is because you can't pay rent? And I was like, yeah, that's the only thing. And he said, well, send out a writ. And I was just like, wow. Like, is there anywhere I can get some help? FESSLER: The writ she's talking about is a writ of restitution. It directs the U. S. Marshals Service to begin eviction proceedings. When Limes mentioned this, it was a week after she was in court where we can't record. Instead, we sat in her three-bedroom apartment in southeast Washington where many of the city's poorest residents live. It felt like someplace people were just passing through - empty walls, plastic bins stuffed with clothes on the floor. Limes fully expected to be homeless any day. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Good morning. Today is Wednesday, March 9, 2016, and all evictions by the U. S. Marshals are going to take place in the southeast and southwest. . . FESSLER: Every morning she had to call the court to see if her apartment was scheduled for eviction that day. It can sometimes take weeks before the marshals actually show up at the door. LIMES: And it's, like, really scary. Like, I'm - I try so hard not to cry. Like, I would be like - oh, my God, if they come today, what am I going to do? FESSLER: Limes lives with her 4-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. LIMES: And I also have my niece. She's 18 and she's been going from house to house. So I told her just come stay with me until, you know, she get on her feet. FESSLER: Her ailing father was living there, too, although he died shortly after this interview. Limes is pretty typical of those who end up in rent court - single mother juggling a lot on her own. She says the father of one of her children is in prison. The other is a deadbeat dad. She lost a full-time job last October, and her new one is only 20 hours a week. At $10. 50 an hour, that's not nearly enough to cover her $1,275 a month rent. JUDITH BARTNOFF: They're living on a very tight margin. FESSLER: Judge Judith Bartnoff presides over the D. C. court that includes the Landlord Tenant Branch. She thinks many of the thousands of tenants who come before the court each year can afford their rent at some point but just barely. BARTNOFF: And if something happens, if somebody gets sick, if somebody gets hurt, if somebody loses their job, then it throws the whole system off. (CROSSTALK) FESSLER: Which is why the hallway outside the landlord Tenant court room is routinely packed with renters trying to work out a deal with their landlord's attorneys. Some offer payment plans so a tenant can catch up. But many renters just agree to move out, or like Meagen Limes, resign themselves to eviction, which doesn't solve a thing. MATTHEW DESMOND: It really drives people deeper into a state of hardship. FESSLER: Harvard sociologist Matthew Desmond spent more than a year following low-income renters and landlords in Milwaukee, which he details in his new book called \"Evicted. \" Desmond says evictions are not just a result of poverty but a cause, that it makes lives more unstable. People not only lose their homes. . . DESMOND: But you often lose your neighborhood and your school. You know, children often have to switch schools and miss long stretches. FESSLER: And families often end up in areas with more crime and poorer-quality housing. Meagen Limes is worried about that. She wants to move, but even studio apartments are $800 a month, which she can't afford. LIMES: It's like I'm stuck here. I don't know where else to go. I don't want to go to the shelter. I'm trying to get help, but I can't find help anywhere. FESSLER: She did get some temporary assistance from the city a few years ago. But permanent housing aid is almost impossible to find. Limes applied eight years ago for vouchers to help cover her rent. LIMES: And nothing. I'm still - what - 1,000-something. FESSLER: That's 1,000th on the waiting list. The city recently had to shut down the list because it had more than 70,000 names on it. Across the U. S. , only 1 in 4 people who qualify for public housing or vouchers actually gets them. Five weeks after my first visit with Limes, furniture was piled on the curb outside her apartment complex - mattresses, CDs, a flat-screen TV. Two other families had been evicted that day. But Limes was still waiting, worried that she and her kids would end up back in the city's homeless shelter where they lived in 2012. LIMES: It was hard, and it's, like, it was disgusting. And I don't want to put my kids in that situation again. FESSLER: But then a week later, she got a temporary reprieve. Limes received her earned income tax credit check from the IRS and was able to pay off what she owed. Now she's got to worry about next month's rent. Pam Fessler, NPR News.

And if you haven't already filed, you've got until April 18. With tax season comes scams, phones scams, website scams. People try to steal your identity or claim a refund in your name. And it's a fast-growing problem. Nobody knows that more than IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. Welcome to the program. JOHN KOSKINEN: Thanks very much. I'm delighted to be here. CORNISH: Now, we hear about these taxpayer identity scams year after year. Last year alone, the IRS topped 1. 4 million in returns because of identity theft. Why does the problem seem to be getting worse and not better? KOSKINEN: Well, it's actually not getting worse; it's getting more visibility. But it is getting more visibility and more complicated because we're now dealing with increasingly organized crime syndicates around the world, rather than individual entrepreneurs off the street. CORNISH: You said that the problem is becoming more visible, not necessarily getting worse. Can you describe the latest trend in these scams? I mean, what should people be looking out for? KOSKINEN: Well, I think the latest trend in these scams is, as we get better at the basic protections, then the criminals are looking for other ways into the system. With their sophisticated ability to masquerade as taxpayers, they're beginning to try to figure out, can they, in effect, get access to the taxpayers previous tax return - because then they could file a false return that looks more logical and isn't as likely to be caught by our filters. At the same time, this is not an IRS problem alone, obviously. There are criminals hacking into systems all across the world, really. The goal they have is to get detailed individual information that allows them to commit fraud. CORNISH: And you've been saying that cyber-criminals are becoming more sophisticated and find new methods of stealing personal information, so how is the IRS keeping up with that? KOSKINEN: The biggest thing we've done in the last year is create a partnership with the private sector, tax preparers, software developers, payroll providers and state tax commissioners. We've all agreed that none of us by ourselves can stop this program and this problem. All of need to work together in a unified way for the first time, really, in history to protect taxpayers and protect their identities to the extent we can answer and certainly to protect their data. CORNISH: You talk about partnership with the tech industry. What's it like actually trying to recruit young tech people to work for the IRS to do this kind of thing? KOSKINEN: Well, when we advertise, we get a significant number of applicants. Our biggest problem is we're not hiring anybody at all virtually because the only way we can deal with the budget cuts we've over the last six years has been to not replace people when they leave, let alone hire new people. And that's because over 70 percent of our budget are people. CORNISH: Last year, the IRS itself was a victim of a hack. One of its data systems was breached, and more than 700,000 taxpayer accounts may have been compromised. How has this contributed to problems this year going forward? KOSKINEN: Basic taxpayer information was not breached or obtained. That was an application that allowed taxpayers to authenticate themselves and get copies of prior year tax returns. They had already stolen enough data, Social Security numbers, name and other identifiers that they could masquerade as the taxpayers. And what they were after was, if they could get last year's tax return, we'd be less likely to stop this year's fraudulent return. The net result of that is we have, of course, notified all the taxpayers and marked all of those accounts so that we think the amount of actual refunds paid out is relatively modest. But it was a serious representation of the sophistication of the enemy that we're dealing with, so we have - took that application down a year ago, and we are working at improving significantly the authorization required to get into any of those applications. CORNISH: John Koskinen - he's the IRS commissioner. Thank you so much for speaking with us. KOSKINEN: It's my pleasure. Thank you.

Others have complaints about their apartments - rodents, no heat, broken sinks. But when tenants don't pay, landlords have less money to fix things up. It's a vicious cycle that can often land the parties in court. NPR's Pam Fessler has the third in our series on the shortage of affordable housing and its impact on tenants and landlords. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Terrell Walker lives in a one-bedroom apartment in southeast Washington, D. C. with her two daughters, ages 9 and 2. When Walker's at her job as a coach for disabled workers, her mother, Patsy Yates, watches the girls. It's on one of those days that Yates shows the conditions that led her daughter to stop paying the rent and to fight her landlord's eviction threat in court. PATSY YATES: If you sit right here by this window, like, you're sitting watching TV the wind is coming in the window so bad that you can feel it. The bathroom is extra cold. That bedroom back there is extra cold. So I usually try to boil some water or something to try to keep it warm in here. FESSLER: But she says that's dangerous with a little child running around. YATES: You don't ever know when she's going to hit that stove. FESSLER: And the apartment is crowded for three people. There's a bed with a bright pink comforter in the living room. This building is more than 50 years old. The baseboard heaters are falling away from the wall, although they're warm to the touch. Then Yates has me feel around the window frames. YATES: See, you feel the wind. It doesn't stay warm in here. FESSLER: I can feel it. This is - this is really, really cold. YATES: Yeah, yeah. FESSLER: In fact there's an actual breeze, at least where there's no newspaper stuffed into the cracks. Yates also says the appliances are old and don't work that well. And in the bathroom. . . YATES: He never glazed the tub right. So the inspector asked him to re-glaze it. He ain't done that. FESSLER: The tub's finish is all worn off and corroded around the drain. Yates says her daughter and grandchildren also had a bedbug infestation last year, which makes paying $727 a month in rent seem like an insult. TERRELL WALKER: Hello, my name is Terrell Walker. I'm basically just here today to try to get justice. FESSLER: That's Walker a week later outside the landlord-tenant branch of D. C. 's Superior Court. It's the second time she's been here since her landlord sued her for not paying the rent. Walker has asked for a trial so she can make her case that she shouldn't have to pay until the place is fixed up. Like other tenants, Walker carries what she hopes will be evidence - a manila envelope filled with papers, including lead inspection reports, photos and her handwritten list of everything she's found wrong with the apartment. WALKER: I've complained about it. And I've gotten nothing done. FESSLER: Still the legal process is time-consuming and frustrating. There was supposed to be a hearing today to decide how much money she should pay into escrow during the trial. The landlord's witness didn't show. So after three hours the parties agreed to postpone the hearing. But Walker had already taken off work to be here. Now she's out a whole day's pay. WALKER: Something that I really can't afford for them to basically tell me that I have to come back again - you know, to take off. So it's like nothing really got solved today. FESSLER: And that's how it often goes in the court. Few tenants have attorneys, which can put them at a disadvantage because almost every landlord has a lawyer. Aaron Sokolow represents Walker's landlord. He wouldn't talk about her specific case. But he did say low-income renters aren't as powerless as it might seem, especially in Washington, D. C. where tenant protections are strong. AARON SOKOLOW: In my experience there's very little risk that a tenant will flat-out lose a case because they don't understand what's going on. FESSLER: Sokolow says, instead, some tenants have become adept at claiming housing code violations to avoid paying rent. They could take their complaints to a separate housing conditions court. But he says they go to the landlord-tenant branch where they can drag the process out for months - time when the landlord isn't getting paid. SOKOLOW: And that's a great frustration for a lot of my clients. They say, I'm not excused of my tax payment. I'm not excused of my mortgage payment. So the notion that I have to come out of pocket for 18 months of litigation, it can get very daunting very quickly. ART NALLS: We have a gas range, gas stove, no disposal in this one. Some do. Some don't. FESSLER: Art Nalls is a landlord who owns two apartment buildings in the city. He's showing me one of the units. Nalls thinks it's important that low-income residents have a decent place to live. NALLS: We try to take care of people and we try to offer a good, decent affordable housing at a reasonable rate. FESSLER: But he says if people don't pay their rent that's difficult to do. NALLS: It means that I can't cover all that other stuff. So I have to call my refrigerator guy and says I'm going to have to pay you next month when I get rent. It's that tight. It's that tight. This is not - we're not making a bazillion dollars here. FESSLER: Nalls thinks one answer is more government subsidies for low-income housing. Otherwise, he says landlords eventually get tired of the hassle and sell out, a problem when affordable housing is so hard to find. The Joint Center For Housing Studies at Harvard says the number of low-cost rental units grew only 10 percent over the past decade while the number of low-income renters grew 40 percent. And that squeezed more people into apartments they can't afford or that are not in the best shape. PAMULA GLOVER: When I turned this on last Saturday, when I flipped this right here, electricity shot out. FESSLER: Pamula Glover is showing me the thermostat in her apartment in southeast D. C. Glover was recently in landlord-tenant court with some neighbors who were being sued for not paying their rent. Glover says she has water leaks, mold and a constantly beeping fire alarm. She admits 815 a month for a two-bedroom apartment is a bargain. But still. GLOVER: I could be paying a dollar. I still want to live comfortable - you know? I still want to be safe. We don't even have security around here no more. They shoot around here like it's a job. FESSLER: She says the gunfire's so bad at night she sleeps at an angle in her first-floor bedroom to stay out of the line of fire. The company that runs her apartment, Oakmont Management, wouldn't comment. It's being sued by the city for unlivable conditions at another apartment. Glover says her place has been allowed to go downhill too. She grew up nearby and recalls looking at these apartments and thinking they were so nice. If she lived here, she'd be rich. Now she doesn't know where else to go. Neither doesn't Terrell Walker who doesn't make much more than minimum wage. WALKER: I honestly think for me to get into a decent home with my income, it would be very hard. It would be very hard because I wouldn't be able to afford it. Not with the prices that they have these days. I wouldn't be able to afford that. I just - I wouldn't. FESSLER: Walker says anything over $800 a month is out of her league. Anything under 800 is pretty much what she already has. Pam Fessler, NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Some low-income tenants don't pay their rent because they don't have enough money.

Williamson knows veterans' unemployment is at a historic low, and plenty of companies advertise that they hire vets. But too many of those are dead-end jobs, he says, that don't leave time to look for a better one. WILLIAMSON: At one point in time, people in business and government had military experience. LAWRENCE: But now it's only a tiny percentage who served, so a tiny number who know that a corpsman has a lot of medical knowledge or a quartermaster knows about logistics.

That happened in 2014. Joining us now is Jacob Vigdor, a University of Washington professor who's running a city-funded study on the minimum wage law. Welcome to the show. JACOB VIGDOR: Thanks for having me, Ari. It's a pleasure to be here. SHAPIRO: And so Seattle is phasing in the minimum wage law over time. It's going to hit $15 an hour in a few years. So far, what have you seen with the wage hike? VIGDOR: So far, as of January 1 of this year, the large employers in Seattle are now paying $13 an hour, and the smaller businesses get to pay a little bit less. So far, the impacts seem to be not too great here. We've seen some impacts on prices, but in terms of employment or other sorts of things, not too much. SHAPIRO: So things are not costing a lot more. Employment is not dramatically dropping. It doesn't look like people are getting laid off because of the wage hike. What about people who were making the minimum wage who are now making more money? Has it had much impact on them? VIGDOR: Yeah. Our study has involved doing interviews in depth with a number of low-wage workers who are trying to raise families and make ends meet, and they are telling us that the higher wages are making a difference. They are helping people buy food and just the basic necessities of life, but I'd say that they are skeptical. They're worried that prices are going to go up and the income that they receive is going to be offset by higher prices. A lot of them are receiving benefits in the form of housing vouchers or SNAP benefits. And the value of these benefits declines as your income goes up, so some of them are telling us that they're not really sure that these higher wages are going to lead to a better quality of life for them just because of these potentially offsetting impacts. SHAPIRO: Now, as we mentioned, this law is being phased in incrementally. Do you think's making a difference rather than all at once bump everybody's wages up to $15 an hour? VIGDOR: Yeah. One of the things that Seattle did, they phased it in overtime, and they implemented different phase-in schedules depending on the size of the business. And both the business owners and the workers that we've talked to are sort of appreciating the fact that, for a small business, going straight to 15 would have been much more difficult. So this extra time allowing people to figure out, what is my new business model now that I'm going to face higher labor costs - I think that has really helped blunt what might have been a pretty big impact had it all happened at once. SHAPIRO: Do you think there is enough information to state clearly what the impact of a national $15 or $12 minimum wage would be? VIGDOR: No, I don't think that I can say that with any degree of certainty. What I can tell you is that to think one minimum wage is going to have the same impact everywhere at all points in time, that's not really consistent with what we're observing so far. Higher minimum wages are thought of as a way to maybe allow some of the spoils and the profits of society to be distributed towards the lower-income workers. And spreading those profits and that wealth around, it's a lot easier in a town like Seattle, where there is some wealth to spread. And it might not work so well in a place that is uniformly higher poverty, doesn't have as many of these tech sector jobs or other types of high-income employment to make it all work. So that is one thing that I can tell you. We are going to be paying close attention. One thing that we have heard from employers is that the minimum wage is working just fine for them now, but that's not necessarily going to hold the next time a recession comes along.

We're talking about people who are part of the so-called gig or sharing economy, like, say, Uber drivers. And we're also talking about a much larger group of people who temp or freelance in sales jobs, in schools, in health care settings, to name a few. Princeton economist Alan Krueger has been studying this and joins us now. Welcome to the program. ALAN KRUEGER: My pleasure. Thank you. CORNISH: You found in your research that all of the net employment growth in the U. S. economy from 2005 the 2013 essentially occurred in these alternative work arrangements. Tell us about the trend. KRUEGER: Well, over the decade from 2005 to 2015, about 9. 1 million jobs were created overall. And we find that this alternative category increased by 9. 4 million, 9. 5 million in that period. So basically all of the net employment creation over this long decade has occurred in the alternative employment sector. CORNISH: I mentioned Uber in our introduction. Do you know just how much of this work actually comes from those kind of online, short-term job apps? KRUEGER: Small. Only about half a percent of U. S. employment is in what I would call the online gig economy -- companies like Uber or TaskRabbit, where workers choose their own hours and they provide services through these intermediaries. We find that there's been growth, but from an extremely low level. These jobs didn't exist a decade ago. Far more important development for the U. S. labor market is the growth in contract jobs - employees who are working for one company and contracted out to provide services at another one, such as janitors or cafeteria workers, or we found, increasingly, higher paid workers are now being contracted out, such as payroll jobs. CORNISH: You know, when I think of traditional full-time work, it provides people with health care, sick leave, you know, additional benefits. What are the consequences of the growth in these nontraditional short-term jobs? KRUEGER: I think that there is reason for concern that we've seen so much growth in this segment of the economy, but it's not all necessarily bad. So it has grown, I believe, for a mixture of reasons. One reason is companies have been trying to reduce costs so they took traditional employees, like janitors, who they were paying reasonably well, and they contracted that work out to companies that pay the janitors less well. And I think that's a development that is concerning. But other factors also have been playing a role. For example, work has become more standardized, easier to monitor. That means that there can be some efficiency advantages from contracting out. And then thirdly, there are workers who prefer the flexibility. Uber drivers, for example, overwhelmingly say that the flexibility of being able to work a few hours here, a few hours there when they have available time is appealing to them, and I think that's true for many freelancers. CORNISH: But can we dig into this a little more? Because we are also experiencing an election where jobs and the quality of the jobs people have, it's really affecting the electorate, and people are really talking about this in the campaign. And, I mean, how are these workers handling the downsides of this structure? KRUEGER: I think this is a very important issue for the American public. The fact that more work is being done in alternative work arrangements means that workers are responsible for more of their safety net. It also means they're subject to more volatility, more shocks. And I think it's important that they and we as a society help to prepare for that. On the other hand, when it comes to the election, I think you need to draw a distinction between a longer-term trend and the improvement in the economy that we've seen over the last four or five years. And today's jobs report, I think, is another indication that the economy is strengthening. CORNISH: Alan Krueger is professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.

S. economy gained 215,000 jobs last month. That's a solid performance by just about all accounts. But the unemployment rate did not go down. It went up a bit to 5 percent. And as NPR's Chris Arnold reports that's not necessarily a bad sign. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: For years, as the economy's recovered, we've been waiting for this thing to happen. We've been waiting for discouraged workers who've given up looking for a job to say, hey, actually things are looking good enough. I'm feeling pretty optimistic. I'm going to go look for a job now, too. And now that's happening. DEAN BAKER: Yeah, you know, I'm really excited by this report because this has been a trend now - four or five months - when there's been a lot of people re-entering the labor force, particularly prime age workers. ARNOLD: Dean Baker co-directs the Center for Economic and Policy Research. He says this is why the unemployment rate went up in March from 4. 9 percent to 5 percent. Because even though we gained more than 200,000 jobs, that was overwhelmed by the number of people coming back into the labor force to look for work. BAKER: And this has been a big debate among economists ever since, you know, the trial for the downturn. We saw all these people leave the labor force, and the question was - were they gone permanently? And at this point, it looks like we have pretty good evidence that they're coming back when they see the opportunities. ARNOLD: And Baker says that's a very big deal. BAKER: Well, yeah. I mean, this is huge in terms of thinking of what the economy's potential is. ARNOLD: Here's the big issue. According to Baker, if workers are now coming off of the sidelines, it's safe for the Federal Reserve to keep stimulating the economy with low interest rates because if there's a larger pool of workers looking for jobs, then it's easier to keep inflation under control. BAKER: I think we still have millions of people who, you know, would like full-time employment or working part time or who are out of the labor force altogether and almost certainly would like to get back in and have jobs, which means there's no reason for the Fed to be slamming on the brakes. ARNOLD: Baker's think tank leans to the left. Others might disagree about the Fed policy. But it's hard to argue about one thing, the U. S. economy is continuing to add a solid number of jobs month after month. Nariman Behravesh, who's chief economist with the global forecasting firm IHS. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: For two years now, we've had very strong employment growth. And this is the strongest two-year employment growth since the late 1990s, since '98 and '99. And that says something to have growth in employment to be as strong as it was during the last boom that we all really enjoyed and really liked. This is a good thing. So I interpret these numbers as being, you know, a very good sign that the U. S. economy is on very solid ground. ARNOLD: What's more, Behravesh says, the jobs being created aren't all low-wage jobs. We're seeing higher-quality jobs, too. Still, for the average person, wage growth remains stubbornly anemic. But if this solid job creation goes on long enough, Behravesh says we're bound to see better wage gains, too. Chris Arnold, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   The U.

HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: New York and California are breaking ground on a $15 minimum wage at the state level. And California Gov. Jerry Brown says he hopes they won't be the last.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: You can't lead a decent life. You can't raise a family on $18,000 a year in the state of New York. WANG: This is New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: So we want to raise the minimum wage, which, in and of itself, would affect 2. 3 million workers. WANG: New York lawmakers passed their deal today, and Brown is expected to sign California's increase into law on Monday. Still, the question now is once these states hit 15, what's next? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: You ask five different economists, you'll get five different answers. Why? Because they're all forecasting what they believe is going to happen in the future. WANG: And their crystal balls are rather foggy. Cities like Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have already started down the path to $15, but hitting 15 at the state level hasn't happened before. Still, economists like David Neumark at the University of California, Irvine, do have their guesses based on past research. DAVID NEUMARK: You get some job loss, and you don't do much for poverty on net. You get - some people do better; some people do worse, but there's not a big reduction in poverty. WANG: William Spriggs of Howard University is more optimistic. He's an economist with the AFL-CIO, an umbrella group of unions. WILLIAM SPRIGGS: When wages go up, the workers don't quit as often, so there's less turnover. And at lower levels of turnover, it may mean that workers have to search longer to get a job. WANG: But he argues that they'll eventually get jobs at higher wages that will help close the growing inequality gap. Putting aside this theoretical debate, though, Spriggs says $15 an hour is becoming the new norm for wages that more workers will come to expect, and that worries many small-business owners. Matt Watkins manages a citrus farm in Fowler, Calif. , just south of Fresno. He told KQED that farmers may have to pass the costs of higher wages onto customers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)MATT WATKINS: Really, all we're doing is just causing the cost of food to go up, which makes less money in your take-home check at the end of the month, just because you've got pay more for food. So, to me, it's just a revolving circle. PAT MCCORMICK: There's going to be farms that are going to go out of business around us. And I don't know if I can afford to pay that much, especially with what we're getting for our product now. WANG: Pat McCormick in upstate New York has similar concerns. He's a seventh-generation dairy farmer from Java Center. And he's preparing for a gradual wage increase to $12. 50 an hour, before state officials reevaluate whether 15 is possible. Unlike California's statewide increase to 15 by 2022, New York lawmakers agreed to a lower starting rate for communities upstate.

He literally wrote the book on this subject. He is the author of \"The Hidden Wealth Of Nations: The Scourge Of Tax Havens. \" Welcome to the show. GABRIEL ZUCMAN: Thank you. SHAPIRO: You've see what is in these documents. Having studied the subject for years, were you surprised at the specifics? ZUCMAN: No, I'm not surprised because this is what you see, you know, in the data, as I try to explain in my book. So we know that there are hundreds of thousands of shell corporations that are incorporated, you know, in the British Virgin Islands, in Panama and that are used for all sorts of criminal activity, including tax evasion but not only, so it was not a big surprise. SHAPIRO: Given that so much of this is illegal, how have so many countries allowed this to proliferate? ZUCMAN: That's a very good question, and I think, you know, we need to put an end to that. You know, why do we even allow such a huge financial industry to exist in the British Virgin Islands since leaks after leaks, we discover that it is largely used for criminal purposes? SHAPIRO: You mention the British Virgin Islands. This leak comes from one law firm in Panama. Does that mean that this is just the tip of the iceberg and there's that much more that we cannot see? ZUCMAN: Of course. You know, it's just one firm in one tax haven, and there is much more going on. And if you want to have a comprehensive view of the scale of problem, you need to look at macroeconomic statistics. And when you do that, you see that there's about 8 percent of the world's financial wealth that is held in tax havens globally. So that's about $7. 6 trillion today, a huge amount of wealth. SHAPIRO: Can you distinguish between how much of this is illegal behavior as opposed to just unethical behavior? ZUCMAN: Yes. So the data that we have suggests that out of the $7. 6 trillion total, about 20 percent of this wealth is duly reported on tax returns so does not correspond to illegal behavior. But 80 percent is not reported, and that's criminal tax evasion. SHAPIRO: Talk about the real-world impact of this kind of behavior. If a corrupt oligarch gets rich in ways that he's not supposed to, who is actually harmed by that? ZUCMAN: The people, you know, of the country are harmed by that. You know, if billionaires pay very little in taxes, it means that the rest of us - we have to pay more. So it means more taxes for the middle class, and so we all pay the cost of tax evasion by the wealthiest individuals. SHAPIRO: Given the sheer magnitude of this, when you look at the Justice Department trying to penalize these behaviors, does the - I suppose if you look at it as cops and robbers, do the cops seem up to the task of stopping the robbers? ZUCMAN: At this stage, no. You know, we've had extensive anti-money laundering regulations in place since the late-1980s, and we keep discovering year after year that the basic rules are constantly violated by a number of offshore financial institutions, and so we can rely on these rules and on some audits from time to time to curb this criminal activity. We need to take a different approach which involves saying, look; you know, it's clear that most of the financial activity that occurs in those centers is conducive to criminal behavior, so we should have immediate sanctions that will remain in place as long as Panama, the British Virgin Islands or similar territories are able to show that they've correctly identified all the potential owners of the shell companies on their territory.

KAMERICK: Native Americans dance on a mesa. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: . . . A vacation isn't so much a break from the day to day as it is a reminder of what those days should be. KAMERICK: Children make strands of chili peppers and frolic at White Sands National Monument. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: New Mexico - true. KAMERICK: But recently, new ads started running, and one also shows children and chili, but they have a very different message. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: This is New Mexico, where we celebrate our unique cuisine and turn a blind eye to our hungry children. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) New Mexico truth. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: New Mexico - truth. KAMERICK: This parody ad was created by Allen Sanchez. ALLEN SANCHEZ: In New Mexico, we have an epidemic. KAMERICK: Sanchez runs a Catholic children's organization with the biggest home-visiting program in the state. SANCHEZ: So if you imagine a potter, and while the pot is being formed, while that clay is wet, that's like the child's brain as it's spinning and they're forming that clay. But in New Mexico, before that Clay can harden, we like to poke holes in it. So imagine this beautiful pot, holes being poked in it. Those are adverse child experiences. KAMERICK: These experiences include poverty. Many experts see early childhood education, like home visiting and prekindergarten, as the remedy. That's why Sanchez is pushing to increase early childhood programs. SANCHEZ: How can we live knowing that this is the state that has the highest rate of children in poverty, the third highest in hunger, the worst graduation rate? All of this is connected, and if we do nothing, then we're failing it, and we're failing ourselves. KAMERICK: The parody campaign hits Monique Jacobson on two fronts. MONIQUE JACOBSON: I found it to be heartbreaking. KAMERICK: She was the tourism secretary when the New Mexico True campaign was created. And now, Jacobson runs the state's child welfare agency. JACOBSON: I do think it's critical that we draw attention to what's going on with our children and our families here in New Mexico, but I think there's a way to do it that's actionable and that's positive. And unfortunately, I think they did it a way that was destructive and divisive. KAMERICK: Jacobson was tasked with turning around an agency facing high staff turnover and a string of high-profile child abuse cases. It's a job made even tougher, she says, by an anemic state budget gutted by plummeting oil and gas revenues. JACOBSON: It's critical that we find ways to diversify our economy here in New Mexico. And that's something that the tourism industry, particularly the New Mexico True campaign, has had incredible success doing. KAMERICK: No one's happy about the status of New Mexico's children. In fact, state lawmakers have steadily increased funding for early childhood programs. RACHEL GUDGEL: Is it enough? It may not be. KAMERICK: Rachel Gudgel is the director of the state's legislative education study committee. GUDGEL: Are we being thoughtful, and are we really trying to prioritize those programs? Absolutely. KAMERICK: But that funding isn't enough, say critics like Alan Sanchez, who created the parody campaign. He says too much money has gone to tax cuts and to tax credits for industries that haven't helped the state's economy. So he plans to keep up the pressure. SANCHEZ: New Mexico Truth is just getting started. KAMERICK: Sanchez says he'll roll out another series of ads this summer. For NPR News, I'm Megan Kamerick in Albuquerque. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   New Mexico offers stunning ski slopes and high desert vistas. You can see them in the state's tourism campaign, called New Mexico True. But it is also true that New Mexico has the highest child poverty rate in the nation. That has prompted an advocacy group to create a parody campaign called New Mexico Truth.

We're not talking about what's at the box office or what's getting the most hits on TMZ today. We're talking about oil, black gold, Texas tea. LA still has a number of oil fields. In fact, more than a third of the oil that Californians use comes from California. And with extremely low oil prices, there's a big effect on the region's economy. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: OK, we're here. Los Angeles is a world center for transportation, fashion, manufacturing and, above all, entertainment. In the heart of this metropolis, one of the most important industries is hidden in plain sight, just like this oil field I'm standing in, which is just a few hundred yards from NPR's Culver City studios and a few miles from downtown Los Angeles. LARS PERNER: When you think about Los Angeles, you tend to think of big skyscrapers and beaches, and you don't generally tend to think of oil wells. GLINTON: Lars Perner is with the Marshall School of Business at USC. I took him for a drive to explore some of LA's oil fields. PERNER: We're looking at an oil field very close to downtown Los Angeles near Baldwin Hills. And this is fairly valuable real estate with some rather expensive homes close by. And then this oil is clearly very valuable to justify using that space for those oil pumps. GLINTON: Now, as iconic as the Hollywood sign is or the movie studios are, the oil wells, they came first. They date way back to the mid-1880s. PERNER: Back in those days, there weren't really a lot of regulations as to how you could drill, so a lot of people got very entrepreneurial and they were trying to get pumps onto their property before the neighbors could. GLINTON: In fact, local history buffs will tell you LA's oil rush is the thing that put Los Angeles on the map. Part of what made LA's oil so attractive, Perner says, was that the oil was close to the surface - you know, easy to extract. Add the newfangled automobile, incredible weather, a port and that's a recipe for exponential expansion. PERNER: Well, the petroleum industry, of course, made it possible to have Hollywood where you needed to spread out, but it also made it possible to build an infrastructure to help transport in agricultural produce from other areas so you could support the growth of a relatively large city very quickly. DAVID SLATER: Los Angeles was a sleepy pueblo that became LA and Hollywood. And the studios all popped up, and people got wealthy because of oil. GLINTON: David Slater is the chief operating officer for Signal Hill Petroleum. SLATER: And we are standing in the middle of the Long Beach Signal Hill oil field on top of the hill in the city of Signal Hill. GLINTON: It's difficult to overstate just how much oil was being produced right here in LA back in the '20s. SLATER: The production from here made Los Angeles the equivalent of Saudi Arabia today. That's how prolific and how much oil relative to the rest of the world was coming out of Los Angeles basin. GLINTON: Today, the Signal Hill oil field is still one of the largest producers in the U. S. but the steep drop in oil prices has had a big impact on smaller oil companies like signal Hill. Again, David Slater. SLATER: And the painful part, though, is when prices go down, contracting our business and eliminating jobs is never, ever a fun thing to go through. GLINTON: And you have about 150 employees. How is that affecting you? SLATER: We don't have 150 employees anymore. We now have about 85 employees. GLINTON: Slater said he'd love to hire them back but he won't be able to until oil prices go up. You see, here in Southern California, cheap gas can be costly. Sonari Glinton, NPR News, Culver City.

And regulators worldwide are reviewing the reports published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. CORNISH: The reports also shed light on money laundering. Robert Mazur is familiar with that sort of operation. He's a former federal agent who worked undercover posing as money launderer for years. I asked him how offshore accounts aid money laundering. ROBERT MAZUR: Well, they're a very, very important tool in the toolbox of money launderers. You can launder money without it, but I'd be like playing Major League Baseball without a glove. It's an integral piece that blocks transparency. These types of offshore entities have been used for decades, and when I worked as a long-term, undercover agent as a money launderer, I dealt with many banks, many accountants, many attorneys, all of whom used those offshore entities on a regular basis to hide the true beneficial owners of funds that I handled and that other people handled. CORNISH: When you look at what's come out in the papers now, in what ways - how does this change the game for prosecutors, for investigators? MAZUR: This is actually the start of the game. This is the ability now to be able to link individuals to accounts, to assets and to then compare it with what they have purported legally in the world, to be tied to in the way of income and assets. These are going to offer the beginning of following a lead, and you're going to need to use mutual legal assistance, treaties. You're going to need to get cooperation between governments because most of the time, launderers don't just use one haven like Panama. CORNISH: Right. And I'm sure a lot of people have questions about whether the U. S. has jurisdiction - right? - given that this laundering took place in foreign banks. MAZUR: Yes but because of the fact that the U. S. dollar is the global currency, most of these bad guys wind up getting paid or seeking accounts in U. S. dollars. They do that because of the fact that other currencies are more prone to inflation and instability. So once they wind up putting their funds into U. S. dollar accounts, unfortunately for them, when the money moves, it moves through U. S. jurisdiction, through the Fed. And that gives the U. S. authorities an opportunity to very often get jurisdiction in the matter. CORNISH: This is a business about middlemen, ideally discrete middlemen, right? I mean, what are the hurdles in terms of pressing charges? MAZUR: Well, the hurdles here are that the people who create these offshore entities set up what I considered plausible deniability - enough documentation, enough appearance of legitimacy that there is an excuse for what was done. That's the real difficulty here - to get to the heart of, where did the money come from; what crime was committed, and who knew it at the time that the transactions were being conducted? But really, there's no better proof than their own words, and that's why I keep going back to the tremendous importance there is for governments to invest in doing the type of long-term undercover operations that I got the opportunity to do.

Most tax returns have grown more complicated for many American families. Much of the tax code was designed with old-style traditional families in mind, which makes tax time more complex for the increasing numbers of people whose families do not fit that mold. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Today about 40 percent of children are born to mothers who aren't married. But they aren't all single parents. A growing percentage of babies born out of wedlock have parents who live together. More families, in other words, don't fit the traditional structure of family - of two married parents and biological children. That is certainly the case for Trevor Franklin. Hi, I'm Yuki. TREVOR FRANKLIN: Trevor. NOGUCHI: Hi, nice to meet you, Trevor. FRANKLIN: You, too. NOGUCHI: Hi, guys. Franklin lives in a small apartment in Washington, D. C. with his fiancee and four children aged 1 to 14 - not all of whom are his biological kids. FRANKLIN: T. J. is mine. He's biological. Malik and Morgan are my step-kids. NOGUCHI: His fiancee is on bed rest with a fifth child. Franklin, who works in a warehouse, says in the past he and his fiancee were able to file their taxes without issue. This year the IRS rejected both their returns. He says it could be because he and his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e aren't married, don't share a last name or because the kids have different fathers. FRANKLIN: It is hard for a blended family when you're not, you know, married as of yet to try to claim taxes and get the money for supporting your kids over the year. NOGUCHI: After getting an audit letter from the IRS, Franklin sought help at a tax clinic. And he and his fiancee plan to file their returns over again. This time they will divvy up the children. He will file for their child together. And she will claim hers instead of him claiming all of them as he had in the past. How many hours have you spent on this? FRANKLIN: That's about eight hours then probably like another two or three hours, so probably like 10, 12 hours altogether. ELAINE MAAG: Taxes for families can be complicated because their lives are complicated, as well. NOGUCHI: Elaine Maag is a researcher at the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute. She says the stakes are often higher these days for lower-income families like Franklin's. MAAG: It used to be that the majority of assistance for families was delivered through the traditional safety net - through welfare, through food stamps. That's changed. And now a substantial share of assistance is delivered through the tax code. NOGUCHI: Tax benefits for people with children take a number of forms - through a simple exemption, a $1,000 child credit or, for unmarried parents, filing as a head of household. In addition, there is the earned income tax credit, which also increases with the number of dependents. Alan Viard is a resident scholar who studies the tax system at the American Enterprise Institute. He says part of the problem is each tax benefit has different rules. ALAN VIARD: So it's been a real challenge for Congress, for the IRS and for the taxpayers who claim these benefits to sort through the rules for claiming tax benefits for children. NOGUCHI: Some of the tax code's benefits are tied to who financially supports the children. Some are linked to where the children live most of the time. Audit rates are higher for earned income tax benefits because they're more often filed incorrectly, Viard says. VIARD: Those improper payments may not be any type of deliberate wrongdoing but simply reflect tax payers, you know, struggling to deal with a complicated set of rules. NOGUCHI: There isn't an easy solution to the problem, he says. And with demographics continuing to shift away from traditional families, the complexity is only likely to grow.

The economy has recovered. So why does it still feel so shaky? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: The labor market is gaining jobs. That's a fact. But income inequality is growing. And this economic anxiety, decades of lost manufacturing jobs and ever-shrinking middle class, all these issues are driving the political conversation right now and shaping the course of the 2016 presidential race. So every week up until the November election, we're going to talk about the increasing pressures on the middle class. It's a series we're calling Hanging On. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: And today, we're going to get into the big picture with Derek Thompson. He's a senior editor at The Atlantic where he writes about the economy. He joins me now from our studios in New York. Hey, Derek, thanks for being with us. DEREK THOMPSON: Hey, it's a pleasure to be here. MARTIN: As someone who studies the economy, writes about the economy and these issues, how do you define the middle class? THOMPSON: When I think of middle class, I think of the median household between $50,000 and $55,000. MARTIN: OK, so before we dig into the pressure that we know exists on the middle class, let's talk about a little good news because there have been 73 straight months of job growth in the private sector in this country, which is huge. It sounds huge. Can you explain what's behind that? THOMPSON: Sure. It's a really big thing. That is the most consecutive months of private sector job growth in American history, and that's fantastic. But what has to be taken into consideration are two other things. First, you have to think about where we're coming from. We're coming from one of the worst recessions in the last century. Second, you have to look at the kind of jobs that are being created. And there's a significant amount of evidence that a lot of the jobs that have been added in the last six years have been lower wage jobs. MARTIN: So when we think about who has benefited from the recovery, are you saying that people who fall into the category who would work for - in these lower wage jobs, those people have benefited from the upswing? THOMPSON: If the metric is more jobs, basically every single demographic you can think of has benefited in the last six, seven years. Jobs have grown for the poor, they've grown for the middle class, they've grown for the rich as well. The problem, however, the challenge is, all right, what kind of jobs are those? Well, often they're lower paying service sector jobs. Maybe they're retail jobs, cashier jobs, even home health aid-type work, which is notably often independent, so it's not given sort of employer subsidized health care. So this is work and any work is good, but a lot of it has been either low-paid or it's come often without the sort of array of benefits that we're used to expecting with work, whether that's employer subsidized health insurance or retirement packages. MARTIN: So let's talk about the people who have been losing out or who have at least felt like they're losing out because I imagine those answers - those groups of people are different. THOMPSON: Yeah, I think I like the way that you framed that. I think that right now it's important to know that if you live in a city, you are surrounded by considerable growth relative to the rest of the country. New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Austin - these sort of cities are bustling. Young people graduating from elite colleges are moving there. They're doing really well. But there's a part of the country that's not doing quite so well and hasn't done so well in the last decade and perhaps even longer, and that's this Rust Belt in Appalachia. And if you look at some of the demographics of, for example, Donald Trump supporters, they often live in this part of the country. They didn't go to college. They feel like they don't have a political or economic voice, that they've missed out on this recovery. And so I do think that this economic and political story is intertwined. MARTIN: But you say they feel like they've missed out on the recovery, but they actually have, right? They've - many of them anyway come from these places that have seen all these jobs shipped overseas. So when a candidate, be it Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, talks about the perils of globalization, that means something to them in a very real way. THOMPSON: Absolutely. And I think - you know, one way that I think about the appeal of revolutionary or outside-the-box candidates, there's an interesting theory from sociology called the Revolution of Rising Expectations, which is this idea that if you looks at revolutions throughout world history - the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution - the places, the pockets of revolutionary spirit, it wasn't those in abject poverty. It also wasn't those obviously who were aristocrats. It tended to be the middle class that recently felt shocked by some change in their - in reality relative to expectation. They thought things were going to keep getting better and then they didn't. And so this theory of the Revolution of Rising Expectations essentially says that sometimes revolutions come not because things are in the absolute so much worse than they used to be 40 years ago, but because reality isn't catching up with expectations. And certainly something that you see here with the Rust Belt, with Appalachia, is a part of the country that in the middle of the 20th century was absolutely going gangbusters. I mean, Youngstown and Flint, these were two of the richest cities not only in the country, perhaps in the world. And right now they are examples of cities that in the last 30 years have been essentially abandoned, both by their residents and by politics. So I do think that it's important to not only look at the numbers but also look at how the numbers compare to how people might have expected their lives to go, looking from the vantage point in the 1960s, 1970s.

So we wondered what other tricks rich people can use to dodge taxes. David Cay Johnston won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of tax issues. Welcome to the show. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Thank you. SHAPIRO: So the Panama Papers leak goes into great detail about these shell companies, tax havens, how to move around money so that the feds can't find it. What other tricks do rich people use to avoid paying taxes? JOHNSTON: Oh (laughter) the reason our tax code is almost 6,500 pages long is, first of all, there are all sorts of legal devices. There are special rules for real estate professionals, private equity and hedge fund managers that allow them to live tax-free if they choose to. There are all sorts of deferral situations where instead of paying your taxes you get to delay paying your taxes. And when that happens, the government has effectively loaned you that money at zero interest. And if you could hold on for just 30 years, invest the money and netting 4 percent a year, after the 30 years for every dollar you didn't pay in taxes you'd have more than $3. So you could pay the $1 of tax. It's not adjusted for inflation. And you'd pocket more than $2 and you'd be richer. And, by the way, if you bought treasury notes, it would mean that all the rest of us would be taxed to pay the interest that made you rich off the taxes you didn't pay on time. SHAPIRO: You say real estate can help people avoid paying taxes. How does that work? JOHNSTON: Well, if you work 15 hours a week in real estate, Congress has special rule. You can take unlimited deductions for the depreciation of your buildings to offset your other income from a salary or, say, a television show. SHAPIRO: Is that true even if the cost of real estate is increasing? JOHNSTON: Oh, yes. This is not about real economics. This is about tax and accounting rules. SHAPIRO: Do you feel like this is likely to change anytime soon? Is there much pressure to change it? JOHNSTON: It will change when the American public gets fed up enough and says we need to have real reform but not until then. The reality is that there are legions of lobbyists who go to Congress and say, you know, the world would be fair if we could just get this one little rule here. And one little rule at a time we have built an absolutely indefensible monster that's damaging our economy. It is holding back progress, and we need to replace it with a 21st-century tax system. SHAPIRO: You know, with all of these legal loopholes, it's hard to see why rich people would ever need to cheat on their taxes. JOHNSTON: Well, some rich people get a great deal; others do not. It depends on your situation. That's one of the big problems with our tax code. Instead of treating everybody equally, we have special rules for certain enterprises - real estate, hedge funds, utilities, private equity - and other rules for everybody else. So it really is a matter of Congress not leveling the playing field and being rewarded with donations and jobs when you leave office and other things for making an unlevel playing field.

There's a reason it falls on April 12. As the proclamation says, today marks how far into the new year women would have to work in order to earn the same as men did in the previous year. Women, on average, make 79 cents for every dollar men earn. Harvard economics professor Claudia Goldin has looked into the reasons for this, and you say the reason is not primarily discrimination. Is that right? CLAUDIA GOLDIN: Well, I'd rather not use the word discrimination. Much of the difference has to do with what I call the high cost of temporal flexibility. SHAPIRO: High cost of temporal flexibility. . . GOLDIN: Yes. SHAPIRO: Parse that for us. GOLDIN: I certainly will. Disproportionately, women, particularly those who are mothers or who are taking care of others, would like greater predictability in their hours. They would like less on-call hours. They would like fewer periods of long hours. Well, those jobs are often the jobs - the ones that have the longer hours, the less predictability - those are the ones that are often the higher income occupations. So temporal flexibility is giving someone the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable. A physician, let's say, could work 50 hours a week but work the days that they would like to work and not be on call. They'll probably get less than someone who is working the graveyard shift or who was on call, et cetera. And that's true in a lot of fields. And it's also as true at the top as it is at the bottom. SHAPIRO: Does that suggest that if you compare women who are not caretakers, who aren't raising children or looking after elderly parents, to men, you will find closer to equal pay than you would in the general population? GOLDIN: You certainly do find that. And you find that using data for the U. S. , and you find that using data for Scandinavian countries that have incredibly good data that you can really follow people year after year. And you can actually follow them at the event of having a child. SHAPIRO: And then I would also assume that if you compare men who take time off to raise a family to other men, the men who've raised a family are making 79 cents on the dollar. Is that right? GOLDIN: If we had enough of them, we could probably say that. SHAPIRO: But to what extent is discrimination also a factor, that women are just paid less than men? If you look at, you know, the Lilly Ledbetter case that came before the Supreme Court, that seemed like an outright case of men make one amount and women make less. GOLDIN: There's certainly cases of explicit bias. On average, when we measure these differences, we do find a residual gap. And in certain cases, we would feel very comfortable as researchers in saying this is discrimination. But it's very, very hard to do that because it's hard to find the smoking guns. I'm a historian as well as an economist. And in the past, we really could find smoking guns. People would actually say, I pay women less than men. We don't find that anymore. So we have to really search for the smoking guns. I know they're there. I know that there is discrimination. How much is there - probably not that much. SHAPIRO: Do you envision a day when the gap will disappear, or is that even a desirable outcome? GOLDIN: I can certainly envision a day when we reduce the cost of temporal flexibility. When more and more people - and we see this among young people. We can see a growing group that would say that they would like to work their own hours. We have mantras, such as, you know, work-life balance. So in many workplaces, it's not work-family balance, but it's work-life balance. The more people there are like that, the more they are men, the more we're going to move to equality for all. SHAPIRO: Harvard economist Claudia Goldin studies the gender pay gap. Thanks for joining us. GOLDIN: Well, thank you very much, Ari. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   President Obama has declared today Equal Pay Day. There's a reason it falls on April 12. As the proclamation says, today marks how far into the new year women would have to work in order to earn the same as men did in the previous year. Women, on average, make 79 cents for every dollar men earn. Harvard economics professor Claudia Goldin has looked into the reasons for this, and you say the reason is not primarily discrimination. Is that right? CLAUDIA GOLDIN: Well, I'd rather not use the word discrimination. Much of the difference has to do with what I call the high cost of temporal flexibility. SHAPIRO: High cost of temporal flexibility. . . GOLDIN: Yes. SHAPIRO: Parse that for us. GOLDIN: I certainly will. Disproportionately, women, particularly those who are mothers or who are taking care of others, would like greater predictability in their hours. They would like less on-call hours. They would like fewer periods of long hours. Well, those jobs are often the jobs - the ones that have the longer hours, the less predictability - those are the ones that are often the higher income occupations. So temporal flexibility is giving someone the ability not just to work fewer hours but to work their hours and not get a big hit for it or to work hours that are more predictable. A physician, let's say, could work 50 hours a week but work the days that they would like to work and not be on call. They'll probably get less than someone who is working the graveyard shift or who was on call, et cetera. And that's true in a lot of fields. And it's also as true at the top as it is at the bottom. SHAPIRO: Does that suggest that if you compare women who are not caretakers, who aren't raising children or looking after elderly parents, to men, you will find closer to equal pay than you would in the general population? GOLDIN: You certainly do find that. And you find that using data for the U. S. , and you find that using data for Scandinavian countries that have incredibly good data that you can really follow people year after year. And you can actually follow them at the event of having a child. SHAPIRO: And then I would also assume that if you compare men who take time off to raise a family to other men, the men who've raised a family are making 79 cents on the dollar. Is that right? GOLDIN: If we had enough of them, we could probably say that. SHAPIRO: But to what extent is discrimination also a factor, that women are just paid less than men? If you look at, you know, the Lilly Ledbetter case that came before the Supreme Court, that seemed like an outright case of men make one amount and women make less. GOLDIN: There's certainly cases of explicit bias. On average, when we measure these differences, we do find a residual gap. And in certain cases, we would feel very comfortable as researchers in saying this is discrimination. But it's very, very hard to do that because it's hard to find the smoking guns. I'm a historian as well as an economist. And in the past, we really could find smoking guns. People would actually say, I pay women less than men. We don't find that anymore. So we have to really search for the smoking guns. I know they're there. I know that there is discrimination. How much is there - probably not that much. SHAPIRO: Do you envision a day when the gap will disappear, or is that even a desirable outcome? GOLDIN: I can certainly envision a day when we reduce the cost of temporal flexibility. When more and more people - and we see this among young people. We can see a growing group that would say that they would like to work their own hours. We have mantras, such as, you know, work-life balance. So in many workplaces, it's not work-family balance, but it's work-life balance. The more people there are like that, the more they are men, the more we're going to move to equality for all. SHAPIRO: Harvard economist Claudia Goldin studies the gender pay gap.

The U. S. has no set funding stream for this, which means that cities are often doing it alone. Now, a look at two of them, starting with New Orleans and Tegan Wendland of member station WWNO. TEGAN WENDLAND, BYLINE: On a sunny afternoon in New Orleans, Jeff Hebert stands in a swampy, green field. JEFF HEBERT: One of the biggest challenges of the next several decades is going to be water - either too much of it or not enough. WENDLAND: In New Orleans' case, of course, the problem is too much. Hebert is chief resilience officer for the city. His job is to help it prepare for disasters like hurricanes and rising sea levels. HEBERT: You see a lot of driveways that are buckling, the streets that are buckling. WENDLAND: But it won't look like this for long. The city is experimenting with pervious surfaces and water-absorbing parks. Small single-story ranch homes line the street in Gentilly, a residential area along Lake Pontchartrain. It was one of the worst-hit areas after Hurricane Katrina. HEBERT: Over in this corner, you'll see a huge sports field that will be allowed to inundate underwater when it rains. You'll see a - almost a creek that will go through here. WENDLAND: It will include water features in medians to reduce flooding, lagoons and a pond. That city just won a competitive $141 million grant from the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to build this resilience district. That's in addition to $2 billion in relief payments the city just received from FEMA. Robin Keegan helped the city apply for some of those grants. She works with GCR consulting and says, after Hurricane Katrina, the city faced some hard choices. ROBIN KEEGAN: Every system had to be looked at anew because everything was broken, and we had to fix it. WENDLAND: She says the reason it's getting federal and private money to come up with new ways to deal with water is because it's already been hit again and again. But not every city has the cachet or the same level of crisis that New Orleans has. I'm Tegan Wendland in New Orleans. SUSAN PHILLIPS, BYLINE: Here in Philadelphia, those big checks from government and private entities aren't rolling in. I'm Susan Phillips from member station WHYY. On the one hand, the city isn't as vulnerable as New Orleans, but some of its neighborhoods are expected to flood from rising tides along the Delaware River. To pay for upgrades, it has to turn to its residents, who pay a storm water fee each month. For most, it's only a few bucks, but for others. . . GINA RUCCI: So I get this bill for $300 and - I don't know - $30. PHILLIPS: Gina Rucci operates Popi's, an Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia where, several years ago, she bought an adjacent property and turned it into a parking lot. RUCCI: And I wasn't thinking about a water bill because there was no water on the lot. PHILLIPS: But the city charges her for the water runoff from her parking lot. To reduce that bill, she recently found out about a program where the city encourages green infrastructure - things like rain gardens, tree trenches and green roofs. RUCCI: Once your own ground here becomes permeable, that water's going to just sink. PHILLIPS: Today, Rucci has cut her water runoff bill by 60 percent. So far, Philadelphia has built hundreds of green infrastructure projects in streets, parks and parking lots. And green infrastructure is cheaper, especially compared to more traditional engineering approaches, like building a large concrete tunnel to hold the extra water. Chris Crockett is an engineer with Philadelphia's water department in charge of planning for climate change. CHRIS CROCKETT: We could - instead of doing these greener practices, we could just go and dig a hole to China and build a tunnel. But that has a huge carbon footprint. PHILLIPS: And it's not just the carbon footprint that's a problem. That hole-and-tunnel approach would've cost the city's rate payers $10 billion dollars and taken decades complete. The thousands of rain gardens, green roofs and tree trenches will cost the city around $2 billion. For NPR News, I'm Susan Phillips in Philadelphia.

The reason is the rapid transformation of the Texas energy sector. (SOUNDBITE OF EQUIPMENT RUNNING)JOHN WESTER: That's the sound of the gas. Do you hear that? BUCHELE: It's hard not to hear it when you visit the Sand Hill natural gas plant outside of Austin. John Wester works for Austin Energy, the city-owned utility that runs the plan. Now Austin is a city with a strong environmental bent. So to reduce its carbon emissions, it's trying to get away from coal. That means more wind, solar and natural gas. Gas generation produces less CO2 than coal. WESTER: You know, our long-term plans are to go as much toward renewables as possible. But as long as - you know, there's going to be natural gas for a while. BUCHELE: It's done to meet the city's environmental goals. But the move away from coal also follows the direction of the market. This month, even the historic coal company Peabody filed for bankruptcy. One of the causes of coal's woes is cheap natural gas. That's something Texas has in abundance. BRETT KERR: We really see what we are promoting as a very Texas way to do this. BUCHELE: Brett Kerr is a lobbyist and spokesperson for Houston-based Calpine Energy. It's the largest independent power producer in the country. Kerr says it consumes 15 percent of the gas produced in Texas. Last November, Calpine and Austin Energy filed legal briefs supporting the Clean Power Plan. KERR: To be clear, we are not a public policy shop. And while we value environmental stewardship and that's one of our core principles, we also think it makes a lot of business sense. BUCHELE: Because Calpine is so big in natural gas. Kerr says if the Clean Power Plan reinforces the trend away from coal, that's a huge national business opportunity for Calpine and other energy companies like it. KERR: The Clean Power Plan is in the best interest of Calpine. We believe it's also in the best interest of some of these other companies. BUCHELE: So what of all the pistol-packin' rhetoric opposing the plan? David Spence is a professor of energy regulation at the University of Texas at Austin. DAVID SPENCE: It seems as though political ideology is driving a lot of the positions being taken by states and state institutions because, clearly, Texas will sell a lot of natural gas to a lot of power plants all over the country who will be generating more often because of the Clean Power Plan. Yet we are opposing the Clean Power Plant. BUCHELE: If the plan is struck down, he says Texas and some other states will likely hold onto more coal power. But the long-term trends will stay the same, with more electricity coming from wind, solar and natural gas in the future. For NPR News, I'm Mose Buchele in Austin.

As part of the crackdown after the federal bailout, every year, the big banks have to write up a kind of emergency action plan to make sure the meltdown of eight years ago doesn't happen again. This past week, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC looked at these contingency plans for five of the biggest banks and said - sorry, these aren't good enough. The banks have until October to come up with something better. As part of our weekly series Hanging On,  where we look at issues facing the middle class in this election year, we're going to dig a little deeper into why banks are still too big to fail and how the candidates are addressing all this. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins me now. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: As I understand it, Jim, the big banks have to show this emergency plan every year. So what happened this year? What fell short? And why does it matter? ZARROLI: Well, it's actually - these are called living wills. They were required under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill. And they basically say actually that the eight biggest banks have to come up with these plans that spell out what they would do in bankruptcy. And if they can't do that, the regulators have the authority to break them up. And what happened this week was, you know, kind of a midterm. The regulators looked at the plans of all eight banks and said to five of them, you know, your plans aren't good enough. Go back and redo them. It's likely that they will do that and that they'll pass next time. I mean, there's a lot at stake for the banks. MARTIN: A lot at stake for presidential candidates, too, who are making banking and Wall Street reform essential part of their platform, i. e. , Bernie Sanders. I imagine he probably seized on this issue. What was his response? ZARROLI: You know, this is a signature issue for him. He says it all the time - you know, the banks have gotten too big. They represent a threat to the economy. He said it again in Thursday night's debate with Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: We have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system. ZARROLI: And he says the fact that the regulators rejected these living wills this week just proves what he's been saying all along. Now, I have to say recently people have begun to question Sen. Sanders about this idea of breaking up the banks. You may have read about that New York Daily News interview he did. MARTIN: Yeah. ZARROLI: In the interview, at least, I think a lot of people say that Sen. Sanders didn't seem to have real answers. And this is a big issue in New York because, of course, the banks are major employers here. MARTIN: So this is where I ask you that hard question (laughter). As someone who has studied this stuff and reported on economic issues and banking for a long time - what does the law actually say? I mean, can a potential President Sanders really force a bank to be broken up at all - in the first place legally - and then how would it happen? ZARROLI: Well, it's not a simple issue. I mean, there is a process under Dodd-Frank spelling out how the big banks can be broken up. The Dodd-Frank set up something called the Financial Stability Oversight Council. And it can recommend that a bank be split up if it poses a big risk to financial stability. Hillary Clinton actually says, you know, there is a process. It's a good process. We have to let it work. Here, she talked about it in the debate on Thursday night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions. Sometimes the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions. That has to be the judgment of the regulators. ZARROLI: You know, the problem for Clinton is that there's so much anger about the big banks right now. And Bernie Sanders has really capitalized on it. He's portrayed her as being, you know, in the pockets of Wall Street. And she's had to bend over backwards to show she can be tough on the banks, too. You know, she wants to go after executive bonuses. So you've had both Democrats trying to compete with each other to show that they can be tougher on the - on Wall Street. MARTIN: What about the Republicans, Jim? John Kasich, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz - do they talk at all about wanting to break up the banks? ZARROLI: Well, you know, they talk about it less than the Democrats. All of them say they're against Dodd-Frank. All of them want to repeal it. Ted Cruz says it's had enormous regulatory burden on small banks. Both Trump and Cruz have really been critical of bank bailouts. All of them have also been a lot less specific about, sort of, what the role of the government should be in regulating the banks. You know, if the economy's in trouble and a bank poses a systemic risk to the economy, you know, what should regulators do? Do they step in? Or should they take a kind of hands-off approach? That's really the question that has been raised after 2008 and the financial crisis. And it's a question that the candidates haven't really answered. MARTIN: NPR's Jim Zarroli. Jim, thanks so much for breaking it down for us. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

All of them have also been a lot less specific about, sort of, what the role of the government should be in regulating the banks. You know, if the economy's in trouble and a bank poses a systemic risk to the economy, you know, what should regulators do? Do they step in? Or should they take a kind of hands-off approach? That's really the question that has been raised after 2008 and the financial crisis. And it's a question that the candidates haven't really answered. MARTIN: NPR's Jim Zarroli.

I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: And this is For The Record. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: We're going to New York this hour because that's where all the presidential candidates have been ahead of Tuesday's primary. They've been eating pizza in the Bronx, shaking hands on Long Island, and clocking time upstate where a lot of small towns have been gutted by the loss of manufacturing jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Upstate New York has been decimated - OK? - decimated. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, I will fight for more help here in upstate New York. Organizing way back in job here upstate New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED CRUZ: We're going to see manufacturing jobs coming back to upstate New York. We're going to bring jobs back from China and back from Mexico. MARTIN: This morning, we're going to focus in on one of those towns where big plant closures have meant residents either reinvent themselves or move. For the record today, making it work in Massena. ROBERT CUNNINGHAM: Massena's located in the northernmost part of New York state. We live right on the great Saint Lawrence River. We used to have massive manufacturing industry there (unintelligible) - but General Motors, Reynolds, Alcoa. MARTIN: This is Robert Cunningham. What kind of place was it to grow up in? CUNNINGHAM: It was great. My father worked for General Motors - started there in '59. We had a great childhood - good union benefits and security. MAX PELIFIAN: OK. I'm Max Pelifian. I live in Massena, N. Y. Retired from General Motors. Worked there for 31 years. After I went to college, I told my father I had six months to get a job. And they were hiring, so I just kept going out there every day, hounded them to give me a shot and they hired me (laughter) - after a couple months. MARTIN: A couple years out of college, Robert Cunningham found his way to GM, too. CUNNINGHAM: If you didn't work there, you wanted to work there. They were looking for pipefitters, and I put my application in, and I got an interview, and I got hired. And it was like winning the lottery. It was just, like, I can't believe it. For pay and security for your family, by far the best job. PELIFIAN: It was a production job where I made pistons for the 350 cubic inch V8 motor. Well, I worked midnights. So I went in for 11 and got done at 7 - 7 o'clock in the morning. And during the summers, I would actually ride my bicycle to work which was about a 10-mile ride each way. And I'd get to work a half hour, 45 minutes early just to socialize in the cafeteria with coffee - over coffee with, you know, the guys you were working with. CUNNINGHAM: I met my wife at the plant. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CUNNINGHAM: She was loss foam technician. MARTIN: So you had, like, a courtship on the foundry floor? (LAUGHTER)CUNNINGHAM: Oh, you know, I guess you could say that. We look back on that with some fond memories and. . . MARTIN: Yeah. CUNNINGHAM: . . . Working midnight together. You know, as you get off from work at 7 o'clock in the morning and - most people are going, you know, out for dinner date. We're going for breakfast, you know. MARTIN: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Not only did he find the love of his, but Robert was also making really good money. His first-year salary was $101,000. With overtime, it was 157,000. Max was cashing in too. PELIFIAN: We worked hard, but we worked a lot of overtime, too. We made a lot of money, and it was really, you know, busy. You know, especially after I got my first year in. And then I go - this is a good life. And you know, I bought really nice cars and toys and houses and stuff. And it was - it worked out good. (SOUNDBITE OF JACKSON BROWNE SONG, \"RUNNING ON EMPTY\")MARTIN: There was love. There was money - and also a sense of belonging. Co-workers were like a second family. Everyone in town turned out for the GM company picnics. PELIFIAN: It made you feel really good. I mean, we had a couple guys that ran the Olympic torch one year. You know, they're all sponsored. They had GM stuff on when they did it. And we had cars following them. And it gave a little pride in what you were doing. MARTIN: Then in 2007, the news came out of the blue. GM was shutting down. The announcement came on a Monday. MARTIN: Here's Robert. CUNNINGHAM: Most people were in shock. They couldn't believe it. There was a lot of anger, you know. And then it just became this - I can't believe it's coming to an end. And you're in denial. And being in the position that I was in, you know, working closely with our local union leadership and the international union, we know - we tried. And then it - it was over. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CUNNINGHAM: No one quite understood the impact that it was going to have down the road. When you take - we'll call it $60 million out of the local economy every year, that's what General Motors put into the local economy between payroll and taxes and contractors that they hired - what that ripple effect would actually do. And it was devastating. MARTIN: How long were you out of work? CUNNINGHAM: Four years. MARTIN: Robert's wife immediately went back to school to become a nurse. And they'd been saving money all along and investing it well, so they had a buffer. But they had five kids to support. Do you remember having to have conversation with your kids to reassure them? CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, they were little freaked out. You know, we laugh about it now. We'd go shopping - grocery shopping. And they're like - do you remember the $300 days? - where you'd just go in and whatever they wanted, they just threw it in the cart? And they'd just be like, you know. And I'd be like - yeah, go ahead. MARTIN: (Laughter). CUNNINGHAM: You know, and they laugh about it. And so it made me feel bad. I'm like oh, my God, you know, I feel so bad that we didn't keep doing that. MARTIN: Meanwhile, the town of Massena itself started to change. A lot of families moved away - took transfers with GM or just moved to find new jobs. Schools closed down. Here's Max. PELIFIAN: The mall here went from being busy all the time to having a Sears store close. There was a department store at the other end of the mall. That closed. There was, like, Gap, Structure, Limited - all those type stores all closed in the mall after that. MARTIN: We reached out to GM, and they told us that the majority of jobs lost in Massena were moved to a plant in Saginaw, Mich. And some of the work went to a facility in Mexico. And this is where politics comes in because presidential candidates from both parties, mainly Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, are pointing to these shuttered plants and blaming globalization and free trade agreements. That, in turn, is getting families in Massena talking. CUNNINGHAM: I just had this conversation with my dad because we were having the same conversation over NAFTA. MARTIN: Here's Robert again. CUNNINGHAM: And I said -  well, Dad, we're half to blame for that, too, I said, because companies need profits. We want big wages because we want to make the most money we can. But when it comes to products and services, we don't want to have to pay a lot of money. But he goes - well, you know, you're kind of right. And I was like, well, Dad, I said, think about it. We go down, and we want to buy a truck. And what we do? We work for the auto - I can't believe that truck's $45,000. Oh, that truck should be 35. Well, it's $45,000, you know. We want to get it as cheap as we can. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: We should say that Robert did eventually find another job. And he's been working at Massena Electric. But neither Robert nor Max thinks this is a place where their kids or their grandkids will be able to build careers because it was hard enough when GM closed down. But now the last big employer in town, an aluminum manufacturing company called Alcoa - that company is considering leaving, too. The news broke last November. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: A major hit to the North Country economy has elected officials rallying together. This week, Alcoa announced it was closing its west plant in a move that impact nearly 500 jobs. MARTIN: Alcoa had already downsized its operations in Massena. So this didn't come as a major shock. But on top of the GM closure, it was just too much for this one town to absorb. So a couple weeks later, the state government stepped in and gave Alcoa a bailout of sorts, paid the company roughly $70 million to stay open. Here's Gov. Andrew Cuomo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: The Alcoa jobs are saved, and they're going to stay right here in Massena. And this plant is going to keep operating the way it has been operating for over 100 years. (APPLAUSE)MARTIN: That's the dream scenario. But the deal actually says Alcoa only has to stay in Massena for three and a half more years, which means Massena, in that time, has to come up with a plan to replace all those jobs. There are some ideas floating around about how to diversify the economy - building an interstate to bring in business from Canada, building up a tourist industry around the Saint Lawrence River. Robert Cunningham can see that as a possibility - kind of. CUNNINGHAM: I think there is, you know, tourism, obviously - bringing fishing up to the area. But do I see it generating $60 million a year? I hope it does. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CUNNINGHAM: I don't think it's going to. What are they going to come to Massena to see? The seaway? The dam? I mean. . . MARTIN: Other job opportunities have opened up since GM closed. There's a new casino outside of town that created some jobs. And some people went to work for the Border Patrol near the Canadian line, which is just a few lines from Massena. Other residents have started new businesses that are growing. Even so, Robert Cunningham can't help but look backwards. CUNNINGHAM: Massena's not going to recover to its former glory - in my opinion. I mean, we're going to survive. And we're going to get through it as North Country people always do. But to try to get us back to that time when we were the shining star throughout northern New York - I mean, with the huge employers and all the income. . . MARTIN: That, he says, is just not going to happen. For the record today, we heard from Robert Cunningham and Max Pilifian, former GM workers from Massena, N. Y.

They say it's good for the U. S. economy. But recent research shows when it comes to China, trade has hurt American workers more than the experts predicted. This week, NPR and some member stations are reporting on trade for our project A Nation Engaged. Now NPR's Chris Arnold looks at why the issue resonates with voters this election season. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: If you're Bernie Sanders and you want to get your supporters fired up at a rally, bashing trade deals like NAFTA and the TPP is a good way to go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: Every disastrous trade agreement which has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: The TPP is a horrible deal. ARNOLD: Here's Donald Trump in a primary debate on Fox. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. And we don't have smart people making the deal. (APPLAUSE)ARNOLD: Actually, China isn't even a part of the TPP trade deal, so as far as Trump's comments there. . . DAVID AUTOR: That's off-the-scales wrong. ARNOLD: David Autor is a labor economist at MIT. He says the political rhetoric is often a confused mess, but he says it's tapping into something that's very real. AUTOR: I think what politicians are correctly responding to is the reality that the last 35 years have been bad ones for blue-collar Americans. ARNOLD: Wages have been stagnant, and millions of manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Now, you can't just blame trade, though. Technology plays a very big role here. With computers and automation, factories in all kinds of other workplaces need fewer people, and that kills a lot of jobs. Autor says by comparison, if you look at NAFTA and trade with Mexico, that really has not been very harmful for U. S. workers, but China - his research shows that's a different story. AUTOR: China's rise is really kind of a world historical event. This is the largest country in the world. It has caused a wholesale substantial contraction of U. S. manufacturing employment. ARNOLD: Autor says in less than a decade, starting in the year 2000, trade with China destroyed about 1 million U. S. manufacturing jobs. Now, trade theory doesn't say that all workers will be protected. It says that trade will make both countries better off. But what happened here? OK, let's forget about China for a moment and consider U. S. trade with another country - France. The U. S. makes good airplanes and cars, of course, and the French - well, the French make good cheese. ARNOLD: Have a little bag of. . . AUTOR: Oh, my God. ARNOLD: . . . My goodies. AUTOR: OK. ARNOLD: So here I have some French cheeses. AUTOR: OK, there we go. ARNOLD: I'm sitting with David Autor in his office at MIT, and in the middle of our interview, I pull out some useful items to help him explain how trade is supposed to work. ARNOLD: For you, David, I brought some. . . AUTOR: OK. ARNOLD: . . . Little cars. AUTOR: Matchboxes. ARNOLD: Yeah. AUTOR: Matchbox cars. ARNOLD: So I'll be France, and you're America with the cars. So how does this work where we both win? AUTOR: I say, you know, you make some really good gourmet food there, Chris, and we'd sure like to eat it. I guess I could take some of my Chevy workers, and I could say, you know, go spend two days a week making cheese, and you know, stop putting on hubcaps. But they probably wouldn't be very good at it, and the end result would be. . . ARNOLD: Bad cheese. AUTOR: . . . Bad cheese, fewer cars. ARNOLD: So instead of that. . . AUTOR: Why don't we just trade? And I'll give you some trucks, and you give me some gourmet food, and we'll both be doing the think that we're good at. We'll be focusing on our area of compared advantage. ARNOLD: And this is the magic of trade. With two countries doing what they're best at with the same number of workers and the same amount of money invested together, they can create more higher-quality stuff than either of them could separately. In a sense, it creates wealth for both countries. China was a bit different, though, because for one thing, it was a huge, and it began exporting all kinds of things that U. S. manufacturers were already making, just doing it cheaper. And much more quickly than economists predicted, China was able to transform its rural society with about a billion low-wage workers into a cheap-labor manufacturing superpower. AUTOR: It was the proverbial boulder, you know, sitting at the top of a mountain for a hundred years. And one day, it just started to roll down, and you know, it is rather disruptive to those in the valley below. ARNOLD: That would be the American manufacturing workers getting squashed by the Chinese boulder. AUTOR: I mean, I don't want to go to far with that analogy because we still win from trade with China. ARNOLD: Everything from the shoes that you're wearing, your watch, kitchen appliances, your phone - so many things in our lives are cheaper because of international trade that overall, despite the loss of jobs, Autor says that the U. S. and China still both come out ahead. The problem, though, is that these benefits are diffuse, but the harm, the pain - that's concentrated. AUTOR: If I lose my job at a furniture factory where I've worked for decades, no amount of sort of, you know, cheaper toys and raincoats at Walmart is going to make me whole again. ARNOLD: So Autor wishes that this is what the national conversation could be about. Instead of bashing trade deals, he'd like to see a lot more focus on what we could do to help workers who've been displaced by trade. He says other developed countries do a much better job of this, and the U. S. is pretty lousy at it. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

Autor says by comparison, if you look at NAFTA and trade with Mexico, that really has not been very harmful for U. S. workers, but China - his research shows that's a different story. AUTOR: China's rise is really kind of a world historical event. This is the largest country in the world. It has caused a wholesale substantial contraction of U. S. manufacturing employment. ARNOLD: Autor says in less than a decade, starting in the year 2000, trade with China destroyed about 1 million U. S. manufacturing jobs. Now, trade theory doesn't say that all workers will be protected. It says that trade will make both countries better off. But what happened here? OK, let's forget about China for a moment and consider U. S. trade with another country - France. The U. S. makes good airplanes and cars, of course, and the French - well, the French make good cheese. ARNOLD: Have a little bag of. . . AUTOR: Oh, my God. ARNOLD: . . . My goodies. AUTOR: OK. ARNOLD: So here I have some French cheeses. AUTOR: OK, there we go. ARNOLD: I'm sitting with David Autor in his office at MIT, and in the middle of our interview, I pull out some useful items to help him explain how trade is supposed to work. ARNOLD: For you, David, I brought some. . . AUTOR: OK. ARNOLD: . . . Little cars. AUTOR: Matchboxes. ARNOLD: Yeah. AUTOR: Matchbox cars. ARNOLD: So I'll be France, and you're America with the cars. So how does this work where we both win? AUTOR: I say, you know, you make some really good gourmet food there, Chris, and we'd sure like to eat it. I guess I could take some of my Chevy workers, and I could say, you know, go spend two days a week making cheese, and you know, stop putting on hubcaps. But they probably wouldn't be very good at it, and the end result would be. . . ARNOLD: Bad cheese. AUTOR: . . . Bad cheese, fewer cars. ARNOLD: So instead of that. . . AUTOR: Why don't we just trade? And I'll give you some trucks, and you give me some gourmet food, and we'll both be doing the think that we're good at. We'll be focusing on our area of compared advantage. ARNOLD: And this is the magic of trade. With two countries doing what they're best at with the same number of workers and the same amount of money invested together, they can create more higher-quality stuff than either of them could separately. In a sense, it creates wealth for both countries. China was a bit different, though, because for one thing, it was a huge, and it began exporting all kinds of things that U. S. manufacturers were already making, just doing it cheaper. And much more quickly than economists predicted, China was able to transform its rural society with about a billion low-wage workers into a cheap-labor manufacturing superpower. AUTOR: It was the proverbial boulder, you know, sitting at the top of a mountain for a hundred years. And one day, it just started to roll down, and you know, it is rather disruptive to those in the valley below. ARNOLD: That would be the American manufacturing workers getting squashed by the Chinese boulder. AUTOR: I mean, I don't want to go to far with that analogy because we still win from trade with China. ARNOLD: Everything from the shoes that you're wearing, your watch, kitchen appliances, your phone - so many things in our lives are cheaper because of international trade that overall, despite the loss of jobs, Autor says that the U. S. and China still both come out ahead. The problem, though, is that these benefits are diffuse, but the harm, the pain - that's concentrated. AUTOR: If I lose my job at a furniture factory where I've worked for decades, no amount of sort of, you know, cheaper toys and raincoats at Walmart is going to make me whole again. ARNOLD: So Autor wishes that this is what the national conversation could be about. Instead of bashing trade deals, he'd like to see a lot more focus on what we could do to help workers who've been displaced by trade. He says other developed countries do a much better job of this, and the U. S. is pretty lousy at it.

Both Democrats and Republicans have been attacking trade agreements as unfair to American workers. Well, all this week, some NPR member stations will be talking about trade as part of our project called A Nation Engaged. And we begin this week with NPR's Scott Horsley, who reports the anti-trade rhetoric in this year's election is somewhat at odds with public opinion. Polls show a narrow majority of Americans actually support trade agreements. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: For more than a century, the Alcoa company has been making aluminum in Massena, N. Y. , a small city on the banks of the St. Lawrence River. Workers there made good wages, 20 to 30 dollars an hour, until a couple of years ago, when Alcoa decided to shutter one of its plants, eliminating more than 300 jobs. BOB SMITH: This influx of metal into the market from China and other countries, it's flooded the market and drove the price down. It's hard to compete against that. That's why we feel that it's unfair. HORSLEY: Bob Smith, who heads the local steelworkers union, says another shoe dropped last fall, when Alcoa said it was closing a second plant, cutting nearly 500 more jobs. Those workers got a reprieve when the state stepped in. But it's only temporary. Massena's also suffering from the shutdown of a General Motors plant, where Smith's mom worked for more than 30 years. SMITH: To put it in one word, it's been devastating. You're talking about a town of 10, 11,000 people. When you lose 300 jobs here, 500 jobs there, the result of that is you have three or 500 for-sale signs up. This is real money being taken out of the local economy. HORSLEY: The U. S. filed a complaint last year with the World Trade Organization accusing China of more than a billion dollars in prohibited exports subsidies to a wide range industries, including aluminum. China agreed to halt some of those subsidies last week. In the meantime, Massena's tax rolls have taken a beating. People are leaving the surrounding county, and there's a growing problem with heroin abuse. As the New York primary approaches tomorrow, leading Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are talking tough about trade. Economist Robert Scott, with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, says via Skype, politicians are trying to tap into the frustration that many Americans feel. ROBERT SCOTT: Not only have they lost millions of jobs due to growing trade deficits, but there has been downward pressure on the wages of a much, much larger number of Americans, nearly two-thirds of the labor force. HORSLEY: To be sure, trade also produces winners in America. The U. S. enjoys a big trade surplus in aerospace, for example. So if you work for Boeing, exports are your friend. Once more, American consumers save money when they can buy cheaper imported goods. Political analyst Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution notes many people by surprised when they look at public opinion polls on trade. Democratic voters are generally supportive of trade deals, even if many Democratic elected officials are not. BILL GALSTON: The Democratic base is made up of young people and minorities and also educated professionals. And all of those groups tend to be open to trade. HORSLEY: Polls show Republican voters are much more skeptical of trade deals, even though the party's establishment is still generally supportive. Overall, more Americans think trade deals have been good for the United States than bad. But Galston says opponents tend to speak more loudly. GALSTON: It's a little bit like gun control, where you have a pretty solid popular majority in favor. But the people who can be mobilized on the basis of that single issue are disproportionately on one side. HORSLEY: That's not surprising. Lots of people feel a little better when they save money on cheap imports. But those who lose their jobs feel a lot worse. New research suggests communities hard hit by trade, like Massena, N. Y. , take a lot longer to recover than forecasters used to think. Galston adds trade worries are amplified by more general concerns with slow growth, automation and inequality. GALSTON: For millions and millions of Americans, the American dream has been called into question by the stagnation of the past 15 years. HORSLEY: Matthew Slaughter is a Dartmouth economist who worked in the George W. Bush administration. He supports free trade and says erecting new trade barriers would be counterproductive. At the same time, he says policymakers do need to find better ways to compensate the casualties. MATTHEW SLAUGHTER: I think we've missed an opportunity in the United States, for many years at this point, to have a discussion about our social safety nets so that those individuals who aren't benefiting from the global economy don't feel as politically motivated to give voice to wanting to stop it. HORSLEY: Slaughter suggests the safety net could be strengthened with expanded unemployment insurance, job training and direct subsidies for workers whose wages suffer. He warns, unless the benefits of trade are shared more equitably, public opposition to trade deals is likely to grow. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

NPR's Jim Zarroli reports the president actually has little direct authority over the banks, and any attempt to break them up would be a complicated process. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Sanders says that within the first hundred days of his administration, he will have the Treasury Department draw up a list of financial institutions that are too big to fail. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: Within one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose. . . (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: . . . No longer pose a grave threat to the economy. ZARROLI: But doing so wouldn't be as easy as it sounds. Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics says the White House actually has no real legal authority to break up the banks. KAREN SHAW PETROU: It's not something the president can do. It's not even something the treasury can do. ZARROLI: Banks are regulated by a patchwork of state and federal agencies. The Federal Reserve, for instance, has a lot of direct authority over the biggest banks. If the Fed thinks a bank is doing something risky, for example, it can require it to hold more capital. PETROU: But that's the Fed. That's not the Treasury, and it's not the president. And the Fed is an independent agency that Senator Sanders, as president, could not tell it what to do. ZARROLI: And Petrou says Congress did this by design because it wanted to insulate regulators from political pressure. There are other agencies that can generally make life difficult for the banks such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. And there's the new Financial Stability Oversight Council which is often said to have driven GE out of the financial services business. But the president does have a roll. Marcus Stanley is policy director of Americans for Financial Reform. MARCUS STANLEY: There's a saying in D. C. that personnel is policy, meaning that the people that you appoint are really the ones who determine what the policies are really going to be on the ground. ZARROLI: In other words, a president may not be able to order a bank breakup, but he or she does get to appoint the regulators. And Stanley says those regulators can be persuasive. STANLEY: There's no doubt that the regulators have the ability to put tougher rules on the larger banks such that that would create an incentive for the larger banks to break up. ZARROLI: But even the regulators' power is circumscribed. Karen Shaw Petrou says regulators can highlight problems and demand they be addressed, but before they take steps to lead to a bank breakup, they have to prove the problems can't be resolved in some other way. PETROU: They could say, we don't like your brokerage operations; we think you need to get rid of them. They can't do it just because they don't like big banks. ZARROLI: The president can use these regulatory bodies to exert pressure on the banks, says Anat Admati, professor of economics at Stanford. But she says the process wouldn't be as quick or easy as Senator Sanders suggests. ANAT ADMATI: It's all just very slow and very cumbersome, the things he can do. But it's not a clear order from today to tomorrow or anything like that that would just do this thing called breaking up the banks. ZARROLI: It's also true that banks have enormous lobbying power in Washington, and they can be counted on to vigorously oppose any effort to break them up, no matter what the president wants.

Supporters here are pulling out all the stops. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN YEATS: Thank you, everybody, for coming in defense of religious freedom today. (APPLAUSE)MORRIS: An enthusiastic crowd filled the rotunda of the Missouri State House this week pledging to fight back against what they see as an assault on long-held religious beliefs. Missouri Baptist Convention Director John Yeats says Senate Joint Resolution 39 simply shields a vocal constituency in Missouri from being forced by the government to take part in something they find morally wrong - gay marriage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YEATS: You would think that SJR 39 would be a common-sensed no-brainer. (APPLAUSE)MORRIS: But while Yeats sees a threat to religious liberty, Joe Reardon sees a threat to commerce. JOE REARDON: We're talking about profitability. We're talking about jobs. MORRIS: Reardon runs the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce and says the biggest business groups in the state have locked arms against the amendment. Hundreds of individual businesses have piled on. REARDON: It's every sort of business in Kansas City coming together in common cause around this, and that's been remarkable to me. MORRIS: Some companies have long stood for LGBT rights, but Stuart Hinds, who runs the Gay and Lesbian Archive of Mid-America, says the current level of massed business support is something new. STUART HINDS: It's a phenomenal shift, and it's incredible to see it happen so quickly. MORRIS: It's not hard to see what businesses are worried about. Mark Fisher with the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce says the city lost at least $60 million worth of convention business when his state passed a religious freedom act last year. MARK FISHER: We all need to realize that social issues are economic issues now. MORRIS: Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, scaled back the law just one week after signing it but not quickly enough, according to Fisher. FISHER: This can be a defining brand or defining image for your city, and how will that affect your ability to attract and retain talent? MORRIS: This is precisely why Monsanto, the global crop technology firm based in St. Louis, is fighting the Missouri proposal. Monsanto isn't exactly a liberal darling. The company's funding Republican congressional candidates this year are more than three times the level it's giving to Democrats. But Monsanto lobbyist Duane Simpson says recruiting and keeping world-class researchers is hard enough now. DUANE SIMPSON: We're just asking legislators not to make our job more difficult by making the state appear unwelcoming. MORRIS: And if a place is perceived as being unwelcoming to conventions or business talent, your typical tourist may shun it as well. MORRIS: David Epstein is the co-owner of Tom's Town, a new distillery and art deco bar in an old part of Kansas City that's blossoming with fresh restaurants, galleries and tech startups. And he calls the amendment an existential threat. DAVID EPSTEIN: Religious freedom bill which I think is so misnamed would decimate us. MORRIS: This level of alarm from businesses in Missouri comes as something of a shock. Senator Bob Onder, who wrote the religious protection legislation, says corporate opposition has materialized just since mid-February. BOB ONDER: When I presented this bill and committee on the state senate, not a single business lobbyist came to testify against my bill. MORRIS: And there was little reason to think that they would. After all, as Don Hinkle with the Missouri Baptist Convention points out, conservative Christians have long worked hand in glove with the Missouri Chamber of Commerce. DON HINKLE: We've been on the same side of issues for so many times for so long. And for them to think that our religious freedom is for sale, much less the gospel of Jesus Christ is for sale, to us, it's heartbreaking. MORRIS: So an amendment that passed overwhelmingly in the Missouri Senate now seems to be stalled in the House. If it does clear the legislature, though, it would then go to a public vote, likely triggering an even bigger fight pitting Christian conservatives against their old allies in business.

I'm Michel Martin. We're going to start with election-year politics. But we're going to talk about issue that's gotten candidates and voters riled up across the political spectrum. That issue is free trade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: The TPP is a horrible deal. It's a deal that was designed for China to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED CRUZ: We're getting killed in international trade right now. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: We've learned a lot about trade agreements in the past years. Sometimes they look great on paper. Now looking back on it, it doesn't have the results we thought it would have. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: The TPP is just a new easy way for corporations to shut down in America and to send jobs abroad. MARTIN: That was Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and Democratic candidates Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and free trade in general. We wanted to talk about why international free trade has struck such a nerve with Americans this year. So all this week, a group of NPR stations around the country participated in a coordinated conversation called A Nation Engaged. We're closing it out with NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Hi Marilyn. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi Michel. MARTIN: And from the studios of Colorado Public Radio Megan Verlee. Megan, welcome to you as well. MEGAN VERLEE, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: So let me just start out, Marilyn, by pointing out that actually for decades, the political parties have by and large supported big trade agreements that you hear about in the news. People will have heard about NAFTA. They will have heard about the TPP. Why has it turned around seemingly so much, and why is China such a focus of all of this anger? GEEWAX: Right. Let me just say that in the past, Republicans liked it because they tend to be pro-business, Democrats tended to like it because they tend to be internationalists. They see the world as being globalized, so you had a lot of support for it. But then we slammed into the Great Recession. A lot of the popularity of trade went down. Then when it comes to China, there's a lot of deep feeling about that because we all go into the store and we see those things made in China, and it seems like gosh, aren't they making everything these days? Well, China is not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's not one of the 12 nations involved. It's the United States, Japan, Australia - all these countries that are around the Pacific Rim but specifically not China. MARTIN: But the anger is real. Marilyn, could you talk a little bit more about this? GEEWAX: That individual anger is certainly real and justifiable. I mean, if you're one of the people that lost their jobs, you really hurt and your community is devastated. For example, this year we've had this kind of well-known case about Carrier. It's a company that makes air conditioning. And they announced they were closing a plant back in February, and they're moving all these jobs to Mexico. Well holy cow, if you're one of those people that just lost their job, this hurts a lot. The intense downside of trade is felt very much by people, and it makes it easy to point to examples like that if you're a political candidate. The thing that's tricky about trade is that this is a very large economy. It's almost a $19 trillion economy with 323 million people. A lot happens at once. The gains can be very diffused and they're spread out over the economy. For example, air conditioning is really cheap now. A lot of that is because of overseas production. MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because when a lot of our reporters, as we mentioned, across the country have been digging into this over the course of the week, they experienced that kind of mixed bag of opinion themselves. For example, in Los Angeles, Saul Gonzales from member station KCRW talked with truck drivers in California. They're delivering goods from one of the busiest ports in the U. S. Here's Brian Spencer making the case for how trade helps him personally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)BRIAN SPENCER: How I pay my bills, how I take care of my family, etc. , etc. , is for the simple source of our trade system. You know, if nothing's coming and going, I'm sitting still, therefore I'm not making any money. I'm not making - you know, so I can't live. MARTIN: And here's another trucker Dennis Roach, who had a different opinion, less of a fan. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DENNIS ROACH: Jobs are going to foreign countries. We're shipping more product in from overseas. You know, I'd bet you go to anybody's house and look in their closet and it says Indonesia, China, Japan, Taiwan. There's very few things that'll say made in the U. S. A. MARTIN: Let's go to Megan Verlee now. You had a piece that ran on member station Colorado Public Radio. Tell us a little bit about it. Well, let's play it a bit from the piece then Megan you can tell us more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)VERLEE: It's a quintessential Colorado scene. Grant Bledsoe's family has owned this Yuma County operation since the 1940's. This is what hungry calves sound like? GRANT BLEDSOE: They're just getting ready to go to grass for the summer time. VERLEE: These steers will eventually be going a lot further than that, or at least parts of them will. BLEDSOE: It's just amazing some of the products that get sold around the world, big demand for the diaphragm, the stomach, tripe to Mexico. MARTIN: So Megan, tell us a little bit more about your reporting. What were the opinions of the people that you interviewed? VERLEE: Well, like you've been saying, mixed from, you know, very traditional industries like beef production, which was shaped by NAFTA opening markets and now stands to really expand under the TPP into more Asian markets. On the one hand, we have people for whom the breaking down the barriers through trade deals is going to be a big plus. And I talked to workers who've been displaced because I think probably anywhere in the country you can find people who know that their jobs have moved overseas. MARTIN: You met two women at Starbucks, for example. You want to tell us about that? VERLEE: Yes. Venice Romero and Vanessa Abdurahman are really good friends. They met working at a T-Mobile call center, and they worked at that call center for more than a decade. And then a couple years ago, T-Mobile closed that center, moved the jobs over to the Philippines. And suddenly, these women who have families, have responsibilities, realize they only had high school diplomas and no way to make as much money as they had before. So they used a federal program called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. It pays for two years of retraining to workers whose jobs have been lost to trade. And they went back to school, became respiratory techs. They're making about as much now as they did before, and they're both a lot more satisfied with their work. So they're kind of - they're how trade is supposed to work - you know, these low-skill, low-paying jobs move overseas. They're replaced by higher-skill, higher-wage jobs. And in an ideal system, the same people get trained for those new jobs. What I found though is that very few people actually get to take advantage of this retraining opportunity. MARTIN: Marilyn, is this an issue where you stand depends on where you sit because you're in an area where your livelihood depends on trade, then you tend to be for it, but if you're in an area where you think that you've been harmed by it, you tend to be against it? Or. . . GEEWAX: Well. . . MARTIN: . . . Is that not so much the case anymore? GEEWAX: Economists will say that generally speaking, there's something like a ratio of 16 to 1 of benefits to losses to trade. They find the data shows that ultimately it's good. But as I say, if you were that Carrier worker who just found out your job's going to Mexico, it's pretty tough to sit there, you know, thumbing through some academic studies saying that somebody else is winning when you know you're losing. And one other thing I just want to point out is that going forward, these deals are not going to be that much about manufacturing because that's sort of in the rearview mirror. We have lost a lot of manufacturing jobs already. What's happening in the future is how do these trade deals affect things like intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, much more sophisticated products. MARTIN: That's NPR's Marilyn Geewax and also with us Megan Verlee from Colorado Public Radio. Thank you both so much. GEEWAX: Oh, you're welcome. VERLEE: Thank you.

It's called Hanging On. And our next guest knows exactly how that feels. His name is Neal Gabler, and he's written a piece in The Atlantic magazine called \"The Secret Shame Of Middle-Class Americans. \" And the subtitle reveals a lot. Here it is - \"Nearly Half Of Americans Would Have Trouble Finding $400 To Pay For An Emergency. I'm One Of Them. \"NEAL GABLER: I think by many measures in society, I'm a success, I like to think. And if you were to look at me, you certainly wouldn't think that I would have trouble scrounging up $400. Or if you were to look at my resume, you wouldn't think that. I've written five books. If you looked at my 1040, you probably wouldn't think that. But that is really the whole point. Despite all of those things, I still have a difficult time making ends meet, as many, many, many Americans do. MARTIN: I mean, these details that you lay out in the piece - you know, it says I know what it's like to have to borrow money from my adult daughters because my wife and I ran out of heating oil. How did this happen? GABLER: Well, simple answer is - and I think this is true for many people - too little income in a society where wages have been stagnant for almost 40 years and too many expenses. I am in a situation that tens of millions of Americans share, and we're not talking about poor people. I'm not poor. We're talking about middle-class Americans, even upper-middle-class Americans, who live paycheck-to-paycheck. MARTIN: How does that jibe with the metrics that have been telling us for a while that we're out of the Great Recession and that our economy is on the upswing? GABLER: Well, there's a gigantic gulf between macroeconomics and microeconomics. The macroeconomic figures do not reveal what's going on in the microeconomic world. People are having a difficult time living. There is always a car that needs repair, a pet - my dog who's limping, a faucet that leaks. There is always an emergency, and we live within that. MARTIN: But hasn't that always been thus? Like, what has changed about the way we live now? Is it just as simple as we expect more - we're living beyond our means? GABLER: Oh, I think that's part of it. I think we've been taught to expect more. We have been taught that a middle-class existence is, you know, a house. By some metrics they say, you know, maybe a $250,000 house and a vacation every year and a car for each adult and educated for the children. And indeed, those are the very metrics that the Commerce Department has used in defining what a middle-class life is. But as I point out in the article, if you put a price tag on that middle-class life, as USA Today did several years ago, the price tag for that middle-class life is A$130,000. Only 1 in 8 Americans makes $130,000, so the middle-class life that we've all been taught is ours if only we work for it is out of the reach of all but a very small number of us. MARTIN: In the piece, you call this financial impotence, in large part because it gets at this private shame associated with being on the economic brink. What has that looked like in your own life? I mean, now you have come public. But how did that shame weigh on you? GABLER: That shame weighed on me - and I am not overstating the case - on not only a daily basis, but an hourly basis. It keeps you up at night. It is ruinous for relationships. The shame is so great - the ongoing sense of shame that in a country where we are told anyone can be successful and where, as Donald Trump has told us endlessly, you know, if you don't make it, you're a loser. So yes, did I feel like a loser? You bet I did. But what can you do with that, that sense of shame? You can't share it with anybody because to expose it is, like sexual impotence, something you just don't want to talk about. MARTIN: What does this mean for how we think about success in this country? I mean, do we need to redefine, as a culture, what it means to be part of the American middle class? GABLER: We do need to redefine that. But that's a very, very tall order. But the beginning is to have Americans who are suffering from financial impotence, which is nearly half of America if you believe this data - it's them coming out and saying - you want to know something? I'm tired of feeling like a failure because I'm told that everybody in America ought to be rich if only they work hard. And by the way, Rachel, I'll tell you something. You know, surveys show - and I don't cite this in article - that Americans are the only people who believe that in the industrialized world. If you look at the English or the French or the Germans, they don't believe that they're totally responsible for not having achieved financial success. Americans do. And we've got to stop people telling us that it's all in our hands as to whether we're going to be successful because frankly, it is not. MARTIN: Neal Gabler - his piece on financial impotence appears in this month's edition of The Atlantic. Neal, thanks so much for talking with us. GABLER: Thank you so much for asking.

Congress is considering a plan to restructure the U. S. territory's more than $72 billion debt. And time is running out. If Congress doesn't act, Puerto Rico is expected to miss a $400 million debt payment next week, a default that NPR's Greg Allen reports might signal the start of the island's financial meltdown. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: The saga that is Puerto Rico's crushing debt crisis has been running for over a year. It's a story that involves eye-glazing things like tax law, municipal bonds and hedge funds. But its impact is enormous, contributing to a stagnant economy that spurred a half-million people to leave the island. And with a major default looming, many are beginning to speculate what a total collapse of Puerto Rico's finances would mean for bond markets and the U. S. economy. But how to make it interesting enough to grab America's attention? On his HBO show, John Oliver recruited the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the hit Broadway play \"Hamilton,\" Lin-Manuel Miranda. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\")LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: (Singing) Yeah, my family is from Puerto Rico, the tropical destination where you can spend your Washingtons, the spot where you vacation, a commonwealth with not a lot of wealth, a not-quite nation, $70 billion topic of conversation. ALLEN: Earlier this year, House speaker Paul Ryan made Puerto Rico a priority and pledged the House would craft a plan to help the island repay its bills. Fresh from his success on Broadway, Miranda has lobbied Congress to act, even offering tickets to \"Hamilton\" if that would help.

Your citizens are suffering. Stop the bleeding. Stop the loss. Help Puerto Rico. It's just 100 miles across. ALLEN: But there are those working to stop the plan taking shape in the House. Here's an ad that's been running in Washington and in the districts of some House members. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Retirement accounts crushed, a bailout on the backs of savers and seniors. Tell Congress stop the Washington bailout of Puerto Rico. ROB BISHOP: Well, you know, they've spent a whole lot of time running it in my district, and it hasn't changed my opinion because I understand what the details are. ALLEN: That's Rob Bishop, a Republican from Utah and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Bishop's committee has released two drafts of a plan for Puerto Rico, and is now working with the White House on a third that he hopes to bring for a vote this week if possible. There's bipartisan support for the plan, which would set up a fiscal control board and an orderly process for restructuring the island's debt. It's also supported by bond funds and other creditors that hold Puerto Rican debt. The groups leading the opposition are harder to pin down. The one that paid for the ad campaign, the Center for Individual Freedom, doesn't disclose where its money comes from. Bishop believes, though, that opposition is being led by hedge funds looking to maximize the return they get on Puerto Rican debt they bought at discount prices. BISHOP: There is a niche group that bought really cheap and want full-face dollars. And they think if there was chaos, if everything broke down, there probably would be a bailout and then they probably would be first in line to get paid back in full-face credit. ALLEN: Bishop says critics who call it a taxpayer-funded bailout are wrong, that the bills uses no federal money to help Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, elected officials are watching the deliberations in Congress with a mixture of hope and dread that color much of the island's dealings with Washington. Sen. Ramon Luis Nieves opposes creation of a fiscal control board, saying it would violate the island's sovereignty. But like most on the island, he believes the solution to Puerto Rico's financial woes lies with Congress. RAMON LUIS NIEVES: Puerto Rico's not asking for a bailout. We're not asking for a bailout. We're asking for the tools to help ourselves. ALLEN: If Congress doesn't act, Puerto Rico's expected to default on a $422 million debt payment due next Monday. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:   Puerto Rico's financial crisis is at an important tipping point this week. Congress is considering a plan to restructure the U. S. territory's more than $72 billion debt. And time is running out. If Congress doesn't act, Puerto Rico is expected to miss a $400 million debt payment next week, a default that NPR's Greg Allen reports might signal the start of the island's financial meltdown. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: The saga that is Puerto Rico's crushing debt crisis has been running for over a year. It's a story that involves eye-glazing things like tax law, municipal bonds and hedge funds. But its impact is enormous, contributing to a stagnant economy that spurred a half-million people to leave the island. And with a major default looming, many are beginning to speculate what a total collapse of Puerto Rico's finances would mean for bond markets and the U. S. economy. But how to make it interesting enough to grab America's attention? On his HBO show, John Oliver recruited the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the hit Broadway play \"Hamilton,\" Lin-Manuel Miranda. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\") LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: (Singing) Yeah, my family is from Puerto Rico, the tropical destination where you can spend your Washingtons, the spot where you vacation, a commonwealth with not a lot of wealth, a not-quite nation, $70 billion topic of conversation. ALLEN: Earlier this year, House speaker Paul Ryan made Puerto Rico a priority and pledged the House would craft a plan to help the island repay its bills. Fresh from his success on Broadway, Miranda has lobbied Congress to act, even offering tickets to \"Hamilton\" if that would help. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER\") MIRANDA: (Singing) Paul Ryan, I'll come sing \"Hamilton\" at your house. I'll do-si-do with Pelosi. I'll wear my \"Hamilton\" blouse.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: And the government, our government, our poor government, we're being out-dealt by China. They're so smart. But I make a lot of money with China. We're being out-dealt by China and Mexico and Japan. Look at Japan. They sell cars. By the millions, they pour in. You know what we give them? Practically nothing, OK? INSKEEP: Trump is playing on a very real resentment. Many American jobs have gone overseas. Occasionally, you hear a factory worker whose final task is dismantling the equipment to send it to its new location out of the country. Bernie Sanders critiques trade deals too, but some economists have been arguing that a better approach is more help for the workers who do lose their jobs. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Most economists, including Jacob Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, believe that trade is good for the U. S. Economy despite negative effects for workers who lose their jobs. JACOB KIRKEGAARD: I think there is a group here who could say that, yes, they have a grievance. But that doesn't change the fact that on a net effect for the U. S. Economy as a whole and for the average American, trade has been a huge benefit. YDSTIE: But Kirkegaard says the U. S. Hasn't been very good at channeling some of those benefits to people who've lost the most to trade. John Folk knows all about that. He worked at a Huffy bicycle plant in Celina, Ohio that was shutdown nearly 18 years ago when the company moved its production to China. Huffy had given its union workers an ultimatum, work for $6 an hour with no benefits. JOHN FOLK: We didn't even put it out to vote. No one could live on that. We had many people there that their whole income in the household was from Huffy's. Both the husband and wife worked there. So it was pretty devastating. YDSTIE: A federal program called Trade Adjustment Assistance that paid for worker retraining was available. But Folk says only about a quarter of the Huffy workers signed up, partly because they needed health insurance and couldn't get by on unemployment benefits. FOLK: If you didn't have the means to keep a roof over your head, keep food on the table for you and your children and clothes on their back, you had to go and find a job right away. YDSTIE: The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is still around. John Folk knows it well. He used the program after he lost his job at Huffy to study financial management. And he is now an administrator for the program at Allen County Jobs and Family Services in Lima, Ohio. Folk says it and other U. S. Employment programs are sorely underfunded. FOLK: In fact, in the 12, 13 years that I've been in this field, our funding has been almost cut in half from when I started in 2002. YDSTIE: And Folk says he's come to believe that reemployment services should be expanded, and not just for those who can prove their jobs were lost to trade. Why should a worker whose job moves from Ohio to China be treated any differently, he asks, than someone whose plant moves from Ohio to South Carolina? Jacob Kirkegaard says in Europe, countries generally don't care whether you've lost your job to trade or to domestic competitors. KIRKEGAARD: In some countries, they call it the right and duty principle, which means that if you become unemployed, you actually have a legal right to some kind of retraining. YDSTIE: Kirkegaard acknowledges that European countries spend up to 10 times more, as a share of GDP, on these so-called activist labor policies than the U. S. Spends on its programs. And he admits there's no political appetite for spending that much in the U. S. One possible, less expensive option, is something President Obama mentioned in his State of the Union speech. It's called wage insurance. Colby College economist Lori Kletzer has pushed the idea. It's a way of subsidizing wages for workers who lose a job for any reason. But their lack of skills means they can only get a job that pays much less than their old job. LORI KLETZER: But if there's a program of wage insurance that closes the gap between old and new job earnings, that can be an enticement back into the labor market, where a worker has access to training. YDSTIE: On the job training, which is the most effective kind, training that lifts skills and productivity and ultimately wages. Kletzer calculates a program like this would cost the U. S. About $2 billion a year. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  One of Donald Trump's signature issues is his criticism of American trade agreements.

S. territory may default on a debt payment of almost $500 million. Nick Timiraos is a national economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. NICK TIMIRAOS: Oh, thanks for having me. SIMON: The money just isn't there, so what happens if Congress can't agree on some kind of relief? TIMIRAOS: Well, Puerto Rico has $70 billion that it owes creditors and there are several different classes of debts. So the missed payment that's happening this weekend is for one public agency but you're basically going to see potential cascading defaults now and so that is why Congress is stepping in here to possibly put forward some kind of restructuring legislation. SIMON: Speaker Ryan wants something. . . TIMIRAOS: Yeah, Paul Ryan has been working on this. The reason Congress is getting involved - you know, a lot of people say, well, why does Congress even have to get involved here? Puerto Rico is in a very interesting place. It's not a state, but it's not a country. So if it were a state, its municipal corporations would be able to use the federal bankruptcy code Chapter 9 the same way that Detroit did a couple of years ago to restructure its debts. For some reason - no one's quite sure why - in 1984, the bankruptcy code was amended so that territories couldn't use it. Again, it's not a sovereign country, so they can't go to the IMF - the International Monetary Fund - the way, you know, Greece or Argentina have. So they're in this weird position here and that is why the Treasury Department and the Obama administration have said, you know, Congress, which has responsibility for Puerto Rico since it is a federal territory, needs to come up with some way for the island to restructure its debts. SIMON: How did this happen? TIMIRAOS: It happened over a long period of time where the governments was able to continue borrowing. And one of the reasons they were able to borrow so much, again, has to do with this kind of quirk of their political status. Puerto Rico, unlike other states, can issue triple tax-exempt bonds, which means they don't have to pay federal, state or municipal tax. And so that made these investments very attractive. And when Puerto Rico wasn't able to balance its budget year in and year out, they went and borrowed in the capital markets and they had investors lining up really to lend money to Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, their economy has been in a recession since 2006. If you think about the worst parts of the United States - the Rust Belt - Puerto Rico's situation is every bit as dramatic, if not more so, than that and they've had tremendous population loss. It's very hard to grow your tax base to boost revenues when you're losing 1 to 2 percent of your population every year. SIMON: What might congressional legislation look like? Do you have an inkling now? TIMIRAOS: Yeah. So the deal that the Treasury Department and that the House leadership with Paul Ryan and they've been working on would be to pair a federal oversight board with a debt restructuring mechanism. Again, Puerto Rico can't file for bankruptcy protection, so this would create some kind of alternative bankruptcy-like mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debts. A control board is of course not very popular with the local government. They'd be losing sovereignty to Washington here, but it's probably the price they're going to have to pay for being able to have some haircuts on the bonds and the bondholders are going to have to take - of course, bondholders had been fighting this. Some of them had been fighting it very hard. They've tried to characterize the legislation as a bailout, which is interesting because there actually isn't any taxpayer money being put into this. And there probably will be at some point if Congress doesn't pass legislation that allows a debt restructuring and things get worse on the island. So you could see a scenario two years from now if this isn't addressed and more people are coming into the United States and Puerto Rico really can't pay its costs (ph) then you could have, you know, you could actually have a humanitarian crisis and that could actually cost money.

That wouldn't be easy, and some economists doubt it's even possible. But Trump's pledge is expected to drive a lot of people to the polls in Indiana, where manufacturing plays a big role in the economy. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. PHIL BURKHOLDER: We're going to go right down through this aisle -JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Phil Burkholder rides a golf cart through an enormous Rolls-Royce plant in Indianapolis. The plant makes gas turbine engines for civil and defense aircraft. BURKHOLDER: So this is where we make the engines for the helicopters. So these are smaller than what you would see in the big aircraft. ZARROLI: Hanging from the ceiling are flags of the U. K. , Turkey and the Netherlands. They're testament to the fact that engines made here will be used all over the world, Burkholder says. BURKHOLDER: Because of technology, because of air travel, we are more integrated than we've ever been in the past, so the markets around the world are important and increasingly important. ZARROLI: Burkholder is president of Rolls-Royce's North American defense aerospace division. The company is spending $600 million to upgrade its facilities here. It employs 4,000 people in the area. In many ways, Indiana is a trade success story. Its transportation and life sciences companies compete around the world. At the same time, many factories have fled for low-wage countries, or they employ fewer people because of automation and productivity gains. Indiana had 672,000 manufacturing jobs in 2000. Today, it has about a half-million. Tim Slaper is an economist with the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana University. TIM SLAPER: Even while the economy was growing, both overall in the country as well as the state, we were losing a lot of manufacturing jobs. ZARROLI: The most notorious departure was Carrier's recent decision to move one of its plants to Mexico, which was harshly criticized by Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders. Slaper says many of the manufacturing jobs that remain are harder to get because they were require a lot more training. SLAPER: If you compare life back in the '40s and the '50s, where you could even drop out of high school, walk down the road and get a job at the GM plant in Muncie - that kind of job just doesn't exist anymore. ZARROLI: The job losses have helped make Indiana fertile ground for a protectionist message. Columbus is a small, heavily Republican city south of Indianapolis. It's dominated by Cummins, the Fortune 500 company that sells diesel engines around the world. But it isn't hard to find people who see trade as a bad word. Matt Coy has been watching Trump on TV and at 47, he's decided to vote for the first time. MATT COY: I've lost three factory jobs in the last 10 years to go to China or to go to Mexico or to go somewhere out of the country. We're losing our jobs to everybody else. We need them back. I think he can do it. ZARROLI: Rosalie Barnhill, a retired secretary, is voting for Trump, too. ROSALIE BARNHILL: There's too many jobs and manufacturers that go out of our country, and there's too much coming in. I mean, this is a free country, anybody can come in it, but we have had an excess that puts our people out of work. ZARROLI: Those aren't necessarily majority opinions. Russell Poling is an engineer at Cummins. He says the U. S. has to be able to compete globally, and he's skeptical about talk of tariffs and trade wars. RUSSELL POLING: If we're trying to export, we can't cut off imports, because that's what some people would like to see - we don't import anything, but we ship everything out. Well, you can't do that because nobody will take it. ZARROLI: But even Poling says trade has to be balanced, and he's not sure it is these days. Indiana may have companies that compete globally, but in places like Columbus there's an uneasy sense that too many people have been left behind, and that's likely to sway some votes in tomorrow's primary.

Today, it has about a half-million. Tim Slaper is an economist with the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana University. TIM SLAPER: Even while the economy was growing, both overall in the country as well as the state, we were losing a lot of manufacturing jobs. ZARROLI: The most notorious departure was Carrier's recent decision to move one of its plants to Mexico, which was harshly criticized by Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders. Slaper says many of the manufacturing jobs that remain are harder to get because they were require a lot more training. SLAPER: If you compare life back in the '40s and the '50s, where you could even drop out of high school, walk down the road and get a job at the GM plant in Muncie - that kind of job just doesn't exist anymore. ZARROLI: The job losses have helped make Indiana fertile ground for a protectionist message. Columbus is a small, heavily Republican city south of Indianapolis. It's dominated by Cummins, the Fortune 500 company that sells diesel engines around the world. But it isn't hard to find people who see trade as a bad word. Matt Coy has been watching Trump on TV and at 47, he's decided to vote for the first time. MATT COY: I've lost three factory jobs in the last 10 years to go to China or to go to Mexico or to go somewhere out of the country. We're losing our jobs to everybody else. We need them back. I think he can do it. ZARROLI: Rosalie Barnhill, a retired secretary, is voting for Trump, too. ROSALIE BARNHILL: There's too many jobs and manufacturers that go out of our country, and there's too much coming in. I mean, this is a free country, anybody can come in it, but we have had an excess that puts our people out of work. ZARROLI: Those aren't necessarily majority opinions. Russell Poling is an engineer at Cummins. He says the U. S. has to be able to compete globally, and he's skeptical about talk of tariffs and trade wars. RUSSELL POLING: If we're trying to export, we can't cut off imports, because that's what some people would like to see - we don't import anything, but we ship everything out. Well, you can't do that because nobody will take it. ZARROLI: But even Poling says trade has to be balanced, and he's not sure it is these days. Indiana may have companies that compete globally, but in places like Columbus there's an uneasy sense that too many people have been left behind, and that's likely to sway some votes in tomorrow's primary.

The island has defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the third time in less than a year. To explain what this means for the island, we're joined by NPR national editor Luis Clemens. Hi, Luis. LUIS CLEMENS, BYLINE: Good to be here. SIEGEL: And first explain what did not happen today. CLEMENS: Bottom line - bond holders of Puerto Rican debt didn't get paid. And we're talking about owners of debt to the tune of over $400 million. That didn't happen because Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla last night announced moratorium. He said Puerto Rico cannot afford to make these kinds of payments. Fact is Puerto Rico's, in effect, plain, flat broke. The government owes $72 billion in debt. By comparison, when Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, it owed approximately between $18 and $20 billion in debt. SIEGEL: Well, what happens next? CLEMENS: Crystal ball time, I think. Look; first off, I think the key to understanding why this is so tricky is that Puerto Rico, unlike Detroit, unlike other cities, other counties on the mainland, does not, by law, have the option of filing for bankruptcy. It is explicitly prohibited from doing so. And because Puerto Rico cannot file for bankruptcy, Puerto Rico's governor has been lobbying Congress, the U. S. Treasury Department to come up with a plan that would allow for the orderly settlement of debts while still enable the routine operations of government on an island where 45 percent of the population lives in poverty. SIEGEL: Well, let's talk about today's default. It's not the first. Is it likely to be the last? CLEMENS: It's not likely to be the last. And when we talk about the significance of today's default - look; it's not good, but there may be a silver lining here to what is obviously bad news for creditors. Last night's announcement by the governor was followed by an announcement by the president of the island's Development Bank, Melba Acosta. She said, we have the outlines of a potential framework deal here with investors, and those investors today announced that they would hold off on the legal action. What is big on the horizon, looms large, is come July 1, $1. 9 billion more is due. SIEGEL: What's happening in Congress? Do lawmakers show much willingness to help Puerto Rico? CLEMENS: You know, I think the first thing you have to consider in answering that question and for members of Congress to decide how much they put into this issue is - Puerto Rico has no representation, no voting representation in Congress. There are no senators. There's a nonvoting representative in Congress. So members of Congress have to decide how much political capital they are willing to expend on the island. And to date, there have been lots of discussions between the Natural Resources Committee, the Speaker's Office, Treasury Department. We don't have a resolution yet. SIEGEL: And if Puerto Rico doesn't get help from Congress and it defaults on July 1, what happens then? CLEMENS: Barring a deal with creditors, it's going to be a mess because this government Development Bank that I was referring to funds everything from credit unions on the island to highways to a range of activities. Without it, the island will be hard-pressed to continue functioning normally. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Luis Clemens. Luis, thanks. CLEMENS: Thank you.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. If you live or work in a city, sitting in traffic is probably a big part of your life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: About 15, the Lincoln about 20 to 30 out. On the inbound side, we got about a 20-minute delay. VEDANTAM: You're in Washington, D. C. We take perverse pride in having some of the worst traffic in the United States. But on a global scale, D. C. has nothing on London or Istanbul, Rio or Mexico City. On today's episode, we're going to explore all kinds of interventions that can make traffic better. We're also going to look at the interventions that are supposed to make traffic better but don't. DANIEL PINK, BYLINE: I feel like we should put together the international journal of unintended consequences. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . And send them to lawmakers all over the planet. VEDANTAM: Before we get there, we want to take you on a quick trip around some of the world's most congested cities. Producer Maggie Penman reached to NPR correspondents stationed in Asia, Africa and Europe. She's also going to tell us about a little traffic culture clash of her own. MAGGIE PENMAN, BYLINE: So a few years ago, I'm out in LA for a couple of days for work. I'm driving a rented car, and I come up to a busy intersection, and I'm trying to turn left. I have my blinker on, I'm in the left-hand turn lane, and the light is green. But there is still tons of cars coming through the intersection. So I patiently sit there waiting my turn, and the light turns yellow, and there's still cars coming through the intersection. And then the light turns red. I think, OK, I'll just wait until the light turns green again, big mistake. The cars behind me start honking like crazy. I can see the guy in my rearview mirror, and he's losing it, yelling, hitting his steering wheel in frustration. When the light does turn green again, I'm now determined to make this left turn. And the guy behind me turns, too, and then passes me immediately, yelling out his window and flipping me off. At the next intersection, the woman who was behind him pulls up next to me and signals for me to roll my window down. And she's this kind-looking lady, probably about my mother's age. And I thought she was going to commiserate with me about how crazy that guy was. But no, then she starts yelling at me, too. Why didn't you go? Were you texting? What's wrong with you? So I get to the NPR West office, and I'm very shaken up, and I describe this experience to a couple of my colleagues who live and work in LA, and they're both like, oh, yeah, you probably should have gone. AREZOU REZVANI, BYLINE: So we confirmed for you that you are indeed crazy. At least in LA you are. PENMAN: That's Arezou Rezvani, an editor at Morning Edition who works out of NPR's LA bureau. She was one of the people I was meeting that day, and I recently called her up to try and get some insight about why my style of driving was so frustrating to LA drivers. REZVANI: You have to kind of float in the middle of an intersection when you want to make a left or right turn. You got to wait for the cars on coming traffic to, you know, finish up, and sometimes that means making that turn on a red. PENMAN: So wait, I was supposed to run the red light. REZVANI: By the book, that's illegal, right? But there's just a new normal that is introduced in cities like Los Angeles, and you've just kind of got to go with the flow. PENMAN: I was really curious about this new normal that Arezou was talking about, and I wondered whether other cities had unspoken rules or conventions, too. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: When you come to a light and it turns green, the automatic thing to do if you want to take a left turn is to immediately rush and take a left across three or four lanes of traffic. PENMAN: The first person I thought to ask was Frank Langfitt, who, in addition to being NPR's correspondent based in Shanghai, has also occasionally driven a taxi around the city to find stories. LANGFITT: It's like being in a game where anything can come at you at any time from any angle. So a stop sign, a light is not entirely relevant but not very relevant. So when I go through intersections, I look right. I look left. I look right again. PENMAN: The norm in Shanghai is that traffic laws are more like suggestions. LANGFITT: Here in Shanghai, there is not a lot of enforcement. And I'm amazed when I get a ticket. I was pulled over a while ago for being in the wrong turn lane, which was just kind of comical considering all the things that the cops allow people to do here. PENMAN: But considering all of this, I was shocked when Frank told me about another norm. There's almost no road rage. LANGFITT: As long as the cars never touch, people just let it go. And I think it's - maybe it's partly a function. I don't understand all of this, even though I've been here a long time. It may be a function that this is such a crowded country, especially these big cities on the East Coast, that if you are going to get angry about this stuff, you'd just have a heart attack. PENMAN: In fact, he said. . . LANGFITT: I'm the only one who has road rage. (Unintelligible). I'm, like, the only guy in the city who has road rage. PENMAN: I also talked to NPR's correspondent in Nairobi, Greg Warner, and he told me Nairobi is one of the most polite cities he's ever lived in. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: For instance, nobody cuts in line. PENMAN: But when it comes to driving, Greg says, all that changes. One of the main features of driving in Nairobi, according to Greg, is that there are very few traffic lights. WARNER: There are occasionally, like, a random traffic light you'll see, but nobody actually pays attention to it. It has no actual meaning. It just turns green and red and for no particular reason. PENMAN: So how do people know when to go? WARNER: It's all convention. And so in this situation, what I would think people would do is a kind of honor system. Like, OK, yeah, you went. OK, now let me go. That lane hasn't gone for a while. Like, it's just a kind of understanding, but it's actually just a complete free for all. Everybody's trying to go at once. And every four-lane intersection is like a gridlock. And it's not just a gridlock where, you know, some cars will kind of inch forward, but it's like a twisted knot where I'm behind your bumper, and they're behind their bumper. And it's like this interlocked, you know, kind of origami or whatever. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PENMAN: I also talked to Rich Preston, NPR's producer in London, and the primary feature of driving in the UK is, of course, that you drive on the left. RICH PRESTON, BYLINE: And as the London producer dealing with visiting American correspondents, I see this a lot is visitors to the United Kingdom stepping out into the road not looking down the road the right way. PENMAN: Rich travels around for work and is pretty accustomed to switching sides and driving on the right. But occasionally, that rule of thumb gets him into trouble. PRESTON: There's that mentality of, oh, I'm in another country. I'm going to have to drive on the right-hand side. I started driving on the right-hand side of the road in Ireland, even though I should have been sticking on the left. PENMAN: And even when he's back home in London, Rich says driving can be pretty scary. PRESTON: Because the thing about London is it's such an old city, it's really hard to make more space for all the people that are here. PENMAN: Rich mostly cycles around the city these days, but he can still be found honking at drivers. PRESTON: I actually bought a horn for my bike, which is this small thing that clips onto the handlebars. And it's an kind of electronic horn, and it's about 140 decibels, and it saved my life on so many occasions, I can guarantee it. PENMAN: I asked Rich to collect some sound of his commute home yesterday, so I'm going to leave you on this somewhat shrill note. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN)VEDANTAM: All right, I hope you made it home safely. That's HIDDEN BRAIN producer Maggie Penman. After a short break, Dan Pink is going to be back on the show to play a round of Stopwatch Science with me. We're going to tell you about interesting social science research on what works and doesn't work to fix traffic congestion. PINK: They found, even controlling for population growth, that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Back now for a round of Stopwatch Science, I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined as always by Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will drown us out with music just like they do at the Oscars. Our topic today is traffic. You hate it. You deal with it. Maybe you are even in it. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Right now. Today, we're going to explore what works and what doesn't work in easing congestion and improving traffic safety. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, there's one easy, if expensive, solution, and that's just to build more roads, right? It makes sense. Well, maybe not. Two economists writing in the American Economic Review analyzed two decades worth of data on U. S. commuting times and road construction. They found even controlling for population growth that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. Now, what's going on here? Even though this paper is a complex bear of statistical analysis, the core explanation is simple, supply and demand. When we build roads, we increase the supply of driving opportunities. Increasing the supply of something generally reduces its price. But driving, it turns out, is extremely responsive to price changes. The lower price, that is more room on the roads, increases demand again. More individuals and commercial truckers now want to drive, and they re-congest the roads. Economists call it the fundamental law of highway congestion. More roads cause more traffic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: Unfortunately, policymakers ignore the law, and the result is futility. VEDANTAM: So I'm guessing the solution to this is more public transit. PINK: You would think. But what the research also shows is that adding public transportation also increases congestion for the exact same reason. It lowers the price of driving, driving responds to price changes, more people then get on the roads. VEDANTAM: So more public transit doesn't help. More roads don't help. We just have to resign ourselves to traffic jams. PINK: Well, what we have to do is I think we have to start thinking like economists and realize how much driving depends on price. And so the best thing to do is something that is deeply, politically unpopular, which is to raise the price of driving perhaps through congestion charges or higher tolls. VEDANTAM: I think Dan Pink just declared for president. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . And I suspect he's not going to win. PINK: No, I don't think so, but maybe you can win, Shankar. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . On your next 60 seconds, which begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when you enact laws or make policies that affect human beings, it's often easy to forget that you're dealing with a dynamic system, which is exactly what you were just talking about, Dan. PINK: Yes. VEDANTAM: People adapt to new rules often in ways that policymakers don't anticipate. In the late 1980s, Mexico City was dealing with a pollution problem. Lawmakers said, let's pass a new law. They banned drivers from the road one day each week. The day you were not allowed to drive was calculated based on the last digits of your car license plate number. Boom, one simple law, 20 percent fewer cars on the road each day, right? PINK: What could go wrong? VEDANTAM: Exactly. Lucas Davis at the University of Michigan finds that pollution did not decline as a result of the measure in Mexico City. Why? Drivers went out and bought more cars. PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: If I can't drive my Toyota on Mondays. . . PINK: Oh, yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . I'm going to drive my Chevy instead. Even worse, the law triggered an increase in older, more polluting cars perhaps because buying a new car is expensive, so drivers bought an old gas-guzzling clunker to drive the one day of the week they could not use their regular car. I feel that lawmakers around the world should be asked to sign the Hippocratic Oath, Dan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: First, do no harm. PINK: Yes, exactly right. I feel like we should put together the international journal of unintended consequences. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . And send them to lawmakers all over the planet. . . VEDANTAM: Indeed. PINK: . . . Because that's what this is. VEDANTAM: Indeed. Now hoping that the consequences of the next 60 seconds are predictable. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Dan, your time starts now. PINK: We all know traffic exhaust and air pollution are harmful, but what about traffic noise? Is it a health hazard or just an annoyance? A team of British researchers looked at data on 8. 6 million people in neighborhoods across London. Then they analyzed their exposure to daytime and nighttime traffic noise and compared that to a range of health data. What they found, even after controlling for race, sex, air pollution levels, socioeconomic status and other factors, was sobering. Adults exposed to long-term daytime road traffic noise had lower life expectancies and were more likely to be admitted to the hospital for strokes than people living in quieter areas. This was especially true for elderly residents. Now the researchers found only a correlation, and the effect wasn't huge. But other evidence has shown that constantly being around loud traffic triggers stress hormones, which are linked to hypertension and occasionally death. Bottom line, that racket you here in certain areas of big cities - honking, idling, revving - maybe harming people who aren't even in the cars. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: So interesting, Dan. Is it possible that this is being driven just by the fact that you have more noise pollution in urban areas and there may be other factors in urban areas that increase the mortality rate? PINK: Well, possibly, but they actually did a good job of controlling for a lot of that. They divided up the city into census tracts and actually compared census tracts to each other. And the census tracts that had more noise had worse health outcomes, again, even after you control for the things we know drive health outcomes, especially socioeconomic status. So there was something about noise that seemed to be producing these ill effects. So let me turn it over to you for your 60 seconds, but I'd like you in light of the study to do it very quietly. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, so we've heard that noise can be bad for you, but can making noise also save your life? James Habyarimana and William Jack at Georgetown University analyzed two interventions in Kenya to improve traffic safety. The government passed a set of laws to limit unsafe driving among many bus drivers. These are vans that hold a dozen passengers. They are private versions of public transit. The laws turned out to have very little effect on road safety. What worked was a second initiative where passengers on the minibuses were encouraged to, quote, \"heckle and chide. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Drivers for unsafe driving. \"VEDANTAM: Stickers on the buses said, don't just sit there. Stand up. Speak up. PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: When consumers were encouraged to make some noise, driver behavior improved radically, and many bus crashes dropped by at least 50 percent. Now we don't know what exactly drove this. Maybe people spoke up. Maybe the driver was afraid people would speak up. Whatever it was, it worked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PINK: That is extraordinary. And I also think that we should rename this show Heckle and Chide. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You can be Heckle. I can be Chide. But I - you know, I actually think a lot of this goes, you know, shows power to the people. VEDANTAM: Yeah, can I be Dr. Heckle and can you be Mr. Chide? PINK: Certainly. (LAUGHTER)VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Building new roads can lead to more congestion, and banning people from driving can increase pollution. Traffic noise is not just unpleasant. It can have health consequences. Finally, before you pass a new law to solve a problem, try to empower the people with the problem to fix it themselves. Dan, thanks for joining me on Stopwatch Science. PINK: My pleasure. I have to get back in my car now.

You got to wait for the cars on coming traffic to, you know, finish up, and sometimes that means making that turn on a red. PENMAN: So wait, I was supposed to run the red light. REZVANI: By the book, that's illegal, right? But there's just a new normal that is introduced in cities like Los Angeles, and you've just kind of got to go with the flow. PENMAN: I was really curious about this new normal that Arezou was talking about, and I wondered whether other cities had unspoken rules or conventions, too. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: When you come to a light and it turns green, the automatic thing to do if you want to take a left turn is to immediately rush and take a left across three or four lanes of traffic. PENMAN: The first person I thought to ask was Frank Langfitt, who, in addition to being NPR's correspondent based in Shanghai, has also occasionally driven a taxi around the city to find stories. LANGFITT: It's like being in a game where anything can come at you at any time from any angle. So a stop sign, a light is not entirely relevant but not very relevant. So when I go through intersections, I look right. I look left. I look right again. PENMAN: The norm in Shanghai is that traffic laws are more like suggestions. LANGFITT: Here in Shanghai, there is not a lot of enforcement. And I'm amazed when I get a ticket. I was pulled over a while ago for being in the wrong turn lane, which was just kind of comical considering all the things that the cops allow people to do here. PENMAN: But considering all of this, I was shocked when Frank told me about another norm. There's almost no road rage. LANGFITT: As long as the cars never touch, people just let it go. And I think it's - maybe it's partly a function. I don't understand all of this, even though I've been here a long time. It may be a function that this is such a crowded country, especially these big cities on the East Coast, that if you are going to get angry about this stuff, you'd just have a heart attack. PENMAN: In fact, he said. . . LANGFITT: I'm the only one who has road rage. (Unintelligible). I'm, like, the only guy in the city who has road rage. PENMAN: I also talked to NPR's correspondent in Nairobi, Greg Warner, and he told me Nairobi is one of the most polite cities he's ever lived in. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: For instance, nobody cuts in line. PENMAN: But when it comes to driving, Greg says, all that changes. One of the main features of driving in Nairobi, according to Greg, is that there are very few traffic lights. WARNER: There are occasionally, like, a random traffic light you'll see, but nobody actually pays attention to it. It has no actual meaning. It just turns green and red and for no particular reason. PENMAN: So how do people know when to go? WARNER: It's all convention. And so in this situation, what I would think people would do is a kind of honor system. Like, OK, yeah, you went. OK, now let me go. That lane hasn't gone for a while. Like, it's just a kind of understanding, but it's actually just a complete free for all. Everybody's trying to go at once. And every four-lane intersection is like a gridlock. And it's not just a gridlock where, you know, some cars will kind of inch forward, but it's like a twisted knot where I'm behind your bumper, and they're behind their bumper. And it's like this interlocked, you know, kind of origami or whatever. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PENMAN: I also talked to Rich Preston, NPR's producer in London, and the primary feature of driving in the UK is, of course, that you drive on the left. RICH PRESTON, BYLINE: And as the London producer dealing with visiting American correspondents, I see this a lot is visitors to the United Kingdom stepping out into the road not looking down the road the right way. PENMAN: Rich travels around for work and is pretty accustomed to switching sides and driving on the right. But occasionally, that rule of thumb gets him into trouble. PRESTON: There's that mentality of, oh, I'm in another country. I'm going to have to drive on the right-hand side. I started driving on the right-hand side of the road in Ireland, even though I should have been sticking on the left. PENMAN: And even when he's back home in London, Rich says driving can be pretty scary. PRESTON: Because the thing about London is it's such an old city, it's really hard to make more space for all the people that are here. PENMAN: Rich mostly cycles around the city these days, but he can still be found honking at drivers. PRESTON: I actually bought a horn for my bike, which is this small thing that clips onto the handlebars. And it's an kind of electronic horn, and it's about 140 decibels, and it saved my life on so many occasions, I can guarantee it. PENMAN: I asked Rich to collect some sound of his commute home yesterday, so I'm going to leave you on this somewhat shrill note. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN) VEDANTAM: All right, I hope you made it home safely. That's HIDDEN BRAIN producer Maggie Penman. After a short break, Dan Pink is going to be back on the show to play a round of Stopwatch Science with me. We're going to tell you about interesting social science research on what works and doesn't work to fix traffic congestion. PINK: They found, even controlling for population growth, that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. VEDANTAM: Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Back now for a round of Stopwatch Science, I'm Shankar Vedantam. I'm joined as always by Daniel Pink, our senior Stopwatch Science correspondent. Welcome, Dan. PINK: Thank you, Shankar. VEDANTAM: On Stopwatch Science, Dan and I give one another 60 seconds to summarize interesting social science research. As we approach the 60-second mark, our producers will drown us out with music just like they do at the Oscars. Our topic today is traffic. You hate it. You deal with it. Maybe you are even in it. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Right now. Today, we're going to explore what works and what doesn't work in easing congestion and improving traffic safety. Dan, if you're ready, your first 60 seconds starts now. PINK: Well, there's one easy, if expensive, solution, and that's just to build more roads, right? It makes sense. Well, maybe not. Two economists writing in the American Economic Review analyzed two decades worth of data on U. S. commuting times and road construction. They found even controlling for population growth that constructing additional roads led to more traffic congestion, not less. Now, what's going on here? Even though this paper is a complex bear of statistical analysis, the core explanation is simple, supply and demand. When we build roads, we increase the supply of driving opportunities. Increasing the supply of something generally reduces its price. But driving, it turns out, is extremely responsive to price changes. The lower price, that is more room on the roads, increases demand again. More individuals and commercial truckers now want to drive, and they re-congest the roads. Economists call it the fundamental law of highway congestion. More roads cause more traffic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: Unfortunately, policymakers ignore the law, and the result is futility. VEDANTAM: So I'm guessing the solution to this is more public transit. PINK: You would think. But what the research also shows is that adding public transportation also increases congestion for the exact same reason. It lowers the price of driving, driving responds to price changes, more people then get on the roads. VEDANTAM: So more public transit doesn't help. More roads don't help. We just have to resign ourselves to traffic jams. PINK: Well, what we have to do is I think we have to start thinking like economists and realize how much driving depends on price. And so the best thing to do is something that is deeply, politically unpopular, which is to raise the price of driving perhaps through congestion charges or higher tolls. VEDANTAM: I think Dan Pink just declared for president. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . And I suspect he's not going to win. PINK: No, I don't think so, but maybe you can win, Shankar. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . On your next 60 seconds, which begins right now. VEDANTAM: All right, when you enact laws or make policies that affect human beings, it's often easy to forget that you're dealing with a dynamic system, which is exactly what you were just talking about, Dan. PINK: Yes. VEDANTAM: People adapt to new rules often in ways that policymakers don't anticipate. In the late 1980s, Mexico City was dealing with a pollution problem. Lawmakers said, let's pass a new law. They banned drivers from the road one day each week. The day you were not allowed to drive was calculated based on the last digits of your car license plate number. Boom, one simple law, 20 percent fewer cars on the road each day, right? PINK: What could go wrong? VEDANTAM: Exactly. Lucas Davis at the University of Michigan finds that pollution did not decline as a result of the measure in Mexico City. Why? Drivers went out and bought more cars. PINK: Oh, boy. VEDANTAM: If I can't drive my Toyota on Mondays. . . PINK: Oh, yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . I'm going to drive my Chevy instead. Even worse, the law triggered an increase in older, more polluting cars perhaps because buying a new car is expensive, so drivers bought an old gas-guzzling clunker to drive the one day of the week they could not use their regular car. I feel that lawmakers around the world should be asked to sign the Hippocratic Oath, Dan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: First, do no harm. PINK: Yes, exactly right. I feel like we should put together the international journal of unintended consequences. . . VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: . . . And send them to lawmakers all over the planet. . . VEDANTAM: Indeed. PINK: . . . Because that's what this is. VEDANTAM: Indeed. Now hoping that the consequences of the next 60 seconds are predictable. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Dan, your time starts now. PINK: We all know traffic exhaust and air pollution are harmful, but what about traffic noise? Is it a health hazard or just an annoyance? A team of British researchers looked at data on 8. 6 million people in neighborhoods across London. Then they analyzed their exposure to daytime and nighttime traffic noise and compared that to a range of health data. What they found, even after controlling for race, sex, air pollution levels, socioeconomic status and other factors, was sobering. Adults exposed to long-term daytime road traffic noise had lower life expectancies and were more likely to be admitted to the hospital for strokes than people living in quieter areas. This was especially true for elderly residents. Now the researchers found only a correlation, and the effect wasn't huge. But other evidence has shown that constantly being around loud traffic triggers stress hormones, which are linked to hypertension and occasionally death. Bottom line, that racket you here in certain areas of big cities - honking, idling, revving - maybe harming people who aren't even in the cars. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: So interesting, Dan. Is it possible that this is being driven just by the fact that you have more noise pollution in urban areas and there may be other factors in urban areas that increase the mortality rate? PINK: Well, possibly, but they actually did a good job of controlling for a lot of that. They divided up the city into census tracts and actually compared census tracts to each other. And the census tracts that had more noise had worse health outcomes, again, even after you control for the things we know drive health outcomes, especially socioeconomic status. So there was something about noise that seemed to be producing these ill effects. So let me turn it over to you for your 60 seconds, but I'd like you in light of the study to do it very quietly. VEDANTAM: (Laughter) All right, so we've heard that noise can be bad for you, but can making noise also save your life? James Habyarimana and William Jack at Georgetown University analyzed two interventions in Kenya to improve traffic safety. The government passed a set of laws to limit unsafe driving among many bus drivers. These are vans that hold a dozen passengers. They are private versions of public transit. The laws turned out to have very little effect on road safety. What worked was a second initiative where passengers on the minibuses were encouraged to, quote, \"heckle and chide. . . PINK: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: . . . Drivers for unsafe driving. \" VEDANTAM: Stickers on the buses said, don't just sit there. Stand up. Speak up. PINK: Yeah. VEDANTAM: When consumers were encouraged to make some noise, driver behavior improved radically, and many bus crashes dropped by at least 50 percent. Now we don't know what exactly drove this. Maybe people spoke up. Maybe the driver was afraid people would speak up. Whatever it was, it worked. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PINK: That is extraordinary. And I also think that we should rename this show Heckle and Chide. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). PINK: You can be Heckle. I can be Chide. But I - you know, I actually think a lot of this goes, you know, shows power to the people. VEDANTAM: Yeah, can I be Dr. Heckle and can you be Mr. Chide? PINK: Certainly. (LAUGHTER) VEDANTAM: All right, so there you have it. Building new roads can lead to more congestion, and banning people from driving can increase pollution. Traffic noise is not just unpleasant. It can have health consequences. Finally, before you pass a new law to solve a problem, try to empower the people with the problem to fix it themselves. Dan, thanks for joining me on Stopwatch Science. PINK: My pleasure. I have to get back in my car now.

Because even though a lot of economic indicators suggest the country is on an upswing, a lot of people feel like the recovery isn't helping them. Wages haven't gone up, and some feel like their standard of living has flatlined or even declined. To talk more about this, I'm joined by NPR's Jim Zarroli. He covers economics, and he's been looking into all this. Hi, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: We hear time and again how people don't feel like they're a part of this recovery. How much of that sentiment has to do with the fact that wages haven't gone up? ZARROLI: I think a very big part of it. Wage stagnation is really one of the central issues of our time, I think. Many Americans feel like they're not keeping up. They feel like they're not doing better than their parents did, also that their children won't do as well as they're doing. There are lots and lots of example - really, millions of examples of this. But I'll tell you about a woman I met last week in downtown Indianapolis. Her name is Jennifer Kaiser, and she is 44. She was on her lunch hour. She works as a legal assistant at a law firm. And she has had this job for 10 years, and she's very happy there. JENNIFER KAISER: I love my job (laughter). I really love my job. I just wish I made more (laughter). ZARROLI: Now, Kaiser says she makes a decent salary. She and her husband were able to buy a house in Indianapolis. And for a long time, they took, you know, the occasional cheap vacation with their two kids. But Kaiser says her salary really hasn't gone up over the years. KAISER: I get a raise, but every year it's lower and lower. The past few years, it hasn't even been a raise that's comparable to the cost of living. So it makes it hard. ZARROLI: Now, there's one thing I should point out. Jennifer Kaiser's husband died very recently. He was a mechanic. When he got sick, he lost his job. He left some steep medical bills. And she, Jennifer Kaiser, doesn't know how she's going to pay them. She actually says she's losing her house. So it wasn't easy before, but it is a lot worse now. Now, this story isn't typical, in the sense that her husband died fairly young. But what it does underscore is the fact that, you know, when you live paycheck-to-paycheck and something unexpected happens, it can really be devastating. MARTIN: Yeah, you don't have a buffer. And so even though she suffered this loss, she's still in the same boat as a lot of Americans. The money coming in just isn't enough to meet the demands and the bills and the money that has to go out. ZARROLI: Right. I mean, even before her husband died, she was learning to cut back. I mean, she's very careful with money. She doesn't take trips anymore. You know, she takes public transportation to work. She doesn't have a lot of credit card bills. But at the same time, the bills that she has to pay have been rising. KAISER: My insurance is going up. My groceries are going up. And my utilities are going up. Yet, I'm really not bringing in the money to be even with all of that, so it's not easy. ZARROLI: One of the things she told me is she has a good retirement plan at work, but she's not putting as much money into it as she would like to because she has to concentrate on, you know, paying the bills that she has to pay now. MARTIN: Yeah. So how typical is Jennifer Kaiser's story? ZARROLI: Well, she says it isn't unusual at all. KAISER: For me and a majority of the people I know, it's a paycheck-to-paycheck society. It just - that's what it is, and it stinks. You know, when my mom was my age, you know, she knew lots of women that were stay-at-home mothers. I don't - I can count on one hand how many people I know because you can't afford to do that. MARTIN: So that's one example of how wage stagnation can affect someone at the micro level, right? What evidence is out there, Jim, that shows how broad this is? ZARROLI: There's a lot of statistical evidence about this. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says wages and compensation for the bottom four fifths of workers were essentially flat between 2007 and 2014. And if you go back further than that, decades even, you can see that, you know, wages have been growing, but not very much. And since the financial crisis, they've pretty much been flat. MARTIN: So here's a big question. How come? ZARROLI: Well, this is a long-term trend. And like a lot of long-term trends, it's got a number of complex causes. I spoke to Larry Mishel who's a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute which is a prolabor think tank. Here's what he says. LARRY MISHEL: There's been a series of decisions that basically all work to undercut the ability of a typical worker to be able to get a better deal from his or her boss. ZARROLI: Now, he would say, you know, the weakening of labor unions is a factor, the failure to raise the federal minimum wage. And then a big factor is health care costs. You know, they've gone up a lot, so employers have found themselves paying more for insurance and other benefits which means they've been less inclined to raise wages. Here's Larry Mishel again. MISHEL: You know, firms are besieged by pressure from global competition and from other employers. They don't want to step out and provide higher wages until they have to. ZARROLI: Now, it's important to remember here that the United States is not the only place where this is happening. Wage stagnation is happening in other highly developed economies in Europe and Japan. And this suggests that, you know, there are structural factors tied, perhaps to globalization, that are keeping wages from going up. MARTIN: Which, of course, plays right into what some of the candidates have been saying on the campaign trail. ZARROLI: Well, they're talking about it a lot. I mean, this could really be the first election where this issue actually plays a dominant role. It's a big part of Donald Trump's rhetoric. You know, he says people are falling behind, jobs are leaving. It's also a really big part of Bernie Sanders's campaign. You could almost say it's the centerpiece. Now, when you get to real policy ideas, there aren't a lot of specifics. Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton want to raise the federal minimum wage. But, you know, there's no silver bullet that's going to solve this. This is something that's really been happening gradually over decades. And it reflects a lot of big changes in the economy. And it will probably take a lot of slow, gradual changes in policy to address it. And that's going to be, you know, a steep mountain for any president to try to climb. MARTIN: NPR's Jim Zarroli - thanks so much, Jim. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

U. S. employers added just 160,000 jobs in April. That is well below the average of the last 12 months. President Obama talked about the slowdown during a White House news conference this afternoon. The president's own job will be coming open in about eight months, and he also weighed in on the spirited contest to replace him. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Today's report from the Labor Department shows a steady downshift in the pace of hiring over the last three months, even as wages continue to grow. President Obama says the U. S. economy still faces headwinds from slow growth elsewhere around the world. And he argued, not for the first time, that Congress could help with stepped up spending on public works and a vote to raise the federal minimum wage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is something that would not only help those individuals who are getting a bigger paycheck, but it also means they're spending more, and that would be a boost to business. HORSLEY: The president's been making this argument for years, but he's yet to persuade congressional Republicans. Obama also asked lawmakers for help today in cracking down on money laundering and tax evasion. The administration issued its own rule designed to open a window on secretive corporations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: We are requiring banks and other financial institutions to know, verify and report who the real people are behind shell corporations that set up accounts at those institutions. HORSLEY: Officials say the new rule was in the works long before the release of the Panama Papers, millions of leaked documents from a single law firm in Central America that shine a spotlight on secret financial dealings. For all the griping about clandestine bank accounts in offshore tax havens, some of the biggest loopholes in financial reporting are right here in the U. S. Shruti Shah, who's vice president of the nonprofit group Transparency International USA, says when shell companies open accounts here, bankers need to understand who really owns, controls and profits from the money. SHRUTI SHAH: One of the problems that was highlighted in the Panama Papers was that often officials named in executive positions or in managerial positions for anonymous companies are figureheads. They don't actually control the entity. HORSLEY: The release of the new bank rule comes just ahead of an anti-corruption summit in London next week. While the president tried to frame his news conference around the economy, most of the questions concerned the presidential race. Obama says despite Hillary Clinton's commanding lead in the Democratic primary, he sees no rush for Bernie Sanders to drop out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Let's let the process play itself out. HORSLEY: Obama says Sanders has done an extraordinary job raising important issues, and he's confident no matter how bitter this year's battle has been, Democrats will be united in November. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Despite the fact that during the course of primaries, everybody starts getting a little chippy - I've been through this, it's natural - sometimes even more with the staffs and supporters than with the candidates themselves. The good news is is that there's a pretty strong consensus within the Democratic Party on the vast majority of issues. HORSLEY: Obama opted not to comment on the latest Twitter controversy sparked by de facto Republican nominee Donald Trump. Yesterday Trump celebrated Cinco de Mayo by tweeting a picture of himself with a large taco bowl under the caption, I love Hispanics. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: As a general rule, I don't pay attention to Mr. Trump's tweets. HORSLEY: Obama's criticized the news media for its blanket, often uncritical coverage of Trump, a man the president wants dismissed as a carnival barker. Today, Obama said the U. S. cannot afford to treat its presidential contest as a mere spectacle or circus. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times, and this is a really serious job. This is not entertainment. This is not a reality show. HORSLEY: Obama urged reporters to give close scrutiny to what all the candidates say, especially proposals that could start a war, upend alliances or break the financial system. The American people have good judgment, he said, as long as they get good information. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   Hiring slowed last month. U. S. employers added just 160,000 jobs in April. That is well below the average of the last 12 months. President Obama talked about the slowdown during a White House news conference this afternoon. The president's own job will be coming open in about eight months, and he also weighed in on the spirited contest to replace him. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Today's report from the Labor Department shows a steady downshift in the pace of hiring over the last three months, even as wages continue to grow. President Obama says the U. S. economy still faces headwinds from slow growth elsewhere around the world. And he argued, not for the first time, that Congress could help with stepped up spending on public works and a vote to raise the federal minimum wage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT OBAMA: This is something that would not only help those individuals who are getting a bigger paycheck, but it also means they're spending more, and that would be a boost to business. HORSLEY: The president's been making this argument for years, but he's yet to persuade congressional Republicans. Obama also asked lawmakers for help today in cracking down on money laundering and tax evasion. The administration issued its own rule designed to open a window on secretive corporations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: We are requiring banks and other financial institutions to know, verify and report who the real people are behind shell corporations that set up accounts at those institutions. HORSLEY: Officials say the new rule was in the works long before the release of the Panama Papers, millions of leaked documents from a single law firm in Central America that shine a spotlight on secret financial dealings. For all the griping about clandestine bank accounts in offshore tax havens, some of the biggest loopholes in financial reporting are right here in the U. S. Shruti Shah, who's vice president of the nonprofit group Transparency International USA, says when shell companies open accounts here, bankers need to understand who really owns, controls and profits from the money. SHRUTI SHAH: One of the problems that was highlighted in the Panama Papers was that often officials named in executive positions or in managerial positions for anonymous companies are figureheads. They don't actually control the entity. HORSLEY: The release of the new bank rule comes just ahead of an anti-corruption summit in London next week. While the president tried to frame his news conference around the economy, most of the questions concerned the presidential race. Obama says despite Hillary Clinton's commanding lead in the Democratic primary, he sees no rush for Bernie Sanders to drop out.

That's the view of some economists who note the job market keeps getting stronger. The employment report due out today is expected to show more improvement. Recent studies say students getting diplomas this month will find companies have more jobs and more money to offer them, which is a very different picture than it was and than it remains for graduates of the Great Recession. Here is Charles Lane of member station WSHU. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: About an hour before I met Mohammed Ahmed, he had sat down to send out resumes. MOHAMMED AHMED: And then within I'd say about 20 minutes to a half-hour, I got a phone call. And I scheduled an interview for tomorrow. LANE: Ahmed is feeling pretty confident about his future. He's finishing up his MBA at Stony Brook University in New York. His bachelors is in pharmacology. But Ahmed's older sister also got her MBA with a medicine background, except she graduated just as the recession was settling in. AHMED: You know, she would constantly be applying, wouldn't be able to hear back. And if she did hear back, it was for positions that she wasn't interested in. LANE: Following the recession, unemployment for those with a college degree was about 5 percent. This year, it's been half of that. A recent poll paid for by the job website CareerBuilder found that more companies will be filling positions with recent grads. And 37 percent of those companies will be increasing starting salary. A similar survey comes from the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Research director Andrea Koncz says companies are seeking the young and the college educated. ANDREA KONCZ: They continue to increase hiring knowing that there are retirements. There's open positions to fill. And it's important to keep new college graduates in their talent pipelines. LANE: The most in-demand jobs involve technology, business and engineering. And that underscores how the labor market is changing. Nariman Behravesh is an economist with IHS. He says the so-called education premium is getting bigger. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: Which is to to say, the premium that skilled workers and educated workers get over and above what unskilled workers get, that has risen and probably will continue to rise. LANE: But here's a cruel twist. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, says its data show it can be tough to get a good job even with a college education if you were born at the wrong time. Here's senior economist Elise Gould. ELISE GOULD: I mean, just for the luck of when you were born and when you graduated from high school or graduated from college or the lack of luck, I should say, it means that your lifetime earnings are going to suffer. LANE: Graduating into a recession means workers have to take lesser jobs and may have more holes in their resume. Gould worries that as employers start adding jobs, they will look not to the grads of previous years but to new graduates without the scars of the recession. For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane.

I'm Michel Martin. We're going to start the program today by taking a look at housing in this country. In a few minutes we're going to speak with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Julian Castro, about a controversial new directive he's laid down that's intended to help people with criminal records get access to housing. But first we want to take a look at an interesting trend affecting millennials and other first-time home buyers. Now, you might assume that more young people are in a better financial position to join the ranks of home owners - employment is up, mortgage interest rates remain low. It's even a lot cheaper to fill up your gas tank. So, as we said, you might assume it's smooth sailing for people who've been shut out of the market. Only there's a big problem if you live in one of several major metropolitan areas nationwide. There are few houses available for the first-time buyer in cities like Dallas, Denver, Seattle and Atlanta. There isn't a lot of inventory and the houses that are coming on the market are being snapped up or are the subject of bidding wars. In some cases, this housing crunch is happening in cities that did not go through the housing boom and bust just a decade ago. We wanted to find out what's going on so we called one of the big providers of housing data Zillow. Skylar Olsen is a senior economist at Zillow, and she's with us now via Skype. Thank you so much for joining us. SKYLAR OLSEN: Yeah, thank you for having me. MARTIN: So, what is the big picture here? Is this a situation where there just isn't any inventory? I mean, we keep hearing that there was this big wave of foreclosures. We know that there are - you know, we've all seen the pictures of kind of empty houses just waiting for somebody to buy them, looking, you know, sad and forlorn. So why is it that there's so little inventory in these areas? OLSEN: Inventory is extraordinarily low, especially relative to the time where it felt abundant because we had a lot of distress housing coming out on the market. So housing is about maybe half as available as it was five years ago. But, you know, we were talking about tight inventory last year. And this year, it's 6 percent lower still. If I'm going to target entry-level housing - so, you know, ones that first-time buyers or millennials might be more interested in or the level that they can actually afford, right? It's 10 percent lower than last year. MARTIN: You know, I ask you about inventories, if this was solely a supply problem. But I wonder whether it's also an affordability problem. For example, I was just looking at some data from RealtyTrac, which provides data and it said that three-quarters of real estate markets in U. S. counties larger than 100,000 people are less affordable now than a year ago and that home prices have outpaced wage growth in 94 percent of those counties since home prices hit bottom in each of those locations. So what I was wondering is is it that home prices are escalating faster than people's wages? OLSEN: You know, our numbers show very similar things. But flip it on its head, you know, kind of look at your other option when you're renting as well and we can tell the same story. So rents have far outpaced the growth of income as well, particularly in the last two years. So let's say you're a millennial trying to save for a down payment. You know, it's very difficult to do so when you're paying such a large rent burden to actually build the down payment that you need to compete in a competitive market where someone might be able to put, you know, 20 percent or even all cash down on homes. And in some markets, mortgages are more expensive now than they were in pre-bubble years despite the fact that interest rates are at record lows over the past six years. MARTIN: And why is that? OLSEN: It's just home values have grown so, so quickly. So those markets are places like San Francisco, San Jose and LA. MARTIN: Well, who can afford all these houses then? Is this a phenomenon of places with a bubble? Like, for example, there are sort of unique factors like, for example, in Silicon Valley, where wages are quite high. OLSEN: You know, nationally when we hear, you know, or ask questions, you know, are we in a bubble? Not nationally, no. But if I target places where home values have increased so quickly like the ones we just mentioned, you know, we are getting to a point where when interest rates rise, houses are going to feel even more prohibitively expensive. But it's always important to remember, you know, the metros that we're talking about there - San Francisco, San Jose, L. A. , you know, we can add other metros that have also kind of reached those limits, right, where affordability is starting to become kind of a big issue. These are all great job centers. MARTIN: You're in Seattle. So is Seattle one of those hot markets? OLSEN: Yeah. MARTIN: OK. OLSEN: Seattle is definitely one of those hot markets. MARTIN: Yeah, for all kinds of reasons. And so can you give me an example of what first-time homebuyer would be facing where you live? OLSEN: In the Seattle metropolitan area, if I'm talking entry-level homes, homes are 30 percent less available this year than last year. That's basically cuts the available housing for a millennial buyer by third, which is incredibly tough when you're also in a place that's experiencing record high population growth. So the demand for these places is extraordinary. And you're facing four, five, six bids to win a home, you might actually have to place bids on several homes before you win. MARTIN: That's Skylar Olsen, senior economist with Zillow. Thank you so much for joining us. OLSEN: Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

At this point, virtually all the countries in the world have agreed to reduce carbon emissions to try to slow climate change. Now the challenge is to implement that deal. And when I asked the top U. S. envoy on climate change where the challenge is biggest, Todd Stern told me one country now has a steeper hill to climb than any other. TODD STERN: There's no country probably with a bigger challenge looking at the number of people, the level of their economic growth, the number of people who don't have access to electricity. SHAPIRO: Want to guess which country he's talking about? Here's a clue - sounds from a market in one of this country's biggest cities. (CROSSTALK)SHAPIRO: So which country is this? ANJALI JAISWAL: India has a lot of challenges and a lot of opportunities. SHAPIRO: That's Anjali Jaiswal from the Natural Resources Defense Council. JAISWAL: What's happening in India is really transformational. It's unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We would like to be the first to welcome you to New Delhi, India. SHAPIRO: To see this transformation up close, a producer, a photographer and I flew to the biggest democracy in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So we do ask that you please remain comfortably seated. SHAPIRO: We've brought back stories looking at some of the ways people are managing the tension between development and climate change. And today we want to answer a more basic question. Why India? When lots of developing countries are struggling with these challenges, what makes India unique, and what can it tell us about the challenges around climate change that the whole world faces? ANTHONY LEISEROWITZ: First and perhaps most importantly, India's now the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. SHAPIRO: This is Anthony Leiserowitz. He directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. He says even though India is only behind the U. S. and China in total carbon emissions, it's just getting started. Per Capita emissions are still really low. Most people are poor and just don't have a big carbon footprint. LEISEROWITZ: Seventy-six percent of Indians live on less than $2 a day. I mean, Americans can't imagine living on $2 a day, and yet, 76 percent of this population which is right around a billion people right now are living on that kind of income. SHAPIRO: In India, 400 million people don't have reliable electricity. That's more than the entire population of the United States. And India has ambitious goals to give its people think that Americans take for granted like refrigerators or cars or even something as basic as lighting at night. AJAY MATHUR: This means that we need to enhance the energy supply by four to five times what it is now. SHAPIRO: Do you mean provide four to five times as much energy as India is creating right now? MATHUR: Right now. SHAPIRO: Wow. MATHUR: Right. SHAPIRO: This is Ajay Mathur. He is one of India's climate experts who now runs the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. He told me no matter how fast India increases its clean energy like solar and wind, the country will not cut back on coal - in fact, quite the opposite. MATHUR: It will increase. But whereas the amount of coal that we use will probably double between now and 2030, the amount of renewables will probably go up by an order of 10. SHAPIRO: So here's the answer to that question, why India? If India can find a sustainable way to develop, that could be a template for the rest of the world. Every highly developed country in history has gotten where it is in an unsustainable way - by cutting down trees, pumping carbon into the atmosphere. And if the developing world today does the same thing, this could lead to disaster, and the impacts of climate change would hit people in India harder than almost anywhere else. RICHARD HEWSTON: India has the highest number of people exposed to natural hazards. SHAPIRO: Richard Hewston is with a global risk assessment firm call Verisk Maplecroft. His company looked at which countries around the world are most vulnerable to storms, flooding and other acts of nature, and India was at the top of the list - No. 1 in the world. HEWSTON: Tropical cyclones are likely to become more intense. We're also seeing that climate change is going to have an impact on the monsoon. SHAPIRO: That means more floods for some people in India and more droughts for others. To of India's biggest cities, New Delhi and Calcutta, are on the top 10 list of global cities most vulnerable to natural hazards. We will visit both Delhi and Calcutta over the next two weeks. And here are some of the people we'll meet. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). SHAPIRO: On a small island, a man whose home has already been washed away by rising tides. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Through interpreter) This is my motherland, so I can't abandon it. SHAPIRO: In the world's largest mangrove forest, we'll meet people who are figuring out how to share a shrinking landscape with Bengal Tigers. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Many times I have seen the tiger. SHAPIRO: And in India's capital where the air is more polluted than any city on Earth, we'll meet salesmen who are trying to profit off the dirty air. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: We have vegan leather masks, also, for the bikers. SHAPIRO: Vegan leather masks? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Yeah, for the bikers. SHAPIRO: For the bikers who are also vegans. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Yeah. SHAPIRO: We're chronicling this project on social media with the hashtag #ATCInIndia. You can find us there. Tomorrow we'll meet someone who is trying to shrink the carbon footprint of the dead. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Chanting in foreign language).

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We would like to be the first to welcome you to New Delhi, India. SHAPIRO: To see this transformation up close, a producer, a photographer and I flew to the biggest democracy in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So we do ask that you please remain comfortably seated. SHAPIRO: We've brought back stories looking at some of the ways people are managing the tension between development and climate change. And today we want to answer a more basic question. Why India? When lots of developing countries are struggling with these challenges, what makes India unique, and what can it tell us about the challenges around climate change that the whole world faces? ANTHONY LEISEROWITZ: First and perhaps most importantly, India's now the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. SHAPIRO: This is Anthony Leiserowitz. He directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. He says even though India is only behind the U. S. and China in total carbon emissions, it's just getting started. Per Capita emissions are still really low. Most people are poor and just don't have a big carbon footprint. LEISEROWITZ: Seventy-six percent of Indians live on less than $2 a day. I mean, Americans can't imagine living on $2 a day, and yet, 76 percent of this population which is right around a billion people right now are living on that kind of income. SHAPIRO: In India, 400 million people don't have reliable electricity. That's more than the entire population of the United States. And India has ambitious goals to give its people think that Americans take for granted like refrigerators or cars or even something as basic as lighting at night. AJAY MATHUR: This means that we need to enhance the energy supply by four to five times what it is now. SHAPIRO: Do you mean provide four to five times as much energy as India is creating right now? MATHUR: Right now. SHAPIRO: Wow. MATHUR: Right. SHAPIRO: This is Ajay Mathur. He is one of India's climate experts who now runs the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. He told me no matter how fast India increases its clean energy like solar and wind, the country will not cut back on coal - in fact, quite the opposite. MATHUR: It will increase. But whereas the amount of coal that we use will probably double between now and 2030, the amount of renewables will probably go up by an order of 10. SHAPIRO: So here's the answer to that question, why India? If India can find a sustainable way to develop, that could be a template for the rest of the world. Every highly developed country in history has gotten where it is in an unsustainable way - by cutting down trees, pumping carbon into the atmosphere. And if the developing world today does the same thing, this could lead to disaster, and the impacts of climate change would hit people in India harder than almost anywhere else. RICHARD HEWSTON: India has the highest number of people exposed to natural hazards. SHAPIRO: Richard Hewston is with a global risk assessment firm call Verisk Maplecroft. His company looked at which countries around the world are most vulnerable to storms, flooding and other acts of nature, and India was at the top of the list - No. 1 in the world. HEWSTON: Tropical cyclones are likely to become more intense. We're also seeing that climate change is going to have an impact on the monsoon. SHAPIRO: That means more floods for some people in India and more droughts for others. To of India's biggest cities, New Delhi and Calcutta, are on the top 10 list of global cities most vulnerable to natural hazards. We will visit both Delhi and Calcutta over the next two weeks. And here are some of the people we'll meet. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). SHAPIRO: On a small island, a man whose home has already been washed away by rising tides. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Through interpreter) This is my motherland, so I can't abandon it. SHAPIRO: In the world's largest mangrove forest, we'll meet people who are figuring out how to share a shrinking landscape with Bengal Tigers. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Many times I have seen the tiger. SHAPIRO: And in India's capital where the air is more polluted than any city on Earth, we'll meet salesmen who are trying to profit off the dirty air. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: We have vegan leather masks, also, for the bikers. SHAPIRO: Vegan leather masks? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Yeah, for the bikers. SHAPIRO: For the bikers who are also vegans. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Yeah. SHAPIRO: We're chronicling this project on social media with the hashtag #ATCInIndia. You can find us there. Tomorrow we'll meet someone who is trying to shrink the carbon footprint of the dead.

Congress is debating how and whether to help. And yesterday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew called attention to Puerto Rico's crisis by going there. NPR's Greg Allen was with him. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Centro Medico is the jewel of Puerto Rico's health care system, its largest hospital, with a trauma center and the only neonatal intensive care unit in the Caribbean. While Congress deliberates how to help Puerto Rico, Secretary Lew spent a day on the island assessing the human impact of the crisis. In Centro Medico trauma center, Dr. Juan Azaria was blunt. JUAN AZARIA: We are hanging by a thread now. For us to provide services, we have to let other things not to be paid. ALLEN: Puerto Rico is currently 70 to $80 million behind in Medicaid payments it owes to hospitals and doctors. The funding shortfall has forced hospitals to lay off staff and close entire floors. Nurses and doctors, more than one a day, are leaving the island for better-paying jobs on the mainland. On a tour of Centro Medico, the head of Puerto Rico's health care financing agency, Ricardo Rivera told Lew the system is nearing collapse. RICARDO RIVERA: There are people that ask, well, what's your plan B and plan C? But they are already on their plan W. Yeah, it comes down to funding. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)ALLEN: In the neonatal intensive care unit, about 15 tiny babies attached to wires and monitors lie in cribs and incubators. Dr. Marta Suarez, a pediatric specialist, says delays in payments to suppliers risk holding up dialysis treatments for newborns. Chemotherapy drugs now are only available to the hospital COD, she said, after it sends funds by wire transfer to the supplier. MARTA SUAREZ: A kid needs chemotherapy. I can't - I mean, we have to jump through all these hoops and holes just to get that wire transfer while that kid, which may be anybody's daughter, waiting for their chemotherapy. ALLEN: After touring going the hospital, Lew had a message for members of Congress who may have been waiting to help Puerto Rico until, in his words, it's a moment of crisis. The crisis, he said, is today. JACK LEW: I don't think there's a member of Congress who would find it acceptable for a 5-week old baby to not have access to the medications they need for dialysis. ALLEN: That's how Puerto Rico's debt crisis is playing out on the island. In Washington and the districts of some member of Congress though, a different is being aired. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Tell Congress stop the Washington bailout for Puerto Rico. ALLEN: The group that paid for this ad, the Center for Individual Freedom, doesn't disclose where its money comes from. But the ad is part of a campaign to block a bill under discussion in Congress that would set up a financial control board with the authority to restructure Puerto Rico's debt. One of the campaign's most potent weapon is the use of that word, bailout. Treasury Secretary Lew. LEW: It is not just incorrect. It's deceptive and plain wrong. ALLEN: Lew says Congress has gone to great pains to make sure that not a penny of taxpayer dollars will be part of the bill. Opponents of the bill include an influential group of hedge funds and other creditors who don't like the idea of a control board, preferring to sue in court for repayment, even if it takes years. Lew says that's not in the public interest. LEW: There may be some stakeholders who think the best solution here is for them to defend their interest to the very end. That will destroy Puerto Rico. It will produce worse outcomes for most stakeholders, and it will just destroy life for 3 and half million Americans. ALLEN: After more than a year of struggling to pay its bills, last week, Puerto Rico went over a fiscal cliff, defaulting on a $400 million debt payment. That may encourage Congress to act before the next big deadline. In July, Puerto Rico has a nearly 2 billion debt payment due, and the government says it doesn't have the money.

So we're going to take a few minutes now to talk about one solution that people are trying overseas, which is starting to get attention from American politicians. To tell us about this, I'm joined by NPR's Chris Arnold. He heads up our money and life coverage. Hey, Chris. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: How bad is the problem, before we get to the solution? ARNOLD: Well, as you've probably heard before, the problem is very bad. And one thing that sticks in my mind is I saw a talk that Janet Yellen gave on this. SHAPIRO: She's the chairman of the Federal Reserve. ARNOLD: Yes, exactly. And she was talking about income and equality and other things. But she put up on the wall a chart, and it showed that American families with children, half of those families have almost no assets whatsoever. I mean, just next to nothing. And, you know, it was just very striking. And there are other surveys that you can look at, too, that show that more than a quarter of American workers have saved less than $1,000 for retirement. Not a pretty picture. SHAPIRO: And so those people are going to be - what? - almost entirely dependent on Social Security? ARNOLD: Unless things change, absolutely, and especially the ones that are older and it's too late for them to start saving. As people get older, they are more likely to put aside some money, but there are just lots and lots of people who are finding with Social Security, the savings that they have, it's just not enough. SHAPIRO: So, Chris, you've brought us a personal story that really illustrates this in vivid terms. Tell us about this. ARNOLD: Right, so I went to visit Rissa Sawyer out in Adams, Mass. She's 62 years old. And for financial reasons, she's living with a friend. And it turned out when I got to her front door, she is also living with a big, brown pit bull named Rosco. RISSA SAWYER: Down, Rosco. OK. ARNOLD: Want to smell the microphone, Rosco? (SOUNDBITE OF DOG SNIFFING)ARNOLD: So Rosco, it turned out, was a big sweetheart, and we got him some water. And we sat down to talk. And she was explaining just what it's like to try to live now that she started to collect Social Security. And Sawyer, she has some health problems, she would like to retire, but she's telling me here that she just can't afford to. SAWYER: It's impossible. Social Security doesn't pay me enough to live. My Social Security benefits are only $486 a month. SHAPIRO: How does she live on $486 a month? ARNOLD: Well, I mean, she doesn't. She has a part-time job because of that. But she's in this situation that I think a lot of Americans are in where she worked informal jobs where she wasn't paying a lot into Social Security. And so then you end up getting this very low Social Security payment. So she's working a part-time job at this tourist information center in town and figures she's going to have to work at some job or another for the rest of her life. And her health is getting shaky. SAWYER: It's scary. Every month, the first thing I do when I get my check - my Social Security check - is try and pay the car payment, my care credit for the dentist 'cause the dentist bill was, like, over 10 grand. Day-to-day living - it's like, what am I going to do? What can I afford now? SHAPIRO: Chris, this model of save on your own while you're working if you can, depend on Social Security and retirement, has been the American model for a while now. There are other models out there that you looked at. What are other people trying? ARNOLD: There's something that's happening in the U. K. right now. There's a new law that's being phased in that I think is really, really interesting. So the problem is human beings are just bad at saving on their own. What the U. K. is essentially doing is instead of saying, OK, we're going to leave it up to you to save, you have to choose to save, the government's saying, you know what? You have to choose not the save. They're kind of flipping it around. The government's telling all employers across the country if you don't have a retirement plan for your workers, you have to get one. And then you have to automatically enroll your workers into this plan. I talked to Charlotte Clark. She's the top U. K. official overseeing the program. Here's what she said. CHARLOTTE CLARK: If you're an employer, it doesn't matter what size you are. You know, you could be McDonald's, you could be the BBC or you could be somebody who employs a nanny. ARNOLD: So fast food workers at a minimum wage, just about everybody in the entire country is getting set up with what we call a 401(k) style retirement account. SHAPIRO: Chris, this sounds like a government mandate. And we know from the health care debate that government mandates don't necessarily go over well in American politics. Are people being forced by the government to save? ARNOLD: No, and this is the interesting thing here, too, that this is more of a psychological nudge or a behavioral nudge that for the employer, it's a mandate. But for you, me, a worker, anybody, they can opt out. They can say, no, no, thank you very much. Give me my money back, maybe in an English accent. And then. . . SHAPIRO: (Laughter). ARNOLD: But the thing is, they stay in - 90 percent of people will stick with it just because it's the default. And it's a very easy way to push people over the edge and get them to start saving. And that's what they're seeing in the U. K. Here's Charlotte Clark again. CLARK: We have so far done about 100,000 employers, and 6 million people have a retirement plan that they didn't have before. SHAPIRO: Is this being tried anywhere in the U. S. ? ARNOLD: Yeah, a lot of people don't realize this but 25 states across the country are in some stage of either exploring this or crafting legislation. Some are passing legislation. I think Maryland just passed a law this week. And there's bipartisan support for these bills that look pretty similar, some of them, to what they're doing in the U. K. SHAPIRO: And what could the national impact of that be if it happened on the federal level? ARNOLD: Well, a couple of things. I mean, if you look at small businesses, they say, no, no, no, you can't do this. There might be too much administrative burden. So as these rules and laws get crafted, they really try to lower the burden on small businesses to get it through. The impact would be there are 55 million Americans, according to AARP, who do not have a retirement plan at work. So best case scenario, this could catapult a lot of them into a much better situation. SHAPIRO: We're in the middle of a presidential campaign. What have the candidates said about a plan like this? Could we see the next president implement something like this on the federal level? ARNOLD: We could. Anything can happen. So far, the candidates themselves are not talking about this, but there is obviously a lot of interest at the state level. So the next president could get behind this. The candidates at this stage are talking more about sort of more predictable things - Social Security. And to kind of sum that up, they're all saying they would protect Social Security. They would do slightly different things with it. Bernie Sanders wants to expand it. He's says it's the greatest federal program ever. Hillary Clinton would expand it a little bit for people who were, say, stay at home moms or taking care of a sick family member, and so they weren't paying into Social Security as much. And Donald Trump has said sometimes he doesn't want to change the program at all. He's said some other things, so it's a little unclear exactly what his plan will be. But that's about where the candidates are. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Chris Arnold with the latest conversation in our series politics in real life. Thanks, Chris. ARNOLD: Thanks, Ari.

Analysts who studied the proposals said they would almost certainly increase the federal budget deficit by large amounts.

DONALD TRUMP: They will go up a little bit, and they may go up, you know, above. . . STEPHANOPOULOS: But they're going down in your plan. TRUMP: No, no, in my plan they're going down, but by the time it's negotiated, they'll go up. ZARROLI: The comments caused some confusion. Was Trump saying he wanted to raise taxes on the rich? Absolutely not, Trump said. Here he was on Fox Business Network on Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: But I'm not talking raised from where they are now. I'm talking about raised from my low proposal. ZARROLI: In other words, Trump said, he still wants to cut taxes on the rich. But, he says, the cuts may not end up being as big as he first proposed. He'd have to negotiate with Congress. He wouldn't get everything he wanted. Trump's stated willingness to compromise is a decided departure from the never-say-die rhetoric that Republicans have traditionally employed on tax issues. Alan Cole is an economist at the Tax Foundation. ALAN COLE: The interesting thing about how Trump looks at this stuff is he sort of compromises his negotiating position right up front by admitting that he doesn't really think that this is his plan, and that's something unusual, something that I've never really seen from other political candidates. ZARROLI: Of course Trump's comments left open the question of just where he really stands on taxes and how much compromising he'd ultimately be willing to do. Len Burman of the Tax Policy Center says it's true that Trump probably can't get the kinds of large tax cuts he wants through Congress. They'd get watered down. LEN BURMAN: It is always what happens anyway, but if you look at history, the presidential candidate's proposals often end up being enacted in some form. ZARROLI: Burman says presidents such as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all ended up getting their tax proposals approved in some form, so it matters what Trump is saying. Burman says Trump may be shifting his views on the feasibility of big tax cuts. BURMAN: One possibility is that he now understands the effect of his proposal and it's really an enormous tax cut on very high-income people. ZARROLI: But Stephen Moore, a prominent conservative commentator, says Trump's comments last weekend about tax cuts for the rich were misunderstood. Moore met with Trump a few weeks ago to discuss ways to tweak his tax proposals. STEPHEN MOORE: He told us in the meeting he wants to cut tax rates. He believes this is the way to grow the economy. And I take him for his word on that. I think that's been a centerpiece of what he's been talking about on taxes. ZARROLI: Moore says he and other conservatives such as Larry Kudlow are working with Trump staffers to revise Trump's tax plans to lessen the impact on the deficit. He says there's no guarantee Trump will adopt any of these ideas, but right now he seems to be listening. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Last September Donald Trump proposed a series of large tax cuts on individuals and businesses. Analysts who studied the proposals said they would almost certainly increase the federal budget deficit by large amounts. In recent days, however, Trump has appeared to walk back part of his proposal in ways that have left many observers perplexed. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: When Donald Trump first proposed tax cuts last year, he said they'd benefit everyone from middle-class families to the rich. Then last Sunday in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC \"This Week,\" Trump appeared to say something different.

Twenty-four years later, it's a different Clinton running, but the economy is still front and center for both parties. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: You know, I say this without trying to be partisan or personal, but the economy just works better when we have a Democrat in the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We had no growth in last two quarters, essentially no growth. It's unheard of. If China gets down to 7 percent, it's like they're going to have a national catastrophe. We have nothing. We had nothing left. We've been stripped. MONTAGNE: Here's NPR's John Ydstie for a look at who the economy favors this time around. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Most models that try to predict who's going to win the presidency take into account some measure of how the economy is doing. That's because, generally, if it's going strong in the six months or so before the election, history suggests the party currently in the White House will win. If it stinks, the party not in the White House takes over. But what if the economy is just so-so like it is now? DAN WHITE: The tiebreaker, as of today, is really gasoline prices. YDSTIE: That's economist Dan White. He oversees the election prediction model at Moody's Analytics. The model, which correctly predicts the outcome of all presidential elections going back to 1980, includes a measure of home prices. They've been going up nicely - advantage Clinton. The model also includes a measure of income growth - not going up so nicely, advantage Trump. But the price of gasoline is clearly in the Democrats' favor. WHITE: We are currently in the largest decline in gas prices that we've had going back to World War II. YDSTIE: White says Moody's chose its three economic factors - home prices, income growth and gasoline prices - because they're part of everyday life. WHITE: Things that affect marginal voter behavior most significantly are things that the average American is going to run into on an almost daily basis. YDSTIE: The Moody's model, which predicts the Electoral College outcome state by state, also includes political factors. It looks at how the state usually votes in presidential elections, whether the party has held the White House for two consecutive terms - that's a negative - and what the current president's approval rating is. In this case, President Obama's ratings have gone up recently, which also helps the Democrats. WHITE: Based on what we think the economy's going to do between now and November, we assume that the Democrats will win with 326 electoral votes. YDSTIE: The oldest prediction model, created by economics professor Ray Fair at Yale University, reaches a different conclusion. It's based on economic growth per capita in the four years before the election. Professor Fair didn't want to record an interview, but he said because of the sluggish growth in the economy, his model now predicts the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will win. Fair's model picks the winner in all but two elections since 1916. But he says this time he may get trumped. That's because the likely Republican candidate is so outside the mainstream. Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, agrees. ALAN ABRAMOWITZ: We've got in Trump a candidate who sort of defies just about all of our understanding of what normally happens in presidential elections. We've never had a major party nominee like that. YDSTIE: Abramowitz has a model, too. It forecasts a very tight race. But he ultimately thinks Donald Trump's high unfavorable ratings will put Hillary Clinton in the White House. UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck says rhetoric about the economy will still likely dominate in this campaign and could sway some voters on the fence. Trump will focus on losses, she says - job losses, income losses, losses to the U. S. economy from trade deals. LYNN VAVRECK: Because there's a lot of work out of psychology that shows people are more risk-accepting in times of loss - and so, will you take a gamble on an outsider like Donald Trump? YDSTIE: Hillary Clinton and the Democrats will obviously do the opposite, focusing on the long period of growth and job gains since the Great Recession. VAVRECK: And they will do that because in times of gains, people are more risk-averse. YDSTIE: In any case, the Trump candidacy could make some election prediction models losers.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: My guest today is Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. He's also the head of economic research at Uber, the ride-sharing company. Keith's going to talk about some of the behavioral anomalies that Uber has observed, and we're then going to talk about some of Keith's earlier work which explored the evolutionary and cultural origins of certain biases and heuristics. Keith Chen, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KEITH CHEN: Thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan of the podcast. VEDANTAM: I want to start by talking about surge-pricing. Uber charges more when demand is high based on the idea that this is going to draw more drivers into the pool and increase the supply of rides. Now, this makes perfect sense from the point of view for traditional economists, but you're a behavioral economist and you must know there's something about charging different prices for the same products that rubs customers the wrong way. They say, hey, five minutes ago this ride was 10 dollars. Now it's 20. CHEN: So as you can imagine, I hear over and over again, you know, both at my dinner table and at family gatherings. . . (LAUGHTER)CHEN: . . . That surge-pricing can feel very unfair to customers. But it's been a really integral part of Uber's success, precisely because, you know, the whole kind of goal of the company was to replace a really frustrating experience with taxi with a service that's just ultimately reliable - right? And the only way to do that, the only way to be able to get basically everyone who lives in a dense part of a city a car within five minutes was to do that through dynamic pricing, through giving drivers a very, very strong incentive to want to get to the places where they're needed the most, and also to get riders who could afford to wait a little longer - say they're at a bar - to say, well, you know, if it's more expensive to take a ride right now, go ahead and relax and sit back. If you can wait 15 minutes, the drink's on the person who's got to go now. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). The interesting thing, Keith, is that when I think about my own behavior, when Uber tells me that the price is now 1. 8 times the regular price, I notice that and I factor that in, and there's a part of me that feels it's a little unfair. When I'm waiting for just a taxicab and now the taxicab doesn't show up, I don't actually think of someone whom I can blame or someone whom I hold responsible, even though it actually has a bigger effect on me that now I actually have to wait two hours or I can't get a cab at all. CHEN: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And, you know, this basic question of how psychologically painful kind of the experience of paying a price is is something that I worry about every day, especially because I actually think that it's one of the reasons that we've grown so fast. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to displace taxi so quickly is because in a taxi, you sit in the car and when you're trapped in traffic, you literally watch your money ticking away like in front of you. (LAUGHTER)CHEN: You're just kind of forced to watch it. There's nothing else to see except this. VEDANTAM: It's hypnotic, absolutely. CHEN: It's hypnotic and it's the worst possible psychological experience - you know? Taxis and gas pumps - right? - are the two places where you just watch your money tick away. And the typical Uber experience, you know, you just hit a button, get in the car and if it's not surging, you don't even need to know what you paid until tomorrow morning if you want to open the email. And if you kind of trust that Uber's the kind of cheapest possible of option, you don't even need to look. VEDANTAM: So you found that psychology plays a role in how surge-pricing works because there are places where it works in the way that a traditional economist would predict it would work and there are places where it breaks down. CHEN: Definitely. So just like traditional economics would predict, as you raise the price, you know, surge-pricing starts to dampen demand. You know, when you go from kind of a surge of 1X, meaning no surge, to 1. 2, you actually see a very, very large drop in demand - OK? And that initial drop in demand - actually early on when we first started surge-pricing at Uber, going from 1X to 1. 2X, you would see a 27 percentage points drop in people who would request. After sometime though, like both after a surge has been in the city for a while and after people have gotten a little used to it, that drops to 7 percent. So people start getting used to - it's not such an alien experience anymore. They may not love you - right? - at the company because of it, but they're not quite as kind of put off by it as normal. And then as you tick up the price further and further, you see further and further drops in demand - so 1. 2, 1. 3, 1. 4. You know, people like surge less and less because they understand that they're paying more. The surprising thing is there is a very, very strong round number effect which we detect. So when you go from 1. 9 to 2. 0, you see six times larger of a drop in demand than you saw from going from 1. 8 to 1. 9. So the amount more that you're paying for the trip is the same between those two steps, but 2. 0 just feels viscerally larger to people - right? It just seems a lot like - it's very easy to understand. Everyone understands I'm paying twice as much for this trip as I would have. VEDANTAM: I saw a paper that came out on National Bureau of Economic Research a couple of months ago. This is by Matthew Backus, Tom Blake and Steven Tadelis where they looked at pricing on eBay. And they found something that sounds similar, which is they found that when you price things with round numbers, those things tend to sell faster, partly because people believe that sellers who price things at round numbers aren't really wedded to those prices. . . CHEN: That's right. VEDANTAM: . . . That they basically put those prices on because they want to move something quickly. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And therefore they're actually willing to negotiate with you because they actually don't care so much about what the actual prices is, whereas, when you pick a very specific price point. . . CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . People say, this couch costs 74 dollars and 26 cents - some thought must have gone into this and I don't have much room to negotiate. CHEN: (Laughter) And there is no back and forth. Where if somebody prices their couch at a hundred. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . You think, well, why don't I just counter with 50? VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And then the conversation gets starting from there - right? VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: Actually, you know, we see exactly the same thing at Uber. And I think that's the main explanation for something really, really puzzling, and that is more people will take a ride at a surge multiplier of 2. 1 than would take a ride and 2. So I described to you how between 1. 9 and 2, a lot of people stopped taking rides. If anything, people take more rides at 2. 1 than they did at 2. VEDANTAM: When it's more expensive? CHEN: When it's more expensive. It's as if they're telling you, I would rather pay you 2. 1 times the normal price than I would 2. And I think just like your intuition on negotiations on eBay, that's exactly the same intuition I think that drives the behavior here. You know, people, when you tell someone, your trip is going to be two times more than it normally costs, they think, wow, that's capricious and unfair. VEDANTAM: Someone just made that up. CHEN: Somebody just made that up. Like, you know, they must have seen it was raining and just decided to mess with me - right? Whereas if you say, oh, you know, your trip is going to be 2. 1 times more than it normally does - wow, you know, there must be some smart algorithm in the background here that's at work. It doesn't seem quite as unfair. VEDANTAM: We had the behavioral economist Richard Thaler on the podcast some time ago. And one of the thinks he was talking about is why it's often hard to find a cab on a rainy evening. And his theory is that this had something to do with what he calls mental accounting, which is the cab driver has a number in his or her head about how much money he wants to make on a given day. So the cab driver says, you know, my expenses are going to be a hundred bucks a day. I want to make a hundred dollars over that. And so when I hit 200, I go home. And on a rainy day, demand is higher, so you hit 200 faster. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so the cab driver goes home. And so you end up with fewer cabs with more demand. CHEN: Exactly. VEDANTAM: Now, you have done some work looking at dynamic pricing and surge pricing. And you're finding that actually that isn't the case with Uber driver. Uber drivers do not necessarily go home when it's actually a smart time to be driving. CHEN: Yeah, exactly right. I find very different results than Dick does with New York City cab drivers. And I think I understand a little bit of the psychology as to why we're finding different things. All right, so exactly as you said. If you're a New York City cab driver, you know, you're going to get the same amount for every trip no matter what. It's a regulated fare. So when it's raining, the only thing that's really changing is you're just picking up more people - right? So in that world, it does feel very salient. You know, many of them are collecting cash. You can just see, you know, once there's a pile of 200 dollars in the front seat, I'm just going to call it a day - right? Whereas, on Uber, you know, the main way that we incentivize drivers to move to the places that riders need them and to stay out a little longer if they can afford to is through surge pricing. And so I think that's - I think that's very, very salient. So if you're an Uber driver, and say you were planning to do about a two-hour shift this afternoon - you know, you're driving around but all of a sudden, unexpectedly, it starts to surge 2. 1 times - all right? Like, every trip you're going to make, you know, (laughter) - I can't believe my mind just went to 2. 1(LAUGHTER)CHEN: But, you know, you're an Uber driver, and it's surging, you're going to get twice as much. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . For every additional trip you do. What I actually see in our Uber data is that even compared to yourself a week ago in exactly this situation, Uber drivers will double, triple the length of the shift that they were planning to do if it's surging 2X, if it's surging 3X. They're just going to stay out because, well, they can make a lot of money right now. You know, they can take the whole weekend off if they put in another few hours today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: When you yourself use Uber as a rider, what is it you pay attention to? I mean, do you use your own trips as sort of research into how the company is working? You must at some level. CHEN: Oh, my god, I do all of the time. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And it frustrates me because I kind of see so many kind of psychological biases in my own life. VEDANTAM: Like what? CHEN: So, for example, partially because I think it's just one of our most exciting products, I take UberPool a lot. So UberPool is this service by which now up to three passengers can share the same Uber car. And, you know, when you're in the car, you know, you can just - somebody just kind of two blocks ahead just happens to be going, you know, along the exact same route that you are, you know, will just suddenly tell your Uber driver, pull over and, you know, take in this new person. And then because that we can get people to share rides and get more people into seats, we can like reduce the price. And on average, like, UberPool can save up to 50 percent for most people's rides. VEDANTAM: Not to mention saving on gas and emissions and all the environmental issues. CHEN: Not to mention saving on gas, emissions and increases driver pay because, you know, literally now drivers can be constantly utilized. They can be constantly making money and they don't have any of that downtime of driving to someone or sitting idle somewhere. But a big part of making UberPool work is minimizing the amount of psychological frustration that people have with that experience. And so, for example, I find for myself that initially when we were writing those kind of UberPool algorithms, we took a very rational view. You know, we want to pass people the most amount of savings that we can and inconvenience them as little as possible, with inconvenience usually being kind of just really, really focused on how much time is it going to get you from your point A to your point B? One of the things that we have started to discovered is that - and that I feel very viscerally when I'm in an UberPool - is that there's something really, really psychologically painful about going backwards - right? So even if this is an amazing match for you - right? - forcing your car to kind of, you know, make three right turns and circle around the block and for a short period drive backwards - right? - drive away from your destination. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: . . . Is just like three times more painful than you would have expected just from the added time. VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: So, you know, so we try and avoid that as much as possible. And that's something (unintelligible). VEDANTAM: You know, I feel there have been times that I miss an exit on the freeway, and you know that you have to wait, go to the next exit and then turn around and come back. And every inch of the way, as you're going to the next exit, you're reminding yourself, I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I made a mistake. And you really - it's true, you really beat up on yourself when you feel like you're doing something that's taking you in the wrong direction. CHEN: Yeah, I'll do crazy things, like I realized the other day that - you know, there's two airports that I can fly out of. I have to fly south and there's two airports I can fly out of. One of them is north of me and one of them is south of me. I can't bring myself to book a flight out at the airport that's north of me because I feel like I'll spend the whole drive, like, going in the wrong direction. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). One of the things I wanted to talk to you about this Uber is collecting massive amounts of information on what people are doing. And I think a lot of people don't quite realize how powerful this information is. I remember doing a story some months ago looking at some social science research, analyzing how people were using cell phones in a poor country and how the way people use their cell phones and whether they kept their cell phones topped off - so this is a country where you sort of prepay your cell phone - whether you keep your cell phone prepaid. And whether you have a lot of incoming calls or you have a lot of outgoing calls, how wide your network is - all these things can predict, with a remarkable degree of accuracy, your credit worthiness. And so if a bank sort of just looks at your cell phone usage data, it can make remarkably accurate predictions about whether you are likely to repay a loan or not repay a loan. And, I mean, who would think that just the way that you're using your cell phone could tell a bank that, you know, they should give you a loan to start a new business? And I feel like Uber has sort of similar access to vast amounts of data. I mean, there have been reports for example of, you know, so Uber broadly knows where I live and where I work because I'm often taking cabs back and forth between those two locations. But let's say one day I leave work, and instead of going home I go to another location, which is known to be the address of a bar. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And then a few hours later I go to another location, which is not my home address. CHEN: Sure. VEDANTAM: And then I come to work the next morning, you know, you can draw the conclusion of what I was doing that evening. And it feels like you actually know more about people's lives than perhaps they realize they are letting you know. CHEN: We do have access to a tremendous amount of data. And because of that we have kind of a privacy officer, you know, within the firm. Because of that, kind of even as an employee of the firm, I have to be very, very careful about what kinds of queries and what I look at in people's data. Yeah, precisely because this is people's lives. And you're right that, you know, we have to take very seriously this responsibility that we're becoming a big part of how people move around the world. And we just want to be very careful with that. VEDANTAM: Have you ever been concerned about the way you are using these services that might reveal things about you? I mean, as someone who sees things from the point of view of the institution of the company and knows how powerful this information is, has it changed your own behavior and how you interact with any number of these sites? CHEN: Well, now that you're talking about it, I'm getting even more worried, but. . . (LAUGHTER)CHEN: But, you know, I - and this might be naive, but I have often thought to myself that - you know, so my experience inside of large companies that have access to these huge kind of treasure troves of data is that, you know, you almost always just look at these like broad, broad aggregates. And I guess I've always just taken comfort in the fact that I'm boring enough of a person that no one would ever (laughter) - I mean, it's almost like - you know, so, for example, like, some people I know, like my sister, kind of shreds all of her credit card statements and kind of does everything before she tosses paper in the trash. And I always just throw everything in the trash because I figure, like, I just don't feel important enough for, like, someone to rummage through my trash. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge - in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2. 2, 2. 3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away - is how much battery you have left on your cell phone. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's fascinating. Of course, yeah. CHEN: Yeah, like when your cell phone is like down to like below 5 percent battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. VEDANTAM: I'm talking with Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. And heads up economic research at Uber. When we come back, I'm going to ask Keith about some of his earlier work, which explores the origin of some very interesting biases. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Keith, in your life before Uber, you conducted different experiments into the origins of various human biases, including some issues that often come up in behavioral economics. Some of your most fascinating early work was with monkeys. And I understand to conduct these experiments, you first trained the monkeys to become economic actors. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: How did you go about doing that? CHEN: Oh my gosh, this feels like a lifetime ago. But with a bunch of colleagues at Yale University, we set out to answer this kind of somewhat ill-defined question but one that we were kind of obsessed with, which was, if monkeys were taught to use money - well, one, could monkeys be taught to use money? And two, if monkeys could be taught to use money, would they behave in the same way that humans do in all of the kind of psychologically rich ways that we interact with kind of prices and think about wealth and think about how we spend our own money? So basically what we did was, you know, we just - we had a small colony of Capuchin monkeys that were living with us at Yale. I also did some work with a colony of Tamarin monkeys back at Harvard. And my Yale students were thrilled to hear that the Yale monkeys were much smarter than the Harvard monkeys. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: I didn't tell them it was because it was a different species. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: They attributed it to the school. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). CHEN: But basically what you do to teach a monkey to use money is you hire a bunch of Yale undergrads to basically just live with the monkeys for a long time. So, you know, these Yale undergraduates were typically psychology majors. They were studying the monkeys for various other things. You know, the monkeys live in a big, spacious, comfortable habitat. You know, they typically ignore the kind of humans that are moving around. But you'd have a Yale undergraduate every now and then just drop a coin on the floor - OK? And we had chose these kind of large, metal washers to kind of stand in for a coin. Now, a monkey thinks that's fascinating, runs over, grabs the coin, kind of chews on it, like, you know, bangs it on the floor, every now and then would throw it around, kind of almost a little dangerously, but would eventually kind of lose interest in this metal disc. Then you'd have the Yale undergraduates stand there and stare at the monkey with an open hand outstretched - OK? - and just stare at that monkey uncomfortably, just kind of setting this uncomfortable situation. And every now and then, the monkey would actually pick up the coin and just put it in the undergraduates' hand, like give it back to the student. And what we did was we trained the students to say, why thank you in a really exaggerated tones and then like hand the monkey a piece of food - OK? - so like a little apple slice. One undergraduate came to be known to the monkeys as like the apple undergraduate. If you gave that person a coin, they would always, like, hand you an apple slice. Another person was the pineapple undergraduate. And another person was the orange slice undergraduate. Now, what's amazing is you do this for about six months - all right? - nonstop for about six months. And eventually you start to realize that the monkeys understand that this is Fiat money - right? Now, what does that mean? Well, what that means is, you know, the monkeys had been very familiar with, like, basic ideas, like there's a lever on the wall. If I pull this lever, an apple slice falls from the ceiling. But money is something fundamentally different. When I find this coin - all right? - it's not just an apple lever. It's actually a choice between an apple lever, an orange lever, and a pineapple lever because I can take this coin, I can carry it around with me, and I can wait until the - if I feel like having an apple, I've got to run over to the apple person and I can spend it there - right? Money is kind of fungible across different kinds of food that I can purchase. So we started to see that. We saw that monkeys started to use these with each other, and to save them, to kind of hide them from other monkeys and then to make very, very rational decisions, rational-looking decisions. When the price of apple doubled, you know, when that apple undergraduate started only giving one piece of apple, not two, when you handed him a coin, you know, demand for apples went down and demand for oranges and for pineapples went up. VEDANTAM: How did the monkeys protect their money? CHEN: A fascinating component of the monkeys starting to understand money was that they displayed signs that they realized not only that they understood the value of this disc but that they understood other monkeys recognized the value of this disc. So, for example, you know, early on when the money that we were using was these physical disks, it's a little bit hard to shield from other monkeys - right? And you don't want to be kind of carrying all of these things around. So you would see monkeys, like, hide the discs, like, you know, over in the corner, under a pile of, like, wood shavings - right? They'd kind of hide the discs. Later, actually, we taught these monkeys to use touchpads. And so, like, then kind of in some sense, like, monkeys learned, you know, to use currency as if it's just kind of an ATM, as if it just gets, like, Venmoed or transferred to other players, to the apple guy. . . VEDANTAM: So this is like an Apple wallet basically? CHEN: Yeah, basically. They are ahead of us on this dimension. You know, they are a completely cashless economy at this point. VEDANTAM: You eventually got to the point where you would also introduce to the monkeys the idea that sometimes when they would give a certain amount of money to an experimenter, the experimenter might give the monkey three things. And sometimes the experimenter might give the monkey one thing. So in other words, it was unpredictable what the reward was going to be. You taught the monkeys to gamble. CHEN: Yeah, that's basically exactly what we did. So we introduced them to two new undergraduates. So one undergraduate would always approach a monkey with three pieces of apple in their outstretched hand. Let's call this undergraduate Adam - OK? - would show three, and either give over all three or would it take two back and would only give one. Then we introduced him to another undergraduate, Ben, - all right? - who always showed one - OK? But if you gave Ben a coin, Ben would half the time hand over just that one, half the time would add two apple pieces to his hand and hand over three - all right? So now the fascinating thing is both Adam and Ben are presenting you exactly the same deal. They are a 50-50 gamble between three apple pieces and one apple piece - right? And you can give the monkeys  a lot of experience trading only with Adam and a lot of experience training only with Ben. So they kind of get that this is a 50-50 gamble. The interesting thing is what the monkeys showed us through their preferences between Adam and Ben is that they experience something just like humans do. And that's this very powerful psychological force called loss aversion - all right? And that's the idea that it's more than twice as painful to experience a loss than it is to experience a similar sized gain - right? Now, what does that have to do with Adam and Ben? Well, Adam half the time gives you, in some sense, what he's shown - right? - the three apple pieces. But half the time he delivers you a loss. He takes away two and then hands over only one - all right? So half the time, he delivers you a loss of two. Ben half the time just hands you the one that he is showing you and half the time delivers you a gain. He gives - he puts an extra two pieces of apple there and hands you an extra two apple pieces. What we find is that when given the choice between Adam and Ben, monkeys vastly prefer Ben, - all right? - the guy who initially only shows one apple piece but half the time gives you a gain, than they preferred Adam, who initially shows you three apple pieces and then half the time delivers you a loss. They - you know, 6 to 1 preferred trading with Ben to Adam. And that's fascinating because that cuts against their very, very core instinct, which is, well, if I have got a coin, why don't I go trade it with the guy who is showing me three instead of the guy who is showing me one - right? Like every kind of fiber in their body tells them that they should be going for more food, not less. And yet because of loss aversion and because they actually feel this very viscerally in the same way that people do, they actually prefer the guy who promises less but delivers more. VEDANTAM: I have to say that I am thinking about what I would do in that situation. And I have to say I'm clearly no smarter than a monkey because I would definitely prefer to trade with Ben because you are getting something that seems like it's a surprise. It's a gift. It's like - it's wonderful. It's unexpected. It's happy. And at the worst it's only going to be what he's promised you in the first place. But with Adam, he's taking away something that you thought was yours. CHEN: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, we see in our Uber data this loss aversion at work as well. And you can even just feel it psychologically. Like when you are a rider and, you know, surge pricing hits, like that's a loss - right? And that feels very, very bad. We have often been asked, well, why didn't you frame surge pricing as discounts instead of as - instead of surcharges? Why isn't Uber's standard price twice as high as it is and then most of the time you're getting a discount - right? Why not kind of frame it that way? VEDANTAM: Because behavioral economics would predict that you would actually make people much happier if you did it that way. CHEN: Well, behavioral economics would predict that you would make riders happier if you did that. I mean, the critical thing to notice is that we are a two-sided market. That move, which would make riders happier, would also make drivers feel less well. So, I mean, so we had thought for a while, why not just frame Uber's pricing as how much cheaper we are than a taxi? Because in many major cities in the United States, we're up to 60 percent cheaper than taxi fares when we're not surging. And, you know, what that means is that, you know, you can surge like 2. 1 and still be coming basically out even if you had instead just taken a taxi. But even though because Uber drivers are in such an efficient system, they constantly have a paying rider in the back of the car, they are actually making more than they would have if they had been working as a taxi driver, framing this to them - oh, you're making 60 percent less per mile than you would if you were driving a taxi, that's - that would be a cost of this pricing system.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: My guest today is Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. He's also the head of economic research at Uber, the ride-sharing company. Keith's going to talk about some of the behavioral anomalies that Uber has observed, and we're then going to talk about some of Keith's earlier work which explored the evolutionary and cultural origins of certain biases and heuristics. Keith Chen, welcome to HIDDEN BRAIN. KEITH CHEN: Thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan of the podcast. VEDANTAM: I want to start by talking about surge-pricing. Uber charges more when demand is high based on the idea that this is going to draw more drivers into the pool and increase the supply of rides. Now, this makes perfect sense from the point of view for traditional economists, but you're a behavioral economist and you must know there's something about charging different prices for the same products that rubs customers the wrong way. They say, hey, five minutes ago this ride was 10 dollars. Now it's 20. CHEN: So as you can imagine, I hear over and over again, you know, both at my dinner table and at family gatherings. . . (LAUGHTER) CHEN: . . . That surge-pricing can feel very unfair to customers. But it's been a really integral part of Uber's success, precisely because, you know, the whole kind of goal of the company was to replace a really frustrating experience with taxi with a service that's just ultimately reliable - right? And the only way to do that, the only way to be able to get basically everyone who lives in a dense part of a city a car within five minutes was to do that through dynamic pricing, through giving drivers a very, very strong incentive to want to get to the places where they're needed the most, and also to get riders who could afford to wait a little longer - say they're at a bar - to say, well, you know, if it's more expensive to take a ride right now, go ahead and relax and sit back. If you can wait 15 minutes, the drink's on the person who's got to go now. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). The interesting thing, Keith, is that when I think about my own behavior, when Uber tells me that the price is now 1. 8 times the regular price, I notice that and I factor that in, and there's a part of me that feels it's a little unfair. When I'm waiting for just a taxicab and now the taxicab doesn't show up, I don't actually think of someone whom I can blame or someone whom I hold responsible, even though it actually has a bigger effect on me that now I actually have to wait two hours or I can't get a cab at all. CHEN: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And, you know, this basic question of how psychologically painful kind of the experience of paying a price is is something that I worry about every day, especially because I actually think that it's one of the reasons that we've grown so fast. It's one of the reasons that we've been able to displace taxi so quickly is because in a taxi, you sit in the car and when you're trapped in traffic, you literally watch your money ticking away like in front of you. (LAUGHTER) CHEN: You're just kind of forced to watch it. There's nothing else to see except this. VEDANTAM: It's hypnotic, absolutely. CHEN: It's hypnotic and it's the worst possible psychological experience - you know? Taxis and gas pumps - right? - are the two places where you just watch your money tick away. And the typical Uber experience, you know, you just hit a button, get in the car and if it's not surging, you don't even need to know what you paid until tomorrow morning if you want to open the email. And if you kind of trust that Uber's the kind of cheapest possible of option, you don't even need to look. VEDANTAM: So you found that psychology plays a role in how surge-pricing works because there are places where it works in the way that a traditional economist would predict it would work and there are places where it breaks down. CHEN: Definitely. So just like traditional economics would predict, as you raise the price, you know, surge-pricing starts to dampen demand. You know, when you go from kind of a surge of 1X, meaning no surge, to 1. 2, you actually see a very, very large drop in demand - OK? And that initial drop in demand - actually early on when we first started surge-pricing at Uber, going from 1X to 1. 2X, you would see a 27 percentage points drop in people who would request. After sometime though, like both after a surge has been in the city for a while and after people have gotten a little used to it, that drops to 7 percent. So people start getting used to - it's not such an alien experience anymore. They may not love you - right? - at the company because of it, but they're not quite as kind of put off by it as normal. And then as you tick up the price further and further, you see further and further drops in demand - so 1. 2, 1. 3, 1. 4. You know, people like surge less and less because they understand that they're paying more. The surprising thing is there is a very, very strong round number effect which we detect. So when you go from 1. 9 to 2. 0, you see six times larger of a drop in demand than you saw from going from 1. 8 to 1. 9. So the amount more that you're paying for the trip is the same between those two steps, but 2. 0 just feels viscerally larger to people - right? It just seems a lot like - it's very easy to understand. Everyone understands I'm paying twice as much for this trip as I would have. VEDANTAM: I saw a paper that came out on National Bureau of Economic Research a couple of months ago. This is by Matthew Backus, Tom Blake and Steven Tadelis where they looked at pricing on eBay. And they found something that sounds similar, which is they found that when you price things with round numbers, those things tend to sell faster, partly because people believe that sellers who price things at round numbers aren't really wedded to those prices. . . CHEN: That's right. VEDANTAM: . . . That they basically put those prices on because they want to move something quickly. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And therefore they're actually willing to negotiate with you because they actually don't care so much about what the actual prices is, whereas, when you pick a very specific price point. . . CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: . . . People say, this couch costs 74 dollars and 26 cents - some thought must have gone into this and I don't have much room to negotiate. CHEN: (Laughter) And there is no back and forth. Where if somebody prices their couch at a hundred. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . You think, well, why don't I just counter with 50? VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And then the conversation gets starting from there - right? VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: Actually, you know, we see exactly the same thing at Uber. And I think that's the main explanation for something really, really puzzling, and that is more people will take a ride at a surge multiplier of 2. 1 than would take a ride and 2. So I described to you how between 1. 9 and 2, a lot of people stopped taking rides. If anything, people take more rides at 2. 1 than they did at 2. VEDANTAM: When it's more expensive? CHEN: When it's more expensive. It's as if they're telling you, I would rather pay you 2. 1 times the normal price than I would 2. And I think just like your intuition on negotiations on eBay, that's exactly the same intuition I think that drives the behavior here. You know, people, when you tell someone, your trip is going to be two times more than it normally costs, they think, wow, that's capricious and unfair. VEDANTAM: Someone just made that up. CHEN: Somebody just made that up. Like, you know, they must have seen it was raining and just decided to mess with me - right? Whereas if you say, oh, you know, your trip is going to be 2. 1 times more than it normally does - wow, you know, there must be some smart algorithm in the background here that's at work. It doesn't seem quite as unfair. VEDANTAM: We had the behavioral economist Richard Thaler on the podcast some time ago. And one of the thinks he was talking about is why it's often hard to find a cab on a rainy evening. And his theory is that this had something to do with what he calls mental accounting, which is the cab driver has a number in his or her head about how much money he wants to make on a given day. So the cab driver says, you know, my expenses are going to be a hundred bucks a day. I want to make a hundred dollars over that. And so when I hit 200, I go home. And on a rainy day, demand is higher, so you hit 200 faster. CHEN: Yeah. VEDANTAM: And so the cab driver goes home. And so you end up with fewer cabs with more demand. CHEN: Exactly. VEDANTAM: Now, you have done some work looking at dynamic pricing and surge pricing. And you're finding that actually that isn't the case with Uber driver. Uber drivers do not necessarily go home when it's actually a smart time to be driving. CHEN: Yeah, exactly right. I find very different results than Dick does with New York City cab drivers. And I think I understand a little bit of the psychology as to why we're finding different things. All right, so exactly as you said. If you're a New York City cab driver, you know, you're going to get the same amount for every trip no matter what. It's a regulated fare. So when it's raining, the only thing that's really changing is you're just picking up more people - right? So in that world, it does feel very salient. You know, many of them are collecting cash. You can just see, you know, once there's a pile of 200 dollars in the front seat, I'm just going to call it a day - right? Whereas, on Uber, you know, the main way that we incentivize drivers to move to the places that riders need them and to stay out a little longer if they can afford to is through surge pricing. And so I think that's - I think that's very, very salient. So if you're an Uber driver, and say you were planning to do about a two-hour shift this afternoon - you know, you're driving around but all of a sudden, unexpectedly, it starts to surge 2. 1 times - all right? Like, every trip you're going to make, you know, (laughter) - I can't believe my mind just went to 2. 1 (LAUGHTER) CHEN: But, you know, you're an Uber driver, and it's surging, you're going to get twice as much. . . VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: . . . For every additional trip you do. What I actually see in our Uber data is that even compared to yourself a week ago in exactly this situation, Uber drivers will double, triple the length of the shift that they were planning to do if it's surging 2X, if it's surging 3X. They're just going to stay out because, well, they can make a lot of money right now. You know, they can take the whole weekend off if they put in another few hours today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: When you yourself use Uber as a rider, what is it you pay attention to? I mean, do you use your own trips as sort of research into how the company is working? You must at some level. CHEN: Oh, my god, I do all of the time. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: And it frustrates me because I kind of see so many kind of psychological biases in my own life. VEDANTAM: Like what? CHEN: So, for example, partially because I think it's just one of our most exciting products, I take UberPool a lot. So UberPool is this service by which now up to three passengers can share the same Uber car. And, you know, when you're in the car, you know, you can just - somebody just kind of two blocks ahead just happens to be going, you know, along the exact same route that you are, you know, will just suddenly tell your Uber driver, pull over and, you know, take in this new person. And then because that we can get people to share rides and get more people into seats, we can like reduce the price. And on average, like, UberPool can save up to 50 percent for most people's rides. VEDANTAM: Not to mention saving on gas and emissions and all the environmental issues. CHEN: Not to mention saving on gas, emissions and increases driver pay because, you know, literally now drivers can be constantly utilized. They can be constantly making money and they don't have any of that downtime of driving to someone or sitting idle somewhere. But a big part of making UberPool work is minimizing the amount of psychological frustration that people have with that experience. And so, for example, I find for myself that initially when we were writing those kind of UberPool algorithms, we took a very rational view. You know, we want to pass people the most amount of savings that we can and inconvenience them as little as possible, with inconvenience usually being kind of just really, really focused on how much time is it going to get you from your point A to your point B? One of the things that we have started to discovered is that - and that I feel very viscerally when I'm in an UberPool - is that there's something really, really psychologically painful about going backwards - right? So even if this is an amazing match for you - right? - forcing your car to kind of, you know, make three right turns and circle around the block and for a short period drive backwards - right? - drive away from your destination. . . VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: . . . Is just like three times more painful than you would have expected just from the added time. VEDANTAM: Yeah. CHEN: So, you know, so we try and avoid that as much as possible. And that's something (unintelligible). VEDANTAM: You know, I feel there have been times that I miss an exit on the freeway, and you know that you have to wait, go to the next exit and then turn around and come back. And every inch of the way, as you're going to the next exit, you're reminding yourself, I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I'm going to have to retrace this inch. I made a mistake. And you really - it's true, you really beat up on yourself when you feel like you're doing something that's taking you in the wrong direction. CHEN: Yeah, I'll do crazy things, like I realized the other day that - you know, there's two airports that I can fly out of. I have to fly south and there's two airports I can fly out of. One of them is north of me and one of them is south of me. I can't bring myself to book a flight out at the airport that's north of me because I feel like I'll spend the whole drive, like, going in the wrong direction. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). One of the things I wanted to talk to you about this Uber is collecting massive amounts of information on what people are doing. And I think a lot of people don't quite realize how powerful this information is. I remember doing a story some months ago looking at some social science research, analyzing how people were using cell phones in a poor country and how the way people use their cell phones and whether they kept their cell phones topped off - so this is a country where you sort of prepay your cell phone - whether you keep your cell phone prepaid. And whether you have a lot of incoming calls or you have a lot of outgoing calls, how wide your network is - all these things can predict, with a remarkable degree of accuracy, your credit worthiness. And so if a bank sort of just looks at your cell phone usage data, it can make remarkably accurate predictions about whether you are likely to repay a loan or not repay a loan. And, I mean, who would think that just the way that you're using your cell phone could tell a bank that, you know, they should give you a loan to start a new business? And I feel like Uber has sort of similar access to vast amounts of data. I mean, there have been reports for example of, you know, so Uber broadly knows where I live and where I work because I'm often taking cabs back and forth between those two locations. But let's say one day I leave work, and instead of going home I go to another location, which is known to be the address of a bar. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: And then a few hours later I go to another location, which is not my home address. CHEN: Sure. VEDANTAM: And then I come to work the next morning, you know, you can draw the conclusion of what I was doing that evening. And it feels like you actually know more about people's lives than perhaps they realize they are letting you know. CHEN: We do have access to a tremendous amount of data. And because of that we have kind of a privacy officer, you know, within the firm. Because of that, kind of even as an employee of the firm, I have to be very, very careful about what kinds of queries and what I look at in people's data. Yeah, precisely because this is people's lives. And you're right that, you know, we have to take very seriously this responsibility that we're becoming a big part of how people move around the world. And we just want to be very careful with that. VEDANTAM: Have you ever been concerned about the way you are using these services that might reveal things about you? I mean, as someone who sees things from the point of view of the institution of the company and knows how powerful this information is, has it changed your own behavior and how you interact with any number of these sites? CHEN: Well, now that you're talking about it, I'm getting even more worried, but. . . (LAUGHTER) CHEN: But, you know, I - and this might be naive, but I have often thought to myself that - you know, so my experience inside of large companies that have access to these huge kind of treasure troves of data is that, you know, you almost always just look at these like broad, broad aggregates. And I guess I've always just taken comfort in the fact that I'm boring enough of a person that no one would ever (laughter) - I mean, it's almost like - you know, so, for example, like, some people I know, like my sister, kind of shreds all of her credit card statements and kind of does everything before she tosses paper in the trash. And I always just throw everything in the trash because I figure, like, I just don't feel important enough for, like, someone to rummage through my trash. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge - in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2. 2, 2. 3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away - is how much battery you have left on your cell phone. VEDANTAM: Oh, that's fascinating. Of course, yeah. CHEN: Yeah, like when your cell phone is like down to like below 5 percent battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. VEDANTAM: I'm talking with Keith Chen. He's a behavioral economist at UCLA. And heads up economic research at Uber. When we come back, I'm going to ask Keith about some of his earlier work, which explores the origin of some very interesting biases. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Keith, in your life before Uber, you conducted different experiments into the origins of various human biases, including some issues that often come up in behavioral economics. Some of your most fascinating early work was with monkeys. And I understand to conduct these experiments, you first trained the monkeys to become economic actors. CHEN: (Laughter). VEDANTAM: How did you go about doing that? CHEN: Oh my gosh, this feels like a lifetime ago. But with a bunch of colleagues at Yale University, we set out to answer this kind of somewhat ill-defined question but one that we were kind of obsessed with, which was, if monkeys were taught to use money - well, one, could monkeys be taught to use money? And two, if monkeys could be taught to use money, would they behave in the same way that humans do in all of the kind of psychologically rich ways that we interact with kind of prices and think about wealth and think about how we spend our own money? So basically what we did was, you know, we just - we had a small colony of Capuchin monkeys that were living with us at Yale. I also did some work with a colony of Tamarin monkeys back at Harvard. And my Yale students were thrilled to hear that the Yale monkeys were much smarter than the Harvard monkeys. VEDANTAM: (Laughter). CHEN: I didn't tell them it was because it was a different species. VEDANTAM: Right. CHEN: They attributed it to the school. VEDANTAM: Right (laughter). CHEN: But basically what you do to teach a monkey to use money is you hire a bunch of Yale undergrads to basically just live with the monkeys for a long time. So, you know, these Yale undergraduates were typically psychology majors. They were studying the monkeys for various other things. You know, the monkeys live in a big, spacious, comfortable habitat. You know, they typically ignore the kind of humans that are moving around. But you'd have a Yale undergraduate every now and then just drop a coin on the floor - OK? And we had chose these kind of large, metal washers to kind of stand in for a coin. Now, a monkey thinks that's fascinating, runs over, grabs the coin, kind of chews on it, like, you know, bangs it on the floor, every now and then would throw it around, kind of almost a little dangerously, but would eventually kind of lose interest in this metal disc. Then you'd have the Yale undergraduates stand there and stare at the monkey with an open hand outstretched - OK? - and just stare at that monkey uncomfortably, just kind of setting this uncomfortable situation. And every now and then, the monkey would actually pick up the coin and just put it in the undergraduates' hand, like give it back to the student. And what we did was we trained the students to say, why thank you in a really exaggerated tones and then like hand the monkey a piece of food - OK? - so like a little apple slice. One undergraduate came to be known to the monkeys as like the apple undergraduate. If you gave that person a coin, they would always, like, hand you an apple slice. Another person was the pineapple undergraduate. And another person was the orange slice undergraduate. Now, what's amazing is you do this for about six months - all right? - nonstop for about six months. And eventually you start to realize that the monkeys understand that this is Fiat money - right? Now, what does that mean? Well, what that means is, you know, the monkeys had been very familiar with, like, basic ideas, like there's a lever on the wall. If I pull this lever, an apple slice falls from the ceiling. But money is something fundamentally different. When I find this coin - all right? - it's not just an apple lever. It's actually a choice between an apple lever, an orange lever, and a pineapple lever because I can take this coin, I can carry it around with me, and I can wait until the - if I feel like having an apple, I've got to run over to the apple person and I can spend it there - right? Money is kind of fungible across different kinds of food that I can purchase. So we started to see that. We saw that monkeys started to use these with each other, and to save them, to kind of hide them from other monkeys and then to make very, very rational decisions, rational-looking decisions. When the price of apple doubled, you know, when that apple undergraduate started only giving one piece of apple, not two, when you handed him a coin, you know, demand for apples went down and demand for oranges and for pineapples went up. VEDANTAM: How did the monkeys protect their money? CHEN: A fascinating component of the monkeys starting to understand money was that they displayed signs that they realized not only that they understood the value of this disc but that they understood other monkeys recognized the value of this disc. So, for example, you know, early on when the money that we were using was these physical disks, it's a little bit hard to shield from other monkeys - right? And you don't want to be kind of carrying all of these things around. So you would see monkeys, like, hide the discs, like, you know, over in the corner, under a pile of, like, wood shavings - right? They'd kind of hide the discs. Later, actually, we taught these monkeys to use touchpads. And so, like, then kind of in some sense, like, monkeys learned, you know, to use currency as if it's just kind of an ATM, as if it just gets, like, Venmoed or transferred to other players, to the apple guy. . . VEDANTAM: So this is like an Apple wallet basically? CHEN: Yeah, basically. They are ahead of us on this dimension. You know, they are a completely cashless economy at this point. VEDANTAM: You eventually got to the point where you would also introduce to the monkeys the idea that sometimes when they would give a certain amount of money to an experimenter, the experimenter might give the monkey three things. And sometimes the experimenter might give the monkey one thing. So in other words, it was unpredictable what the reward was going to be. You taught the monkeys to gamble. CHEN: Yeah, that's basically exactly what we did. So we introduced them to two new undergraduates. So one undergraduate would always approach a monkey with three pieces of apple in their outstretched hand. Let's call this undergraduate Adam - OK? - would show three, and either give over all three or would it take two back and would only give one. Then we introduced him to another undergraduate, Ben, - all right? - who always showed one - OK? But if you gave Ben a coin, Ben would half the time hand over just that one, half the time would add two apple pieces to his hand and hand over three - all right? So now the fascinating thing is both Adam and Ben are presenting you exactly the same deal. They are a 50-50 gamble between three apple pieces and one apple piece - right? And you can give the monkeys  a lot of experience trading only with Adam and a lot of experience training only with Ben. So they kind of get that this is a 50-50 gamble. The interesting thing is what the monkeys showed us through their preferences between Adam and Ben is that they experience something just like humans do. And that's this very powerful psychological force called loss aversion - all right? And that's the idea that it's more than twice as painful to experience a loss than it is to experience a similar sized gain - right? Now, what does that have to do with Adam and Ben? Well, Adam half the time gives you, in some sense, what he's shown - right? - the three apple pieces. But half the time he delivers you a loss. He takes away two and then hands over only one - all right? So half the time, he delivers you a loss of two. Ben half the time just hands you the one that he is showing you and half the time delivers you a gain. He gives - he puts an extra two pieces of apple there and hands you an extra two apple pieces. What we find is that when given the choice between Adam and Ben, monkeys vastly prefer Ben, - all right? - the guy who initially only shows one apple piece but half the time gives you a gain, than they preferred Adam, who initially shows you three apple pieces and then half the time delivers you a loss. They - you know, 6 to 1 preferred trading with Ben to Adam. And that's fascinating because that cuts against their very, very core instinct, which is, well, if I have got a coin, why don't I go trade it with the guy who is showing me three instead of the guy who is showing me one - right? Like every kind of fiber in their body tells them that they should be going for more food, not less. And yet because of loss aversion and because they actually feel this very viscerally in the same way that people do, they actually prefer the guy who promises less but delivers more. VEDANTAM: I have to say that I am thinking about what I would do in that situation. And I have to say I'm clearly no smarter than a monkey because I would definitely prefer to trade with Ben because you are getting something that seems like it's a surprise. It's a gift. It's like - it's wonderful. It's unexpected. It's happy. And at the worst it's only going to be what he's promised you in the first place. But with Adam, he's taking away something that you thought was yours. CHEN: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And interestingly, we see in our Uber data this loss aversion at work as well. And you can even just feel it psychologically. Like when you are a rider and, you know, surge pricing hits, like that's a loss - right? And that feels very, very bad. We have often been asked, well, why didn't you frame surge pricing as discounts instead of as - instead of surcharges? Why isn't Uber's standard price twice as high as it is and then most of the time you're getting a discount - right? Why not kind of frame it that way? VEDANTAM: Because behavioral economics would predict that you would actually make people much happier if you did it that way. CHEN: Well, behavioral economics would predict that you would make riders happier if you did that. I mean, the critical thing to notice is that we are a two-sided market. That move, which would make riders happier, would also make drivers feel less well. So, I mean, so we had thought for a while, why not just frame Uber's pricing as how much cheaper we are than a taxi? Because in many major cities in the United States, we're up to 60 percent cheaper than taxi fares when we're not surging. And, you know, what that means is that, you know, you can surge like 2. 1 and still be coming basically out even if you had instead just taken a taxi. But even though because Uber drivers are in such an efficient system, they constantly have a paying rider in the back of the car, they are actually making more than they would have if they had been working as a taxi driver, framing this to them - oh, you're making 60 percent less per mile than you would if you were driving a taxi, that's - that would be a cost of this pricing system.

The rule says anyone who makes less than about $47,000 a year should receive time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week. The measure is one of the most sweeping moves the Obama administration has made in an effort to boost slow-growing incomes. It's facing huge opposition from some business owners though. Joining us in the studio now to explain the new rule is Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Good morning, Secretary. TOM PEREZ: Good morning, Renee. Great to be with you and your listeners. MONTAGNE: And good to have you. How many workers, and in what kinds of jobs, will be affected? PEREZ: Sure. We estimate that there will be 4. 2 million workers who will be directly affected. And these are workers who are currently ineligible for overtime because the current rule is really out of date. And these workers can make - they're making $24,000 a year working 70 hours a week. And what's interesting about that 4. 2 million is that they are people with a college degree - more than 50 percent. More than 50 percent are women. 2. 5 million children will be in a household that benefits from this. And then there's another 9 million workers, roughly, who are managers who are currently misclassified. That administrative assistant who makes $35,000 right now, works 50 hours a week - very important work, but doesn't do any supervisory work - so is entitled to overtime but isn't getting it, we estimate that there's about three-quarters of a million of those who are improperly being denied overtime. So a lot of people are going to get helped. MONTAGNE: Well, let me just say this, clarify something you just said. This applies to people who are ineligible because the rule is out of date. And I would just say that it does double the threshold under which workers receive overtime. But when this rule went into effect in the 1970s, in today's dollars, that threshold was even lower than it is now. But let me say this. Not surprisingly, some business owners are unhappy with this. The National Retail Federation, for one, says the White House has gone too far. Take a listen to what David French has to say. DAVID FRENCH: Change in the overtime rule does not mean more overtime pay. What our members have told us, what many other employers have told us is that there's not a golden pot of money out there sitting in employers pockets that all of a sudden they can pay a lot more in the way of overtime pay. MONTAGNE: Now, that's the National Retail Federation. One thing they might do is, say, not authorize overtime. PEREZ: Well, you know, the workers are going to benefit in three different ways, Renee. Some workers are going to get more money. And we estimate $12 billion over the next 10 years. Some workers are going to get the benefit of time because right now, there's so many workers who are working 60-70 hours a week. And they're basically working 20-30 hours for free. It's not freedom to work for free. So they get the benefit of time. And all workers who are involved in this get the benefit of clarity. And that's what it's about. Because this rule is about vindicating and restoring two basic principles, which is that, middle-class jobs deserve middle-class pay. And when you work extra, you should get paid extra. That's what this is about. It's very simple, but it's very bedrock. MONTAGNE: All right. Well, thank you very much for joining us. PEREZ: Pleasure to be with you. MONTAGNE: Tom Perez is the U. S.

I'm talking about water. That's one reason I head to Fort Collins, Colo. this week for the latest in a series of NPR events focused on important issues that we call our Going There series. Our event in Fort Collins is called The Future of Water. But first, we want to dig into a recent report by the World Bank that addresses climate change, water and economic growth. According to the report, the impact of climate change will be felt mainly through water. Water scarcity, already a problem, could dramatically slow down world economic growth, push more people to migrate and spark even more global conflict. But not all hope is lost. The report also says that potentially affected countries can mitigate the effects of water scarcity by taking action now to use water more efficiently. We wanted to talk more about this, so we called the lead author, World Bank lead environmental economist Richard Damania. And we reached him in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Mr. Damania, thank you so much for speaking with us. RICHARD DAMANIA: Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: What does this report pull together? What does it accomplish that previous ones have not, in your view? DAMANIA: I think there are two important things that this report highlights. The first is that as you suggested earlier - that the major impacts of climate change are felt through water, things like more intense rainfall, droughts, cyclones. Indeed, I'm here in Colombo and it's pouring with rain. And there's a threat of floods, which are unseasonal and unexpected. And that's one of the things that the report highlights. It also highlights that if you happen to have in some senses the misfortune of living in an area that's dry, most likely you're going to get even drier. Another important point - we all know that we need water to live, but seldom do we recognize that the economy also needs water. MARTIN: The report says that water scarcity exacerbated by climate change could cost some regions up to 6 percent of GDP. How did you arrive at that figure? DAMANIA: We combined a model of climate change with a hydrological cycle, and then we fed through what would be the likely consequences of climate change - shrinking, shriveling supplies of water - on economic growth. If you don't have the water and your business needs water, of course this is going to increase your costs. Costs go up, therefore growth tends to be affected by it. So it's quite logical. MARTIN: It is quite logical. I mean, in a way it seems as though it's an issue that's hiding in plain sight. DAMANIA: I think that's partly because we tend to take water for granted. We assume that it's so abundant. And we really are set for a somewhat different world to what we've been experiencing in the past. MARTIN: Now the report does call for three sort of overarching policy priorities to help lead countries to what you call climate-resilient economies. What would such a framework look like? How would such a thing occur? DAMANIA: So what the report tries to emphasize is that if you have a shortage of water, there's really only three things that you can do. You can try to increase the supply of water, but that's dreadfully expensive. Or you could go to really expensive solutions like desalination or water reuse. But a lot more effort needs to be spent on managing demand. Today, in a lot of countries that are water scarce, more water is lost through leaking pipes than is actually delivered to people in their faucets. We also observe that in a lot of countries that are awfully dry, we provide them with, say, irrigation and they tend to grow rice and water-thirsty crops where really - in deserts and arid regions where one shouldn't be growing those water-thirsty crops. So these are the kinds of shifts that need to actually happen. But they are long-term shifts, and we need to start preparing and making them.

S. confronted the reality that their houses were worth only a fraction of what they paid for them. And to this day, even though the recession is over, more than 6 million homeowners in the U. S. are still upside down on their mortgages. For The Record today, staying afloat after your house goes underwater. (MUSIC)MARTIN: We're going to hear the stories of two people who lost their homes in the mortgage crisis. First. . . BRIAN BURNS: My name is Brian Burns. I am 50 years old. I live in Las Vegas, Nev. I've been here for 26 years. MARTIN: Over two decades, Brian watched Vegas grow and grow some more. He saw dirt roads in the desert transformed by construction projects. The land was available and it was cheap. And by 2004. . . BURNS: The housing prices were skyrocketing. The builders could not keep up with the demand. Land prices went through the roof because there was such a demand. MARTIN: Brian and his then wife had bought into the dream. They lived in a huge house. BURNS: Thirty-five hundred square feet probably. There was parts of the house that you never even saw. That's how big it was. MARTIN: And around this time, a realtor friend convinced him to sell. And, yeah, he turned a pretty good profit. BURNS: That house that I had bought for $252,000 my friend sold for $645,000 three years later. I had never had remotely that much money before in my life, probably had never had more than 10 or $15,000 in the bank before. And I took $40 out one time and I showed my friend my ATM receipt. And it said $228,000 balance. And we just looked at each other and laughed. It was ridiculous. I mean, it was just - I didn't know what to do with it. MARTIN: He decided to keep in the bank. And he decided to buy another smaller house in the town of Henderson, Nev. It was a brand new development - not a lot of charm. BURNS: They're all stucco tile roof. They're all tan or brown or light tan, but they're all the same. MARTIN: Brian didn't care though. He convinced some of his friends to buy other houses in the neighborhood. He had cash in the bank, amazing credit. And he had put no money down. Life was good. So that's the first half of Brian's story. Let's bring in the second voice. GUILLERMO GALINDO: Hi, my name is Guillermo Galindo. I'm living right here in Medford, Mass. At this point, I am an assistant for my wife - family childcare. MARTIN: Guillermo and his wife bought their house in Revere, Mass. , back in 2005. They paid $450,000 for it - put about 5 percent down and ended up with a monthly mortgage payment of about $2,000. Guillermo had a job delivering medical supplies. And they got monthly payments from a family that rented the unit on the second floor of their house. Guillermo and his wife lived there for a few years with their baby daughter. And life felt like it was supposed to - stable, secure. When did things start to change? GALINDO: Well, what happened from my work, they cut my hours just about 20 percent at first. MARTIN: This was in 2008. GALINDO: And I think their interest rate went up a little bit at first and then. . . MARTIN: On your mortgage, so you had an adjustable mortgage? GALINDO: On my mortgage, exactly. And then the people from upstairs, to top it off, this girl had a baby and then she had problems with her husband. MARTIN: These were Guillermo's tenets. Remember the couple who lived in the other unit. Eventually the young woman's husband abandoned her and the baby. GALINDO: At the end, she just was left alone there and she stopped paying rent. MARTIN: Oh no. GALINDO: So that was another income that I couldn't get any more. MARTIN: And you couldn't kick - you didn't kick her out? GALINDO: No, no, I couldn't. I - you know. MARTIN: But that meant Guillermo was now really struggling to make his mortgage payments. Around the same time, he found out his home had lost a huge amount of its value - about 50 percent. So he got in touch with his bank, hoping to work out a deal. GALINDO: And then they asked me for more papers. And I sent them all. That was back and forth, back and forth until they finally said that they couldn't help me, that the price was that. And they couldn't do anything. (MUSIC)MARTIN: Across the country, in Las Vegas, Brian had also seen the value of his home plummet. BURNS: I think everybody's dream when you're a normal person and not super rich, not super poor, is that your home is kind of your biggest asset, that you feel like I'm going to play by the rules. I'm going to pay my mortgage. It's just going to continue to increase in value - maybe not by leaps and bounds but by no means should it be worth a third of what you paid for it. And it started to scare everybody. MARTIN: Brian found out that the house he bought for $320,000 was now worth only $140,000. At the same time, his work as a graphic designer was drying up. And even though he could have used his savings to stay in his house, he didn't want to. It felt like a dead-end. He made a choice to stop paying his mortgage. BURNS: I felt really bad back then that I was doing what I did. I wasn't raised that way to not honor your obligations, and do the right thing and pay your bills on time. My credit score was perfect. In fact, when I bought that little house, the guy said, we're willing to give you no down because you have one of the best credit scores I've ever - I've been doing this 20 years, and your credit score is like 850 points or something like that. And he said, I've never even seen one that high. MARTIN: And again, he could have used his savings to keep paying his mortgage payments, but he thought that was a bad idea. BURNS: The analogy I used back then is I'm not going to pay Mercedes prices for a Kia. You know, why would I pay $320,000 for a house that's never going to be worth that? MARTIN: He had a big garage sale - got rid of all his furniture. The decision destroyed his credit, but Brian didn't care. He let the bank take his house and he moved to Oregon to start over. (MUSIC)MARTIN: Guillermo was in a different situation because he didn't want to leave. GALINDO: I thought it was going to be, you know, to pass it on to my daughter. I thought it was something that it will last for my remaining life (laughter). MARTIN: His life savings were wrapped up in that house. He kept talking with the bank, trying to figure out how to stay. Eventually, they sent him a letter saying they were foreclosing. He fought it for another five months and finally said, fine, take it. They gave him $3,000 and he handed over the keys. Do you remember any of that day, that last day when you left the house and just what that felt like? GALINDO: It was very depressing for me. And I was trying to show my best face to my wife and my daughter. I remember we had a dog because that was one of the things that I - we promised my daughter that if we had our own house we could be able to have a dog. And the one thing that we start thinking about getting rid of was the dog. And it was really, really, really heartbreaking for me to find the words to tell my little one, who was probably 3 - probably 3 years by then - that we were going to have to get rid of the dog. So, believe it or not, I wasn't even thinking on anything else but how we were going to tell, you know, her that her dog was going to have to go. (MUSIC)MARTIN: Eventually, Brian Burns moved back to Las Vegas. He lives in an apartment with his fianc\u00e9e. They're renting and feel really gun-shy about buying anything, mainly because it doesn't seem like the housing crisis in Vegas is over. Roughly 20 percent of homeowners are still underwater there. And it doesn't look like a recovery. BURNS: I go golfing and I walk down these fairways, and I look over and I see these gigantic empty homes. And I drive up into suburbia Las Vegas and there's streets still of empty houses - no curtains, no nothing. Weeds in the yard. There are still a lot of empty houses in this town. MARTIN: Guillermo Galindo now lives with his wife and daughter in Medford, Mass. They rent an apartment. There are two main rooms - one where Guillermo and his wife sleep. The other they use as a day care facility. When all the children leave at 6 p. m. , Guillermo's now 12-year-old daughter converts it into her bedroom. GALINDO: My daughter is still (laughter) - just still thinking about having a house. And the first thing she's going to do is to get a dog. I feel very proud of her. She's getting high honors. She's been adapting really good. MARTIN: Guillermo's credit rating is still in the tank because of the foreclosure. And he doesn't have any money for a down payment, so buying another house is not an option right now. And it might not be for a long time. How has this whole ordeal changed how you think about home ownership and how important it is to you whether or not it's a measure of success? GALINDO: When you commit to a house, you want it to be forever. You don't want to buy a house and then get rid of it. And the fact that something like that happened, it makes me feel like failure at first. So it becomes more than a dream. It becomes like a nightmare. And it's something that you really have to be making sure that that will not mark or stay with you forever. MARTIN: That was Guillermo Galindo of Medford, Mass. , and Brian Burns of Las Vegas, Nev. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is For The Record. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE BIG SHORT\") STEVE CARELL: (As Mark Baum) Wall Street took a good idea and turned it into an atomic bomb of fraud and stupidity that's on its way to decimating the world economy. MARTIN: That was a clip from \"The Big Short,\" the Oscar award-winning film about the winners and losers in the mortgage crisis and the global economic meltdown that ensued. Before it hit, real estate seemed like a surefire bet. And pretty much anyone could buy a house - no money down, thousands of square feet, second and third vacation homes. And then the bubble popped. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The worst financial crisis in modern times - certainly the largest financial disaster in decades in this country.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is Hangin' On, our series about the economic pressures of American life. And today, we're talking about overtime. Lots of people work way more than 40 hours a week in this country. And they don't see a bump for that extra time. The Obama administration is trying to change that. And this past week, the Labor Department announced new rules that raise the threshold for people eligible for overtime pay. Annie Lowrey writes about the economy for New York Magazine. And she joins me now. Hi, Annie. ANNIE LOWREY: Hey, there. MARTIN: Can you, Annie, give us a simple explanation of what's being proposed and roughly how many people it could potentially impact? LOWREY: Sure. So right now you can receive overtime pay, in some cases, if you're making money per hour and in other cases if you are a salaried employee who is making less than $23,660 a year. The Obama administration just moved that cutoff, which is a federal regulation, up to $47,476 a year. And so that has made about 4. 2 million workers eligible for time and a half when they work more than 40 hours a week. MARTIN: I imagine there are a lot of people in the business world who have opinions about this. Is this something that's going to end up being prohibitively expensive for businesses? LOWREY: Yeah, businesses hate this (laughter), especially businesses that have a lot of workers in this wage band 'cause it really does just force them to, first of all, ensure that they have a system to make sure that they know how many hours their employees are working and second, to pay them more. But the Obama administration has basically said - you know what? -on net, we think that this is good for workers. They've tried a lot of policies to help flush more money to these middle-class families, some of which have succeeded, some of which have failed. MARTIN: So there are people on Capitol Hill who don't think this is necessarily such a good idea, a lot of Republicans in particular. But is there anything Congress can do to keep it from happening? LOWREY: So Congress can't stop it through the Congressional Review Act. That said, they can attach a rider to legislation or pass legislation blocking it. The question is whether they're going to do that because if they don't do anything, then this is going to come into effect on December 1. And so, it's certainly possible that Republicans in Congress could block it. But this is a fight that the White House wants. You know, they want to say, hey, this going out to 4. 2 million relatively low-income or middle-income workers. And these Republicans, you know, want to make sure that you have a small enough paycheck. That's a pretty good talking point for them, they think, because it forces Republicans to basically, you know, go back to the argument that this is bad for business, which is, in the White House's view, probably a  less powerful talking point. MARTIN: What is the real impact? I mean, will this have a real impact on wages? Or is this more of a political statement in an election season? LOWREY: It will have absolutely an impact on a lot of workers' earnings. That said, there are a lot of businesses that are going to make changes to kind of blunt that impact. So for instance, they might say to some of their workers - we're really sorry, but we you can't work more than 40 hours a week. Similarly, they could also set base pay a little bit lower so that even with the overtime added, the overall pay that they're giving to a given worker in a year is not so much affected. But, you know, the bulk of the evidence suggests that, yeah, this is going to help force more money to this pool of workers. And part of the reason is that, you know, say that you're a salaried worker who's making $35,000 a year again, right? It's pretty hard for your employer to come to you and say, hey, we're reducing your base pay by $3,500, you know, in order to make up for this overtime rule. Those prices for workers tend to be kind of sticky. And workers really don't like that when employers negotiate them down in that way. And so for that reason, it's going to help ensure that those workers are just getting a raise that the White House wants to make sure that they get. MARTIN: Annie Lowrey of New York Magazine.

I'm standing in front of a JCPenney which closed last month. And about 200 feet away, I can see a Macy's which closed last year. When it opened in 1986, it was anchored by a Saks Fifth Avenue and catered to well-to-do Baltimore suburbanites. The mall's owner, Kimco Realty, is planning a multimillion dollar revamp. Like many malls that are trying to reattract customers, it will include a movie theater and restaurants. But it will not include a department store. Jan Rogers Kniffen is a retail consultant familiar with the Owings Mills project. He says the developers are hoping outdoor shopping without department stores will pay off. JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: They're trying to make it more interesting and more experiential, and so they're turning it inside out (laughter) and making it open-air. Whether that'll be a solution or not, I don't know. NOGUCHI: I am of Generation X, and the social epicenter of my suburban St. Louis youth was the mall. Kniffen says mall rats are no more. KNIFFEN: The culture is dead. You were the last generation that went and hung out at the mall. NOGUCHI: People shop where they socialize, and that's increasingly online. In less than 15 years, he anticipates half of sales will be web-based, which hits department stores especially hard. Decades ago, department sores were so valued, developers gave them the land underneath their stores. KNIFFEN: If you were building one today, you wouldn't give that deal to an anchor because they're not a good enough attraction. NOGUCHI: In fact, the most trouble stores like Sears are selling off their best real estate to survive, and more closures are expected. Real estate research firm Green Street Advisors ranks the 1,100 malls in the U. S. by grade. Those with the richest demographics, brands and highest foot traffic get As. A third of the country's malls rank C-plus or lower, and Green Street says many department stores in those locations will likely have to close. Higher rated malls have Apple stores and luxury and specialty apparel brands like Bonobos or Warby Parker that use their stores as showrooms. There's also a lot of emphasis on experiential retail - sitdown restaurant, gyms, movie theaters - because that's where people are spending money. Kniffen, the consultant, says in other cases, malls are adding offices and residences. KNIFFEN: Mixed use, people think, is the savior, right? If you can get people to live at the mall, you have an immediate clientele for your restaurants, right? NOGUCHI: But some malls simply don't have the demographics to draw desirable retail or residential tenants. Some of those are converting into doctors offices, churches and even for-profit prisons. A handful of others are identifying new niche uses for malls that veer from the mainstream. Jose de Jesus Legaspi is president of The Legaspi Company which purchases old malls and turns them into retail centers targeted at the Hispanic community. The company owns three and has developed a dozen others. JOSE DE JESUS LEGASPI: We're selling ambience. We're selling an environment. NOGUCHI: The malls host regular concerts, mariachi band classes and holiday festivities. Where there are vacant department stores, local entrepreneurs open stalls and kiosks as a kind of retail incubator. The effect is like an international bazaar where the community comes to hang out. LEGASPI: I mean, they'll come in right after mass, for example, and they'll stay until 6, 7, 8 o'clock at night. NOGUCHI: And of course they spend. The mall's revenue spiked 20 percent after Legaspi made the changes. Even the sales at the department stores that remain in his malls have increased too because they can target their products and marketing to a specific community. LEGASPI: Bringing Hispanic-oriented retailers helps as what I call an aggregate anchor for the other national retailers. NOGUCHI: Legaspi's malls target areas with dense Hispanic populations, but he says malls that target other populations could work elsewhere, too. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

That's according to a Wall Street Journal article published earlier this week. According to the report, it looks like banks are feeling better about lending and we are feeling better about borrowing. We wanted to know whether this is a good thing for the U. S. economy and for us as consumers. And to shed some light on the issue, we're joined here in studio by Mike Calhoun. He's president of the Center for Responsible Lending. Welcome to the program. MIKE CALHOUN: Thank you so much for having me. CORNISH: So after the financial crisis, how much had we dialed back on our credit card usage? CALHOUN: Families paid off a lot of their credit card debt after the crisis and have only slowly been adding back to that. And the milestone here is that credit card debt is now back up where it was in 2008, 2009. And given that the economy has grown and the number of households have grown, it's even on a per-household level still a little less than it was at the peak. So the good news is it reflects a recovering economy and that consumers feel better about their future and so are willing to take on some more debt. CORNISH: What about the banks? Because we had heard for so long that they had pulled back in terms of lending to consumers. Has the pendulum swung back the other way already? CALHOUN: The banks are being much more aggressive in offering credit cards and expanding the amount that borrowers can take out on their credit cards. So banks are very aggressive because it's perhaps their most profitable line of business. CORNISH: After the crisis, we also heard a lot about so-called Wall Street reform. What's different about the financial industry now that we should think about as we take on more debt and as they offer it? CALHOUN: In 2009, Congress passed major reform of credit cards. And people remember it used to be so easy to get hit with all these late fees or sudden surprise increases in the interest rate on your card. Those have largely been prohibited. Estimates are that over the last four years, those changes save people over $20 billion in fees. So credit cards are much safer and more transparent. It's much more you see what you get with a quoted rate rather than they're going to raise the rate later or add a bunch of fees. Credit cards still come with dangers, though. For most borrowers, if you make the minimum payment it'll take you 20 years or more to pay off the balance. And that's assuming you don't charge anything new. The interest rates are still relatively high. Today's average interest rate on a card with a balance is more than 13 percent. And for families who carry a balance, that works out to about $1,500 a year that they're paying just in interest, not on paying down the balance. CORNISH: Do you see any trends in other areas? Say, auto loans or mortgages? CALHOUN: So we have seen similar trends in mortgages in terms of there were major reforms passed in 2010. And the kind of dangerous exploding mortgages that were at the heart of the financial crisis are no longer offered out there because there are now tighter restrictions on them. And so again, mortgages are much more transparent and much safer for households. We have not yet had those reforms in the auto lending area. And so there have been red flags raised there of loans with higher default, people getting into loans that they can't sustain. And so people need to watch out for that particularly in the auto loan area. CORNISH: Mike Calhoun is president of the Center for Responsible Lending. Thank you for coming in.

For the first time in more than a hundred years, younger adults - those aged 18 to 34 - are more likely to be living in their parents homes than with a partner or spouse. In a few minutes, we're going to talk about this in our Barbershop roundtable. We've pulled together a group of millennials who've been thinking about this. But first, let's talk about the study with Kim Parker, director of social trends at the Pew Research Center, and she helped with the report. Kim, thanks so much for joining us. KIM PARKER: Thanks so much for having me. MARTIN: What are some of the factors that are fueling this - that are fueling this? I assume there's more than one. PARKER: The main driving force is the sort of downward trend in the share of young adults who are married, and part of that is explained by the fact that young adults are marrying later in life. But part of it also has to do with other factors. One is educational attainment. There are different patterns by race and ethnicity, and there are also some economic factors that are really playing into this and particularly affecting young adults who don't have a college degree. Employment among that group is down and wages are down. And those things make it a lot harder for young people to get out and establish their own households. MARTIN: The fact of the matter is millennials are probably the most diverse demographic in our history - right? - and so if you come from, say, an immigrant background, it's not considered so terrible to live with your parents. In fact, that's the norm in a lot of cultures. Is that a factor? PARKER: We do find the rates of young adults living at home, and also more broadly multigenerational households are more common among new immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities. But when you just look at the patterns of what's been going on with whites, you see a similar uptick in the shared living with parents and a downward trend in the share who are marrying or living with romantic partners. MARTIN: One more question - gender. Do you find that young men or young women are more likely to live with their parents? Is there a difference there? PARKER: We do find a difference. Young men are more likely than young women to be living with their parents. This actually became the dominant living arrangement in 2009, so they hit the tipping point a few years back. MARTIN: Why do we think that is? Do we have any idea why that is? PARKER: Overall, employment rates among young men are down significantly in recent decades, and wages have also fallen a lot especially for young men without a college education. But one thing that was really interesting for the young women was that, you know, a few decades ago, like 1960, 1970, young women who were employed were actually more likely to be living at home because they were a lot less likely to marry. But then things changed and married women started entering the workforce in bigger numbers, and then, you know, you see a different pattern. MARTIN: That's Kim Parker, director of social trends at the Pew Research Center. Kim, thanks so much for speaking with us. PARKER: Thank you so much.

I'm Rachel Martin. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think most people hate to think of themselves as middle class (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Have what you need but maybe not everything you want? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have a car, but we live in an apartment. That's middle class. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: If you add a boat, then you're not middle class anymore. That's what changes it right there. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The middle class are families who are earning six figures. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Thirty thousand, $35,000, probably. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: That means me (laughter). And it means I'm in trouble (laughter). MARTIN: This is Hangin' On, our series about the economic pressures of American life. And today, we're going to talk about how coming of age in a recession can affect how a person thinks about money and debt. This is the case for a lot of millennials. And we're going to hear from three of them. First, Austin Prater - he grew up on a small family farm in Akron, Ind. AUSTIN PRATER: Tiny little town in Indiana. No stop lights, just a four-way stop in the middle of town. MARTIN: Austin has about $85,000 in student loans. And paying them down is his primary goal, in large part because of his family's own experience in the recession. PRATER: My parents had a pretty steady working life. But then when the crisis hit, I remember, specifically, my mom taking a second full-time job, my dad, who was injured at the time, getting notices through the mail saying - or reporting the losses each month that he was getting on all of his investments. And just watching money go out and them constantly talking about - well, should we just cash out now, pull the money out now and take the loss? Or do we hang in there? MARTIN: Next, Amanda Jones - she works in tech in Melbourne, Fla. Debt feels inevitable to her. AMANDA JONES: Unfortunately, I feel like it's just a way of life. And I, of course, would like to be debt-free. But as it stands, my life right now I'm just in debt. And that's how it's going to be for the foreseeable future. MARTIN: But she's saving money where she can. JONES: Growing up at this point in time, it definitely drilled that into me that you never know what's going to happen in the future. So you want to make sure you have a cushion. MARTIN: And finally, Kaylie Burns Gahagan of Minneapolis, Minn. KAYLIE BURNS GAHAGAN: You know, I was the kind of kid that saved all my birthday money. MARTIN: Kaylie has a good job in the public school system out there. And while she isn't too stressed about her student loans, she feels like she's making decisions in the dark. BURNS GAHAGAN: Had there been someone that was willing to give me advice, I would have had a lot less bumpy of a road until now. MARTIN: So we brought in someone who could answer their questions. His name is Jude Boudreaux, and he's a financial planner in New Orleans. He advises young professionals about cash flow, retirement, savings, all of that. BURNS GAHAGAN: I have a question, Jude. This is Kaylie. So I grew up in a family that wasn't financially sound. And I am at a point in my life where I've got a 403(b), I've got term life insurance. I've got a few different savings strategies. And my husband and I bought a house two years ago. And we're really thinking about what's next as far as investments go. And how do I know whether I'm more of a conservative investor, or if I'm willing to take those risks? JUDE BOUDREAUX: Well, I think the general wisdom has always been you're younger. You should take more risk. And I don't really think that's valid any longer. The biggest question I always have is can you live with it? Can you stick it out if there's a downturn in this kind of an investment? And just because there's more potential return, if I'm going to get so much anxiety, I'm not going to be able to sleep at night, I'm going to have to sell that investment during a bad market, that's a bad investment for me. MARTIN: Jude, what are the metrics of measuring whether or not someone is conservative or can tolerate a little more risk? Because just because you're a saver, in general, and, like, a responsible human, as these three sound to be. . . BOUDREAUX: Sure. MARTIN: Does that mean that you're going to assign them the most conservative portfolio strategy? Or what are the other kinds of questions you ask? BOUDREAUX: Well, I think the first question always when I ask people when they - we're trying to determine where you are is really kind of the background story that they all shared of - what was money like growing up? When you think about what they've gone through, they've gone through two of the biggest financial downturns since the Great Depression. So that's already enough to shake somebody's confidence right when they're starting out with investing. We then have their family situations. When you see what's happened with their parents, I don't think they're any more or less conservative or aggressive than a 40, 50-year-old client's cohort. But I think they're not this universally aggressive stance that is kind of pushed on them from the financial world. MARTIN: Great. OK. I'll just ask each of you. Amanda, do you have a specific question for Jude? JONES: Yes. I'm actually considering doing somewhat of a career change and taking on some paid internships and some temporary positions. I was wondering if you had any advice or recommendations for people who may be in the gig economy. And should I work on investing, saving. . . MARTIN: That's a good question because so many people live in that world now. BOUDREAUX: Absolutely. And so I think anything where your income is going to be rather lumpy, accumulate cash. If things go bad and we don't have some cash to back us up, we're going to start to accumulate some credit card debt. And having extra cash, I often talk to people about - oh, well, savings accounts returns are so low. And that's absolutely true. We're at historic lows. And that hopefully will get better but not anytime soon. The reason we're saving that money is not because we think we're going to go and get a quarter of a percent in our savings account. The purpose is to help protect us from any of those uncertain things that might come up, whether that's a job opportunity that requires us to move across the country or I'm going to try to start a business. If we have cash, it provides us a lot of ability to ride that out. MARTIN: Good advice. Austin, do you have a question you wanted to put to Jude? PRATER: Yes. It kind of rolls right along with those. With me focusing 100 percent on debt for whatever money I have left over after normal expenses and maintaining that savings amount, should I continue to place 100 percent of that towards debt? Or should I maybe put 90 percent and put the rest toward a Roth IRA or a 401(k), not so much that I'm going to get a better return on that money, but just to get the proverbial ball rolling? MARTIN: Yeah. Jude? BOUDREAUX: Yeah, I'm going to answer this two different ways, if that's all right. MARTIN: Sure. BOUDREAUX: You know, again, so the rational, kind of financial purely numbers way would be to say, yes, if you start to put money into Roth IRA now and we let it compound for 35 years, you're going to have more than if we start one year from now and do the same thing for 34 years. So that's true. But I think when we come down to actual life standpoints, paying the additional money towards the debts to clear that off and to get free of that issue is going to provide us a greater return on life, if you will. So if paying off those debts and really making that the focus and meaning you're starting a few years later a little bit further behind from a retirement savings standpoint, but you can do that in a life and in a place that you want to be in for the next 20 or 30 years, I don't feel like that's a bad trade-off. MARTIN: In closing, I would ask each of you - Amanda, Kaylie and Austin - how you think about your financial future. Do you let yourself dream? And if you do, what are your financial goals? Amanda? JONES: I am thinking about paying off my student loans, paying off my car loan, ultimately owning a house or a tiny home at some point in the future and just being financially secure, not having to worry about all this debt looming over me for the rest of my life. That would be my goal. MARTIN: But you do think about owning a home? JONES: A tiny home. MARTIN: A tiny - oh, a tiny - like an actual - one of these tiny, tiny things. JONES: It's a dream right now. But it's definitely something I would like to achieve. MARTIN: Austin? PRATER: It's funny that Amanda mentions the tiny home because that's a similar thought that I've had. So if I decided to travel, I could travel for six months working and come back and have a low-overhead home. But the main appeal of everything is just having the flexibility without any of the concerns. MARTIN: Kaylie? BURNS GAHAGAN: I was kind of giggling because I own a tiny home. But it's just a small house. (LAUGHTER)BURNS GAHAGAN: It's not actually, like, a cool tiny house. MARTIN: It's not actually a trendy, cool tiny home. BURNS GAHAGAN: No. MARTIN: It just is tiny. BURNS GAHAGAN: No, it's just itty-bitty. But I think that my goal is to have a family and to be a family that can actually go on vacation, that doesn't have to worry about debt. I would really like not to accrue more debt besides a home and possibly a car here and there. But that's my dream. MARTIN: Well, it has been a fascinating conversation. Thanks to all of you for having it with us, Amanda Jones, Kaylie Gahagan and Austin Prater. We were also joined by Jude Boudreaux. He's a financial advisor from New Orleans, La. Thanks to all of you. BOUDREAUX: Thanks, Rachel. PRATER: Thank you. BURNS GAHAGAN: Thank you. JONES: Thank you, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think most people hate to think of themselves as middle class (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Have what you need but maybe not everything you want? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have a car, but we live in an apartment. That's middle class. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: If you add a boat, then you're not middle class anymore. That's what changes it right there. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The middle class are families who are earning six figures. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Thirty thousand, $35,000, probably. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: That means me (laughter). And it means I'm in trouble (laughter). MARTIN: This is Hangin' On, our series about the economic pressures of American life. And today, we're going to talk about how coming of age in a recession can affect how a person thinks about money and debt. This is the case for a lot of millennials. And we're going to hear from three of them. First, Austin Prater - he grew up on a small family farm in Akron, Ind. AUSTIN PRATER: Tiny little town in Indiana. No stop lights, just a four-way stop in the middle of town. MARTIN: Austin has about $85,000 in student loans. And paying them down is his primary goal, in large part because of his family's own experience in the recession. PRATER: My parents had a pretty steady working life. But then when the crisis hit, I remember, specifically, my mom taking a second full-time job, my dad, who was injured at the time, getting notices through the mail saying - or reporting the losses each month that he was getting on all of his investments. And just watching money go out and them constantly talking about - well, should we just cash out now, pull the money out now and take the loss? Or do we hang in there? MARTIN: Next, Amanda Jones - she works in tech in Melbourne, Fla. Debt feels inevitable to her. AMANDA JONES: Unfortunately, I feel like it's just a way of life. And I, of course, would like to be debt-free. But as it stands, my life right now I'm just in debt. And that's how it's going to be for the foreseeable future. MARTIN: But she's saving money where she can. JONES: Growing up at this point in time, it definitely drilled that into me that you never know what's going to happen in the future. So you want to make sure you have a cushion. MARTIN: And finally, Kaylie Burns Gahagan of Minneapolis, Minn. KAYLIE BURNS GAHAGAN: You know, I was the kind of kid that saved all my birthday money. MARTIN: Kaylie has a good job in the public school system out there. And while she isn't too stressed about her student loans, she feels like she's making decisions in the dark. BURNS GAHAGAN: Had there been someone that was willing to give me advice, I would have had a lot less bumpy of a road until now. MARTIN: So we brought in someone who could answer their questions. His name is Jude Boudreaux, and he's a financial planner in New Orleans. He advises young professionals about cash flow, retirement, savings, all of that. BURNS GAHAGAN: I have a question, Jude. This is Kaylie. So I grew up in a family that wasn't financially sound. And I am at a point in my life where I've got a 403(b), I've got term life insurance. I've got a few different savings strategies. And my husband and I bought a house two years ago. And we're really thinking about what's next as far as investments go. And how do I know whether I'm more of a conservative investor, or if I'm willing to take those risks? JUDE BOUDREAUX: Well, I think the general wisdom has always been you're younger. You should take more risk. And I don't really think that's valid any longer. The biggest question I always have is can you live with it? Can you stick it out if there's a downturn in this kind of an investment? And just because there's more potential return, if I'm going to get so much anxiety, I'm not going to be able to sleep at night, I'm going to have to sell that investment during a bad market, that's a bad investment for me. MARTIN: Jude, what are the metrics of measuring whether or not someone is conservative or can tolerate a little more risk? Because just because you're a saver, in general, and, like, a responsible human, as these three sound to be. . . BOUDREAUX: Sure. MARTIN: Does that mean that you're going to assign them the most conservative portfolio strategy? Or what are the other kinds of questions you ask? BOUDREAUX: Well, I think the first question always when I ask people when they - we're trying to determine where you are is really kind of the background story that they all shared of - what was money like growing up? When you think about what they've gone through, they've gone through two of the biggest financial downturns since the Great Depression. So that's already enough to shake somebody's confidence right when they're starting out with investing. We then have their family situations. When you see what's happened with their parents, I don't think they're any more or less conservative or aggressive than a 40, 50-year-old client's cohort. But I think they're not this universally aggressive stance that is kind of pushed on them from the financial world. MARTIN: Great. OK. I'll just ask each of you. Amanda, do you have a specific question for Jude? JONES: Yes. I'm actually considering doing somewhat of a career change and taking on some paid internships and some temporary positions. I was wondering if you had any advice or recommendations for people who may be in the gig economy. And should I work on investing, saving. . . MARTIN: That's a good question because so many people live in that world now. BOUDREAUX: Absolutely. And so I think anything where your income is going to be rather lumpy, accumulate cash. If things go bad and we don't have some cash to back us up, we're going to start to accumulate some credit card debt. And having extra cash, I often talk to people about - oh, well, savings accounts returns are so low. And that's absolutely true. We're at historic lows. And that hopefully will get better but not anytime soon. The reason we're saving that money is not because we think we're going to go and get a quarter of a percent in our savings account. The purpose is to help protect us from any of those uncertain things that might come up, whether that's a job opportunity that requires us to move across the country or I'm going to try to start a business. If we have cash, it provides us a lot of ability to ride that out. MARTIN: Good advice. Austin, do you have a question you wanted to put to Jude? PRATER: Yes. It kind of rolls right along with those. With me focusing 100 percent on debt for whatever money I have left over after normal expenses and maintaining that savings amount, should I continue to place 100 percent of that towards debt? Or should I maybe put 90 percent and put the rest toward a Roth IRA or a 401(k), not so much that I'm going to get a better return on that money, but just to get the proverbial ball rolling? MARTIN: Yeah. Jude? BOUDREAUX: Yeah, I'm going to answer this two different ways, if that's all right. MARTIN: Sure. BOUDREAUX: You know, again, so the rational, kind of financial purely numbers way would be to say, yes, if you start to put money into Roth IRA now and we let it compound for 35 years, you're going to have more than if we start one year from now and do the same thing for 34 years. So that's true. But I think when we come down to actual life standpoints, paying the additional money towards the debts to clear that off and to get free of that issue is going to provide us a greater return on life, if you will. So if paying off those debts and really making that the focus and meaning you're starting a few years later a little bit further behind from a retirement savings standpoint, but you can do that in a life and in a place that you want to be in for the next 20 or 30 years, I don't feel like that's a bad trade-off.

S. employment numbers - not good, pretty bad, far below expectations. That was the reaction when the Labor Department announced just 38,000 jobs were created last month. So is this the beginning of a trend or is it an aberration? NPR economics correspondent John Ystdie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Everyone expected the job growth in May might be a little subdued. Analysts knew a strike by Verizon workers was going to subtract 35,000 jobs from the total. But most economists anticipated about 160,000 jobs would be added. So Diane Swonk of DS Economics says the paltry gains were a body blow. DIANE SWONK: It was a lousy report not only in its total, which was hurt by the Verizon strike, and we know those workers are now back at work so they'll come back in June. But even beyond that, the losses were broader and deeper than we expected, and there were downward revisions to the previous two months. YDSTIE: That put the average job growth for the past three months at about half the pace of last year. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tweeted that the jobs report was terrible. Speaking for the Obama administration, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez acknowledged the numbers were disappointing. But, he argued, a slowdown in job growth is an expected outcome as the economy gets closer to full employment. THOMAS PEREZ: When you're getting close to the summit of the mountain - and we're not at full employment yet, but we're inching closer to it - what ends up happening, you tend to have lower job growth numbers in any given month. But that's offset by the fact that you see wages go up, and that's exactly what we're seeing now. YDSTIE: Wage growth has picked up a bit in recent months. Wages are about 2. 5 percent higher now than a year ago. But in May, they were once again subdued. Dyke Messenger, who runs a small manufacturing firm in Salisbury, N. C. , says Perez's theory makes some sense. His firm Power Curbers builds machines that make curbs and gutters for housing developments and commercial projects. Messenger says he's actually added jobs in the past month to meet demand. But, he says, the workers he needs are getting hard to find. DYKE MESSINGER: We employ mostly skilled labor. And there's real demand, and we've had upward pressure on pay, which in the overall scene is good because, you know, it attracts better people. And people's standard of living rises which helps all of us. YDSTIE: Messenger says he was not surprised to see more jobs lost in manufacturing in May. He points out that firms that make stuff for the oil and gas industry and agriculture are still hurting. But he was surprised to see that the economy lost 15,000 construction jobs because, he says, there's lots of residential and commercial building going on across the country. Economist Diane Swonk who's based in Chicago thinks the lack of skills may be a factor restraining construction hiring, too. She says lots of workers left the industry during the Great Recession. SWONK: Some of those skilled workers just aren't there, especially in the skill trade carpenters, electricians, welders, people that we need on big projects. In fact, even if Chicago, they've had to delay some projects because of an inability to find some of those workers. YDSTIE: Whatever the reason for the lousy May jobs report, Swonk says it will convince the Fed to hold off raising interest rates later this month and possibly skip July, too.

Only 38,000 new jobs were added to payrolls. That is far less than expected. But despite the slow job growth, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since late in 2007. Now, let's try and sort this out with NPR economic correspondent John Ydstie, who is here to talk about this. Good morning, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So am I right that this is mixed messages? Very slow job growth, big drop in the employment rate - what exactly is happening here? YDSTIE: Well, the unemployment rate did fall from 5 percent to 4. 7 percent - but in this case, not a good sign. GREENE: OK. YDSTIE: Because what happened was close to half a million people dropped out of the labor force - according to this government data - and they're no longer counted as unemployed. So the unemployment rate fell not because of strong job growth but because people dropped out. Now, these government surveys can swing dramatically. And so this huge exit from the labor market may correct itself next month. And that means the employment rate could rise again in the coming months. GREENE: Well, in terms of this low job growth number, I mean, does that tell us that there's just not a lot of hiring going on in this country at all? Is that an accurate picture here? YDSTIE: Well, probably not, but this report clearly signals a slowdown in job growth. The numbers from March and April were revised down, so the average job growth for the past three months is only 116,000 jobs. Compare that to the average for the last year, which was about 220,000. That suggests a slowdown in hiring and probably reflects a slowdown in economic growth to below this sort of 2 percent range we've experienced for the past couple of years. GREENE: Are we going to start using the R-word, recession? YDSTIE: No. . . GREENE: The economy will be heading for or no? YDSTIE: . . . I don't think so, David. Even that three-month average of 116,000 is probably low. Remember that the main numbers were skewed downward by the Verizon strike, which took over 35,000 workers off the payrolls. That strike was settled last week, and they'll be going back to work. Also, there was an unexpected drop in construction jobs in May, despite healthy growth in home building. That could correct itself. So probably - more likely, job growth is running in the range of 160 to 170,000. GREENE: You had suggested that there might be - the fed might raise interest rates if job growth looks steady. Do these numbers make that look less likely now? YDSTIE: I think it's off the table for June, certainly, and also less likely for July - maybe September now. GREENE: OK, that's NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie talking about lower-than-expected jobs numbers out this morning. John, thanks a lot. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

S. economy. In less than two weeks, the Federal Reserve will decide whether to boost interest rates for only the second time since the Great Recession. One big factor will be whether the economy is continuing to add jobs at a steady clip. And we'll get a big clue about that later this morning in a new monthly jobs report, as NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Just last week, Fed chair Janet Yellen was asked whether it's time for a second rate hike. And she said this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: Probably in the coming months such a move would be appropriate. YDSTIE: That suggests the Fed could raise rates at its meeting in the middle of this month or in late July. John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, thinks today's jobs report will show the unemployment rate has dropped to just 4. 9 percent, giving the Fed a reason to move. JOHN SILVIA: That is consistent with what some Fed officials have indicated is their estimate of full employment. YDSTIE: Yellen acknowledges the Fed is getting close to its full employment goal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: But the number of individuals working part-time who would like to have full-time jobs is unusually high. YDSTIE: That number is coming down, but Yellen worries it's still much higher than normal. And she remains concerned that wage growth remains too slow. But if both the part-time and wage numbers improve significantly in today's report, they'll provide more support for a rate hike. John Silvia says job growth for May could look a bit weaker than it really is because of a strike at Verizon. Thirty-five-thousand workers there weren't counted as working last month, even though their strike was settled last week. According to a number of surveys, economists think job growth in May totaled around 160,000, about the same pace as April. Silvia thinks it will be a bit weaker than that but still at a pace reflecting steady economic growth. SILVIA: Except for maybe one or two minor sectors, everybody's adding jobs, including the federal government, state governments and certainly in the broad service sectors. YDSTIE: Silvia believes the job market is strong enough to meet the Fed's test for a rate hike. But he thinks it's more likely to come in July than in June. That's because the British vote on whether to stay in the European Union comes just after the Fed's June meeting, and policymakers may worry that a rate hike plus a vote to leave could destabilize global financial markets.

SILVIA: Except for maybe one or two minor sectors, everybody's adding jobs, including the federal government, state governments and certainly in the broad service sectors. YDSTIE: Silvia believes the job market is strong enough to meet the Fed's test for a rate hike. But he thinks it's more likely to come in July than in June. That's because the British vote on whether to stay in the European Union comes just after the Fed's June meeting, and policymakers may worry that a rate hike plus a vote to leave could destabilize global financial markets.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is Hanging On, our series about the economic pressures of American life. And today, we're going to talk about gentrification. It's happening in cities all over the country. People, often white people with money, move into neighborhoods that are less white, where there's less money. New businesses move in. Condos go up. Longtime residents end up moving out. Bobby LeFebre has watched that story play out in his own neighborhood of Northside in Denver. He's a poet and an activist. And his art addresses the complexity of gentrification. Bobby LeFebre joins me now. Thanks so much for being with us. BOBBY LEFEBRE: Absolutely. Thank you for having me. MARTIN: Tell me about the Northside that you grew up in, your neighborhood. LEFEBRE: I have deep roots in the neighborhood. My grandparents and great-grandparents were all living in the neighborhood in the, you know, '50s until today, so long history - long family history there. And when I grew up, you know, the neighborhood was definitely different than it is now. Predominantly a Chicano neighborhood, so there was a lot of mom-and-pop businesses, local restaurants and strong ethnic enclave that had been developed over generations - and so that is sort of being erased with this process right now. MARTIN: How has that manifested? What does the change look like in Northside today? LEFEBRE: The neighborhood has always existed as sort of an immigrant community. From the founding of the neighborhood back in the, you know, 1800s, there were these different identifiable waves of immigrants that came by. You know, the Irish were there. The Germans were there. Before the Mexican and the Chicano community, the Italians had built community there. And our community is the kind of most recent, you know, arrival to the neighborhood. And just about everything in the neighborhood is shifting. Demographics are shifting. We're having lower-income folks that are being forced to move. Real estate has increased rents and home prices resulting in, you know, not only involuntary displacement, but just really a lot of tension around people who had been there for while. MARTIN: So who do you blame? Who do you think bears most of the responsibility? LEFEBRE: I think everyone has a little bit of blame. You know, I blame my own community. I blame myself for not starting to organize sooner. I blame developers who are coming in opportunistically and not caring anything about the character or the history of the neighborhood. And I blame our elected officials who are so concerned with authoring Denver as the next great, world-class city that they're forgetting to write into that story the people who made it great in the first place. MARTIN: Your own neighborhood, as you mentioned, used to be a different kind of place - right? - with Italian immigrants and before that, immigrants from Ireland or Germany. So to some degree, is change just inevitable? LEFEBRE: It is inevitable, absolutely. But the type of change that is occurring at least can be critiqued. So we're having people with more money, more social and political capital coming into these areas. And with that comes a certain ignorance. And I mean that in the, you know, dictionary definition sense of - they don't know necessarily what was here before. And to a large degree, a lot of people that we've spoken to don't necessarily even care. MARTIN: How do you fix that? I mean, when outsiders move into your neighborhood now, do you want to make them part of your community? Or would you rather them create their own separate thing? LEFEBRE: No, no. MARTIN: And if you want that integrated community. . . LEFEBRE: No, no. MARTIN: . . . How do you make the first move? LEFEBRE: It's absolutely necessary for them to become part of the community. But part of that requires a process of unlearning for those folks because a lot of these folks that are moving in benefit enormously from white privilege. And there's sort of a disconnect from that privilege. So the first step is really folks need to unpack some of that and recognize their privilege. They need to learn the history of the neighborhood. They need to become part of the fabric of the neighborhood. They need to stretch themselves outside of their comfort zones and listen to long-term residents. So a lot of the times when we're organizing something or when we're, you know, creating a protest or even an online forum dedicated to discussing gentrification and critiquing it, we get a lot of backlash from people, mostly new residents, who are saying, you know, kind of - get over it. Times change. There's nothing you can do about it. And so we created an online platform called We Are North Denver that really aims to have those conversations. We absolutely want them to be part of the neighborhood. But it requires work on both ends. And if that work's not being done, we're really just creating further segregation and siloing that isn't going to lead to anything good in the neighborhood. MARTIN: Do you think you could share a poem with us? LEFEBRE: Sure. Sure, I could do that. (SOUNDBITE OF POEM, \"DENVER, WHERE HAVE YOU GONE? \")LEFEBRE: I remember when my neighborhood was just called the Northside. Now they've rebranded it the Highlands. Bilingual bookstores are now boutiques. The liquor store is carrying exotic wine. They call it progress. MARTIN: That's Bobby LeFebre reading from his poem \"Denver, Where Have You Gone? \". (SOUNDBITE OF POEM, \"DENVER, WHERE HAVE YOU GONE? \")LEFEBRE: Last night, I walked your streets in search of you, bounced around like a pogo stick possessed. You were nowhere to be found. Or maybe, maybe I passed you a million times. Maybe I didn't recognize you through the new makeup and clothes. Maybe you are more comfortable with I, with who you are becoming. Maybe you crossed the street on purpose as you saw me coming your way. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think most people hate to think of themselves as middle class. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: You have what you need, but maybe not everything you want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have a car, but we live in an apartment. That's middle class.

Part of that decline is no mystery - all those baby boomers retiring. What is vexing economists is that prime working-age Americans, ages 25 to 54, they are also falling off the job map. To find out why, we've called our regular economics commentator, David Wessel. He's at the Brookings Institution and also writes for The Wall Street Journal. Hey there, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. KELLY: Good morning. When we say many working-age Americans are in fact not working, put a number on that for us. WESSEL: Well, 30 years ago, about 1 in every 16 men between ages of 25 and 54 wasn't in the job market, wasn't working, wasn't looking for work. Today, it's about 1 in 8. Now, the story for women is different. In 1950, about two-thirds of the women weren't in the workforce. By the late '90s, about a quarter of the women were not in the workforce. And what happened then, which is a bit of a puzzle, is it leveled off. So we still have about 1 in 4 women in this age bracket who isn't working or looking for a job. KELLY: OK, so 1 in 4 women, 1 in 8 men not working, not looking for a job, although they are of prime working age. Do we know why? WESSEL: Right, it's a good question. I mean, these people are too old to be in school and not old enough to be retired. Some of them have given up looking for work. This always happens in a recession. But usually when the economy gets better, more of them come back, and that hasn't happened this time. Some of them must figure that they can't. It's not worth getting a job. Wages for low-skill workers are so low that it's not worth the hassle and expense. Some are being supported by working spouses. And we know a larger number of people are on the Social Security Disability Insurance program, which has kind of become the income of last resort for people who can't find any other income. KELLY: Is one other possibility that some people are working but in ways that is not captured by the government? I'm thinking of the guy who drove me to work this morning in his Uber car, or people who are renting out their places on Airbnb, for example. WESSEL: Well, it's hard for the government to come up with surveys that adapt to the changing economy. But we believe that people who work for Uber, even though they're independent contractors, when the government asks them are they working, they say yes. So something like Airbnb where you're renting out a spare bedroom, those people are probably not counted as working. KELLY: You mention that these numbers have fluctuated over the decades. How unusual is this number historically - big picture? WESSEL: It's unusual. You know, in most societies, prime working-age males are on the job or at least looking for work. And the fact that it's coming down in the U. S. is alarming. It means that we'll have fewer people working, contributing income to help pay for retirees and stuff. So it is unusual and it's disturbing because we can't quite figure out why it's happening or what to do about it. KELLY: Can we figure out what impact it might have on the economy going forward? WESSEL: Oh, yeah. The economy will grow more slowly if there are fewer people working. We know that people who don't work tend to have less self-respect. They don't feel part of the society. It maybe account for some of the agitation we see in the presidential election. And importantly, economically, it means there's fewer people paying taxes to help support the people who are no longer able to work. KELLY: Paying Social Security and everything else. WESSEL: Exactly. KELLY: All right, thank you, David. WESSEL: You're welcome. KELLY: That's David Wessel. He is director of the Hutchinson Center at the Brookings Institution.

I know, the bond market. Just stay with me here. The yield on the 10-year year bond issued by the German government fell into negative territory for the first time. And here's what that means. If you bought one of the bonds and held onto it, you would actually lose money over time. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports the drop in rates shows the growing nervousness about where the global economy is headed. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It is by now a familiar problem. Eight years after the subprime mortgage crisis, many of the richest and most developed countries of the world remain mired in slow growth, says MIT economist Simon Johnson. SIMON JOHNSON: The fundamental facts of Japan and much of the Euro area are that growth is disappointing. Growth is low. Investors do not feel there are attractive places to put their money with good return to reasonable risk. ZARROLI: Recently there's been something else to be worried about. Next week the United Kingdom will vote on whether to leave the European Union, and recent polls suggest the vote will be a lot closer than it once seemed. That's introducing a big, new level of uncertainty into the global economy, so a lot of investors are doing what they always do. They're pouring their money into government bonds. David Blanchflower is a professor of economics at Dartmouth. DAVID BLANCHFLOWER: People are looking for safety. They're looking for places to park their money. ZARROLI: This surging demand for government bonds is driving down interest rates in the United States. And in some wealthy countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and now Germany, bond rates have actually fallen below blue zero, Simon Johnson says. JOHNSON: We have some countries - the most notable are in Europe - where the investors are willing to buy bonds that have a negative yield so you don't get compensated for putting your money into these bonds. You actually - it's like paying a little tax, if you like. ZARROLI: Buying a bond that's guaranteed to lose you money may seem like a pretty crazy thing to do. It's actually not as irrational as it seems. Money market economist Tom Simons of Jefferies and Company says a lot of bonds are bought by big institutional investors, and they don't usually hold onto them very long. They sell them. TOM SIMONS: I think that when an investor buys, say, a 10-year bond at a negative yield, what they're thinking is that, I'll hold this for a short period of time, let all of the period of uncertainty sort of dissipate. And then at that point, I'll probably get out of it. ZARROLI: As long as rates are falling, investors who sell bonds can still make a profit. The risk is that something unexpected can happen. Rates could suddenly reverse course, and a lot of big investors could lose huge amounts of money, Tom Simon says. SIMONS: One might assume that if the outlook brightened just in general that there would be a mass exodus from the negative yielding assets and that everybody would be selling at the same time. And if that happens, then losses could be substantial. ZARROLI: Last week one of the most famous bond investors in the world, Bill Gross, tweeted a warning about the bond market. He said there are now $10 trillion worth of negative rate bonds on the market. This is a supernova that will explode one day, he said. He later appeared to walk back the remarks a bit. In fact, risks are nothing new in the bond market. Unexpected changes in interest rates mean big losses for some investors and big gains for others. Tom Simons says the fact that negative rates are growing more common could add a psychological element to the market. It could make some investors more nervous. They could react in ways they never have before. But no one knows for sure because the world of negative rates is still such a new one. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: The traffic thins as you walk in Orange Avenue in Orlando past a makeshift memorial of flowers, candles, crosses and balloons towards a police roadblock within view of the Pulse Nightclub. There are a bunch of shuttered or half-open businesses on either side of the road here. Alex Brehm is standing by the door of a 7-Eleven, watching law enforcement work the scene. ALEX BREHM: I've been to Pulse. It's - I mean, it's somewhere that the whole Orlando community - gay or straight, everyone - it's an awesome place to hang out, so. . . ROTT: Brehm says he works about a block and a half from Pulse at a real estate office. They've been closed since the shooting like a lot of the businesses around here, and he's wondering what the long-term effect of this will be on his home of Orlando. BREHM: Especially now we've had three things on major news in a week. ROTT: The shooting at Pulse, the killing of former \"Voice\" star Christina Grimmie and the sad news in the last day that a toddler was into the water at a Disney World resort hotel by an alligator. That combination could be devastating to any community, but there's a potentially for it to be particularly so in Orlando. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Welcome to Orlando in Central Florida. ROTT: More than 66 million people visited the city last year, many of whom flew into the city's airport where the Disney World and Universal Studios shuttle buses pick up incoming tourists. All of the news in the last week isn't lost on people arriving here. Jennifer and Robert Trujillo came in from Denver with their two kids to visit Disney World. JENNIFER TRUJILLO: So I was a little green over it, but we, you know, we talked about it. ROTT: You weren't so much. ROBERT TRUJILLO: No - 24 years in the military, you know - it's inherent risk. ROTT: River and Jacob Anderson from Albuquerque said something similar. JACOB ANDERSON: There's no point in walking around scared of it, you know? I mean. . . RIVER ANDERSON: That's the point of terrorism. . . ANDERSON: Yep, I mean. . . ANDERSON: . . . Is that you stop living your life the way that you would've. ROTT: Still, the fear is real here for the tourism industry that there could be a negative result on the city's economy. George Aguela is with Visit Orlando. He says tourism. . . GEORGE AGUELA: Is about a third of all the jobs in the area. So it's large in that respect, and then certainly any notable decline, were there to be on, would certainly be effect - would certainly be noticed. ROTT: Aguela says they haven't noticed a decline yet, and he hopes that they won't. But it may be too soon to tell. Back near Pulse at Brick and Fire Pizza, owner Mark Dollard says they've still got to pay the bills, but that's not why they're open today. MARK DOLLARD: We're open because we want to provide anybody that walks through the door a degree of normalcy, and in this community, that's something that's going to be sought for a while. ROTT: Dollard says he talked to a local politician a couple of days ago. DOLLARD: The only thing came out of my mouth was, what are we going to do now? How are we going to move forward from this? ROTT: Did she have an answer? DOLLARD: No, she really didn't. She just had a hug. (LAUGHTER)ROTT: For now, that might be exactly what this community needs. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Orlando. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  My co-host Ari Shapiro is in Orlando, and we will be hearing from him elsewhere in the show. That city has a lot to overcome, namely the deadliest shooting in modern U. S. history. The question about how the city and its businesses move forward is a big one because Orlando is one of the most visited places in the country.

They're trying to figure out when next to raise interest rates. The goal is to keep the economy on track. And this is not an easy thing. Members of the Fed's Open Market Committee track an array of sometimes conflicting data. Economists call this the Fed's dashboard. And for a look at what the dashboard is saying right now, we turn to NPR's Chris Arnold. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Let's say instead of the U. S. economy, Janet Yellen is the captain of the U. S. S. Enterprise. And her starship faces a nebulous and perhaps perilous path forward. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"STAR TREK\")MICHAEL DORN: (As Lieutenant Worf) Sensors show a large magnetic disturbance on the star's surface. BRENT SPINER: (As Lieutenant Commander Data) It is a solar flare, Captain. PATRICK STEWART: (As Captain Jean-Luc Picard) Shields. DORN: (As Lieutenant Worf) Shields are up, but only at 23 percent. ARNOLD: So on the Enterprise, there are these panels of blinking lights and readouts. Well, Princeton economist Alan Blinder says the Federal Reserve has sort of the same thing. And after Janet Yellen took the helm, people started calling it. . . ALAN BLINDER: The Yellen Dashboard - it wasn't actually lights and bells, but a list of things that she and, of course, the whole Federal Reserve were looking at to monitor the economy. ARNOLD: Blinder's a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. And he says, right now, one of the most important indicators on that dashboard is wages. BLINDER: Hugely important - wages are the backbone of consumer spending, which is, in turn, the backbone of the economy. ARNOLD: Over the long term, the past 30 years or so, wages for most Americans have been pretty stagnant when you adjust for inflation. So in an economy that's driven by consumer spending, that's been this ongoing train wreck basically. BLINDER: Yeah. I mean, it's a slow-motion train wreck. It's a very big problem that we need to address. ARNOLD: In the shorter term, though, over the past year, wages have been rising at least a bit faster than inflation. It's taken a long time for that to happen coming out of the recession. So Blinder says that that's a good sign. Another positive thing on the Fed's dashboard - the official unemployment rate is now 4. 7 percent. Randall Kroszner is a former governor of Federal Reserve Board. He says, in some ways, we're better off than we were before the recession hit. RANDALL KROSZNER: The number of jobs we have is higher than before the financial crisis. GDP is higher than it was before the financial crisis. ARNOLD: Still, the last monthly jobs report from the Labor Department showed much weaker job growth than expected. And Kroszner says it's definitely not all happy green lights on Janet Yellen's dashboard. KROSZNER: I think we have to worry about some asteroid fields that are out there. ARNOLD: There's the whole Brexit thing and people in the U. K. voting to leave the European Union. That could cause big problems in financial markets. There's also a slowdown in China. And Blinder says that's not all. BLINDER: Another thing the Fed is scratching its head about now is productivity. ARNOLD: Rising productivity is the engine that creates wealth for an economy. It allows us to do more or make more with the same hour of labor from a U. S. worker. But that wealth-creation engine has been stalling. BLINDER: Productivity growth has slowed to a crawl, to the lowest pace that we've seen almost in recorded history. And the productivity growth rate is the fundamental foundation of higher living standards. ARNOLD: For some reason, companies are just not investing as much in better equipment and technology. That's probably part of what's going on there. And all this might sound like a lot of bad news. But Blinder says don't worry too much. BLINDER: You hear a lot in the media that our economy's in terrible shape. It's not. If you stack the performance of the U. S. economy in terms of GDP growth, in terms of jobs, we look pretty good relative to almost every other country on the globe.

It's called their Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and it's there just in case other countries stop selling oil to the U. S. The Energy Department is considering whether the country still needs so much oil in storage or if some of it should be sold off. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The reserve was created in the 1970s after Arab oil-producing countries stopped selling crude to the United States. They were upset over U. S. support for Israel. The embargo led to long lines at U. S. gas stations. All Things Considered talked with frustrated drivers back in 1974. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: How long you been waiting in line? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: About five minutes. I just cut in front of a whole bunch of people. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Did that guy behind you tell you that he cut into the line? Twice I got out and talked to him. BRADY: Here's the basic idea behind the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Keep at least a three-month supply of oil imports on hand so if another country stops the flow of crude again, the government can tap its reserve and avoid a shortage. All that oil is stored at four locations along the Gulf Coast, including one near Freeport, Texas, south of Houston. ROBERT CORBIN: Right now, we're walking towards the well pad of underground cavern number five. BRADY: Bob Corbin is a deputy assistant secretary in the Department of Energy. And he oversees the reserves, which are 2,000 feet below us in huge salt caverns. The reserve has been tapped for emergencies three times, at the start of the Gulf War in 1991, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and after the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. Each sale was controversial and, some argue, not needed. Tom Kloza is with the Oil Price Information Service, a business that provides data about the oil industry. He calls the reserve a 1970s anachronism. TOM KLOZA: You might as well be wearing bell bottoms as having 690 billion barrels in storage. BRADY: The oil market has changed a lot over the past four decades. Now domestic production is on the rise. And oil imports have fallen. Kloza says U. S. drillers can more easily rush in to make up shortfalls. KLOZA: Should there be some sort of interruption in Mid-eastern supply that sends prices skyward, we would see a very, very quick ramp up, particularly for some of the wells that have been drilled but uncompleted. BRADY: Oil prices are relatively low now. Companies have drilled wells but not pumped the oil out yet. So there's essentially a private reserve of oil along with the public one. Kloza thinks the government should reduce the size of its reserve. Others think it should be sold off altogether. They say the proceeds could be used for everything from road repairs to investing in renewable energy. The Department of Energy is conducting a big review of the reserve. Along with the existential questions, it'll explore things like the SPR's aging infrastructure. Bob Corbin with the Department of Energy says the reserve still fills a vital role for the U. S. economy, making it less likely gas prices will rise quickly because another country cuts off crude shipments. CORBIN: You want to try and bring those prices back down as quickly as possible. The SPR can do that by releasing a large volume of oil in a short period of time. BRADY: The Department of Energy's review of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is just about finished.

The expression the vanishing middle class has a lot of meaning for people like Mat Johnson, who grew up on the sinking side of the income imbalance. He's going to tell us about that in a personal essay he's written about watching his mother try to keep from getting deeper in debt. He last joined us on FRESH AIR to talk about his novel \"Loving Day. \"MAT JOHNSON: (Reading) When it was hot, the bill my mother wouldn't pay was the gas one. This meant peanut butter sandwiches for breakfast, peanut butter sandwiches for lunch and also dinner peanut butter sandwiches or fruit or anything else good that didn't have to be cooked or refrigerated. In the colder months, her neglected bill of choice was the electric, which meant reverting to an agrarian sleeping schedule - up at dawn, down at sunset and candlelight, despite the fact that the larger city of Philadelphia glowed alive outside our window. In the apartments where we had electric heat, we warmed ourselves by turning the oven up high and leaving his door hang open, my mom's fingers held wide to catch its heat like it was a campfire. The phone being turned off was my favorite because it just meant more conversation and walks to the payphone two blocks away for essentials. These periods would last weeks or hours, whatever it took to get her next payday. My mom couldn't pay the bills on time during this period because she was generally broke - a full-time college student also working a full-time clerical job all while being a full-time mother as well. Without sufficient funds, some months she had to choose which bill could get paid, which bill could get paid late, which bill couldn't get paid that month at all. But eventually, whatever was turned off would be turned on again, after paying the original balance plus the late fee plus the reconnection fee plus sometimes having to lose a day of work and pay to stay home for the technician to eventually show up and bring us back into the modern age. On top of the existing cost of her keeping her house a home, which she already could barely afford, my mom paid the poverty tax. And that informal poverty tax wasn't just on utilities. It was there in her bank account where $45 overdraft charges could accumulate into hundreds in a day. It was there in the high interest rate when she bought a car and finally bought a home, rates that may have also been higher because her blackness was factored into her loan. She wasn't just struggling with poverty. She was also struggling with effectively being fined for being poor and what together became a societal mechanism to keep her poor as well. The three words vanishing middle class are a popular way of describing America's increasing income inequality, our slow but steady move to a polar society of haves and have-nots. But in my head, it's a sterile, nebulous phrase evoking the image of an idealized 1950s family slowly fading into grey. At best, it hints towards the long-term elements - stagnated wages, a statistical trend towards a lack of upward economic mobility and a generation shift downward. It's evidenced in omnipresent and omnivorous check-cashing storefronts which offer broke people the opportunity to further break themselves at usury rates, appliance rental companies that cause customers to pay more over time for essentials than they ever would have if they can manage good credit and an arcane credit-rating system that lowers scores drastically just for having small balance allotments or minor payment latenesses years before. I managed to get to the middle class and grab enough of a foothold to stay in it - knock on a forest of wood. I teach at a large university in Houston and I'm fortunate to be one of the salaried professors here, as opposed to the freelance adjunct professors on campus, some of whom teach more classes than me - and get paid far less - with none of my job's benefits. I drive home to my middle-class suburb through the poverty of the Third Ward, past people who are paying far more for many of the expenses of living even though I make far more. It would be nice to sit in my car and think that the difference between my lifestyle and theirs was just down to hard work. But I'm under no such delusion. I'm where I am in part because of my mother's sacrifice, in part because I also had a white middle-class father a few miles away who was active in my life and invested in my education. I worked hard, sure, but nobody works harder to survive than poor people. I just got some good breaks and so do many of my ancestors. A wealthy friend told me recently that this was an anti-rich moment in America. But I see Donald Trump on TV constantly bragging about the billions he says he has, and his crowd is cheering. I think most Americans love the rich as long as they can convince themselves it's possible to join their ranks. But it's becoming increasingly obvious to even casual observers that there is no real right-angle triangle graph between our economic classes with a slow and steady gradient to the top. We are separated by cliffs incredibly easy to fall off and with few handholds to climb. The vanishing middle class sounds cold, moderate, gradual, but it's not. For far too many, this economic reality is hot, violent and now.

In the colder months, her neglected bill of choice was the electric, which meant reverting to an agrarian sleeping schedule - up at dawn, down at sunset and candlelight, despite the fact that the larger city of Philadelphia glowed alive outside our window. In the apartments where we had electric heat, we warmed ourselves by turning the oven up high and leaving his door hang open, my mom's fingers held wide to catch its heat like it was a campfire. The phone being turned off was my favorite because it just meant more conversation and walks to the payphone two blocks away for essentials. These periods would last weeks or hours, whatever it took to get her next payday. My mom couldn't pay the bills on time during this period because she was generally broke - a full-time college student also working a full-time clerical job all while being a full-time mother as well. Without sufficient funds, some months she had to choose which bill could get paid, which bill could get paid late, which bill couldn't get paid that month at all. But eventually, whatever was turned off would be turned on again, after paying the original balance plus the late fee plus the reconnection fee plus sometimes having to lose a day of work and pay to stay home for the technician to eventually show up and bring us back into the modern age. On top of the existing cost of her keeping her house a home, which she already could barely afford, my mom paid the poverty tax. And that informal poverty tax wasn't just on utilities. It was there in her bank account where $45 overdraft charges could accumulate into hundreds in a day. It was there in the high interest rate when she bought a car and finally bought a home, rates that may have also been higher because her blackness was factored into her loan. She wasn't just struggling with poverty. She was also struggling with effectively being fined for being poor and what together became a societal mechanism to keep her poor as well. The three words vanishing middle class are a popular way of describing America's increasing income inequality, our slow but steady move to a polar society of haves and have-nots. But in my head, it's a sterile, nebulous phrase evoking the image of an idealized 1950s family slowly fading into grey. At best, it hints towards the long-term elements - stagnated wages, a statistical trend towards a lack of upward economic mobility and a generation shift downward. It's evidenced in omnipresent and omnivorous check-cashing storefronts which offer broke people the opportunity to further break themselves at usury rates, appliance rental companies that cause customers to pay more over time for essentials than they ever would have if they can manage good credit and an arcane credit-rating system that lowers scores drastically just for having small balance allotments or minor payment latenesses years before. I managed to get to the middle class and grab enough of a foothold to stay in it - knock on a forest of wood. I teach at a large university in Houston and I'm fortunate to be one of the salaried professors here, as opposed to the freelance adjunct professors on campus, some of whom teach more classes than me - and get paid far less - with none of my job's benefits. I drive home to my middle-class suburb through the poverty of the Third Ward, past people who are paying far more for many of the expenses of living even though I make far more. It would be nice to sit in my car and think that the difference between my lifestyle and theirs was just down to hard work. But I'm under no such delusion. I'm where I am in part because of my mother's sacrifice, in part because I also had a white middle-class father a few miles away who was active in my life and invested in my education. I worked hard, sure, but nobody works harder to survive than poor people. I just got some good breaks and so do many of my ancestors. A wealthy friend told me recently that this was an anti-rich moment in America. But I see Donald Trump on TV constantly bragging about the billions he says he has, and his crowd is cheering. I think most Americans love the rich as long as they can convince themselves it's possible to join their ranks. But it's becoming increasingly obvious to even casual observers that there is no real right-angle triangle graph between our economic classes with a slow and steady gradient to the top. We are separated by cliffs incredibly easy to fall off and with few handholds to climb. The vanishing middle class sounds cold, moderate, gradual, but it's not. For far too many, this economic reality is hot, violent and now. GROSS: Mat Johnson is the author of the novels \"Loving Day\" and \"Pym. \" He's a professor in the University of Houston creative writing program. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll talk about the business and politics of selling guns. My guest will be Evan Osnos, who's written an article in The New Yorker about the NRA, the gun industry and concealed carry. He writes mass shootings and terrorist attacks have driven up gun sales, but most gun violence is impulsive and up close. I hope you'll join us. FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our technical director and engineer is Audrey Bentham. Our associate producer for online media is Molly Seavy-Nesper. Roberta Shorrock directs the show.

Among them is Joanna Barry (ph). She's a financial recruiter who explained why she is against exiting the EU. JOANNA BARRY: I mean, it's complete uncertainty. It's just this huge black hole of uncertainty, so we're not leaving. GREENE: It's a decision with implications for the United Kingdom, also for Europe and also for the United States. And let's talk about that with David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal and also a frequent guest on our program. David, welcome back. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So what is the impact that the so-called Brexit vote could have on on our economy here? WESSEL: Well, it would probably be bad for the British economy in the short term. They're a big market for our goods but not that big. About 4 percent of all U. S. exports go to the U. K. If its economy's curt (ph) it's bad for us. If it spreads to Europe, it's even worse. Economists at Morgan Stanley say the reduction of U. S. exports to Britain and other things could hurt, could raise the unemployment rate here by two to four-tenths of a percentage point next year. But I think the more immediate risk is that turmoil on global financial markets as a result of Brexit could wash up on our shores. GREENE: OK. So we're talking about if the economies get hurt, as some people predict, that might mean less exporting of U. S. goods and also just sort of general turmoil that could sort of spread here to the United States. So those are the two big things we're thinking about here. WESSEL: Yes, but financial market turmoil could come pretty quickly. No one really knows what's going to happen if the Brits vote to get out of the European Union. There's a lot of contingency planning going on. I think the most interesting threat is that investors could leave the British pound. That means the pound would go down in currency markets. The dollar would go up. That's nice for American tourists planning summer vacations in Europe, but it could really hurt U. S. exports. Rising U. S. dollar acts as a brake on U. S. growth, so that's the most immediate threat. GREENE: You know, we work - we in the United States - I mean, officials here work so closely with officials both in the U. K. and the EU on, you know, things like global finance regulation and creating economic stability in the world. I mean, did sort of - if this division happens, is there an impact there? WESSEL: I think there is. I mean, a vote for Brexit will be seen - and rightly so - as a rejection of half a century of European economic and political integration, the possible dismantling of institutions that have kept the peace in Europe, particularly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. You can imagine a weaker U. K. , a more inward-looking Europe. That would make it harder for the U. S. to do deals on climate change, as you pointed out financial regulation, terrorist finance. So I think there's a lot of fear in Washington that they would be so busy working on their own problems that they wouldn't be an ally of us - of ours in dealing with these really pressing global problems. GREENE: And briefly, David, I mean, many British people we've spoken to in the lead up to this have pointed to parallels with the U. S. in the presidential campaign here and this just general frustration, feeling left out in a global economy. I mean, could there be a sort of a broader ripple effect if voters in the U. K. make this big decision? WESSEL: In short, yes. I think it would amplify all the unease we hear in the U. S. that globalization is not helping the middle class, that trade and immigration are a problem. It would energize the people who are against those things. But maybe a vote for Brexit would also lead people to come up with more creative solutions for how do we get more people included in the benefits of globalization. GREENE: All right. David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome. GREENE: That's David Wessel. He is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at The Brookings Institution.

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The short-term effects we can see already - the stock market reaction, a stronger dollar - but Harvard economist Ken Rogoff says. . . KEN ROGOFF: The big question is what happens to the future of the world. ARNOLD: Oh, so it's not that big a question that you're asking. It's just what happens to the future of the world. (LAUGHTER)ARNOLD: That's a pretty big question. ROGOFF: Oh, this is - this is huge. It's hard to know because we've never seen it. You know, you don't want to be hyperbolic, but this is shocking. ARNOLD: Rogoff studies the global economy and financial crises. And he says that the U. K. and the entire European continent are crucial trading partners for the U. S. , so damage across the Atlantic will be felt here, too. The question is how much economic fallout will there be? ROGOFF: If this is the match that, you know, lights the fire in Europe, it's not going to be a pretty picture for the U. S. I mean, I don't think it's going to be the same as 2008, but it's certainly going to hurt our economy. It's not going to be good. ARNOLD: But Rogoff says he doesn't want to exaggerate the risk of that because we just don't know what's going to happen. ROGOFF: It could be the whole thing's really smooth. Europe just says, well, you know, here's the deal like Norway and Switzerland have. Sorry not to have you. Have a good life. ARNOLD: Norway and Switzerland are not in the EU, but they have close connections with the union. The big worry now is that this won't just be the U. K. and that other countries will want to follow suit, and that will cause more pain across Europe and, therefore, more pain here in the U. S. Megan Greene is chief economist at John Hancock. She's over in the U. K. watching all this unfold. MEGAN GREENE: If we end up having EU countries peel out of the EU more than just the U. K. , that's a real threat for the entire global economy, and we could see the U. S. tipped into recession. ARNOLD: Still, at this point, Rogoff and Greene both say that the odds seem good that the U. S. will weather the storm with only a minor drag on the economy. Alan Blinder is a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He says there are actually some benefits for the U. S. from the turmoil in Europe. ALAN BLINDER: Investors are going to flee from the U. K. and probably from a number of other countries in the EU and look for safe havens. ARNOLD: Just one way that that could help the U. S. is that as investors buy U. S. treasuries, that should have the effect of keeping interest rates low for all kinds of loans that millions of people here make payments on - for example, mortgages and car loans. And that could mean more money in those people's pockets. BLINDER: My sort of mental image - let's put it that way - of interest rates in the United States three months, six months, 12 months from now have gone down - lower interest rates.

U. S. stocks were down, too. Brexit advocates had acknowledged that there might be short-term economic pain. But they frequently stress the U. K. 's status as the world's fifth-largest economy, a place that can stand on its own. How big a deal is it to be the fifth biggest economy? Well that was one of the questions I put to Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator for the Financial Times. MARTIN WOLF: The problem about the fifth-largest thing is that there are a few - one or two enormous economies, and then there's a really big drop. And there are a lot of economies around size. And we're, of course, declining in relative size because the big, emerging economies are growing relatively rapidly. So we will shrink further. But there are two more important points, which go in the opposite direction. Yes, we will be able to stand on our own. But the cost of the transition will be very large and we will lose what are, quite clearly for us, enormously beneficial opportunities to trade really freely from within this vast single market of the European Union. And in our dealings with the EU, we are a relatively small country. SIEGEL: Is it a realistic fear that companies - foreign companies that have invested heavily here because Britain is part of the European Union will now either scale back or leave? WOLF: I think, to some degree, it's a certainty. I expect banks to move people relatively easily. So the big American banks, for example, which have huge European operations here in London, we'll move some of that into the continent. If you've got a big factory - you know, let's say your Nissan up in Sunderland - you can't move a factory overnight. You probably won't move it overnight. You'll continue to produce. But I would expect, depending on the future negotiations on our exit terms, that they will think, well, our next investment should be somewhere else. At the margin, as it were, new investment will go elsewhere. And that's a big deal for Britain. We have had a lot of inward investment. SIEGEL: Martin Wolf, over 15 years ago, you explained to me in an interview why joining the euro was a bad idea for the United Kingdom. And you described that a currency is something that a country has. The EU is not a country. It doesn't have the characteristics. Most people today would agree you were right. Do you think that the European Union, in many other respects, overreached and went beyond what indeed a collection of countries is capable of, as opposed to a single country? WOLF: Yes, it's clear to me now - it's even worse than I thought- that moving towards a single currency was a huge overreach. And they now have imbalances which they find very difficult to deal with. And that has nothing to do with Britain. And it is - remains an immensely sore point because lots of countries are mired in terrible, terrible recessions. Spain, Italy - really important countries have lost decades at least and soaring unemployment. The second thing is they made the decision, which I think was right but a huge gamble, to enlarge to the Eastern - Central Eastern Europe as quickly as possible. It would have been better to have had longer-term, stronger safeguard arrangements for movements of people. Nobody imagined that, for example, that nearly a million Poles would, ten years after joining, now be living in Britain. Now, I happen to think they're wonderful people and doing a great job for Britain, but it has created huge anxiety.

And let's talk about that with NPR economic correspondent John Ydstie who's in studio. Good morning, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So some reaction already from Wall Street. What's happening? YDSTIE: Well, the Dow opened down sharply as expected, down about 500 points, around 3 percent. But it's bounced back a bit. It's now down around 375 points, so, you know, it's not a rout. Selling has been - there's been a lot of selling, but it's been orderly. GREENE: And we'll be watching those markets obviously as the hours and days go on. What about sort of long term, John? I mean, Hillary Clinton referring to potential economic uncertainties that could affect people in this country, Donald Trump sort of attaching the movement that has helped give him support to the movement in Britain - but when we look at the economy, I mean, how tied is the U. S. economy to whatever the repercussions are in Europe and in the U. K. ? YDSTIE: Well, I think there are going to be some repercussions for the U. S. economy, but they're not going to be as dramatic as they might be in the U. K. and the EU. One thing that we've seen today is the U. S. dollar has - is up sharply. That means that the U. S. exports are going to be less competitive, more expensive. And so our growth could be hurt by that. But I think probably we're going to be more affected indirectly because of uncertainty around, you know, is Britain the only one who's going to leave the EU? What's going to happen there? All that uncertainty makes businesses less interested in hiring and investing. And that kind of behavior is bad for growth, and I think - so we'll see slower global growth. And that's going to impact on the U. S. economy as well. GREENE: OK. That's NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie. John, thanks a lot. YDSTIE: You're welcome, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  We woke up to some pretty stunning news this morning. Voters in the United Kingdom have decided to leave the European Union. This is a new reality the next U. S. president will be dealing with. Donald Trump said this vote is fantastic, and that U. K. citizens have taken back their country.

Before the vote, both sides made promises and predictions, and economics writer Tim Harford fact-checked them all for the BBC keeping his own views to himself. Now that the vote is over, NPR's Jacob Goldstein of our Planet Money team asked Harford what he really thought. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: The morning the results came in Harford was in Paris. TIM HARFORD: That's how we roll in the European Union - or at least that is how we used to roll until the referendum result. GOLDSTEIN: He was rushing to catch a train back to the U. K. and trying to figure out what to make of things. And how did you feel? HARFORD: How did I feel as an economist or how did I feel as a human being? GOLDSTEIN: As a human being. HARFORD: As a human being? Actually, you want to know the truth? As the taxi driver dropped me off he said, monsieur, you will always be welcome back in France. I wanted to cry. I really did. It was just that moment of what can you do? What can you do? GOLDSTEIN: How did you feel as an economist? HARFORD: Oh, [expletive]. This is going to be bad. GOLDSTEIN: Harford said he started getting worried well before the vote. HARFORD: I was struck by how little people seemed to be interested in facts. GOLDSTEIN: For example, he said, the Leave campaign kept citing these huge figures for how much money the U. K. sends to the EU. If we leave, they promised, we can spend that money on health care instead. HARFORD: Every independent expert said that's just not true. And it didn't matter. British politicians used to be good at misleading people without actually lying, and that particular discipline appears to have been abandoned in this campaign. GOLDSTEIN: Did you fact-check the Remain campaign as well? HARFORD: Oh, of course. And the Remain campaign were big on taking economic forecasts that looked gloomy and presenting the forecasts as absolute fact. GOLDSTEIN: Now that the results are in, Harford says, it's at least theoretically possible that the leaders of the U. K. and the EU might sit down and work out a deal that does not radically change the status quo. It could be something similar to the deal Norway has. HARFORD: Norway has a relationship with the EU which is very close. It has to accept most EU rules. It has to pay EU membership fees. It has free movement of people just like other EU countries, but it's not actually in the EU. I don't think that's going to happen, but that's the case that this is no big deal. GOLDSTEIN: Harford clearly thinks this is a big deal for a couple key reasons. HARFORD: We now have political chaos. We've got parties in Ireland saying they want to merge with Northern Ireland. You've got parties in Scotland saying you want to leave the U. K. You've got the Spanish government saying it would like to take ownership of Gibraltar which is a British overseas territory. So that - just the politics of this is a mess. GOLDSTEIN: And then of course there's the economics. Harford says it's not just the market turmoil we've been seeing for the past few days. There are long term consequences as well. HARFORD: A lot of international companies invest in the U. K. as a base for doing business with the rest of the European Union. Say a Japanese car company wants to build their factory to make cars. Historically the U. K. would've been a great place to do that - good infrastructure, political stability - ha - and access to the European market. And now it's not clear that they are going to have access to the European market. So most economists think we're likely to be poorer in the long run.

What happens when a banker to the world starts cutting itself off from the world? LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: London is a great financial center. And it is, of course, in Great Britain whose people just voted to leave the European Union. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports on what happens to the banks now. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: London has been a global money center for centuries. But in recent decades, with deregulation and the explosion of global trade, its importance has only grown, especially in derivatives and asset management. It now rivals New York City as a financial power. Nicola Veron is a senior fellow at the Belgian think tank Bruegel. NICOLAS VERON: There has been a rise in financial globalization, more financial business being done across borders. And London has positioned itself as the best place to capture this business. ZARROLI: London doesn't just have big banks and trading firms. It has a huge army of accountants and lawyers and consultants. In fact, the financial services industry plays a much bigger part in the U. K. 's economy than it does in the United States'. Before the Brexit vote, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned a group of bank employees about the consequences of leaving the EU. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE OSBORNE: It is deceiving people to pretend that we can leave the EU - quit the EU and jobs wouldn't be at risk. ZARROLI: As long as the U. K. is part of the European Union, its companies can do business anywhere on the continent. And it can move people around without worrying about visas. But last week's Brexit vote leaves everything up in the air. Mark Compton is a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown in London. And he says no one really knows how the vote will affect financial firms. MARK COMPTON: Although the people have voted to leave, nobody will know for a number of years exactly the terms on which we will be leaving. ZARROLI: And he says no one really knows how the vote will affect financial firms. COMPTON: So the U. K. is going to be wanting to do its best to preserve the trading environment for financial services, not only for its own businesses, but for those from the U. S. , Asia and elsewhere that have set themselves up in London. So it's going to be fighting to keep that. ZARROLI: Compton says the U. K. could leave the EU but join another union called the European Economic Area. It's not a great option. Joining it would allow the U. K. to still do business anywhere on the continent. But it wouldn't have any say in the EU's laws. And it would still have to open its borders to unfettered immigration, which, given last week's vote, seems politically unpalatable. In the meantime, some big banks are already drawing up plans to pull employees out of London. Nicolas Veron says banks are anxious to show customers they have a plan B. VERON: Financial firms hate uncertainty. And at this point, there is a huge amount of uncertainty, legal and political, into United Kingdom. ZARROLI: These firms are said to be weighing whether to move operations to some other city in Europe, such as Frankfurt or Dublin. And Paris has been making a pretty hard push to attract some of the firms. Paris's deputy mayor said recently that he doesn't necessarily want to see big banks flee London.

It involves Donald Trump. In Pennsylvania this week, Trump gave a speech hammering at one of his core messages - his opposition to global trade deals, starting with the giant North American Free Trade Agreement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history - it's, like, the history of this country. GREENE: Now this view pits Trump against mainstream Republicans and also many Democrats. The people Trump is most aligned with here are left-wing economists. Trump often cites research by a well-known liberal think tank. Here he is, talking about a different trade deal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs. GREENE: Now the Economic Policy Institute's senior economist for many years was Dean Baker. Baker is now co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. His views on trade have not changed all that much. He says trade has been a net negative for many American workers. And Dean Baker's in the studio with us right now. Welcome to the program. DEAN BAKER: Thanks a lot for having me on. GREENE: So how does it feel to have Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, using your former organization by name and talking about your views on trade? BAKER: Well, it's good to have these views getting aired. I'd rather have a different spokesperson. But, you know, I would hope we could have a serious discussion of these issues and sort of take Donald Trump out of the story. And, you know, I'd love to see Secretary Clinton pick up on many of these issues. GREENE: On a very basic level, let's talk about what Donald Trump has said about trade deals - that they're bad for - bad for the country and cause a loss of manufacturing jobs. I mean, what's sort of the the thumbnail for that argument? BAKER: Well, the basic story has been that certainly a trade deal like NAFTA was very deliberately designed to make it easy for a U. S. corporation to set up operations in Mexico, know that they don't have to worry about Mexico nationalizing their factory, they don't have to worry about Mexico putting limits on their ability to repatriate their profits. And the result of that was you saw more investment from companies like General Electric, General Motors in Mexico. So that was very directly putting U. S. workers in direct competition with low-paid workers in the developing world. GREENE: Now, I spent some time doing reporting in Peoria, Ill. , this year and spoke to some officials at Caterpillar. They made the argument to me that the more jobs they have overseas, the more work they are doing sort of in a globalized world, is net benefit for workers in this country. BAKER: I don't agree with that. You know, in effect what they'd be saying - if you take that argument literally - that for every job they relocate, they now have a net increase of employment of more than one. So if they - in other words, they ship out a thousand jobs to Mexico, what they are saying. . . GREENE: They will at least have a thousand jobs in the United States. BAKER: More than a thousand new jobs. GREENE: More than a thousand, right. BAKER: And that's a little hard to imagine. GREENE: Donald Trump says that he, if he were president, would make sure that there were better trade negotiators. Have U. S. trade negotiators been doing this badly in your mind? BAKER: It's not a question that these are bad negotiators, they're stupid people - I think he's used that term. I'm sure they're all very bright people. But they have a different agenda. They're actually trying to make it easy for our companies to relocate their factories in Mexico or China or wherever it might be. And part of the story here is he's not going to have to beat up China 'cause, you know, if he says, hey, I want to make it more difficult for U. S. companies to relocate in China and then re-export their goods back to the U. S. , well, you know, China's not going to be happy with that. But most immediately, General Electric's not going to be happy with that. So those are the people he's going to have to beat up. GREENE: I wonder - I mean, I think about the vote in the United Kingdom to leave Europe. And that's sort of been seen as nationalistic, more right-leaning concerns about immigration, concerns about borders and fighting for the working class. But what does that tell us about the world or politics today? BAKER: You know, this is kind of a frightening story. We've had policies in place - speaking first and foremost of the U. S. , but I think you could also look to the U. K. , you can look to Europe - that have tended to redistribute income upwards. And you're seeing a backlash from the victims. And that backlash very often takes, you know, racist, xenophobic forms and that's really awful. But to my view, you know, I'm not going to condone the racism. And I'm not going to condone xenophobia. But if we want to deal with this issue over a longer term, we have to change the economic policies that have made these people lash out that way. And what that means is economic policies that lead to broadly-shared prosperity. And we had this. It's not like, oh, we can't possibly do this. We had this in the '50s. We had this in the '60s, into the '70s. We know how to do it. It's a question that the people in positions of power in the United States are gaining, obviously, from these policies. And they don't see a reason to change course. GREENE: Dean Baker, thanks a lot for coming in. BAKER: Thanks for having me on. GREENE: Economist Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Policy and Economic Research. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Now the story of an unlikely marriage. It involves Donald Trump. In Pennsylvania this week, Trump gave a speech hammering at one of his core messages - his opposition to global trade deals, starting with the giant North American Free Trade Agreement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history - it's, like, the history of this country. GREENE: Now this view pits Trump against mainstream Republicans and also many Democrats. The people Trump is most aligned with here are left-wing economists. Trump often cites research by a well-known liberal think tank. Here he is, talking about a different trade deal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs. GREENE: Now the Economic Policy Institute's senior economist for many years was Dean Baker. Baker is now co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. His views on trade have not changed all that much. He says trade has been a net negative for many American workers. And Dean Baker's in the studio with us right now. Welcome to the program. DEAN BAKER: Thanks a lot for having me on. GREENE: So how does it feel to have Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, using your former organization by name and talking about your views on trade? BAKER: Well, it's good to have these views getting aired. I'd rather have a different spokesperson. But, you know, I would hope we could have a serious discussion of these issues and sort of take Donald Trump out of the story. And, you know, I'd love to see Secretary Clinton pick up on many of these issues. GREENE: On a very basic level, let's talk about what Donald Trump has said about trade deals - that they're bad for - bad for the country and cause a loss of manufacturing jobs. I mean, what's sort of the the thumbnail for that argument? BAKER: Well, the basic story has been that certainly a trade deal like NAFTA was very deliberately designed to make it easy for a U. S. corporation to set up operations in Mexico, know that they don't have to worry about Mexico nationalizing their factory, they don't have to worry about Mexico putting limits on their ability to repatriate their profits. And the result of that was you saw more investment from companies like General Electric, General Motors in Mexico. So that was very directly putting U. S. workers in direct competition with low-paid workers in the developing world. GREENE: Now, I spent some time doing reporting in Peoria, Ill. , this year and spoke to some officials at Caterpillar. They made the argument to me that the more jobs they have overseas, the more work they are doing sort of in a globalized world, is net benefit for workers in this country. BAKER: I don't agree with that. You know, in effect what they'd be saying - if you take that argument literally - that for every job they relocate, they now have a net increase of employment of more than one. So if they - in other words, they ship out a thousand jobs to Mexico, what they are saying. . . GREENE: They will at least have a thousand jobs in the United States. BAKER: More than a thousand new jobs. GREENE: More than a thousand, right. BAKER: And that's a little hard to imagine. GREENE: Donald Trump says that he, if he were president, would make sure that there were better trade negotiators. Have U. S. trade negotiators been doing this badly in your mind? BAKER: It's not a question that these are bad negotiators, they're stupid people - I think he's used that term. I'm sure they're all very bright people. But they have a different agenda.

S. that often gets overlooked - the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. For more than a year, the U. S. territory has been caught in a fiscal crisis, unable to make payments on its $70 billion plus debt and at the same time continuing to pay for basic services like police, education and health care. This week, President Obama signed a law that will put a federal-appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico's finances. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: People in Puerto Rico need to know that they're not forgotten, that they're part of the American family, and Congress's responsiveness to this issue, even though this is not a perfect bill, at least moves us in the right direction. SUAREZ: Joining me now to talk about what this means for Puerto Rico is NPR's Greg Allen. Greg, the law creates a fiscal oversight board appointed by Congress and the White House. It's not made up of elected officials from Puerto Rico who are now in charge of the island's finances. How's that being received on the island of Puerto Rico? GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag. You have the governor, who's been pushing for this law. The non-voting representative in Congress, our other elected official, has been pushing for this law. They say it's far from perfect. They'd like to see something different, but given the circumstances, it's the best that they could get through Congress. The business community in Puerto Rico has been positive. But you set those on one side, and on the other side you have just about everybody else. Other political leaders on the island, the leaders in the legislature there, are very negative on this. They see this as a violation of what they believe to be the island's sovereignty. We heard Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the critics of this law, call it colonialism. And that's how many people see it there - the federal government stepping in and basically exerting its authority on the island. SUAREZ: What will the oversight board be able to do? Can it do what Puerto Rican borrowing authorities haven't been able to do - reschedule debt, make people take haircuts on the bonds? ALLEN: Well, that is the idea. What's happened is that Puerto Rico, because of its unusual status as a territory, it is not covered by chapter nine bankruptcy law the way that other public institutions within the states are. So for that reason, Puerto Rico has been trying to get that chapter nine bankruptcy authority through Congress hasn't worked. So they've decided to support this instead. Now, this is not being called a control board. This is being called an oversight board, as a kind of a nod to trying to get away from the charges of colonialism. But this board will be able to enter into voluntary discussions with creditors. But ultimately, it does have the authority to restructure some of the debt there by getting court approval. And so the creditors will be forced to come to the table, talk openly about this with the knowledge that there's a big stick over their heads if they don't come up with some kind of agreement. The other big stick they have here is that all lawsuits will be on hold for several months while these debt terms are worked out. So it's really going to be talking to the fiscal oversight board or nobody. SUAREZ: Well, while these things are all being ironed out, will Puerto Rico make any payments? ALLEN: Well, that'll be the question for the oversight board to determine. There was a $2 billion payment due that Puerto Rico just did not make. And creditors have no recourse now except to go to the oversight board and talk to them about how they can get repayment done. Now, the oversight board will also take charge of the island's budget. They'll require a balanced budget. They can order certain departments be cut. They can order layoffs, they can order assets of Puerto Rico to be sold. So they can determine how to raise the money to start paying back this debt and then go to theALLEN: creditors and say, what terms can we work out with you? SUAREZ: But also included in the bill signed by the president is a lowering of Puerto Rico's minimum wage. Why is that in there? ALLEN: Well, that's a controversial provision that many people on the island fought against, and Democrats fought against that. It was a Republican idea. Supporters believe that it will help address the island's high unemployment rate. You know, the unemployment rate there is at nearly 12 percent, which is more than double the national average. The idea was to try to kick start employment by getting more young people into the workforce. SUAREZ: During these years of crisis, taxes have been raised, public services have been cut, hundreds of thousands of people have left the island for good. Will this appointment and the provisions of this bill help what's been dogging Puerto Rico over the last 10 years? ALLEN: Well, it will certainly help. What it does is it buys time. But everyone from the president on down say, this is not the solution. This is just a temporary respite of this crisis that has Puerto Rico by the short hairs. The idea is now that while we work out these repayment schedules for the debt, let's take other action to address its health care problems, its economic problems. And the president and others have been calling on Congress to go back to work on Puerto Rico now and take up these other issues. But just this issue of coming up with this oversight board took Congress many months of working on and a lot of heavy lifting. So it'll be interesting to see how quickly they want to go back to take up this issue of working on Puerto Rico, which as we mentioned at the top, is a place that Congress likes to ignore. SUAREZ: That's NPR's Greg Allen. Greg, thanks a lot. ALLEN: You're welcome. RAY SUAREZ, HOST:  This week, Washington turned its attention to a part of the U.

The picture we've found is more complex. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: So between now and the election in November, we'll be asking the question, what does it mean to be middle class in America today? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think middle class is you can pay your bills comfortably. You're steady. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I mean, my sleeves only roll up so far (laughter). There's got to be a light at the end of the tunnel. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Be able to afford a place to live and enjoy life. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You know, we do the entertainment, but we work hard for it, you know? And so it means more to us when we're able to do that. SHAPIRO: We're calling this series The New Middle. Before the city of Flint, Mich. , was in the news for poisoned water or high crime rates, Flint was a middle class boom town. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It looks like an ordinary day in the USA, but in the city of Flint, Mi. , all is excitement. Even the small fry are buzzing. SHAPIRO: This video was produced in 1954 to celebrate the 50 millionth car rolling off the General Motors assembly line. It shows streets crowded with well-dressed people beaming and waving flags. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) Teamwork, teamwork. The nation's secret was teamwork. SHAPIRO: The video ends with this teamwork song. The last line is you ain't seen nothing yet. JENEYAH MCDONALD: So we're going to hang a left here. SHAPIRO: OK. MCDONALD: So this is the neighborhood I grew up in. SHAPIRO: Jeneyah McDonald's grandparents were in that wave of people who moved to Flint during the boom times to join the growing middle class. More than 60 years later, she drove me around to look at what the city has become. MCDONALD: That's the school me and my husband met at. We've known. . . SHAPIRO: . . . Oh, wow. So you guys have known each other since you were kids? MCDONALD: First grade. I used to chase him home from that school. SHAPIRO: You're kidding me. MCDONALD: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Today, she's a substitute teacher and her husband is on disability. They have two young kids. The government recently tore down a bunch of abandoned houses in their neighborhood. Now the street looks like a mouth with just a few teeth. And that elementary school where Jeneyah met her husband? MCDONALD: Our old school is closed and abandoned, which is pretty much the story here in Flint. SHAPIRO: This is not only the story of Flint. RAKESH KOCHHAR: Each decade since 1970 has ended with fewer people in the middle class than at the start of the decade. SHAPIRO: Rakesh Kochhar studies the middle class for the Pew Research Center. He recently found that for the first time since economists started keeping track in the 1970s, the middle class is no longer a majority in the U. S. That is, rich and poor people combined now make up half the population. This is not purely bad news. Kochhar says more people are moving up the income ladder than down. KOCHHAR: There is actually more progress than regression. SHAPIRO: About two-thirds of the people who've left the middle class have gone up. They've become rich. Around one-third have dropped down and become poor. To hear today's presidential candidates talk about it, America's identity depends on having a strong middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: The middle class is disappearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: The middle class has been forgotten. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: The middle class needs a raise. SHAPIRO: America's middle class pride has always come with a healthy dose of middle class anxiety. In 1939, Westinghouse commissioned a one-hour movie to celebrate the World's Fair. It tells the story of a family called the Middletons. In the opening scene, the father turns on the radio news and his son reacts to a report about young Americans looking for their first jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE MIDDLETON FAMILY AT THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As radio announcer) Will they find welcome or closed signs on the gateways of opportunity? JIMMY LYDON: (As Bud) Blah, blah, blah. How can you stand that before breakfast? HARRY SHANNON: (As Father) Wait a minute, Bud. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As radio announcer) What hope is there for youth in the world of tomorrow? SHAPIRO: A decade later, in 1949, Arthur Miller won the Pulitzer Prize for his bleak portrayal of the American middle class. In \"Death Of A Salesman's\" final scene, Linda Loman stands at her husband's grave. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DEATH OF A SALESMAN\")MILDRED DUNNOCK: (As Linda Loman) I made the last payment on the house today, and there'll be nobody home. SHAPIRO: Even people who achieve the dream of middle class life often seem discontent to be there. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LITTLE BOXES\")PETE SEEGER: (Singing) Little boxes on the hillside, little boxes made of ticky tacky, little -SHAPIRO: Pete Seeger had a hit with this satire on suburban life in 1963. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LITTLE BOXES\")SEEGER: (Singing) There's a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one. And they're all made out of ticky tacky, and they all look just the same. SHAPIRO: So what does it actually mean to be in the American middle class today? I recently asked a bunch of people that question in New York's Times Square, and the answers were all over the place. Here's what being in the middle class means to 44-year-old Erin Kennedy. She runs a gym in the Bronx. ERIN KENNEDY: You're struggling, like, paycheck to paycheck. And you're going, oh shoot, I want to go into H&M. But no, you know what? I'll do it next week when I get paid again. SHAPIRO: Compare that to Bob Berger's definition. He's a couple decades older and works as a building manager. BOB BERGER: To be middle class means that I never have had to make a budget. I have never wanted for anything. I pretty much did what I wanted. SHAPIRO: Economists, at least, pretty much agree on how to define the middle class. For a family of three, it ranges from income of about $40,000 to $120,000 a year. That is a wide range. And it says something about America that outside of that range, people still tend to describe themselves as either upper middle class or lower middle class no matter how rich or poor they are. Of course, the cost of living also varies widely across the country. Over the next several months, we'll look at this issue all over the U. S. through the lens of economics, arts, politics, history, health and more. Tomorrow, what happens when you make a middle class income in an upper-class town. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: To me, this is just a higher-end project (laughter) when you think about the amount of money we pay every month. SHAPIRO: That's tomorrow on our series, The New Middle. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  The middle class has been shrinking steadily for four decades, and not just in the nation's Rust Belt, Appalachia or the Deep South. The picture we've found is more complex.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE MIDDLETON FAMILY AT THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As radio announcer) Will they find welcome or closed signs on the gateways of opportunity? JIMMY LYDON: (As Bud) Blah, blah, blah. How can you stand that before breakfast? HARRY SHANNON: (As Father) Wait a minute, Bud. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As radio announcer) What hope is there for youth in the world of tomorrow? SHAPIRO: A decade later, in 1949, Arthur Miller won the Pulitzer Prize for his bleak portrayal of the American middle class. In \"Death Of A Salesman's\" final scene, Linda Loman stands at her husband's grave. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DEATH OF A SALESMAN\") MILDRED DUNNOCK: (As Linda Loman) I made the last payment on the house today, and there'll be nobody home. SHAPIRO: Even people who achieve the dream of middle class life often seem discontent to be there. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LITTLE BOXES\") PETE SEEGER: (Singing) Little boxes on the hillside, little boxes made of ticky tacky, little - SHAPIRO: Pete Seeger had a hit with this satire on suburban life in 1963. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LITTLE BOXES\") SEEGER: (Singing) There's a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one. And they're all made out of ticky tacky, and they all look just the same. SHAPIRO: So what does it actually mean to be in the American middle class today? I recently asked a bunch of people that question in New York's Times Square, and the answers were all over the place. Here's what being in the middle class means to 44-year-old Erin Kennedy. She runs a gym in the Bronx. ERIN KENNEDY: You're struggling, like, paycheck to paycheck. And you're going, oh shoot, I want to go into H&M. But no, you know what? I'll do it next week when I get paid again. SHAPIRO: Compare that to Bob Berger's definition. He's a couple decades older and works as a building manager. BOB BERGER: To be middle class means that I never have had to make a budget. I have never wanted for anything. I pretty much did what I wanted. SHAPIRO: Economists, at least, pretty much agree on how to define the middle class. For a family of three, it ranges from income of about $40,000 to $120,000 a year. That is a wide range. And it says something about America that outside of that range, people still tend to describe themselves as either upper middle class or lower middle class no matter how rich or poor they are. Of course, the cost of living also varies widely across the country. Over the next several months, we'll look at this issue all over the U. S. through the lens of economics, arts, politics, history, health and more. Tomorrow, what happens when you make a middle class income in an upper-class town. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: To me, this is just a higher-end project (laughter) when you think about the amount of money we pay every month.

Sitting in a field just off I-75, south of Cincinnati, it's seven stories high and dominates the landscape. MARK LOOEY: The Bible indicates the original ark was three hundred cubits. That calculates, in modern day terms, to 510 feet long. WESTERMAN: That's Mark Looey, a co-founder of Answers in Genesis, the Christian ministry that built this thing. They're the group that opened the Creation Museum a few years ago, promoting a literal interpretation of the Bible and other teachings - that planet Earth is only 6000 years old, that man lived alongside dinosaurs. With the attraction set to open this Thursday, construction crews are rushing around, putting the final touches on exhibits so sophisticated you might think you're at Disney World. LOOEY: By the way, no live animals in the ark. We have a zoo behind the ark here. That's where. . . WESTERMAN: Looey says they've already hired over 300 staff, and hundreds more jobs are on the way when other phases are completed. It's no surprise that the small town just across the interstate is excited. Williamstown, Ky. , has a population of about 4000. It's a middle-class bedroom community, right between Cincinnati and Lexington. Mayor Rick Skinner says they've already upgraded their electricity and built a new water treatment plant.

What Answers in Genesis calls an independent study puts the ark's economic impact at $4 billion over the next decade. Adkins is skeptical. ADKINS: We've not seen the hotels. We've not seen the restaurants coming in to support this attraction. I think a lot of people are waiting to invest because they want to see if - after the flash and bang of the opening, what happens next. WESTERMAN: Answers in Genesis points to the success of the Creation Museum as proof of the ark's potential. And then there are the controversies around the project, provoking debate over separation of church and state. Adkins is uncomfortable with the tourism tax rebates the ministry is getting from the state that are worth up to $18 million. And it also just doesn't sit well with him that job applicants must adhere to the ministry's rigid moral code and belief system. ADKINS: That one would have to subjugate their own beliefs to comply with that of an employer, that seems very intrusive and oppressive to me. WESTERMAN: But a federal judge earlier this year ruled that Answers in Genesis, as a religious group, has a right to restrict their hiring. Jay Novarra is completely opposed. She's especially irked at local leaders. Along with free land, Williamstown also gave Answers in Genesis $62 million in bonds. The ministry says the town will not be on the hook for those. As a farmer, Novarra is worried about the price of water going up since the town is also providing water to the ark. JAY NOVARRA: We do have a lot of people who make a living farming. And you start adding to the price we have to pay to raise our food, then you're definitely impacting farmers. And I have to ask myself, what is that farmer getting out of it?

Since the Brexit vote, interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen to their lowest levels in more than three years. It is spurring a boom in mortgage applications that experts expect will continue. NPR's Yuki Noguchi explains. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Spencer Cullen is a loan originator for CRM Lending in Tysons Corner, Va. Since the Brexit vote, he's seen his business spike 60 to 70 percent. SPENCER CULLEN: As soon as I saw that the U. K. was voting to leave the European Union, I knew that the pound would plummet. All world money tends to flow into safer investments. NOGUCHI: Safer investments that include U. S. Treasury bonds, which, when they are in high demand, yield less in interest. Treasury yields are hitting record lows. And because mortgage rates are tied to those rates, especially the 10-year note, Cullen knew his business would boom. CULLEN: My immediate thought was that it was going to be a 48-hour phenomenon. NOGUCHI: But it wasn't. The Federal Reserve last week released minutes from its June meeting that underscore the central bank's caution in advance of the Brexit vote. Even though the June U. S. jobs report came out strong last week, now that the U. K. has voted to leave the EU, most market observers think the Fed will hold off on raising interest rates for the rest of the year. Michael Fratantoni is chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, which reported mortgage applications shot up more than 31 percent since the vote, mostly because of consumer interest in refinancing. MICHAEL FRATANTONI: Refinance activity had been falling until we've seen this most recent drop in rates. NOGUCHI: Fratantoni notes the new lower rates are fanning the flames of demand for housing, as well. An even stronger demand it means many homeowners who suffered through the housing crisis can finally sell at a profit. FRATANTONI: We've seen some strong home price growth the past couple of years, so many of those people are now in a better position to be able to sell and potentially move up. So, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if the pace of home sales picks up. NOGUCHI: And that could start a virtuous cycle in the housing market that could extend well beyond the aftermath of Brexit.

S. Treasury bonds. The demand for bonds has pushed down interest rates, and that should be good news for state and local governments that need cheap money to fix roads, bridges and other infrastructure. But as Charles Lane of member station WSHU reports, few of them are taking advantage of the opportunity. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: At its widest part, New York's Hudson River slows down to a glassy drift beneath the cliffs of the Palisades. Here, about 25 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, a dozen barge cranes are busy rebuilding the 3-mile-long Tappan Zee Bridge. SANDRA BLEJER: It's sort of like modern-day dinosaurs. They look small, but when you get up close or by the bridge and you look at them, they're actually quite massive. LANE: Sandra Blejer, a retired medical manager, walks out here most mornings and marvels at the $4 billion project that has been taking shape on giant pillar at a time. BLEJER: All up and down the Hudson River, there's places where things are being prepared and then boated down, and it's just an incredible feat to watch being built. LANE: Financing the project was no small task, either. To start paying for construction, a state agency had to issue bonds worth $1. 6 billion. That was three years ago when interest rates were a third higher. Matt Fabian researches bonds for Municipal Markets Analytics. He says that today's historically low rates make this the best time ever to borrow for a bridge. MATT FABIAN: You know, the ultimate toll that will have to be charged to people who take the bridge could be a bit lower. LANE: It's not just bridges. High-speed rail, airports, roads, all sorts of public infrastructure can be financed on the cheap today. FABIAN: So corporations have been incredibly opportunistic issuing mountains of bonds of the - you know, in 2016 so far - state and local governments - not so much. LANE: And there's several reasons for this. First, while governments can borrow money to build bridges, they can't borrow money to operate them. Investors aren't going to loan city money for an airport they can't afford to hire baggage handlers for. Robert Palter is an infrastructure expert at McKinsey and Company. He says another major risk with big projects happens at the drawing board before you even get to the bond market. ROBERT PALTER: And it is time-consuming, and it's very expensive because you have to incur legal fees, engineering fees, designer fees, permitting fees. LANE: And then there's the politics of it all. Republicans in Congress have resisted increasing federal spending to match state funding for infrastructure because they don't want to issue additional bonds at a time when they national debt is around $19 trillion. Leading economists overwhelmingly disagree with that position. According to a poll by the University of Chicago School of Business, most economists say that it makes sense to invest in infrastructure now. But lawmakers answer to voters, and Palter says voters have not made road and bridge repair a top priority. PALTER: Things like health care, education, debt, taxes tend to rise above solving infrastructure problems. LANE: But there's still time. With global growth slowing amid continued uncertainty over the Brexit, low interest rates are expected to last a long while. For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Since Britain voted to leave the European Union, investors have been moving cash to safe havens like U. S. Treasury bonds. The demand for bonds has pushed down interest rates, and that should be good news for state and local governments that need cheap money to fix roads, bridges and other infrastructure. But as Charles Lane of member station WSHU reports, few of them are taking advantage of the opportunity. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: At its widest part, New York's Hudson River slows down to a glassy drift beneath the cliffs of the Palisades. Here, about 25 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, a dozen barge cranes are busy rebuilding the 3-mile-long Tappan Zee Bridge. SANDRA BLEJER: It's sort of like modern-day dinosaurs. They look small, but when you get up close or by the bridge and you look at them, they're actually quite massive. LANE: Sandra Blejer, a retired medical manager, walks out here most mornings and marvels at the $4 billion project that has been taking shape on giant pillar at a time. BLEJER: All up and down the Hudson River, there's places where things are being prepared and then boated down, and it's just an incredible feat to watch being built. LANE: Financing the project was no small task, either. To start paying for construction, a state agency had to issue bonds worth $1. 6 billion. That was three years ago when interest rates were a third higher. Matt Fabian researches bonds for Municipal Markets Analytics. He says that today's historically low rates make this the best time ever to borrow for a bridge. MATT FABIAN: You know, the ultimate toll that will have to be charged to people who take the bridge could be a bit lower. LANE: It's not just bridges. High-speed rail, airports, roads, all sorts of public infrastructure can be financed on the cheap today. FABIAN: So corporations have been incredibly opportunistic issuing mountains of bonds of the - you know, in 2016 so far - state and local governments - not so much. LANE: And there's several reasons for this. First, while governments can borrow money to build bridges, they can't borrow money to operate them. Investors aren't going to loan city money for an airport they can't afford to hire baggage handlers for. Robert Palter is an infrastructure expert at McKinsey and Company. He says another major risk with big projects happens at the drawing board before you even get to the bond market. ROBERT PALTER: And it is time-consuming, and it's very expensive because you have to incur legal fees, engineering fees, designer fees, permitting fees. LANE: And then there's the politics of it all. Republicans in Congress have resisted increasing federal spending to match state funding for infrastructure because they don't want to issue additional bonds at a time when they national debt is around $19 trillion. Leading economists overwhelmingly disagree with that position. According to a poll by the University of Chicago School of Business, most economists say that it makes sense to invest in infrastructure now. But lawmakers answer to voters, and Palter says voters have not made road and bridge repair a top priority. PALTER: Things like health care, education, debt, taxes tend to rise above solving infrastructure problems. LANE: But there's still time.

We met Rob Weindell on a cul-de-sac in St. Charles, Mo. He says he has less money than he used to. His story was simple but clearly painful to tell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ROB WEINDELL: Actually, I lost my job. I got downsized. INSKEEP: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where we were working? WEINDELL: At Xerox. INSKEEP: When did that happen to you? WEINDELL: 2009. INSKEEP: OK. That was a long time ago. Have you been able to work since? WEINDELL: No. INSKEEP: You've looked and nothing is. . . WEINDELL: No. After that, I got in a bad car accident. I'm on disability. INSKEEP: We call attention to this story because Mr. Weindell is not alone. The number of people on disability has steadily risen for decades. David Wessel of The Brookings Institution is here to help us understand what's happening. Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good Morning. INSKEEP: How big is this trend? WESSEL: Well, Mr. Weindell is not unique. There are now about 9 million American workers, twice as many as 20 years ago, who get money from the Social Security disability program because, in the terms of the law, they can't engage in what - in substantial, gainful activity. INSKEEP: Wow. WESSEL: Now, some of that's because we have more older workers, and they are more likely to be on disability. But even adjusting for that, the Social Security trustee says the rate at which adults get benefits has risen by 25 percent over the past two decades. Five percent of all Americans are getting these benefits. In some states, mostly in the South, it's 7 percent or higher. INSKEEP: Wow. So what's happening here? Is this essentially long-term unemployment maybe for some people? WESSEL: It is, in fact, the ultimate safety net. Now, there are a lot of things going on. Congress has made the program easier to qualify for benefits over the past 30 years, but we know that people like Mr. Weindell who lose their jobs are more likely to apply for disability. We know that people who have poor job prospects, perhaps because they have little skills or little education, find it attractive sometimes to go on disability because of the way the formula works. And we know that when the job market is lousy, people who have a disability but might choose to ignore it and work - opt out and go into the system. INSKEEP: Well, the job market is not supposed to be lousy right now. The unemployment rate has gone below 5 percent. Are there people who are just not able to participate here? WESSEL: Yeah, there are. The number of people in the job market working for - looking for work has fallen. And particularly for low-wage workers, low-skill workers, the job market remains pretty unattractive. And so some of them, this is the last resort. And of course, it wasn't designed for that. It was designed in an era 50 years ago, when it was launched, when either you were disabled or you were a worker. And now we know, because of the American Disabilities Act, which requires employer to accommodate disabilities, the advance of medical technology and medical science, that we don't - we have a system that no longer makes it easy to be partially disabled. INSKEEP: This has become sometimes a political issue. As we were travelling around, we also met a Republican politician in Maryland who said he was convinced that people on disability, some of them, can actually work. Is he right? WESSEL: Yes, there has been some fraud. Some of it involves conspiracies with doctors and lawyers and even Social Security administration judges. For instance, more than 100 New York City cops and firefighters have pled guilty to falsely claiming that they had psychiatric disability stemming from 9/11. And it's true that people who get on SSDI rarely get off the program and return to work. But I think it's a stretch to say that the bulk of the people in the program are faking it or committing fraud. INSKEEP: Most people need something. WESSEL: Yes, most of the people on the program can't work. And we've made it hard for them to be partially disabled and get some benefit but still work. INSKEEP: David, thanks very much.

S. indexes closed at record highs today. That came after better-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other companies. It wasn't supposed to happen this way. After the Brexit vote a few weeks ago, U. S. stock prices wiped out most of their gains for the year. Since then, investors have reassessed their views on the economy, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Just a couple of weeks ago, the pessimism about the global economy was thick. It looked for a while like the European Union was beginning to unravel, and the U. S. jobs report for May turned out to be remarkably disappointing. The Federal Reserve, which had looked pretty likely to raise interest rates, no longer seemed inclined to do so. But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says the mood has changed. JIM PAULSEN: I think some of that's being alleviated now. People are getting a little more calm, and some are getting optimistic that economic recovery looks like it's going to continue. And if it is, then the bull market is likely to continue. ZARROLI: Which is why the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of a little more than 18,500 today. Paulson says there's simply been a lot of good data lately, and it's persuaded nervous investors that the economy isn't heading off a cliff after all. PAULSEN: If you look at the broad array of jobs numbers from record low unemployment insurance claims to still pretty good overall payroll and household numbers coming from the Labor Department to rising wages, it seems to suggest that not only the job market but the overall economy remains in OK shape. ZARROLI: And what about Brexit, the surprise decision by the United Kingdom to abandon the European Union? The quick formation of a new British Cabinet and the naming of a prime minister has gone a long way toward appeasing the markets. There are still likely to be economic ramifications for the U. K. and Europe, but Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, says the damage to the U. S. economy is likely to be limited, at least for now. LIZ ANN SONDERS: Trade between the U. S. and the U. K. accounts for less than half of 1 percent of U. S. GDP. So the math suggests that this is not likely to be a big hit. ZARROLI: In the meantime, something pretty remarkable is happening in the bond markets. Usually when there's evidence that the economy is doing better than expected, interest rates start to rise, but that hasn't happened. John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial, says take for instance last Friday's much-better-than-expected unemployment report. JOHN CANALLY: Normally when that happens, the Treasury bond yield spikes higher, but yet on Friday, bond yields moved lower. I've been doing this for 30 years, and that's the first time I've ever seen that happen. ZARROLI: The reasons for that are complicated, and they say a lot about the interconnectedness of the global economy. Right now the central banks of countries such as Japan, Germany and Switzerland are actually selling bonds with negative interest rates. By keeping rates so low, central banks are hoping to encourage people to spend more. So rather than lose money on negative interest bonds, investors are hunting for safe places to put their money. They're sending some of it into U. S. Treasury bills, which is why interest rates have been generally falling. And they're also putting it into stocks, and that's another reason why stock prices have been setting records this week. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  The major U.

LYNN NEARY, HOST: And now, Hanging On, our series about the economic pressures of American life. And today we're talking about summer, who can and can't afford it. When school ends for the year, some kids go to camps, summer school, daycare. But a lot of these options are expensive. And many families have to come up with cheaper, creative alternatives. ROCHELLE HALE: Our city's rec center. AARON BARSI: We have what we call Camp Grandma. SHARON SPRAGUE: We look for low-cost or free options like town pools, programs at the library. HALE: It's the same cost as the after-school program he was in during the school year, so $60 a week. BARSI: My oldest, Anya (ph), stays up north with my parents, which is about four hours away for eight weeks. SPRAGUE: My husband and I, we have to work. So he is the owner of the Chestnut Hill Soccer Club. And either I work from home and the kids are with me, or they get to go to soccer camp with him. NEARY: That was Rochelle Hale (ph), Aaron Barsi (ph) and Sharon Sprague. And K. J. Dell'Antonia wrote about the economic hardships of summer for The New York Times. She joins us now. Thanks for being with us. K J DELL'ANTONIA: Thanks for having me. NEARY: Now, a lot of people told you that during the summer, they have no other option but to leave their kids alone in their homes, maybe with a relative. But often they're by themselves. But, you know, those days of leaving kids out and they could ride their bicycles around or just be gone for an entire day on an adventure, those days are gone, right? K J DELL'ANTONIA: Right. I mean, that's what we used to do. And that is invariably what people say when you write about this particular topic. But that's just not something we can do anymore. Considering the woman in South Carolina who was arrested in 2014 for leaving her 9-year-old daughter at a park while she worked, it's not an accepted part of our society anymore. NEARY: And what about the other option of leaving kids with other relatives or older kids to babysit for them? NEARY: Well, it depends on what you define as older. What research has found is that self-care goes up in the summer for 6- to 12-year-olds. So you could have that child home alone, or you could have a 6-year-old being babysat by a 10-year-old, in effect. That's considered a little young in a lot of places now. And when it comes to being left with a family member, you know, some kids get lucky. Some spend summer with grandma. That's fantastic. Others, that family member may be a little less enthusiastic, a little less capable of getting out or may have a bunch of kids around, which can be sort of good and bad. NEARY: And there's a big educational consequence here, too, because some of the summer camps and the summer programs are real sort of educational enrichment programs for kids who can afford them, while these other kids who can't afford them, they often fall behind over the summer, right? K J DELL'ANTONIA: Right. It's called the summer slide. And to some extent, it affects everybody. Most kids fall back a little in math. When it comes to reading, what research has shown is that lower-income kids typically lose two to three months over the summer. And the big distinction when it comes to reading is that they just don't get it back. And researchers aren't super clear on why that is. But they are pretty clear on the fact that a learning-based program, something - you know, just getting out there and doing something different and hearing new words and keeping going and doing some reading in that context that keeps the skills up. NEARY: In researching this issue, did you come across any local government programs or low-cost resources that parents can use? K J DELL'ANTONIA: Well, that's what's really interesting. There is a lot out there. What I found when I talked to parents was that when they knew about a program, they were ready to jump on it. I talked to this one woman who said, I knew I had to be online right at 10 a. m. to get her signed up for the thing that's $100 a week with the city. And it was like I was waiting for concert tickets. And that program did fill up fast. But I also talked to some people who run programs who say, you know, we have room. But they're either not getting the word out to the parents, or the parents can't get the kids to the program. And that's another piece of this, the question of transportation at the right time. If your job starts at 7 o'clock in the morning and the program starts at 9, that's not going to help much. It's really all part of that whole distinction between life as an upper- and middle-income parent and life for a lower-income parent. It's just harder to do everything. NEARY: Here's what I found really interesting, that despite all these challenges, I think most of the parents you talked to were not in favor of doing away with summer vacation. They like the idea of summer vacation. K J DELL'ANTONIA: Oh, we all love the idea of summer vacation. I love the idea of summer vacation (laughter). It's a wonderful part of our culture. And we really think of it, even if we're not experiencing it, as this time of freedom. And, you know, parents at every income level want to come home in the long evenings and have that time with their kids and have the lack of scheduling. So it is funny. You'd think we'd want to do away with it because it's a challenge, but we don't. We just want it to be what we want it to be. NEARY: K. J. Dell'Antonia is a columnist and contributing editor for The New York Times' \"Well Family\" blog. Thanks so much for being with us. K J DELL'ANTONIA: Thank you.

NEARY: And what about the other option of leaving kids with other relatives or older kids to babysit for them? NEARY: Well, it depends on what you define as older. What research has found is that self-care goes up in the summer for 6- to 12-year-olds. So you could have that child home alone, or you could have a 6-year-old being babysat by a 10-year-old, in effect. That's considered a little young in a lot of places now. And when it comes to being left with a family member, you know, some kids get lucky. Some spend summer with grandma. That's fantastic. Others, that family member may be a little less enthusiastic, a little less capable of getting out or may have a bunch of kids around, which can be sort of good and bad. NEARY: And there's a big educational consequence here, too, because some of the summer camps and the summer programs are real sort of educational enrichment programs for kids who can afford them, while these other kids who can't afford them, they often fall behind over the summer, right? K J DELL'ANTONIA: Right. It's called the summer slide. And to some extent, it affects everybody. Most kids fall back a little in math. When it comes to reading, what research has shown is that lower-income kids typically lose two to three months over the summer. And the big distinction when it comes to reading is that they just don't get it back. And researchers aren't super clear on why that is. But they are pretty clear on the fact that a learning-based program, something - you know, just getting out there and doing something different and hearing new words and keeping going and doing some reading in that context that keeps the skills up. NEARY: In researching this issue, did you come across any local government programs or low-cost resources that parents can use? K J DELL'ANTONIA: Well, that's what's really interesting. There is a lot out there. What I found when I talked to parents was that when they knew about a program, they were ready to jump on it. I talked to this one woman who said, I knew I had to be online right at 10 a. m. to get her signed up for the thing that's $100 a week with the city. And it was like I was waiting for concert tickets. And that program did fill up fast. But I also talked to some people who run programs who say, you know, we have room. But they're either not getting the word out to the parents, or the parents can't get the kids to the program. And that's another piece of this, the question of transportation at the right time. If your job starts at 7 o'clock in the morning and the program starts at 9, that's not going to help much. It's really all part of that whole distinction between life as an upper- and middle-income parent and life for a lower-income parent. It's just harder to do everything. NEARY: Here's what I found really interesting, that despite all these challenges, I think most of the parents you talked to were not in favor of doing away with summer vacation. They like the idea of summer vacation. K J DELL'ANTONIA: Oh, we all love the idea of summer vacation. I love the idea of summer vacation (laughter). It's a wonderful part of our culture. And we really think of it, even if we're not experiencing it, as this time of freedom. And, you know, parents at every income level want to come home in the long evenings and have that time with their kids and have the lack of scheduling. So it is funny. You'd think we'd want to do away with it because it's a challenge, but we don't. We just want it to be what we want it to be. NEARY: K. J.

That got NPR movie critic Bob Mondello thinking about the old middle, what filmmakers have been telling us about middle-class life through the years. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE: Not for nothing do they call Hollywood a dream factory. Got a vision of the sort of place you'd like to live? Tinseltown can bring it to life. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\")ELLEN GREENE: (Singing) A matchbox of our own, a fence of real chain link. MONDELLO: This is from \"Little Shop Of \"Horrors,\" a musical that gently satirized the notions of middle class bliss that filmmakers have long trafficked in. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\")GREENE: (Singing) A washer and a dryer and an ironing machine, in a tract house that we share somewhere that's green. MONDELLO: This vision of suburban bliss was set in the 1960s, but it had been a Hollywood staple since the days of silent films. Charlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times,\" for instance, where the Little Tramp and a down-and-out Paulette Goddard looked at a suburban house and imagined themselves inside - Goddard in an apron with her hair done, chintz curtains, flowered carpet, nice furniture, Charlie reaching out of the window to pluck an orange from a tree, grapes from a vine. And then - such is the magic of this land of plenty - he grabs an empty pitcher, places it under a cow in the backyard, pats her flank, and she fills the pitcher with milk as he and Goddard sit down to a big steak dinner. It is as they're cutting into the steaks that there's a dissolve. Their stomachs growling woke them from the dream. We'll get a home, says a determined Little Tramp on the title card, even if I have to work for it. And that's the rub - working for it. It's also why we don't often see middle-class people at home in movies. They're off working in places that filmmakers have lots of fun making far more glamorous than home. Think Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers who in most of their movies played kids who danced for a living - hardly a recipe for wealth. In \"Swing Time,\" Fred was flat broke. Ginger was a dance instructor who didn't know she was about to be laid off. But Fred did, so he figured out how to make her boss take a fresh look at her. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"SWING TIME\")FRED ASTAIRE: (As Lucky Garnett) I want to show Mr. Gordon how much you've just taught me. GINGER ROGERS: (As Penny Carroll) No, never mind. ASTAIRE: (As Lucky Garnett) Oh, thank you very much. Now, how did you say that last step went? Oh, yes. Shall we try it right through? Are you watching this now Mr. Gordon? MONDELLO: You'll be pleased to know she keeps the job. As in almost all their movies together, we barely see these two at home. We see them living a white-telephone existence in hotels, in nightclubs, at the estates of rich patrons. They're working stiffs like us. They just get to live large. Later and especially after World War II, middle-class movies were about work and struggle, upward mobility. Where Chaplin was striving to get into the middle class and Fred and Ginger wanted to stay in it, Gregory Peck was urged by his wife to rise out of it in \"The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit. \" The year was 1956. She wanted a bigger house, and he just saw bigger bills. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT\")GREGORY PECK: (As Tom Rath) Do you know what it would cost to keep up a place like that - something like 6,000 a year on a $7,000 salary. JENNIFER JONES: (As Betsy Rath) But you're not going to always be making 7,000. PECK: (As Tom Rath) That's what I mean. I could be making less. JONES: (As Betsy Rath) But you can't look at things like that, Tommy. You've got to believe that things are going to get better. MONDELLO: That belief in upward mobility for the middle class was hardly unanimous in the post-war years. Prejudice meant that many people had their dreams deferred - Sidney Poitier and his family, say - in \"A Raisin In The Sun. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"A RAISIN IN THE SUN\")SIDNEY POITIER: (As Walter Lee Younger) Looking in the mirror this morning and I'm thinking I'm 35 years old. I'm married 11 years, and I've got a boy who's got to sleep in the living room because I got nothing, eh, nothing to give him but stories. MONDELLO: Stories, let's note, is what Hollywood has to give, and they tend to be peopled by folks who are not troubled by such everyday concerns as mortgages or credit card debts. Partly that's to simplify storytelling. You don't want the audience worrying about how the characters will pay their bills if a film is dealing with some other major theme - love, death, whatever. So in comedies and romances, characters are generally well off, and in dramas, if they're not well off, then that's the point. Again, \"A Raisin In The Sun. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"A RAISIN IN THE SUN\")CLAUDIA MCNEIL: (As Lena Younger) Son, how come you talk, talk, talk so much about money? POITIER: (As Walter Lee Younger) Because it's life. MCNEIL: (As Lena Younger) So now money is life. Once upon a time freedom used to be life. Well, now it's money. POITIER: (As Walter Lee Younger) Mama, it was always money. We just didn't know it. MCNEIL: (As Lena Younger) Oh, no, no. Something's changed. In my time, we was worried about not being lynched and getting to the North and how to stay alive and still have a pinch of dignity, too. Now here come you and Beneatha talking about things we ain't hardly ever thought about, me and your daddy. You ain't satisfied or proud of nothing we done. I mean that you had a home and that we kept you out of trouble 'til you was grown and that you don't have to ride to work on the back of nobody's streetcar. You're my children but how different we've become. MONDELLO: That generational shift speaks to what is perhaps the biggest concern of middle-class parents. They have sacrificed so their children can have it better than they did, and wouldn't you know, the kids have different ideas about what's important in life. John Hughes wrote movies about teenagers - \"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles\" - that capture the way high schoolers think about wealth and class distinctions - Molly Ringwald worrying about dating a guy from the other side of the tracks in \"Pretty In Pink,\" for instance. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PRETTY IN PINK\")MOLLY RINGWALD: (As Andie) You know, it's just weird, you know? His friends have a lot of money, and he has a lot of money. He drives a BMW. It just - I don't know. I'm not really sure if they're going to accept me. HARRY DEAN STANTON: (As Jack) What his friends think shouldn't make any difference. RINGWALD: (As Andie) Yeah, but it's not just his friends. It's my friends, too. It's everybody. MONDELLO: Public schools can be great equalizers, bringing together students from various social backgrounds. And something similar could be said of the sort of neighborhood melting pot in movies where different ethnicities get thrown together. In Clint Eastwood's \"Gran Torino,\" for instance, he's a grumpy war veteran who is less than thrilled that Asian emigres have moved into his neighborhood and annoyed to the point of being offensive when they try to thank him for scaring away gang members. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GRAN TORINO\")CLINT EASTWOOD: (As Walt Kowalski) Why are you bringing me all this garbage anyway? UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Because you saved Thao. EASTWOOD: (As Walt Kowalski) I didn't save anybody. I just - I kept a bunch of jabbering [expletive] off of my lawn. That's all. UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood. EASTWOOD: (As Walt Kowalski) I'm not a hero. UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Too bad they think you are. And that's why they keep bringing you their gifts. MONDELLO: Part of what pulls these disparate neighbors together and does the same thing in films by John Sayles and others who make movies about communities is that these folks, although not impoverished, are stuck where they are without the wherewithal to move. Wealthier folks could change their circumstances, but wealth, for the most part, is not a good thing in movies. Think Bond villains with their palatial layers, predatory Wall Street bankers. To be rich is often to be reviled in films, in everything from action adventures to superhero flicks. Imagine the Man of Steel taking on a bricklayer. Far more likely his rival will be a crazed gazillionaire with a flair for the dramatic. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE\")JESSE EISENBERG: (As Lex Luthor) God versus man, day versus night, son of Krypton versus bat of Gotham. MONDELLO: Superheroes, by contrast, tend to have a common touch. And yes, I know, Batman's a billionaire. Exceptions prove the rule, right? Superman grew up on a farm. The Flash was a police department drudge. Captain America was a struggling New York artist, which may be why in his latest movie he doesn't have much use for rich guy Tony Stark but does offer grudging admiration for that spunky teenager in the spider suit. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CAPTAIN AMERICAN: CIVIL WAR\")CHRIS EVANS: (As Captain America) You've got heart, kid. Where are you from? TOM HOLLAND: (As Peter Parker) Queens. MONDELLO: One melting pot borough. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"CAPTAIN AMERICAN: CIVIL WAR\")EVANS: (As Captain America) Brooklyn. MONDELLO: . . . To another. He can identify, and because most movie patrons grew up middle-class much like he did, we can identify, too. These are, after all, souped-up versions of our best selves courtesy of the Hollywood dream factory. I'm Bob Mondello.

That might mean some downsizing - real downsizing. Places like New York, Seattle, San Francisco, where space is scarce, demand is through the roof, if you can afford a roof, there's a new housing trend. NPR's Lee Hale has more on what's called micro apartments. LEE HALE, BYLINE: Think dorm life, but a little more grown up. Small studio apartments, kitchenettes, beds that fold into the wall to make space. It's a tight fit. And before Christine House and her boyfriend moved in a couple months ago, some of her friends warned her. CHRISTINA HOUSE: Oh, you're going to lose space. Aren't you going to be cramped? But honestly, we have more living space and more sleeping space in this apartment, even though it's a different format. HALE: Christina lives at the new WeLive apartment building in Arlington, Va. The developer says what residents like her give up in square footage is made up for in large communal spaces, like a fitness studio. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Come all the way back up to the top. Let's see five more. Here we go. Five air squats. Push your knees out. HALE: There's also a giant commercial-grade kitchen downstairs and a large living room with plush couches and bookshelves. But what Christina appreciates the most doesn't have to do with all the additional space. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG COLLAR JINGLING)HOUSE: Hi. Hi. Hey. HALE: That's Christina's dog, Raleigh, a high-energy lab-beagle mix. HOUSE: My first week here, one of the girls - they met him, and they're like, oh, he's so sweet. If you can't get home in time, I'm happy to, like, come by your apartment, and, like, I'll walk him for you. I was like OK, thanks. Yeah. BRAD HARGREAVES: People are looking to live in community. That is, they're a little sick of the shiny glass high-rise where nobody knows their neighbors. HALE: This is Brad Hargreaves, founder and CEO of Common in Brooklyn. Like WeLive, Common offers small personal living spaces and planned events, like group dinners or book clubs. Hargreaves wants to make the decision of where to live as stress-free as possible. He even streamlined the application process, and he throws in unlimited coffee. People are lining up. HARGREAVES: We've gotten over 6,000 applications for about a hundred rooms that we've opened thus far. HALE: Six thousand applications. Mike Simonsen of Altos Research sees this as evidence of a housing crisis in coastal cities, like New York and Seattle. MIKE SIMONSEN: Strong economic growth, strong inbound immigration and a real shortage of affordable quality units. HALE: Simonsen is both a real estate consultant and an investor. He's helping fund a new micro apartment project in Seattle called Anew Apartments, and he shared some numbers to back up his decision to invest, like 40,000. That's the number of jobs he says Seattle is adding each year. Compare that to the number of new apartments - only 7,000 - and you start to see a real problem - or, for Simonsen, a business opportunity. SIMONSEN: I don't think this is going to replace things like high-rise development. But I think it's a really important trend, especially in the cities facing this crisis. HALE: An apartment at Anew will cost you a little over a thousand a month for about 250 square feet. That's smaller than your typical studio, but they look sharp - granite countertops, stainless steel. The developers use the word luxury, but not everyone can afford those prices. And some developers also see potential in micro apartments as affordable housing, like Linda Mandolini. She says micro apartments would meet her clients' financial, as well as social, needs. LINDA MANDOLINI: What they're really demanding is not just an apartment building where they're - you know, they're not part of something bigger. They really want to be in a context where they have a neighborhood and they have a community. And I think landlords are really trying to be competitive with that. HALE: Mandolini expects that all developers will begin thinking less about square footage and access to a swimming pool and more about what it takes to create a sense of belonging.

If you can't get home in time, I'm happy to, like, come by your apartment, and, like, I'll walk him for you. I was like OK, thanks. Yeah. BRAD HARGREAVES: People are looking to live in community. That is, they're a little sick of the shiny glass high-rise where nobody knows their neighbors. HALE: This is Brad Hargreaves, founder and CEO of Common in Brooklyn. Like WeLive, Common offers small personal living spaces and planned events, like group dinners or book clubs. Hargreaves wants to make the decision of where to live as stress-free as possible. He even streamlined the application process, and he throws in unlimited coffee. People are lining up. HARGREAVES: We've gotten over 6,000 applications for about a hundred rooms that we've opened thus far. HALE: Six thousand applications. Mike Simonsen of Altos Research sees this as evidence of a housing crisis in coastal cities, like New York and Seattle. MIKE SIMONSEN: Strong economic growth, strong inbound immigration and a real shortage of affordable quality units. HALE: Simonsen is both a real estate consultant and an investor. He's helping fund a new micro apartment project in Seattle called Anew Apartments, and he shared some numbers to back up his decision to invest, like 40,000. That's the number of jobs he says Seattle is adding each year. Compare that to the number of new apartments - only 7,000 - and you start to see a real problem - or, for Simonsen, a business opportunity. SIMONSEN: I don't think this is going to replace things like high-rise development. But I think it's a really important trend, especially in the cities facing this crisis. HALE: An apartment at Anew will cost you a little over a thousand a month for about 250 square feet. That's smaller than your typical studio, but they look sharp - granite countertops, stainless steel. The developers use the word luxury, but not everyone can afford those prices. And some developers also see potential in micro apartments as affordable housing, like Linda Mandolini. She says micro apartments would meet her clients' financial, as well as social, needs. LINDA MANDOLINI: What they're really demanding is not just an apartment building where they're - you know, they're not part of something bigger. They really want to be in a context where they have a neighborhood and they have a community. And I think landlords are really trying to be competitive with that. HALE: Mandolini expects that all developers will begin thinking less about square footage and access to a swimming pool and more about what it takes to create a sense of belonging.

Much, if not all, of the losses during the financial crisis are being erased in most parts of the country. But the market is seeing far fewer first-time home buyers than before. Some analysts say as younger buyers age, that will change. Others contend homeownership is on a slow decline. NPR's Yuki Noguchi explores the theories about the absent first-time buyers. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Trevor Burbank is single, 27 and has been house-hunting in Nashville for the last year. TREVOR BURBANK: My rent's going up in August, so I have to figure out what I'm doing. NOGUCHI: The last time Burbank looked, it was five years ago. He decided to use his down payment to start a business instead. BURBANK: There was a house that I really liked, and it was going for $60,000. And I saw the house being sold in the past few months for just shy of $300,000. NOGUCHI: His startup isn't generating much salary yet, so qualifying for a mortgage took some finagling. He's looking for a fixer-upper, but sellers are driving hard bargains on those, too. BURBANK: In some cases, there's not even photos online. So you don't get a tour, you don't get photos. NOGUCHI: He's losing out to investors buying sight unseen. That's a bridge too far for Burbank, so for now he remains on the sidelines. There's a big debate in real estate over where homeownership rates are headed and whether millennials, people who came of age around 2000, will get into the housing market the way generations before them did. The percentage of people under age 35 who are homeowners went from 42 percent a decade ago to just over a third now. Lawrence Yun is chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. He says young people are squeezed from both sides. Rents are increasing even faster than home prices, and he says city politicians aren't making it easy for developers to build condominiums that would be good starter homes. LAWRENCE YUN: We are creating this divide because of the ongoing housing shortage. NOGUCHI: There are other factors everyone agrees are making it harder for today's younger homebuyers. They're delaying marriage, mortgages are harder to get, and people are staying in school longer, taking larger loans. The question is, is homeownership on a permanent decline because of high costs, changing demographics or new attitudes about homeownership? JONATHAN SPADER: That's the million-dollar question. NOGUCHI: Jonathan Spader is senior researcher at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing. He takes the view that ownership may stay the same, just delayed for the younger generation. SPADER: We really haven't seen a shift in interest in homeownership among younger households. NOGUCHI: In surveys, a huge majority - 90 percent of those under age 30 - expect to eventually own, he says. But their earnings took a hit in the recession eight years ago, and it's taking them longer to save up a down payment. Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, takes a different view. She thinks the younger generation is simply less interested in homeownership. LAURIE GOODMAN: This is a permanent shift. NOGUCHI: Goodman cites a 2014 study by Fannie Mae of prime homebuyers. It found among young, college-educated, upper-income white families, homeownership fell 6 percent from 2000. GOODMAN: And that sort of best captures this sort of subtle change in attitudes towards homeownership because this is a group for whom there's no reason not to be homeowners. NOGUCHI: Of course, over 80 percent of them eventually buy. But. . . GOODMAN: . . . They're doing it later, and a lower percentage of them are eventually doing it. NOGUCHI: And then there are the views of Ted Gayer, an economist at the Brookings Institution. TED GAYER: I actually think that homeownership rates are likely to increase. NOGUCHI: He says many young adults lived with their parents to weather the post-recession years. But as they age, more will start new households, and that trend will increase. GAYER: This millennial generation is actually a rather large generation. NOGUCHI: At 82 million people, he says, it outranks the baby boomers in size. And he expects that means a bigger housing boom is around the corner. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Home sales and home prices are up.

That provision goes into effect in 2018. It's part of a sweeping new law on equal pay that the state's Republican governor signed this week. From member station WBUR in Boston, Fred Thys reports. FRED THYS, BYLINE: Massachusetts is the first state to forbid employers from asking job applicants how much they made at their previous jobs. The goal is to prevent women from being stuck in a cycle of low salaries. Victoria Budson directs the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and pushed for passage of the law. VICTORIA BUDSON: This is such an important piece of the pay equity bill because what happens to people over time is if in that first negotiation or those first few jobs out of high school or college you are underpaid, then you really get a snowball effect where if each subsequent salary is really benchmarked to that, then what can happen is that type of usually implicit and occasionally explicit discrimination really then follows that person throughout their career. THYS: The law's chief sponsor, Democratic state Senator Pat Jehlen, adds that divulging a low salary can even prevent an applicant from getting a job. PAT JEHLEN: We heard about a woman who had had a phone interview for a job, did very well and didn't hang up at the end of the conference call and heard the other people say she looked like an ideal candidate until we heard what she's making now. She must not be as good as she looks. And they didn't hire her. THYS: Another notable provision in the new equal pay law is that it protects employees from retribution if they talk openly about how much they're paid. Only a dozen or so states do that. One business group opposed the new law - the Massachusetts High Technology Council. It objected to the presumption that pay differential is the result of discrimination. The group declined to comment for this story. Other business groups supported the law. One reason - it contains a new first-in-the-nation provision that could help companies. If a company is sued for wage discrimination, it can defend itself by showing that it's taken a look at its pay practices and taken steps to remedy any differences. To Pat Jehlen, that's the most powerful part of the new law. JEHLEN: Because I think most discrimination is not intentional. I think people are unaware of bias or of the causes of bias. And so if they perform a genuine self-assessment looking across the board at what different people are paid and seeing if there is unintentional differentials, they can use that if somebody tries to bring a suit against them. THYS: Vicki Shabo tracks pay equity for the National Partnership for Women and Families and says Massachusetts' new law is part of a trend. VICKI SHABO: It's actually the latest in a run of some pretty strong pay equity laws that have passed over the last year or so in California and New York, recently in Maryland.

The Labor Department says U. S. employers added 255,000 jobs last month. That's a lot more than expected, and it's the second month in a row in which the economy grew by more than a quarter million workers. These monthly reports are going to start to play a role in how voters see the economy as we get closer to the November election. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Tom Maher runs a temporary employment company in Dayton, Ohio, a major center of manufacturing, warehousing and swing-state politics. Late last year, Maher's business weathered a slowdown in hiring. But so far, he says 2016 has been a story of steady growth. TOM MAHER: We have more work available than we have people to take the jobs. HORSLEY: With unemployment just 4. 9 percent, Maher says many businesses he recruits workers for are having to pay more. MAHER: We've been working very hard over the last 12 to 18 months to convince our clients that we do need to begin to increase hourly rates, and we're starting to see success now. The rates are going up, but I don't think they're up as high as they need to be. HORSLEY: Nationwide, wages are on track to grow nearly 3 percent this year, well above the rate of inflation. And hundreds of thousands of new workers entered the labor force last month. In theory, that positive economic news should be good for Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton since voters have less incentive to shift course in the White House. But there's a caveat. NATHAN GONZALES: How the economy is doing is less important than how voters think the economy is doing. HORSLEY: Nathan Gonzales who edits the Rothenberg-Gonzales Political Report says just as Republicans may have overplayed the message of gloom and doom at their convention last month, Democrats have to be careful not to pop the economic champagne corks too quickly. GONZALES: Democrats, I think, have to walk the line between promoting positive jobs numbers and economic data that's out there, but still understanding that there is a segment of the American people who don't believe that the economy is working for them. HORSLEY: Those are the voters Donald Trump's been targeting. Trump is set to deliver an economic speech in Detroit on Monday, and today he announced the members of his economic advisory council. One of those members UC, Irvine Professor Peter Navarro says buried beneath the jobs number is a tangle of discouraging economic data, including a growing trade deficit. PETER NAVARRO: We're strumbling (ph) along. We're probably stronger than the rest of the world at this point because we're a - such a great nation. But it's far from good enough. We're vastly underperforming, and at the end of the day the problem all gets down to bad trade deals. HORSLEY: The Trump campaign has also been highlighting figures showing lackluster economic growth in recent months of just 1. 2 percent. White House economist Jason Furman argues the underlying growth rate is stronger than that. He notes consumer spending during the three-month period was up more than 4 percent. JASON FURMAN: And when people are nervous, they hold back their spending. That's not what we're seeing now. We're not seeing nervous consumers. We're actually seeing consumers that are optimistic, that are positive, that are out there spending money because they are making more money and believe that their future is strong. HORSLEY: Voters have a few more months to consider how they feel about the economy, and the candidates' competing economic prescriptions before they decide how one important job gets filled.

YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Alan Blinder, a professor at Princeton and a former Fed vice chairman, says there's something most Americans don't know about the labor market. ALAN BLINDER: Every single month, 5 million jobs get destroyed - either people quitting or getting fired. And a little more than 5 million get created. NOGUCHI: So when job numbers fluctuate by 100,000, in the scheme of things, that's not much. Blinder says the numbers are more meaningful when you look at them over the long run - a yearly average, for example. The monthly numbers garner a lot of attention anyway because they're the best data available to get a snapshot of where the labor market is. Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist for job site Glassdoor, agrees the net job growth headline isn't necessarily significant. ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN: The monthly jobs report has very little day-to-day impact on people's lives. Unless you work in finance, it essentially has no impact on you at all. NOGUCHI: Whereas, he says, the numbers you don't hear about - the creation and destruction of jobs - are, in a macro-economic, sense very important. CHAMBERLAIN: That job churning is hugely important for prosperity over time. For the economy to continue to progress, we need to lead unproductive firms contract and die off. And we need to let innovative, well-run companies expand. NOGUCHI: Chamberlain says this month, he expects the job report's importance to be mostly psychological. CHAMBERLAIN: Economically, not that important but psychologically essential as we get close to a presidential election.

Since the 1970s, it's shrunk decade by decade. We also know that income inequality is growing. Meanwhile, the middle class recently crossed an important line. For the first time since experts started keeping track, it is no longer a majority in America. This is The New Middle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think middle-class is you can pay your bills comfortably. You're steady. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Family of five fifty, 50,000. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Well, I always see it as someone who actually owns their own home. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Yeah, being able to afford a place to live and pay your bills and enjoy life. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: The new middle is a two-plus income family with a side hustle. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: We recently visited a place where the middle class has shrunk faster than almost anywhere else in the country. That's because so many people there have gotten richer. This is a boom bust town that reveals a complex picture of America's economic recovery. We are on the wide open plains of West Texas, where you can see the horizon for 360 degrees interrupted only by the nodding up and down of pump jacks pulling oil up out of the earth. This is a town conveniently named Midland. STEPHANIE SHELTON: Oh, so you want the big tour of Midland. You got 10 minutes? SHAPIRO: (Laughter). Stephanie Shelton is a lifelong Midlander. She works at the community college, and she agreed to give us a quick spin through her home town. SHELTON: You're going to take a right on Big Spring. SHAPIRO: To get the hang of this place, you need to start in the middle of downtown where an electric billboard displays the essentials. SHELTON: And I think the marquee is going to be right up here somewhere. SHAPIRO: There's a Chase Bank here, and on the corner, there's a billboard that says the time, the temperature. It says, God bless Midland. And then it says, oil - 45. 94 a barrel. That number - the price of oil by the barrel - affects everything here - whether people in Midland have jobs, how much they pay in rent, whether waitresses make tips or not. And that number is also the reason the middle class here shrank so much since 2000. During the boom, people got rich. SHELTON: At one point, there was a sign at McDonald's that said that they were starting new hires at, like, between $16 and $18 an hour. SHAPIRO: What? SHELTON: So. . . SHAPIRO: At McDonald's - starting salary. SHELTON: Yeah. I mean when McDonald's is hiring $16 an hour, you can imagine what dentists' offices are paying or hospital reception is paying or. . . SHAPIRO: But what happens when the bust comes? SHELTON: Then every - then you have vacancies everywhere. See; like, all these for sale signs now - you would have never seen that before. There's two on these corners right here. SHAPIRO: We're going to show you a day in the life of Midland, and it's an unsteady moment to be here. Oil used to be above a hundred dollars a barrel. Now it's below 50. Some of the people who got rich in Midland are now spending down their savings. Others have left. And some are hoping to use this downturn as a springboard when the next boom comes along. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: What's this? SHAPIRO: It's 8:00 a. m. We're at a daycare center where a dozen little kids are getting the jitters out before they sit down and start their lessons. Ed Mayberry and his wife run this center out of their home. He's also a pastor who used to minister to oil field workers. He told me what these guys would say when prices were at their highest. ED MAYBERRY: Oh, Man, it was like, Man, we just came back from vacation in Hawaii, and we spent, you know, weeks there. And life is good. We just bought a new house and just got a new car - just a lot of material stuff. SHAPIRO: Even with the cars and the vacations, Mayberry says people didn't seem happier overall. MAYBERRY: Children were raised with dad kind of out the house most of the time, so moms were being overwhelmed and even during the boom. SHAPIRO: So you're saying even having more money (laughter) - I want to say more money, more problems (laughter). MAYBERRY: More problems - yeah, absolutely. That's exactly right, yeah. I mean you see guys, men go to work at - I don't know - 3 in the morning and work weeks. There was more problems for sure. SHAPIRO: He's seen what life is like when the middle class disappears, and it worries him. MAYBERRY: I think we'll kind of destroy ourselves without the middle class, Man. SHAPIRO: And at the same time, do you dream of getting out of the middle class even though you say the middle class is really important? MAYBERRY: Absolutely, yeah, and the reason (laughter) - yeah, that's kind of ironic. But the reason is I think getting out of the middle class, you can tend to help the middle class a little bit more. SHAPIRO: Mayberry and his wife have raised prices at their daycare center from 300 a month to $400 per kid. There's a waiting list, so they're hoping to move into a bigger space. And he's looking to buy a church where he can minister. MAYBERRY: It's not to say that I'll be a millionaire next week or next year, but I feel the momentum is coming. And I feel like I'm kind of at the tipping point where all the momentum up until this point is kind of getting ready to tip me over. SHAPIRO: In some ways, Midland's wild economic swings are nothing like the rest of the country. This boom-bust cycle is pretty extreme, but in other ways, the story of Midland is the story of the U. S. In the last decade, two-thirds of Americans who left middle class went up. They got rich. Only one-third who left the middle class sank down into poverty. (CROSSTALK)SHAPIRO: It's lunchtime at the Mulberry Cafe - burgers, soup, sandwiches, wine and beer on tap. The owner is also Midland's mayor, Jerry Morales. JERRY MORALES: This one opens for breakfast, so I'll come have a cup of coffee, check on them and then go to the other restaurant, work the lunch crowd, shake hands - hello; how are you doing - and then bounce out of there, go do some city work. SHAPIRO: This is his family's third restaurant in town, the newest. He says running any restaurant or any city can be challenging. But imagine trying to do it when the tax income and the population ricochet all over the place from one year to the next. MORALES: It's scary. It's - you know, you really get nerve wracked trying to figure out, how are you going to set aside money for road infrastructure, for example, when you get a report from your staff saying 30 percent of your roads are unrepairable? We need 112 million just to catch up that 30 percent and that - including - if we get another boom here in another - a year or maybe less and you have a 13 percent increase in your traffic, you're going to be challenged. You're - that's scary. So you're only going to get further behind. SHAPIRO: He says as a restaurant owner, sales go up and down about 20 percent depending on the price of oil. Everyone finds creative ways to attract talent. The mayor closed his restaurants on Sundays, offered employees free meals, flexible hours and insurance. Other places offered free shuttles to and from work. But when oil prices fell, everything changed. Thomas Carney got laid off from his job in the oil fields. THOMAS CARNEY: Well, I got six kids, lived in Midland for going on about 32 years. SHAPIRO: If three years ago I'd asked you to describe your economic life, what would you say? CARNEY: It was fun. It was fun - had all my bills paid, had things to do. SHAPIRO: Last year his oldest daughter went to the Rose Bowl with her school marching band and played the flute in the parade. He wrote the $3,000 check and said, have fun - not this year. CARNEY: I mean we cut all that out, and everybody's like, Man, that's your kid's stuff. I said, I understand that, and she understands that. SHAPIRO: He figures he's got about eight more months of savings. He keeps applying for jobs, but nobody's hiring. If oil prices don't go back up soon, he'll leave town. By mid-afternoon, the Texas sun is blazing. Construction at the new amphitheater on the edge of town has stopped for the hottest hours of the day. The only movement is a pump jack nearby, slowly drawing oil up from the earth. The company building this project is called Barbed Cross Construction. John Dunn is the CEO. He's 35, and about 10 years ago, he started the company doing handyman work by himself. JOHN DUNN: And we probably did, oh, 150,000 that year me by myself and then to over - we're pushing around 5 million annually now in sales. SHAPIRO: When he realized he had finally left the middle class for good, he gave his wife and kids a Caribbean cruise. He says compared to other people in Midland, that is downright humble. DUNN: People spend stupid money around here. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) What do you mean? DUNN: I mean stupid money - I mean just the type of stuff. I mean we've done residential remodels where they'll put a half a million dollars in a $400,000 house. SHAPIRO: It's a cliche to call America the land of opportunity, and to many Americans, it feels like the phrase no longer rings true. But over the course of this day in Midland, opportunity and risk turned up everywhere. With the sun low in the sky, we drove outside of town to meet Jesse Murillo and his wife, Megan Newman. They met in college at Cornell and moved here to the Texas plains. JESSE MURILLO: And we first bought this property as nothing. It looked like that. SHAPIRO: Just field and scrub and. . . MEGAN NEWMAN: Which is mesquite bushes and lots of tarantulas like you've seen on your drive in already. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). NEWMAN: Yeah, lots of brush and thorny things. SHAPIRO: They decided to open Out West RV Park and wait for the next boom to hit. Right now about a third of the spaces are full, and they both work second jobs. NEWMAN: We lived out here for almost three months without water and without electricity. . . CORNISH: Seriously. NEWMAN: . . . Living in our RV while we waited for the electric company to finally plug us in. And it was a challenge. You know, it kind of tests your grit. SHAPIRO: Both of them grew up poor. Megan's mother emigrated from Poland. NEWMAN: She came over on a boat all by herself. She was 19 years old. How much courage does that take? SHAPIRO: And Jesse's family has roots in Mexico. MURILLO: At a certain point, we bounced around from family member to family member. They would feed us dinner because we just didn't have any food. I remember - I'm getting so choked up here. I remember one year our bunk bed broke, and we didn't have enough money to replace it. So we slept on the floor. SHAPIRO: Now with their Ivy League degrees, they could have gone into banking or consulting, but they wanted to build something of their own. They've already climbed out of poverty to enter the middle class. They hope that with the next boom, they catch a wave that will carry them even higher.

They marched 400 miles to the state capital of Austin and Cesar Chavez joined them. Ultimately, they succeeded in publicizing their cause, but the strike failed. A half-century after that historic moment, what has changed? NPR's John Burnett went to the Rio Grande Valley to find out. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: You get a new appreciation for watermelon after standing in the fields and watching it being harvested. Two pickers walk the rows. They bend over and grab the 20-pound fruits and pitch them to a man perched on the side of a dump truck who heaves them up to another catcher in the truck bed. The melon pickers have arms like Popeye and the timing of acrobats. They like this crop because the bigger the melons, the more they can earn. A lot has improved since 1966, when watermelon workers here in the borderlands went on strike. Today, they have port-a-potties and fresh water in the field. Crop dusters no longer spray pesticide on them. And they're supposed to earn at least minimum wage of $7. 25 an hour. What hasn't changed is the work. It's as brutal as ever. JUSTINO DELEON: (Speaking Spanish). BURNETT: \"I've seen watermelon has no friends,\" says Justino DeLeon. He fell off a melon truck, hurt his arm and had to retire from farm work. \"They're sweet to eat, but hell to harvest. \"DELEON: (Speaking Spanish). BURNETT: \"You have to be in great condition to toss melons all day,\" DeLeon continues. \"You work hard in the heat, and it's easy to get dehydrated. \"It's not just that field work is grueling. Workers are vulnerable to getting cheated by growers and crew bosses. Since 2010, the McAllen, Texas, district office of the U. S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has filed more than 650 cases against growers and farm labor contractors, affecting nearly 2,500 workers. Francisco Javier Alvarez is one of six plaintiffs who sued Bauer Farms for not paying the minimum wage to workers who picked jalapenos there in 2010 and 2011. He's translated here by a paralegal. FRANCISCO JAVIER ALVAREZ: (Through interpreter) So our pay was very low, and we ultimately got paid very little. And one day, we even only made $30 for the day, even though the four of us worked late into the night. BURNETT: Alvarez says only a handful of workers were willing to step forward and file a lawsuit. ALVAREZ: (Through interpreter) So yeah, some were documented, but some were residents or had legal status and still would not speak up, almost as if they had grown accustomed to that type of treatment from Bauer. BURNETT: In addition to not receiving minimum wage, workers had to buy knives and work gloves from the contractors, which further reduced their pay. The Bauer Farms lawsuit was settled out of court two years ago. The owner Ed Bauer, reached by phone, declined to discuss the case. Daniela Dwyer is a lawyer at Texas Rio Grande Legal Aid, which handled the lawsuit against Bauer Farms. DANIELA DWYER: It's always been a problem that farmworkers are not paid, certainly, a just wage and are not even paid the minimum wage, which is $7. 25 an hour. BURNETT: Texas has some of the lowest farm wages in the country, in contrast to California where the presence of the United Farm Workers Union has raised salaries for all field hands. DWYER: Oftentimes, when we national farmworker advocates get together, we joke about California being the land of Narnia. BURNETT: Whether in California or Texas, agribusiness is suffering from a labor shortage. FRANK SCHUSTER: It's a very difficult job. It's - there are other options for labor besides the backbreaking labor of farm work - flipping burgers. BURNETT: Frank Schuster is a 63-year-old grower whose father came from Austria to farm in this fertile delta along the serpentine Rio Grande. Schuster hires about 200 farmworkers a year. Growers have heard the criticism. If you want to solve the labor shortage, pay your workers better. But Schuster says it's not that simple. He says agriculture in the Rio Grande Valley is at the mercy of market forces and geography. SCHUSTER: We have to put our product to the consumer at a price as cheap as other areas can do it, have to compete with people that have a cheaper freight rate into the markets than what we do. And Georgia is a whole lot closer to the northeast than South Texas. BURNETT: Many farmworkers interviewed for this report believe another reason for depressed wages in South Texas is the heavy presence of unauthorized field hands from Mexico. Of the estimated 2. 5 million laborers working on U. S. farms and ranches, from 50 to 70 percent are thought to be in the country illegally, according to the national advocacy group Farmworker Justice. And Texas is unique. With its long international border and network of federal checkpoints on outbound highways, these immigrants are effectively trapped in the tip of Texas. ANDRES JIMENEZ: (Speaking Spanish). BURNETT: \"The majority are undocumented,\" says Andres Jimenez, who used to work illegally in the fields. \"I think labor contractors choose them because they'll work for less. A legal American does not want to work 12 hours under the sun picking onions and pitching watermelons. \" As soon as Jimenez got a work permit, he quit the fields. Now he's a manager at a dollar store. This is where history repeats itself. In 1966, growers, in cahoots with the Texas Rangers, brought in pickers from Mexico to break the farmworkers strike. Mexicans harvested the melons, and picketing Texas workers were out of a job. Today, Mexican laborers pick much of America's produce. But 50 years later, they're not necessarily replacing legal pickers. The fact is fewer and fewer U. S. residents and citizens will do this work. AURORA GONZALEZ: '75? ARNULFO GONZALEZ: (Laughter). AURORA GONZALEZ: 1975? BURNETT: Arnulfo and Aurora Gonzalez live in a tidy mobile home across the road from a field of spiky Aloe vera plants. Aurora retired last year at age 80, after spending 60 years in the fields, first as a picker, then as a labor contractor. Her bronze, furrowed face attests to a life outside. Though she was not part of the '66 strike, Aurora remembers the conditions back then. AURORA GONZALEZ: (Through interpreter) We worked from sunup to sundown, and we earned almost nothing. When you had to relieve yourself, you just went out in the open. Now everybody earns more. They get an education. Now they have everything. And before, no. BURNETT: She exaggerates the current status of farmworkers. Today, young people who have other options shun field work. Her grandson, fresh-faced 19-year-old, Aaron, sits on the sofa next to her. As a kid, he worked in the fields with his family. But he vowed that last summer would be his last watermelon harvest. Aaron is going to college to be an athletic trainer. AARON GONZALEZ: I did not enjoy it. I'd rather be in air con and in college than be in - working in the fields from 5 in the morning all the way to 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

The federal minimum wage stands at $7. 25 an hour. But polls show that most Americans think it needs to go up. So far, some states have moved to increase the minimum wage, including California, New York, Oregon, and some big cities have passed wage hikes, too, such as Seattle, Los Angeles and Washington, D. C. Now, one thing is clear. The next president has said he or she will support a minimum wage increase. Here's Donald Trump a few weeks back talking about his plan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: So I would like to raise it to at least $10. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country, so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to be literally - they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country. AUBREY: Hillary Clinton has said she would support a blanket hike of the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour and would consider as much as 15 an hour if it worked like the hike in New York, where an increase is phased in over several years and wages for workers in the city, where cost of living is highest - are higher than wages in parts of the state where it's not as expensive to live. Here's Clinton speaking on Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: Raising the federal minimum wage won't just put more money in the pockets of low-income families. It also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods. AUBREY: The debate is front and center today as thousands are gathering in Richmond, Va. at a union-backed convention calling for a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour. We wanted to check in on that rally, so we called Reid Snider who has been talking to advocates there. Hey, Reid. REID SNIDER, BYLINE: Hi, Allison. How are you? AUBREY: I'm fine. So tell us what is the scene there? SNIDER: Well, it's a very hot day in Richmond with temperatures hovering around 95 to 96 degrees. The crowd was very hot, but they were very vocal in their vision on this rally. The mood is very energetic, I might add. I would say probably about five to 8,000 people in general - it's hard to tell. They're very spread out. And they left from the Monroe Park down near the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University and moved up the very famous Monument Avenue to the Robert E. Lee Memorial, where they say they are making the case that in the current minimum wage situation and the oppression that they live in is a result of the Civil War and racism. AUBREY: So that's the symbolism of marching along those monuments. SNIDER: Absolutely. That's why it ended at the Robert E. Lee Memorial to raise awareness that this is a straggler of that old system of oppression in government, they say. AUBREY: So what are you hearing from people at this convention? SNIDER: Well, by and large, they are in favor, of course, of higher minimum wages. Many of them that I talked to work in industries that are based on a minimum wage, and they say they really can't afford to live at the current 7. 25 rate here in the mid-Atlantic region in general. AUBREY: I guess the movement is pushing for $15 an hour. Is there a sense there among people you talk to that that's realistic? SNIDER: Well, it's interesting you should ask, Allison, I asked some of the folks that I stopped along the march up to the Robert E. Lee Monument about that. And they said, well, it is a tough situation, but, you know, as a civilization, we're just going to have to move that way so that many people can afford to live, buy insurance, feed their children and they would also like a union. AUBREY: That's Reid Snider of WCVE at the Fight for 15 Convention in Richmond, Va. Thanks, Reid. SNIDER: Thanks, Allison. AUBREY: Now, to get a fuller picture, we reached out to people who have a lot at stake in this debate. We start with a story of longtime restaurant worker and Fight for 15 organizer Terrence Wise. He lives in Kansas City. He's 37 years old and the father of three. We reached him in Richmond ahead of the rally. TERRENCE WISE: I actually started working at 16. I got my first job at Taco Bell. I can remember minimum wage back then was 4. 25 an hour. And I've been working in the industry for nearly two decades now. I currently work at a McDonald's and Burger King, and despite my experience and years on the job, I only make $9 an hour at both jobs - no benefits, no vacation, no paid time off. AUBREY: Wise has pretty much always worked minimum-wage jobs, and he says it's always a struggle to make ends meet. He and his family rely on food stamps and other public benefit programs. WISE: Nothing's ever fully paid. It's like always you put this much on the light bill or you put this much on the gas bill, and you just pray that a disconnect notice doesn't come. AUBREY: Now, at one point, he told us that his life spiraled out of control. It was after his fiance got sick. WISE: It was the second time that me and my fiance and my three little girls - we experienced homelessness. Anytime you're working in our industries - or are working without benefits or anything of that nature, one little illness - a week off for the flu or you get hurt or something - and you miss that paycheck, you're struggling. You're behind right there. And we lost our home, and we were sleeping in our minivan - me and my fiance and my three little girls. And I can recall the morning we woke up and me and my fiance were getting ready for work in the front seat. I'm putting on my Burger King uniform. She's putting on her CNA scrubs, and in the back of the minivan the girls are getting ready for school, getting backpacks on, putting socks on. And that just really hit me. We're in America, the richest nation on Earth. And here you have two working parents getting ready for work in the front seat of their minivan while their three daughters are getting ready for school in the back of it, homeless. Something's terribly wrong in this country when you have a family that is working doubly hard. We're working triple hard, and things just aren't getting better. AUBREY: And so Terrence Wise says it didn't take much to convince him to join the union movement fighting for a higher minimum wage. WISE: It was a Sunday. I was at Burger King, and I was mopping the lobby, I remember. And I can remember a McDonald's worker and a Domino's worker. They came in the Burger King I was working and they had started talking about how workers around Kansas City were now organizing to demand a living wage, and they asked me and my co-workers a set of questions that day when they came in. I'm like OK. And then they're like, do you guys think you need a living wage? And I'm like living wage? What's that? Sounds like money to live off. Yeah, that sounds good. And they're just like do you think you deserve benefits to go see the dentist or whatever? And I'm like, yeah, that would be really nice. I haven't been to a dentist in 18 years. And do you think you deserve a vacation? Shouldn't all working Americans have a vacation once a year? I'm like yeah. I haven't seen my mom in 10 years. That would be nice. So. . . AUBREY: You hadn't seen your mother in 10 years? WISE: Oh, definitely not, definitely not. I'm in Kansas City, Mo. I'm from South Carolina, and that's where my mom lives at now. And I don't get time off of work, really, to go see her or have the resources to travel and see her, not even once a year. AUBREY: So Terrence Wise got involved with the Fight for 15. The movement has gained a lot of traction over the last two years staging rallies in dozens of U. S. cities and grabbing headlines and TV coverage around the nation. But not everyone feels that a higher minimum wage is the answer. Robert Mayfield owns nine Dairy Queen franchises in the Austin, Texas, area. He says hiking the minimum wage will lead to higher prices on his menus and job losses. ROBERT MAYFIELD: I'm opposed to any time the government gets involved and meddles in the marketplace. AUBREY: Mayfield says if the minimum wage is pushed much higher, some small business owners would stop hiring people, and he says that's already happened to some extent. MAYFIELD: People that are listening to your program will remember the times they used to go into a fast food restaurant and one of the employees would give them a drink before the time they ordered. Now it's all self-service, and that's because when labor becomes so expensive, you do what you can to eliminate some of it. And that's a job that no longer even exists in fast food - somebody pouring the drinks and giving them to you. You make your own drink, and that's the reason. AUBREY: So people would be replaced by machines, by automation? MAYFIELD: They already have been. They already are in my stores. It's a self-service drink. AUBREY: Mayfield says the market should determine the wages, and in his case in Austin, Texas, he already pays higher than the minimum wage. We start out at $12 an hour. MAYFIELD: And we don't do that because we're nice guys, we do that 'cause there is a labor market, and we do that to get the best people because the best people are what we've got to have. AUBREY: Robert Mayfield says he's moved by stories he hears from people like Terrence Wise, but he's skeptical of the Fight for 15 movement. MAYFIELD: I'm empathetic to hear the story. The first thing I would tell that individual is to see if you can find another job with another company where your skills might be better utilized. What I do know about the so-called Fight for 15 is that it's sponsored by labor unions that are losing members all over the country, as I understand it, and those are the ones that I've read in several sources that are behind that whole so-called movement or demonstrations. It's the service unions, labor unions hoping to get more members, best as I can tell. AUBREY: Labor unions are, in fact, organizing the Fight for 15 movement, and while raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is unlikely given the current political landscape, supporters say the movement has already changed the conversation. McDonald's and Walmart are two of the major companies that have raised starting salaries by some amount since the Fight for 15 took off. Both companies have come under a lot of pressure from labor groups to boost wages. Terrence Wise says he's optimistic. WISE: The way out, I tell you, is what we're doing now. If you look back in this country in the paths and what workers are doing now, it's always been movements that have changed the country. We know that even our elected leaders and politicians - they don't just come up with their own great ideas. They go with whatever the people push them. And we know with this presidential election cycle the main topic is wage inequality and racial inequality in this country. You hear it on so many platforms, and I think that's been brought about by what workers have been doing across the country. And that's been organizing and coming together and telling their stories and fighting to win better pay and union rights at the job, and I think that's truly the way out. AUBREY: That's fast food worker and organizer Terrence Wise. He's attending today's Fight for 15 convention in Richmond, Va. ALLISON AUBREY, HOST:  This week, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both gave speeches highlighting their economic policies, and we wanted to spotlight one policy that hasn't gotten too much attention this political season - raising the minimum wage. The federal minimum wage stands at $7. 25 an hour. But polls show that most Americans think it needs to go up. So far, some states have moved to increase the minimum wage, including California, New York, Oregon, and some big cities have passed wage hikes, too, such as Seattle, Los Angeles and Washington, D. C. Now, one thing is clear. The next president has said he or she will support a minimum wage increase. Here's Donald Trump a few weeks back talking about his plan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: So I would like to raise it to at least $10. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country, so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to be literally - they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country. AUBREY: Hillary Clinton has said she would support a blanket hike of the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour and would consider as much as 15 an hour if it worked like the hike in New York, where an increase is phased in over several years and wages for workers in the city, where cost of living is highest - are higher than wages in parts of the state where it's not as expensive to live. Here's Clinton speaking on Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY CLINTON: Raising the federal minimum wage won't just put more money in the pockets of low-income families. It also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods. AUBREY: The debate is front and center today as thousands are gathering in Richmond, Va. at a union-backed convention calling for a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour. We wanted to check in on that rally, so we called Reid Snider who has been talking to advocates there. Hey, Reid. REID SNIDER, BYLINE: Hi, Allison. How are you? AUBREY: I'm fine. So tell us what is the scene there? SNIDER: Well, it's a very hot day in Richmond with temperatures hovering around 95 to 96 degrees. The crowd was very hot, but they were very vocal in their vision on this rally. The mood is very energetic, I might add. I would say probably about five to 8,000 people in general - it's hard to tell. They're very spread out. And they left from the Monroe Park down near the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University and moved up the very famous Monument Avenue to the Robert E. Lee Memorial, where they say they are making the case that in the current minimum wage situation and the oppression that they live in is a result of the Civil War and racism. AUBREY: So that's the symbolism of marching along those monuments. SNIDER: Absolutely. That's why it ended at the Robert E. Lee Memorial to raise awareness that this is a straggler of that old system of oppression in government, they say. AUBREY: So what are you hearing from people at this convention? SNIDER: Well, by and large, they are in favor, of course, of higher minimum wages. Many of them that I talked to work in industries that are based on a minimum wage, and they say they really can't afford to live at the current 7. 25 rate here in the mid-Atlantic region in general. AUBREY: I guess the movement is pushing for $15 an hour. Is there a sense there among people you talk to that that's realistic? SNIDER: Well, it's interesting you should ask, Allison, I asked some of the folks that I stopped along the march up to the Robert E. Lee Monument about that. And they said, well, it is a tough situation, but, you know, as a civilization, we're just going to have to move that way so that many people can afford to live, buy insurance, feed their children and they would also like a union. AUBREY: That's Reid Snider of WCVE at the Fight for 15 Convention in Richmond, Va. Thanks, Reid. SNIDER: Thanks, Allison. AUBREY: Now, to get a fuller picture, we reached out to people who have a lot at stake in this debate. We start with a story of longtime restaurant worker and Fight for 15 organizer Terrence Wise. He lives in Kansas City. He's 37 years old and the father of three. We reached him in Richmond ahead of the rally. TERRENCE WISE: I actually started working at 16. I got my first job at Taco Bell. I can remember minimum wage back then was 4. 25 an hour. And I've been working in the industry for nearly two decades now. I currently work at a McDonald's and Burger King, and despite my experience and years on the job, I only make $9 an hour at both jobs - no benefits, no vacation, no paid time off. AUBREY: Wise has pretty much always worked minimum-wage jobs, and he says it's always a struggle to make ends meet. He and his family rely on food stamps and other public benefit programs. WISE: Nothing's ever fully paid. It's like always you put this much on the light bill or you put this much on the gas bill, and you just pray that a disconnect notice doesn't come. AUBREY: Now, at one point, he told us that his life spiraled out of control. It was after his fiance got sick. WISE: It was the second time that me and my fiance and my three little girls - we experienced homelessness. Anytime you're working in our industries - or are working without benefits or anything of that nature, one little illness - a week off for the flu or you get hurt or something - and you miss that paycheck, you're struggling. You're behind right there. And we lost our home, and we were sleeping in our minivan - me and my fiance and my three little girls. And I can recall the morning we woke up and me and my fiance were getting ready for work in the front seat. I'm putting on my Burger King uniform. She's putting on her CNA scrubs, and in the back of the minivan the girls are getting ready for school, getting backpacks on, putting socks on. And that just really hit me. We're in America, the richest nation on Earth. And here you have two working parents getting ready for work in the front seat of their minivan while their three daughters are getting ready for school in the back of it, homeless. Something's terribly wrong in this country when you have a family that is working doubly hard. We're working triple hard, and things just aren't getting better.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump each gave high-profile speeches this week on their economic plans. Danielle Kurtzleben parsed both speeches for us, and let's see what we can learn. Danielle, thanks very much for joining us. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Of course. SIMON: You think the two candidates aren't quite as far apart as a lot of people think. KURTZLEBEN: Right. And one of the big areas you can see this is on trade policy. We, of course, throughout the campaign season, have seen both candidates really railing against these trade deals. Donald Trump, of course, really, really is opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And here's what Hillary Clinton had to say about that in her speech this week. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)HILLARY CLINTON: My message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this. I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (APPLAUSE)KURTZLEBEN: Now both candidates really have very similar underlying messages. They both say, yes, I'm not opposed to trade itself, but I am opposed to bad trade deals - what they consider unfair trade deals. They both said they want to renegotiate NAFTA. They both criticized China a lot. They say that they want to use tariffs in some form. Now, Trump really likes to attack Clinton because she used to be for the Trans-Pacific Partnership back when she was in the Obama administration. Now she accuses him of going too far on trade and wanting to close the country off. Incidentally, there's one other area the two candidates are very close on, and that's infrastructure spending. She wants. . . SIMON: Every politician thinks infrastructure spending is a good idea. KURTZLEBEN: Oh, absolutely. The question is, you know - how do you pay for it? And she wants to spend $275 billion over five years. Now, Trump, interestingly, has said, you know, around 500 billion. And unlike a lot of other Republicans, he's said, you know, it might just be fine for the government to borrow a lot of money to spend on infrastructure. SIMON: They both have child care plans, too. KURTZLEBEN: Right. So here's what they both had to say about their child care plans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: My plan will also help reduce the cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care spending from their taxes. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I think instead we should expand the child tax credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children - the same families that his plan ignores. And that's just a start. KURTZLEBEN: So they both want to help families afford child care. As any parent knows, child care is super expensive, but their plans to do it aren't really terribly similar. What Donald Trump said right there is that he wants to create a tax deduction. He really got criticized heavily for this this week because many people said that would largely help richer families. That's because it's a deduction. It comes off of your taxable income. It's not a credit that you might get refunded to you. So he took a lot of heat for that. So he also after that said he had a plan for lower income families, saying that they could, for example, deduct their child care costs from their payroll taxes. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand - she's made child care affordability a big part of her campaign. And one of her plans is that she would limit expenses to 10 percent of families' income. As she said in this clip, she wants a bigger child tax credit. She would really subsidize child care. So that could also be an expensive plan. SIMON: And what do their tax plans look like? KURTZLEBEN: Well, here is Donald Trump talking about his tax plan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to compete. KURTZLEBEN: Now, Hillary Clinton's tax plan looks starkly different. She says she wants to raise taxes, particularly on the rich. Trump has a very Republican-looking plan. He wants to get rid of the estate tax. He has a lower top rate for those high-earners and a much lower corporate tax rate. SIMON: The idea of a lower corporate tax rate is to enable businesses to hire more people if they do well. KURTZLEBEN: Right, and that's exactly what he says. And that's part of how he says he's going to bring jobs to the U. S. - is getting more companies to move to the U. S. But his plan really still does look like it would benefit the rich more than the poor. SIMON: Daniel Kurtzleben, thanks very much for being with us. KURTZLEBEN: Of course. Thank you.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is Hanging On, our series about the economic pressures of American life. This week - the online gig economy, a growing sector built by people who want to be their own bosses, make their own schedules and sometimes set their own prices. Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, Seamless - these companies allow people to do just that. For some, it's a critical supplemental income. For others, it's just a way to add flexibility to their lives. Alan Krueger is an economics professor at Princeton University and the former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. He's been studying the gig economy and Uber drivers, in particular. He tells us who's benefiting. ALAN KRUEGER: Some workers do it full time, but most do it on a part-time basis. And most do it on an intermittent basis, where they don't do it every week. They choose their own schedule from day to day. And they have the opportunity to decide whether they want to work on any particular day and what hours they want to work. MARTIN: Do they usually have other, what we would consider to be more traditional, jobs that they do for maybe eight hours during the day and then they're just filling out a 24-hour period with a couple of gig-economy jobs? KRUEGER: Again it's a mixture. Almost a third of the Uber drivers have a full-time job. And they're driving for Uber in addition to their full-time job. About a third have a part-time job. And a little over a third have no other work that they're doing, and they may have other activities in their daily life like watching children or going to school. And they're using part of their time to drive for Uber. MARTIN: How has the online gig economy affected our recovery as a country from the recession? KRUEGER: Well, I think the online gig economy is really separate from the recovery. I think it's being driven by technology and entrepreneurship, which are providing new opportunities for workers. What we saw in studying Uber is that workers are more likely to provide services in the online gig economy when they have a drop in income from other sources. So it helps them to smooth their income volatility, which, I think, is an indication of the new ways in which the opportunity can help people to adjust for income losses in other areas. MARTIN: Is this whole space being regulated? I mean, there are some risks associated with diving into this world, right, if you're a worker? KRUEGER: Absolutely. And I think it's very important that we look closely at the labor protections in this area. I think it's important that we try to maintain the flexibility that this new development affords. But I think it's also important that we extend as much of our social safety net as we can to this group of workers. And for the most part, the courts and the companies have defined the workers as independent contractors, which means that they don't have many of the protections that traditional employees have. MARTIN: Professor Alan Krueger talking to us about the gig economy. Thanks so much for your time. KRUEGER: Thanks for having me.

Alan Krueger is an economics professor at Princeton University and the former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. He's been studying the gig economy and Uber drivers, in particular. He tells us who's benefiting. ALAN KRUEGER: Some workers do it full time, but most do it on a part-time basis. And most do it on an intermittent basis, where they don't do it every week. They choose their own schedule from day to day. And they have the opportunity to decide whether they want to work on any particular day and what hours they want to work. MARTIN: Do they usually have other, what we would consider to be more traditional, jobs that they do for maybe eight hours during the day and then they're just filling out a 24-hour period with a couple of gig-economy jobs? KRUEGER: Again it's a mixture. Almost a third of the Uber drivers have a full-time job. And they're driving for Uber in addition to their full-time job. About a third have a part-time job. And a little over a third have no other work that they're doing, and they may have other activities in their daily life like watching children or going to school. And they're using part of their time to drive for Uber. MARTIN: How has the online gig economy affected our recovery as a country from the recession? KRUEGER: Well, I think the online gig economy is really separate from the recovery. I think it's being driven by technology and entrepreneurship, which are providing new opportunities for workers. What we saw in studying Uber is that workers are more likely to provide services in the online gig economy when they have a drop in income from other sources. So it helps them to smooth their income volatility, which, I think, is an indication of the new ways in which the opportunity can help people to adjust for income losses in other areas. MARTIN: Is this whole space being regulated? I mean, there are some risks associated with diving into this world, right, if you're a worker? KRUEGER: Absolutely. And I think it's very important that we look closely at the labor protections in this area. I think it's important that we try to maintain the flexibility that this new development affords. But I think it's also important that we extend as much of our social safety net as we can to this group of workers. And for the most part, the courts and the companies have defined the workers as independent contractors, which means that they don't have many of the protections that traditional employees have. MARTIN: Professor Alan Krueger talking to us about the gig economy. Thanks so much for your time. KRUEGER: Thanks for having me.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

He's a philosopher with the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins, and his arguments are moral. When we meet, he's in a tweedy jacket and sneakers, speaking to several dozen students at James Madison University. TRAVIS RIEDER: How old are you going to be in 2036?

LUDDEN: Dangerous climate change will be happening by then, he says, and the world's poorest nations will suffer most even though rich countries like the U.

RIEDER: . . . To go through a pregnancy and everything. That mattered to me a lot. LUDDEN: In fact Sadiya wanted a big family, so Rieder caved, sort of. He decided, you can't deny someone the hard-wired human fulfillment of creating a child, but he also convinced Sadiya that the moral bar for a second one is higher. They are one and done. T. RIEDER: When I write online, I get some nasty comments, and a lot of the things that people say is, well, he obviously doesn't have any children the way he talks about it.

S. has lost nearly 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. Donald Trump says that if elected president he'll bring a lot of those jobs back.

JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It's a line that almost always generates loud applause for Donald Trump at his rallies - he will bring back the factory jobs that have been sent overseas. Here he was at a rally in Pennsylvania last Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: What we're going to do, folks, is going to be so special. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring back our jobs. We're going to bring back our companies. ZARROLI: Legally speaking, there seems little that a President Trump could do to bring jobs back or to stop companies from sending them overseas. Without an act of Congress, it's simply not within his authority. Jeffrey Bergstrand is a professor of finance at Notre Dame University. JEFFREY BERGSTRAND: Firms are going to make the decisions for their shareholders. If he wants to do this, he is going to have to use government and institute laws to restrict decisions of firms. ZARROLI: What Trump does promise to do is scrap existing trade agreements and begin the lengthy process of renegotiating them. And in the meantime, he says, he would slap steep tariffs on U. S. companies, such as United Technologies' carrier division, that export jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very, very strong border, we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit. ZARROLI: Could a President Trump impose tariffs unilaterally? Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics says it would be pretty unusual. But he says tariffs can be imposed in the interest of national security. That doesn't mean it would be a good idea, Bown says. For one thing, he says, if the U. S. imposed tariffs on, say, China, then Beijing would almost certainly file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. And in the meantime, it would retaliate against the U. S. CHAD BOWN: We would lose the tens of billions of dollars a year in soybean exports that we send to China, in corn, in wheat, in autos. And so all of the people that work in those sectors are now all of a sudden going to be losing their jobs. ZARROLI: Beyond that, he says, it would be hugely disruptive. It would be a time of immense uncertainty for businesses around the world. BOWN: If I'm running a business and it's unclear to me if Donald Trump is going to allow me to be able to import parts or components that I need to be able to make my particular good, I don't know what to do. ZARROLI: There are other less dramatic steps the White House can take to boost trade, says Aric Newhouse of the National Association of Manufacturers. It can initiate talks with countries that have closed their markets to U. S. goods. It can also address tax and regulatory reform, issues that Neuhaus says make it harder for manufacturers to operate in the U. S. . ARIC NEWHOUSE: So it's really unfortunately not one magic bullet. It's not if you do this one thing manufacturing is going to come back to the United States. You have to do a little bit of a lot of things. ZARROLI: And there's another reality about factory jobs today. Chad Bown says manufacturers have become a lot more productive and simply don't need as many employees as they once did. BOWN: So it's a lot more robots, computers, equipment and many, many fewer people. So what you see is there is still even today, you know, a lot of manufacturing activity in the United States.

And that is exactly what happened. Benefits were limited, and poor families were encouraged to find jobs. But the results have been mixed. Some people found work, but others are struggling more than ever. Today, the number of families on welfare is much lower than it used to be, even though deep poverty is on the rise. NPR correspondent Pam Fessler covers these issues and joins us in the studio. Good morning. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So is there a way to say whether welfare reform was a success or a failure? Or - it sounds like it might be just complicated. FESSLER: Exactly. Those who were able to get steady work - for the most part, they are better off. They not only have some income - even low income - but they also get what's called an earned income tax credit, which has really helped a lot of people out of poverty. The problem is that there's also this large group of people at the bottom, and they haven't been able, for one reason or another, to get or keep jobs. And they're worse off. And that part of the reason is because there is now a five-year, lifetime limit on getting welfare benefits. And in some states, it's even lower, as low as one year. So when a family hits that limit, their benefits are cut off. GREENE: Didn't we always hear that one of the keys to this reform was that states had a lot of flexibility to respond to the concerns of their residents? Has that helped? FESSLER: In some ways, it's helped. But it's also hurt. States get block grants, and there, now, have a lot of control over how they spend this money. The result is welfare is very different depending on where you live. Some states have much lower benefits. I recently went to Louisiana where, today, only 4 percent of the poor families in the state get welfare. That's 6,000 families in the entire state. FESSLER: Where you going, baby? FESSLER: And David, that voice you're hearing now, that's Natasha Williams. And you'd think that she would be one of those who would be getting welfare. She's a 31-year-old single mother with a 12-year-old boy. She's constantly struggling. Her last job as a part-time security guard ended in July. And when I met her, she was in her New Orleans apartment watching a friend's baby in exchange for food. NATASHA WILLIAMS: You know, instead of paying me the cash for watching the kid, she just bought me some stuff. GREENE: Pam, she's babysitting and getting paid for it in food. FESSLER: That's right. And she's also getting help with her rent from a non-profit. Last year, she was homeless. She had an accident. She lost another job and was evicted. So every night, she told me, she drove her car to Lake Pontchartrain. WILLIAMS: And I'd just go around it and, like I said, park some where it was real, real dark. You know, just relax and - well, try to relax and just fall asleep. FESSLER: So the obvious question is, if things are so bad, why doesn't she get welfare, now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. Williams says it's because it's just not worth it. The benefits are extremely low, $188 a month. And to get them, she says she'd have to take time off from her current job search to go to a program to find out how to get a job. And until last month, she was working, even while homeless. She just didn't earn enough to live on. WILLIAMS: Why look for a job if I already have a job? Why can't I just get a little help? It didn't really make sense to me. DANIELLE MOLETT: All this is your school supplies right here. FESSLER: It also doesn't make sense to Danielle Molett. She's 22 and lives nearby in a shelter with her three children, ages 4, 3 and 2. Molett does get welfare and appreciates the extra cash. But this month, it barely covered the school supplies she had to buy for her kids. MOLETT: Crayons, markers, pencils, headphones, notebooks, notebook paper. FESSLER: And she still has to get diapers, hygiene products and other necessities she can't buy with food stamps. But to qualify for the aid, Molett says she has to pack up her children, get on a bus and travel to two appointments a week and look for a job. The state gives her some money for transportation and childcare, but not enough to cover her costs. MOLETT: It's too much. They asking for too much. FESSLER: Marketa Garner Walters is sympathetic. MARKETA GARNER WALTERS: We're not the most accessible or user-friendly. FESSLER: She's the new secretary of Louisiana's department of family and children's services. GARNER WALTERS: We have to figure out how to meet our clients where they are and how to make the help that we are giving them more accessible and readily available. FESSLER: Walters says one problem is, over the years, welfare spending in the state has been slashed. The law that Bill Clinton signed allowed states to use federal TANF funds for things other than welfare. And when state budgets were stressed after the Great Recession, that's exactly what many of them did. GARNER WALTERS: So we now use TANF money to pay for things that are not traditional TANF expenditures. FESSLER: Like early childhood education and other programs that used to be funded by the state. Jan Moller of the Louisiana Budget Project says welfare became something of a slush fund. The result is that, today, Louisiana uses only 8 percent of its welfare money on cash benefits for the poor and only 1 percent on programs to help them find jobs, one reason that benefits are so low. JAN MOLLER: I think there is a perception among the tax-paying public that a lot of their dollars are being used to let people sit at home and not work. And the reality is that simply isn't true in Louisiana. It wasn't very true 20 years ago, and it's certainly not true today. FESSLER: Secretary Walters says the state's now trying to replenish the program. But Moller's not optimistic it can find the funds. Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution who helped write the welfare reform bill as a GOP congressional aide now thinks giving states so much flexibility was a big mistake. But he says the law did accomplish a lot, such as helping millions of low-income women into the workforce. And with the help of food stamps and tax credits, their poverty rates have gone down. RON HASKINS: More of them, now, are really committed to work. They like to work. They say they like to work. They don't have great jobs - we all know that - but their families are better off economically. So to that extent, the reforms have worked well. FESSLER: Still, he admits that many families have been left behind. Often, they're headed by single mothers who work part-time jobs and get little or no help from the fathers. They face multiple hurdles, like unstable housing, poor education and debt, people like Natasha Williams, who says she sometimes gets overwhelmed trying to support herself and her son. WILLIAMS: You know, I have to go sit outside in the car and cry or, you know, wait for him to go to sleep and go in the bathroom and just cry my eyes out because I can't let him see me like that 'cause that's going to just mess him up. GREENE: Listening there to my colleague Pam Fessler reporting on welfare reform 20 years later. And that voice of that mother, Pam, just sticks with me. I mean, talking about her boy who is going to grow up in poverty - that has to have long-term consequences. FESSLER: That's right. That's the big concern, whether the cycle can be broken. This afternoon on All Things Considered, we're going to look at how welfare works in another state Oregon. That state has a benefit that's much higher, among the highest in the country. And they also have a special program to help people get and retain jobs. GREENE: OK. Pam, thanks a lot. FESSLER: Thank you. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Twenty years ago today, President Bill Clinton signed legislation to end welfare as we know it. And that is exactly what happened. Benefits were limited, and poor families were encouraged to find jobs. But the results have been mixed. Some people found work, but others are struggling more than ever. Today, the number of families on welfare is much lower than it used to be, even though deep poverty is on the rise. NPR correspondent Pam Fessler covers these issues and joins us in the studio. Good morning. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So is there a way to say whether welfare reform was a success or a failure? Or - it sounds like it might be just complicated. FESSLER: Exactly. Those who were able to get steady work - for the most part, they are better off. They not only have some income - even low income - but they also get what's called an earned income tax credit, which has really helped a lot of people out of poverty. The problem is that there's also this large group of people at the bottom, and they haven't been able, for one reason or another, to get or keep jobs. And they're worse off. And that part of the reason is because there is now a five-year, lifetime limit on getting welfare benefits. And in some states, it's even lower, as low as one year. So when a family hits that limit, their benefits are cut off. GREENE: Didn't we always hear that one of the keys to this reform was that states had a lot of flexibility to respond to the concerns of their residents? Has that helped? FESSLER: In some ways, it's helped. But it's also hurt. States get block grants, and there, now, have a lot of control over how they spend this money. The result is welfare is very different depending on where you live. Some states have much lower benefits. I recently went to Louisiana where, today, only 4 percent of the poor families in the state get welfare. That's 6,000 families in the entire state. FESSLER: Where you going, baby? FESSLER: And David, that voice you're hearing now, that's Natasha Williams. And you'd think that she would be one of those who would be getting welfare. She's a 31-year-old single mother with a 12-year-old boy. She's constantly struggling. Her last job as a part-time security guard ended in July. And when I met her, she was in her New Orleans apartment watching a friend's baby in exchange for food. NATASHA WILLIAMS: You know, instead of paying me the cash for watching the kid, she just bought me some stuff. GREENE: Pam, she's babysitting and getting paid for it in food. FESSLER: That's right. And she's also getting help with her rent from a non-profit. Last year, she was homeless. She had an accident. She lost another job and was evicted. So every night, she told me, she drove her car to Lake Pontchartrain. WILLIAMS: And I'd just go around it and, like I said, park some where it was real, real dark. You know, just relax and - well, try to relax and just fall asleep. FESSLER: So the obvious question is, if things are so bad, why doesn't she get welfare, now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. Williams says it's because it's just not worth it. The benefits are extremely low, $188 a month. And to get them, she says she'd have to take time off from her current job search to go to a program to find out how to get a job. And until last month, she was working, even while homeless. She just didn't earn enough to live on. WILLIAMS: Why look for a job if I already have a job? Why can't I just get a little help? It didn't really make sense to me. DANIELLE MOLETT: All this is your school supplies right here. FESSLER: It also doesn't make sense to Danielle Molett. She's 22 and lives nearby in a shelter with her three children, ages 4, 3 and 2. Molett does get welfare and appreciates the extra cash. But this month, it barely covered the school supplies she had to buy for her kids. MOLETT: Crayons, markers, pencils, headphones, notebooks, notebook paper. FESSLER: And she still has to get diapers, hygiene products and other necessities she can't buy with food stamps. But to qualify for the aid, Molett says she has to pack up her children, get on a bus and travel to two appointments a week and look for a job. The state gives her some money for transportation and childcare, but not enough to cover her costs. MOLETT: It's too much. They asking for too much. FESSLER: Marketa Garner Walters is sympathetic. MARKETA GARNER WALTERS: We're not the most accessible or user-friendly. FESSLER: She's the new secretary of Louisiana's department of family and children's services. GARNER WALTERS: We have to figure out how to meet our clients where they are and how to make the help that we are giving them more accessible and readily available. FESSLER: Walters says one problem is, over the years, welfare spending in the state has been slashed. The law that Bill Clinton signed allowed states to use federal TANF funds for things other than welfare. And when state budgets were stressed after the Great Recession, that's exactly what many of them did. GARNER WALTERS: So we now use TANF money to pay for things that are not traditional TANF expenditures. FESSLER: Like early childhood education and other programs that used to be funded by the state. Jan Moller of the Louisiana Budget Project says welfare became something of a slush fund. The result is that, today, Louisiana uses only 8 percent of its welfare money on cash benefits for the poor and only 1 percent on programs to help them find jobs, one reason that benefits are so low. JAN MOLLER: I think there is a perception among the tax-paying public that a lot of their dollars are being used to let people sit at home and not work. And the reality is that simply isn't true in Louisiana. It wasn't very true 20 years ago, and it's certainly not true today.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: Time now for our series Hanging On, where we take a look at the economic pressures of American life. This week, being a graduate student. On Tuesday, in a case brought by Columbia University grad students, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that teaching assistants at private colleges have the right to form a union. The Columbia students were seeking to collectively bargain over things like compensation, health care and family benefits. Paul Katz, a third-year grad student in Latin American history, is one of the organizers of the Columbia effort. And he joins us from our New York bureau. Welcome to the program. PAUL KATZ: Oh, thank you so much for having me. WERTHEIMER: Now, why do Columbia graduate students think it's necessary to organize? KATZ: Well, fundamentally, it's a question of having a voice in our graduate experiences and primarily in our working conditions. We spend five, six, seven years of our lives pursuing both our own research and teaching and research assistantship at the university. This really is, I think, an important contribution to the function of the university, and we believe we deserve a say in our working conditions. WERTHEIMER: How precarious an economic situation is it being a grad student, especially in a place like New York City? KATZ: Well, really, the experience I can speak to most directly is my own. And that is, of course, living in one of the most expensive cities in the country. At a very basic level we have to spend, you know, an inordinate share of our income on rent. We basically just don't have a margin for error. You know, any kind of crisis or emergency is going to be very hard to address if you're living on, say, $28,000 a year. WERTHEIMER: I understand you have a part-time job as a tour guide to help make ends meet? KATZ: Indeed, yes. I work for a great company called Big Onion Tours. In fact, I'm just coming right now from leading a tour of the Lower East Side. WERTHEIMER: And so this is something you do in your spare time, right? KATZ: It is, yes. And while it is, you know, very much an enjoyable job and I appreciate it tremendously, I think the very existence of this company, which employs history graduate students from throughout New York City, is a testament to just how difficult it is to make ends meet as a grad student here. WERTHEIMER: Now, you're 30 years old. Is that right? KATZ: Well, 29, about to turn 30. WERTHEIMER: So this is very different, I assume, from being a struggling 20-year-old undergraduate. KATZ: Well, I mean, it feels like it ought to be, right? I mean, I suppose that's one of our frustrations is that I think when some people think about students in general they have in mind, you know, a college sophomore and a 19-year-old where, you know, certainly have a very high tolerance for making ends meet with, you know, very little in the way of resources. But, you know, many of us pursuing Ph. D. s are in our late 20s, in our early or mid-30s. And by this point, it would be nice to have a little bit more stability and security in our lives. WERTHEIMER: So what is the first thing you want to try to do - to get for the graduate students at Columbia? KATZ: Well, our main interest, the thing that unites all of us across departments, is a desire to negotiate a binding contract with the administration. More specifically, though, you know, talking to people across campus, it's become clear that we do share certain common concerns. You know, front and center is health care. I think many of us are concerned about the limits of our student health care plan, which is basically identical to the one that undergraduates receive. We're concerned about the expense of adding dependents to our health plan, our lack of dental and vision coverage. More broadly, we're concerned about a lack of a grievance process - protections against, say, sexual harassment and assault. As long as we don't have clear procedures in place to deal with issues as they arise, it's very hard to feel secure in our lives. WERTHEIMER: Paul Katz is a graduate student at Columbia University. Thank you very much for talking to us. KATZ: Oh, thank you so much for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WERTHEIMER: BJ Leiderman writes our theme music.

S. housing market is finally getting back to normal after the worst housing crash since the Great Depression. Sales are pretty solid. Prices are rising. But as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, appearances can be deceiving. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: For 30 years, Greg Spier has been a home builder in Foxborough, Mass. And he feels pretty lucky to be standing on a job site. GREG SPIER: A lot of people have gone out of the business. If I didn't have rental property that I was able to, you know, use and cash flow during the downturn, I wouldn't have survived. ARNOLD: But today at least, Spier has some blueprints tucked under his arm that he's brought to show his carpenters. They're framing out what's going to be a beautiful new 4,000-square-foot house. Spier says just this summer he's finally seen a shift. He says at least some people are buying new homes again. He hasn't even officially listed this one for sale yet. . . SPIER: And I've got a customer looking at it on Saturday. So - and, you know, this is without even using a broker, people that just drove by. ARNOLD: So that all sounds good. Still, Spier says while older people, baby boomers are buying homes, first-time homebuyers - those younger couples settling down, millennials - he barely sees them. Well, with one exception. Spier points towards the house next door. SPIER: One of the houses in our subdivision - the couple won the lottery, and they came and bought a big house. But pretty much. . . ARNOLD: . . . They actually won the lottery? SPIER: Right there. ARNOLD: Right there, one lucky young couple bought a big, nice house. But for most millennials. . . WILLIAM WHEATON: They're just renting. Young people are not buying anything. ARNOLD: That's William Wheaton. He's a housing economist at MIT. And he says it's kind of a funny thing. You look at certain indicators, the housing market looks just fine. Take sales of existing homes. WHEATON: The sales of houses, most of which is just people buying one house and selling another, sales of single-family housing is about average or above. But what's not above is the net increase in the number of people owning homes. ARNOLD: That's one reason Wheaton says that many new home builders like Spier are still only halfway back to normal levels of construction. Wheaton's talking about the homeownership rate. As the population grows, we're not seeing those additional people owning homes. In fact, the opposite is happening. WHEATON: In the last year, the homeownership rate fell. ARNOLD: And it's been falling a lot. Sure, up at the peak of the bubble, maybe the close to 70 percent homeownership rate was too high. But now it's steadily fallen year after year all the way down to 62. 9 percent. WHEATON: It hasn't been that low in 50 years. The last time was back in the '60s. ARNOLD: Really? WHEATON: And it is just very, very depressed. So, you know, everybody's going around and has their one theory or another. ARNOLD: One is it's still too hard to get a loan. The banks dispute that. Student debt might be deterring people. Another theory is that first-time homebuyers are still spooked by housing because they saw their parents or relatives get hurt financially when the bubble burst. But Wheaton says there's another explanation and one that makes sense to him. And that's that younger people just aren't getting married as much these days. WHEATON: The number of people under 35 who have never been married is two times what it was in the '80, the '90 or the 2000 census. It's just off the charts. And once you realize that statistic, then everything else falls in place. ARNOLD: Wheaton says that's because if you don't get married and settle down you're much less likely to buy a house. Now, common sense would suggest that with rents on the rise, at some point a lot more people - married or not - would get sick of paying rent and want to build equity in their own home or condo. But we're not seeing much of that yet. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  There are signs that the U.

I sat down with him this morning shortly before he flew to China for the next G20 meeting. We were at the Brookings Institution in Washington to talk about trade and other global economic issues, and I began by asking him, at this point, are the TPP and a proposed deal with Europe, the TTIP, dead? JACK LEW: No. There's a strong case for a good trade agreement, which TPP is, and we're going to continue to press forward, as the president has indicated. We're going to continue to work with the Europeans. Whether we can finish it or not I can't guarantee, but we're going to still try to get that done. SIEGEL: But on TPP where you've lost Secretary Clinton as a supporter it seems, do you read the opposition to that as just an election year kerfuffle, or is there something changing in the way Americans see trade agreements and in the way Washington had better negotiate trade agreements? LEW: You know, Robert, I think that the benefits of the market access for American workers are clear. I think what we need to be more clear at is how the benefits of trade agreements get to workers, how workers are equipped with the training they need to have the jobs in the new economy, how companies share the benefits of growth with workers. We have to make a stronger case, a better case, but the substance, the facts are clear. SIEGEL: Secretary Lew, I'm not hearing you feeling the tectonic plates about trade policy shifting in the United States. I hear you feeling things haven't been presented exactly right; they could be sold better. I'm not hearing you detect some fundamental change in this issue. SIEGEL: Look; what I believe is that there's a lot of anxiety and anger amongst working people around the world. It's not just in the U. S. We're seeing it in many, many parts of the world. I think that is a message to global financial policymakers that what we've been saying for a long time has to become central. And that is, how do we make sure that the benefits of a growing economy reach working people? It will not help working people to have a shrinking economy. Right now the United States economy would be doing better if global growth was stronger. That would mean more demand for U. S. goods and services. So we need a stronger global economy, but we also need to make sure the benefits are broadly shared. SIEGEL: What do you tell an American who's anxious about the budget deficit and the debt and who sees the economy not strong enough for us to undertake either the spending cuts or the tax increases that might reduce the deficit and not strong enough to grow in a way that there would be more revenues and just watching the deficit grow? LEW: You know, people have to focus on not just the nominal number of what the size of the deficit is but the deficit as a share of the economy. When we came into office, it was roughly 10 percent of GDP. It's now under 3 percent of GDP. That is the most dramatic reduction in deficit in history. It's comparable with the post-World War II reduction. SIEGEL: Isn't that share moving up a little bit right now? LEW: It is ticked up a little bit, but it's in the zone of a sustainable level. And when - if you ask me today, what is the most pressing need, it is more important to invest more in infrastructure and training today to build the economic foundation for growth that will throw off more income and more revenue in the future than to get an incremental amount of deficit and debt reduction over the next few years. SIEGEL: When I ask you about Ireland, Apple and taxes. Why is the U. S. critical of the European Commission billing Apple for billions in taxes to pay Ireland? Aren't they trying to cope with global tax evasion, something which we think is a problem that should be handled? LEW: We have a shared view that companies should not be able to avoid taxation by shifting profits and by using loopholes in international tax laws. What's not appropriate is for, in the name of state aid, Europe to be rewriting tax law retroactively, reaching into a tax base that properly should be a U. S. tax base because it's U. S. income and doing it in a way that I think ultimately will hurt the business environment because it's going to create uncertainty in Europe. SIEGEL: But it sounds - in the case of Apple, it sounds odd. It sounds as if the U. S. is saying to Europe, how dare you do something about this? We're busy not doing something about this. It's our job not to do. LEW: I think that the process of working tax reform through Congress typically takes many years. It's not unusual for it to start in one administration and end in another. What's not appropriate is for Europe to preempt the ability for the United States to address that, which is what I've said is a potential outcome of the European action. SIEGEL: Secretary Lew insists he's optimistic about the economy, although he says policymakers should pay attention to the global economic debates that have been so heated this year. He says more attention should be paid to spreading the benefits of trade, not reducing it. And he paints a glowing picture of an economic future that he says is possible. LEW: It will be a 21st century economy. It will have technology that's different. It will have trade practices that are different. But we can have high standards that protect workers' rights, the environmental standards, good business practices and global markets that give U. S. workers and businesses the ability to get a fair share of the global markets. That's who we're fighting for. SIEGEL: That sounds like a beautiful world. I mean that sounds a far cry from the anxiety you've described of working people all around the world. LEW: I don't disagree that the anxiety is there, but I also take optimism from the fact that there are policies to address that. And if you look, for example, at the TPP, there are labor provisions in the TPP that are already driving an improvement in labor standards in countries like Vietnam and Mexico. And it is already having an impact to level the playing field and improve the ability for U. S. competition. What we can't do is pull away from the world. SIEGEL: But what are the chances of the TPP being approved in the lame duck session? LEW: We are going to continue to press for it. We think the case is strong, and the opportunity is there. And we're determined to get it done. SIEGEL: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, thanks a lot for talking with us once again. LEW: Great to be with you, Robert. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  One person convinced of the benefits of global trade to the American economy is Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. I sat down with him this morning shortly before he flew to China for the next G20 meeting. We were at the Brookings Institution in Washington to talk about trade and other global economic issues, and I began by asking him, at this point, are the TPP and a proposed deal with Europe, the TTIP, dead? JACK LEW: No. There's a strong case for a good trade agreement, which TPP is, and we're going to continue to press forward, as the president has indicated. We're going to continue to work with the Europeans. Whether we can finish it or not I can't guarantee, but we're going to still try to get that done. SIEGEL: But on TPP where you've lost Secretary Clinton as a supporter it seems, do you read the opposition to that as just an election year kerfuffle, or is there something changing in the way Americans see trade agreements and in the way Washington had better negotiate trade agreements? LEW: You know, Robert, I think that the benefits of the market access for American workers are clear. I think what we need to be more clear at is how the benefits of trade agreements get to workers, how workers are equipped with the training they need to have the jobs in the new economy, how companies share the benefits of growth with workers. We have to make a stronger case, a better case, but the substance, the facts are clear. SIEGEL: Secretary Lew, I'm not hearing you feeling the tectonic plates about trade policy shifting in the United States. I hear you feeling things haven't been presented exactly right; they could be sold better. I'm not hearing you detect some fundamental change in this issue.

It would be among the U. S. and 11 other countries, and the Obama administration insists it would improve the economy. In a few moments we'll hear Treasury Secretary Jack Lew make a case for it. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: First a look at what trade agreements have meant for California. It has more factory workers than any other state in the nation, but there are far fewer of them than there used to be. Ben Bergman of KPCC reports as part of our project with member stations about America's role in the world, A Nation Engaged. BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: Inside a sprawling warehouse just outside downtown L. A. , a line of seamstresses sew high-end blouses. This city is still the garment capital of the U. S. even though only a fraction of the apparel workers who once worked here are left. Since 1990, the number of U. S. apparel manufacturing jobs has fallen by 80 percent. ILSE METCHEK: The charts and the statistics are really frightening. BERGMAN: That's Ilse Metchek, head of the California Fashion Association. She's worked in the industry for half a century, and she says she's seen firsthand the devastating effects free trade agreements have had across the country. METCHEK: Absolutely terrible. When NAFTA was put into place, the years thereafter, we lost 50,000 jobs. BERGMAN: Metchek says trade has been a one-way street for American workers, a flood of cheap imports. And in terms of exports, there are almost none. I asked her to name a company that makes clothes in L. A. and sends them overseas. She couldn't do it. She says the Trans-Pacific Partnership would make things even worse because it sets rules for 12 countries but not China. METCHEK: It's an open door for China to ship to the United States duty free. BERGMAN: Still, Metchek doesn't like the anti-trade rhetoric that's dominated this campaign from Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We're going to start making things again. We're going to start up our manufacturing businesses. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: I believe we can still make it in America and export from America. BERGMAN: Metchek finds that kind of talk naive. METCHEK: Just because you close trade doesn't mean factories are coming back. BERGMAN: The apparel factories that do remain in the U. S. make high-end fashion - $300 designer jeans, $160 T-shirts. But as for the clothes most people wear, Metchek says there's no way you can make them cheaply enough in the U. S. METCHEK: I think the biggest problem is of course that we have a concept that if we make it here, the world would want it. The world is not waiting for American product. We're kidding ourselves. BERGMAN: At least in apparel. But in more advanced manufacturing, it's a different story. The world often is waiting for made-in-USA goods. In Orange County, Calif. , a carbon fiber core rolls through a long machine as a worker gives one last quality control check. We're at the factory of CTC Global which makes conductors that improve efficiency and power lines. Chief Operating Officer Marv Sepe says more than 80 percent of the company's products are exported. MARV SEPE: So anything that would hamper our ability to sell into foreign markets would impact us greatly. BERGMAN: CTC global is typical of the factories that now dominate Southern California. It's not making T-shirts. It's making high-value products that get shipped all over the world. It's also lean, with just 130 workers. That's why it's cost effective for the company to still make its conductors in the U. S. SEPE: We've done a very good job of automating the process. We can have a minimal number of people producing the maximum amount of product. BERGMAN: That's not a popular thing to say, but most economists agree. It's automation, not trade, that's to blame for most of the job losses in manufacturing. But that doesn't play as well on the campaign trail as what Trump says. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Other people are taking your jobs, and our jobs are disappearing. They're going to other countries. BERGMAN: Though she's considered less protectionist than Trump, Clinton came out last year against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest trade agreement in history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: What I know about it, as of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it. BERGMAN: Sepe is still holding out hope the treaty will be ratified. He says it would help open new markets to sell his conductors, so he's dismayed both Clinton and Trump oppose it. SEPE: If you are not selling enough product in the United States and you need to go into foreign markets, why would you cut that off? Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers are outside of the United States. We need to go out and compete worldwide. BERGMAN: And competing means California shouldn't close its doors to bringing in goods from other countries, says Kevin Klowden, an economist at the Milken Institute. KEVIN KLOWDEN: Imports are still more important because we are the main gateway for manufactured goods from China into the United States. BERGMAN: When operations at West Coast ports ground to a halt last year because of a labor dispute, LA's economy took a big hit. Klowden says it's proof of how important trade has become, supporting a vast number of workers who transport and process all that stuff we buy from China. KLOWDEN: If the slowdown had turned into a full strike, it potentially could have pushed the Los Angeles area into recession. BERGMAN: And that's what he says could happen if the U. S. got into a trade war with China. For NPR News, I'm Ben Bergman in Los Angeles.

Since that vote a couple of months ago, the British economy has not completely crashed. But the pound has fallen against the dollar - one of the things that's creating uncertainty for American finance firms and automakers based in Europe. This week, we're hearing about America's role in the world in a project called A Nation Engaged. Today, we're going to explore how the Brexit referendum has affected U. S. business and political interests there. NPR's Frank Langfitt was on the line with us from London. Good morning. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Well, let's start with the mood of American business in the U. K. these days. LANGFITT: You know, Renee, the actual Brexit is years off. But there are certain sectors here that are already anxious and bracing for it. GM is talking about cutting hours for workers at two German plants because of lower demand in the U. K. based just on the Brexit vote alone. Ford's talking about raising prices, even looking at closing factories. The company's already taking a financial hit. Now, this is Bob Shanks. He's the company's chief financial officer. Here's how he put it in an investor call earlier this summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BOB SHANKS: We are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit, and we see the impact on Ford being somewhere in the range of 400 to 500 million dollars in each year. LANGFITT: And that's just based on the vote in June. MONTAGNE: And that is also just Detroit's view. There's also the view from London. It is Europe's financial capital. Lots of American investment banks are headquartered there. How do they see things? LANGFITT: Well, I've been talking to a lot of people on the future of finance in London, and we'll be hearing from them in a moment. But you can start even before the June referendum - what people were saying. Take Jamie Dimon - he's the CEO of JP Morgan. He came here and warned that after Brexit, the company's operation in the U. K. might not be able to do certain work in Europe, which is what most people expect. And he told workers in the U. K. office here that a lot of their jobs might actually end up going to continental Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE DIMON: Today, we can service EU companies here, freely, with systems, technology, research, investment banking. After a Brexit, we cannot do it all here. And we will have to start planning for that. I don't know if it means a thousand jobs, 2,000 jobs. It could be as many as 4,000. ANDREW GRAY: This is hugely too complicated because the organizations have evolved in London over decades. LANGFITT: Andrew Gray is a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers. He advises investment banks, insurance companies and other firms on Brexit planning. GRAY: A number of banks have estimated to replicate even part of their infrastructure in Europe could take between five and 10 years. LANGFITT: So you mean to take what they do here in the city of - in London and move it to Europe? GRAY: Yeah, I mean if. . . LANGFITT: That's a lot. GRAY: It's a huge amount of time. There are 2 million people working in financial services in the U. K. There is no capacity in a number of other European locations simply to replicate what we have. LANGFITT: Gray says companies are considering cities ranging from Dublin to Amsterdam to Paris and Luxembourg, assuming they can find the space. GRAY: You have to be looking at real estate as an option. Yeah, there is a - only a finite supply of suitable real estate in a number of these locations. And if they choose a particular location, they've got to think about issues around - you know, the people issues, which will include some of the social aspects, housing, schools. They've got to look at language skills. LANGFITT: The United Kingdom's auto business, which is seen as very successful, sends more than half its exports to the European Union. So naturally, it's worried, as well. TAMZEN ISACSSON: It's our single most important trading partner. LANGFITT: Tamzen Isacsson works for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a U. K. industry group. ISACSSON: It's vital for our U. K. automotive manufacturing and for our, you know, huge retail market here that we secure unfettered access to the European markets. LANGFITT: Otherwise, companies, such as GM, could face tariffs to export to the EU. And that could make it harder for plants here to win new work. GRAY: The big issues are going to be large-scale models coming up for renewal during the period of uncertainty. LANGFITT: Graham Armitage is an auto analyst for KPMG. GRAHAM ARMITAGE: You're talking about tens of thousands of jobs that could be affected. You know, not all of those under - no one would say that all of those decisions will go against the U. K. , but they're going to be tougher decisions than they would otherwise have been. MONTAGNE: So American business is anxious, uncertain about Brexit. Where is the U. S. government in all of this? LANGFITT: Well, you know, you remember, President Obama actually came here, and he urged the British to vote, stay in the EU. And it wasn't just for economic reasons, but political ones as well. And it is all connected. The U. K. has been seen as a reliable, influential ally for the U. S. on its own and in Europe. And I was talking to a guy named Anand Menon. He's a professor of European politics at King's College here in London, and this is the way he analyzed it. ANAND MENON: First and foremost, I think the United States wants a cohesive Europe. This obviously - this Brexit decision - undermines that cohesiveness to an extent. The United States wants an economically strong Europe, and in so far as Brexit has negative economic consequences for the U. K. and for continental Europe. That's not something the United States would welcome. MONTAGNE: All of that explains why the U. S. really wanted the U. K. to stay in the EU, right? LANGFITT: Absolutely. I mean, the U. K. has been very helpful to American interests in Europe and speaking for the United States on the continent. But this guy, professor Menon at King's College - he said more broadly that it was about a united Europe and that a united Europe with the U. K. - in it was a key to manage the influence of China - rising China. You know, the U. S. , the U. K. , Europe - they all shared democratic systems and values. And people see it as important for these countries to stick together as an authoritarian nation, as exerting more power across the globe. And with Brexit, you know, managing China's rise may make it just a little bit harder for the U. S. MONTAGNE: Frank, thanks very much. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Renee. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking to us from London, as part of our series A Nation Engaged. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  When the United Kingdom decided to pull out of the European Union, there were dire predictions about the impact on the economy.

LANGFITT: And that's just based on the vote in June. MONTAGNE: And that is also just Detroit's view. There's also the view from London. It is Europe's financial capital. Lots of American investment banks are headquartered there. How do they see things? LANGFITT: Well, I've been talking to a lot of people on the future of finance in London, and we'll be hearing from them in a moment. But you can start even before the June referendum - what people were saying. Take Jamie Dimon - he's the CEO of JP Morgan. He came here and warned that after Brexit, the company's operation in the U. K. might not be able to do certain work in Europe, which is what most people expect. And he told workers in the U. K. office here that a lot of their jobs might actually end up going to continental Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMIE DIMON: Today, we can service EU companies here, freely, with systems, technology, research, investment banking. After a Brexit, we cannot do it all here. And we will have to start planning for that. I don't know if it means a thousand jobs, 2,000 jobs. It could be as many as 4,000. ANDREW GRAY: This is hugely too complicated because the organizations have evolved in London over decades. LANGFITT: Andrew Gray is a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers. He advises investment banks, insurance companies and other firms on Brexit planning. GRAY: A number of banks have estimated to replicate even part of their infrastructure in Europe could take between five and 10 years. LANGFITT: So you mean to take what they do here in the city of - in London and move it to Europe? GRAY: Yeah, I mean if. . . LANGFITT: That's a lot. GRAY: It's a huge amount of time. There are 2 million people working in financial services in the U. K. There is no capacity in a number of other European locations simply to replicate what we have. LANGFITT: Gray says companies are considering cities ranging from Dublin to Amsterdam to Paris and Luxembourg, assuming they can find the space. GRAY: You have to be looking at real estate as an option. Yeah, there is a - only a finite supply of suitable real estate in a number of these locations. And if they choose a particular location, they've got to think about issues around - you know, the people issues, which will include some of the social aspects, housing, schools. They've got to look at language skills. LANGFITT: The United Kingdom's auto business, which is seen as very successful, sends more than half its exports to the European Union. So naturally, it's worried, as well. TAMZEN ISACSSON: It's our single most important trading partner. LANGFITT: Tamzen Isacsson works for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a U. K. industry group. ISACSSON: It's vital for our U. K. automotive manufacturing and for our, you know, huge retail market here that we secure unfettered access to the European markets. LANGFITT: Otherwise, companies, such as GM, could face tariffs to export to the EU. And that could make it harder for plants here to win new work. GRAY: The big issues are going to be large-scale models coming up for renewal during the period of uncertainty. LANGFITT: Graham Armitage is an auto analyst for KPMG. GRAHAM ARMITAGE: You're talking about tens of thousands of jobs that could be affected. You know, not all of those under - no one would say that all of those decisions will go against the U. K. , but they're going to be tougher decisions than they would otherwise have been. MONTAGNE: So American business is anxious, uncertain about Brexit. Where is the U. S. government in all of this? LANGFITT: Well, you know, you remember, President Obama actually came here, and he urged the British to vote, stay in the EU. And it wasn't just for economic reasons, but political ones as well. And it is all connected. The U. K. has been seen as a reliable, influential ally for the U. S. on its own and in Europe. And I was talking to a guy named Anand Menon. He's a professor of European politics at King's College here in London, and this is the way he analyzed it. ANAND MENON: First and foremost, I think the United States wants a cohesive Europe. This obviously - this Brexit decision - undermines that cohesiveness to an extent. The United States wants an economically strong Europe, and in so far as Brexit has negative economic consequences for the U. K. and for continental Europe. That's not something the United States would welcome. MONTAGNE: All of that explains why the U. S. really wanted the U. K. to stay in the EU, right? LANGFITT: Absolutely. I mean, the U. K. has been very helpful to American interests in Europe and speaking for the United States on the continent. But this guy, professor Menon at King's College - he said more broadly that it was about a united Europe and that a united Europe with the U. K. - in it was a key to manage the influence of China - rising China. You know, the U. S. , the U. K. , Europe - they all shared democratic systems and values. And people see it as important for these countries to stick together as an authoritarian nation, as exerting more power across the globe. And with Brexit, you know, managing China's rise may make it just a little bit harder for the U. S. MONTAGNE: Frank, thanks very much. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Renee.

It looks different depending where in the country you live, how old you are and what your race is. Today in our series The New Middle, a slice of the black middle-class experience. One of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the United States sits just east of Washington, D. C. This is Prince George's County, Md. The median income is $73,000 a year. That's more than $20,000 higher than the national average. GRATTAN BETANCOURT: Hi. SHAPIRO: Hi. G BETANCOURT: Welcome. SHAPIRO: Thank you so much. G BETANCOURT: Thanks for coming out. EVELYN BETANCOURT: Thank you so much for having us. SHAPIRO: Grattan and Evelyn Betancourt bought their home here in 1986. It's two stories, with a brick front and a wide lawn. Some evenings, deer come out of the woods and linger in their yard. E BETANCOURT: This was our first, and it will be our only home. G BETANCOURT: You know, when you look at the neighborhood, it has a kind of a look of middle-class prosperity. But the reality is - and we're aware of this - that many people here, even though they've lived here many years, are fighting to save their homes. SHAPIRO: That's true of the Betancourts, too. They think back to when they bought this house. They were both working at the Ford dealership that they still work at today. The house was new construction, and they added special touches, like a bay window. G BETANCOURT: Even though that was 30 years ago, we started thinking of the future. We wanted a home that didn't involve a lot of steps because we knew that one day steps were going to be a problem. SHAPIRO: Because, when you bought it, you knew this was the place you were going to grow old in. G BETANCOURT: Yes. E BETANCOURT: Yes. G BETANCOURT: That was our intent. We were going to stay here. This is where we were going to live the rest of our lives. SHAPIRO: Here in Prince George's County, a quarter of the homes are underwater. The owners owe more than the homes are worth. The Betancourt's home is worth a little over $300,000, but they owe close to half a million on it. Around the country, black middle-class neighborhoods have recovered from the housing crash much more slowly than white neighborhoods. In the Betancourt's case, they had almost paid off their mortgage in 2005, when Grattan needed open-heart surgery. The bank suggested that Evelyn cash out her retirement plan. She liquidated everything and took out a loan on the house to pay her husband's medical bills. G BETANCOURT: Then Evelyn had an accident on the job that really hurt her earning ability for a while. SHAPIRO: Both of them had to scale back their hours at the Ford dealership, where they've worked for more than 30 years. They fell behind on payments. Now, they're afraid they'll lose their home. G BETANCOURT: Being in the middle class, it gives you opportunity, but it doesn't give you immunity. And the further up you step, the harder it is to stay there. SHAPIRO: You know, we know from lawsuits, we know from Justice Department investigations that black homeowners have been consistently given a worse deal than white homeowners. And here we are in Prince George's County, one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the country, and the rate of recovery has been nowhere near that of the rest of the country. What do you make of that? E BETANCOURT: I would say definitely race plays a part in it. I would say, unfortunately, age sometimes plays a part in it. You have people that are in their 60s and their 70s that don't understand the paperwork. You know, they're told or they get a certified letter and, like in my case, with my husband having a bad heart, do I decide to show it to him or share it with him, or do I put it away? And then, sometimes, you put it away, and it's too late to try to be able to unravel what you've got into. SHAPIRO: For the Betancourt's, it might not be too late. They're working with a counselor named Luis Perez at a place called the Housing Initiative Partnership. LUIS PEREZ: The majority of the people that walk in here are middle class. SHAPIRO: His small office has plants and a fish tank to help people relax a little bit. PEREZ: I have seen a lot of tears, I have. I've seen people come in here, you know, stressed out, worried, can't sleep at nights. They know they're going to lose their homes. SHAPIRO: Most of his clients are black or Latino. He says about 30 percent of them manage to hang onto their homes. When he tells people not to lose hope, he speaks from personal experience. PEREZ: I went through exactly what people in front of my desk are going through. I did lose my house. SHAPIRO: It's a familiar story. He got laid off in a merger, then went through foreclosure, bankruptcy, moved into a tiny apartment. He was 63 years old, and it took him five years to rebuild his credit. He tells his clients about what it was like to show them that they can bounce back, too. PEREZ: OK, my wife was not working. OK, the stress that we went through, the sleepless nights that we went through, the fear, OK, and the decision that I have to make because I was afraid of being thrown out on the streets. SHAPIRO: Now, he's about to buy a home once again. At work, he is negotiating with the Betancourt's lender, trying to get a repayment plan that'll let them stay in their house without having to go through the trauma that he experienced. PEREZ: I think that we've got a pretty good chance of keeping their home. SHAPIRO: But even if they do keep their house, any prospect of retirement or taking a vacation seems far away for the Betancourts. KRIS MARSH: You know, we often talk about how, when white America gets a - gets a cold, black America gets the flu. SHAPIRO: I met Professor Kris Marsh in another part of Prince George's County to try to understand why the black middle class has recovered so much more slowly from the housing crisis. She's a University of Maryland sociologist who studies the black middle class and lives in a beautiful home in an upscale housing complex. Most of the homeowners here are black, and she says the houses are worth less than they'd be in a similar neighborhood that's majority white. MARSH: That's the fundamental truth - is, like, it's a racist housing market (laughter). But if we kind of unpack that and add some sociology around that, we have to look at, like, the resources that whites had before the problem that we had in the housing market and how that kind of helped them to rebound so much quicker. Blacks didn't have those resources, so when an emergency or something happens or a crisis happens, it's a little harder for them to bounce back. SHAPIRO: This is one theme that keeps coming up as we look at what it means to be middle class in America today. You can get by all right, until there's a medical emergency or a tree falls through the roof of your house. One big, surprise expense, and suddenly you're in free fall. MARSH: You - you might want to go straight. SHAPIRO: Kris Marsh takes us on a tour of her neighborhood, past duck ponds and playgrounds. MARSH: It is really great to have a cardiologist live next to you and have a executive police officer live to the right of you and a geneticist live down the street. I mean, that's kind of hot. And they're black. But then, on the flip side, it's like, but we quite haven't arrived yet because are living here by choice, or are we forced to live here? Is that - is the housing market constrained? SHAPIRO: Would you prefer to live in a place that is, you know, 30 percent Latino, 30 percent white, 30 percent black? MARSH: Well, those places don't exist because whites live in predominantly white areas. But (laughter), OK, so here's how I'm going to answer that question - is it more important for my psychological well-being to be in a predominantly black neighborhood, or is it more important to for me to build equity faster in my house? And if that's the case, then I should live in a more mixed community. SHAPIRO: Because you know that, living in a predominantly black neighborhood, your house is not going to increase in value as quickly as if your neighbors were white. MARSH: Yes, yes. SHAPIRO: Even if it's a neighborhood like this, where every house is gorgeous? MARSH: Yes. SHAPIRO: She leads us to the center of the housing complex, where there's a grand mansion. It's the original plantation house. This entire development was built on land that once held slaves. Professor Marsh lives on a street named after one of those slaves, a woman called Hattie. MARSH: I'm pretty sure Hattie was a cook. SHAPIRO: Marsh feels a bit like she's reclaiming history, but it's also painful. MARSH: So every morning, when I'm - like, I arrive, I've got to drive past that. SHAPIRO: Hattie was never allowed to own a home. And today, it still feels like black homeowners face some obstacles that white homeowners do not. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  The American middle class is not monolithic.

NPR's John Ydstie says that muddies the water a bit. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Fed officials would like to get their benchmark interest rate back to more normal levels after pushing it to near-zero during the Great Recession. Since then, they've raised rates only once - a quarter-of-a-point hike last December. But after job gains of more than 270,000 in June and July, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week that the case for raising rates again has strengthened. That fueled speculation the Fed will move at its September meeting in less than three weeks. That's less likely now, says Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. CARL TANNENBAUM: This morning's job report was good, but probably not good enough to prompt a near-term move from the Federal Reserve.

After all, Baumohl says, even with the cooling in August, the average number of jobs added in the past three months is 232,000.

The Federal Highway Administration says that's up 3 percent from the year before. We have two reports now on some of the effects of this increased driving. First, the fact that drivers are burning more gasoline. NPR's Jeff Brady starts us off and reports the country will likely set a new record for gasoline consumption this year. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: At Valley Forge National Historical Park outside Philadelphia, the parking lot has cars from all over - Tennessee, New York, Nebraska. It's a good place to find people on a road trip because of low gas prices. Roberta Tower is turning a crank to lower her travel trailer onto the hitch of her SUV. She's from Seattle and is three months into a cross-country trip. ROBERTA TOWER: Because the gasoline prices have been so low this summer, I've been able to go a lot further and see a lot more than I had initially thought I would be able to. BRADY: Heading into the Labor Day weekend, regular gas is selling for a national average of about $2. 20 a gallon. That's 40 percent less than two summers ago. TOWER: I've met a lot of people on the road who were doing the same thing I'm doing. BRADY: And that's showing up in statistics. In June, U. S. drivers burned more than 405 million gallons of gasoline a day. TOM KLOZA: That's an all-time record. That shatters the record established a couple years ago. BRADY: Tom Kloza with the Oil Price Information Service says that's a surprise to a lot of people who follow the gasoline market. Even the oil industry thought demand had peaked back in 2007 and would only go down from now on. Back then, it was the Great Recession and higher gas prices responsible. Today, more efficient cars and changing driving habits were supposed to continue the downward trend. But then the economy improved and gas prices fell. Now Kloza says the U. S. is on track to also break the annual record for gas consumption. KLOZA: But I don't necessarily think that's something to cheer about because some of the reasons that we're breaking it have to do with people making, perhaps, poor choices in what kind of vehicles they're going to use. BRADY: Kloza says people are buying SUVs and bigger cars again. But now even those vehicles are going to get more efficient, and that means gas consumption will start declining again. Joanne Shore is chief industry analyst at the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. She says government regulations require new cars to be even more efficient. JOANNE SHORE: So while we'll be driving more - more people driving - we will be using less fuel. BRADY: There are still some questions about how fast that decline will happen. For example, many in the millennial generation have shown little interest in owning cars up to now, but Shore says that could change. SHORE: I think people will be watching whether or not they will fall into lifestyles that some of the older generations typified, which is moving to the suburbs, having children and continuing to drive. BRADY: Shore says there are some other wildcards out there - things like driverless cars and ride-booking services such as Uber. They discourage car ownership, and that makes predicting gasoline consumption years from now difficult. In any case, she's confident that the peak years of gas consumption are about to become history. Jeff Brady, NPR News, Philadelphia. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Americans are driving a lot more these days, to be specific - 280 billion miles in June. The Federal Highway Administration says that's up 3 percent from the year before. We have two reports now on some of the effects of this increased driving. First, the fact that drivers are burning more gasoline. NPR's Jeff Brady starts us off and reports the country will likely set a new record for gasoline consumption this year. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: At Valley Forge National Historical Park outside Philadelphia, the parking lot has cars from all over - Tennessee, New York, Nebraska. It's a good place to find people on a road trip because of low gas prices. Roberta Tower is turning a crank to lower her travel trailer onto the hitch of her SUV. She's from Seattle and is three months into a cross-country trip. ROBERTA TOWER: Because the gasoline prices have been so low this summer, I've been able to go a lot further and see a lot more than I had initially thought I would be able to. BRADY: Heading into the Labor Day weekend, regular gas is selling for a national average of about $2. 20 a gallon. That's 40 percent less than two summers ago. TOWER: I've met a lot of people on the road who were doing the same thing I'm doing. BRADY: And that's showing up in statistics. In June, U. S. drivers burned more than 405 million gallons of gasoline a day. TOM KLOZA: That's an all-time record. That shatters the record established a couple years ago. BRADY: Tom Kloza with the Oil Price Information Service says that's a surprise to a lot of people who follow the gasoline market. Even the oil industry thought demand had peaked back in 2007 and would only go down from now on. Back then, it was the Great Recession and higher gas prices responsible. Today, more efficient cars and changing driving habits were supposed to continue the downward trend. But then the economy improved and gas prices fell. Now Kloza says the U. S. is on track to also break the annual record for gas consumption. KLOZA: But I don't necessarily think that's something to cheer about because some of the reasons that we're breaking it have to do with people making, perhaps, poor choices in what kind of vehicles they're going to use.

S. job market at another solid but unexceptional performance. Today's employment report showed 151,000 new jobs added to payrolls last month. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4. 9 percent. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, the news will keep analysts guessing about just when the next Federal Reserve interest rate hike will come. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: During the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole conference last week, it became clear Fed officials would be watching today's jobs report very closely. In a speech there, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the solid performance of the job market has strengthened the case for another rate hike. A few minutes later, the Fed's second in command, Stanley Fischer, told CNBC - with typical Fed understatement - that the August jobs report will be important. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STANLEY FISCHER: That will probably weigh in our decision. YDSTIE: But the August employment data came in below economists' expectations. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, says that's likely to rule out a rate hike when Fed policymakers meet later this month. CARL TANNENBAUM: This morning's job report was good but probably not good enough to prompt a near-term move from the Federal Reserve. YDSTIE: But Tannenbaum says today's report, coupled with strong job growth in June and July, plays into a narrative that should lead the Fed to a rate hike in December. TANNENBAUM: We have had a nice year of job creation where payrolls have expanded very well. In addition, the inflation picture is starting to move to where the Fed would like to see it. And concerns about financial stability have ebbed. YDSTIE: Remember, the Fed was concerned that the British vote to exit from the European Union might cause damaging financial turmoil that could hurt the U. S. economy. But so far that hasn't happened. Maybe the most disappointing element of the August jobs report, says Tannenbaum, is a meager one-tenth of a percent rise in hourly wages, bringing the year-over-year increase in wages down to just below two and a half percent. On the other hand, says Tannenbaum, even with August's unexceptional report, job growth in the past three months has averaged a very strong 232,000, and that means a considerable boost to paychecks. TANNENBAUM: With the jobs that we've created this year, we've also restored incomes for people who will now turn around and spend that revenue.

Their industry was wrecked, as we've been reporting, losing business to cheap natural gas and challenged by new environmental rules. Some of the toughest times are felt by workers in eastern Kentucky. In that mountain region famous for coal, some areas lost their very last working mines. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports on the effort to rebuild. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In Hazard, Ky. , a group of men slowly make their way up some telephone poles in the summer heat, using metal clips to grip the wood. As part of a program co-sponsored by the local community college, these men are learning to be telephone linemen. Most of them were, until recently, longtime coal miners - people such as Gabriel Smith. GABRIEL SMITH: I loved it when I was in the coal mines. I'm a third generation. I've done it my whole life. But I have a wife. I have two children. I have third baby on the way. Actually, he's due in one month. And this is my way of trying to get back on my feet. ZARROLI: A lot of these men already have job offers, though they may have to work a few hours away and come home on weekends. In 2011, 14,000 coal miners worked in eastern Kentucky. Today, it's fewer than 4,000. These well-paying jobs helped fuel the entire economy. And their loss has been a real blow. Jeff Whitehead heads the Eastern Kentucky Concentrated Employment Program. JEFF WHITEHEAD: We've got counties that lost 40, 50 percent of their workforce. When that happened, we knew things were going to get bad. And we probably are braced for things to still get worse before they get better. ZARROLI: Many people already have fled the area in search of work. Betsy Clemons, of the local chamber of commerce, says that in a close-knit region where families go back generations, the out migration has taken a toll. BETSY CLEMONS: In the mountains, you depend upon your family, like, for child care and just any kind of need - someone gets sick, or - you have your family here to support you. And it's been devastating for those that have had to leave because they don't have that family support that they've always been used to. ZARROLI: If there's a bright side to the troubles here, it's that many people are beginning to think about what the post-coal world will look like and how to make eastern Kentucky more competitive to employers. There have been some efforts at subsidized retraining, such as the linemen program, and a push to bring better broadband to the region. Joel Brashear is with the Hyden Citizens Bank. JOEL BRASHEAR: We're all worried that coal is gone, you know. I don't know for sure if coal will ever come back. Everybody hopes that it does. But we have to find other opportunities and other places for employment. And if we don't, we're going to have some serious issues. ZARROLI: Unlike some people here, Brashear doesn't believe in trying to lure manufacturers to the area. Too often, he says, factories come and go. And when they leave, small towns are devastated. He wants to see an effort to encourage entrepreneurialism, showing people how to start businesses that will stay in the area. There's already an effort to teach computer coding to ex-miners. Loretta Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who toured Hazard last week, says local leaders know what they're up against. LORETTA MESTER: They understand that it takes leadership. They understand that it takes collaboration. They understand that you have to know what the jobs in demand in the future are going to be so that you can start now to train people in those jobs.

We've heard throughout this year's presidential campaign of stagnant wages and struggle. It is a decades-long trend, but some numbers suggest the picture may at last be improving. There are numbers suggesting the middle class finally got a meaningful raise last year. David Wessel is with us once again. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: What's the evidence? WESSEL: Well, we'll get some official Census Bureau numbers next week, but there are a couple of census veterans at a small firm called Sentier Research that keep track of this on a month-to-month basis. And they say that, adjusted for inflation, household income at the statistical middle of the middle class may have risen more in 2015 than any single year in more than a decade. Their data suggests that in June 2016, the median household income was about $57,200, and that's 2. 5 percent higher, adjusted for inflation, than it was a year earlier. INSKEEP: OK, so not exactly going to go out and spend wildly on a party with that 2. 5 percent raise, but it's a raise. WESSEL: Correct. INSKEEP: And what's driving it? WESSEL: Well, I think that one thing that's going on is that many more people have jobs. In the past couple of years, the economy's added more than 5 million jobs. That obviously boosts the incomes of households. Average wages have begun to rise a little bit, although much less than one would have expected, given how low the unemployment rate is. But I think it's important to remember that these numbers are adjusted for inflation. So when inflation is low, when the prices of food and energy fall, as they have been lately, that boosts the economist's measure of household income just as much as a raise does. But people don't often look at it that way. INSKEEP: They just see that they don't have much more money than they used to have. WESSEL: Correct. And there's another thing that's really important to remember. Even after this recent rebound, the income of the typical American household today is lower than it was in the year 2000, 16 years ago. So things are getting better, but we're still not back to where we were before the recession, let alone back to where we were in the year 2000. INSKEEP: Which explains part of the frustration here, doesn't it - the long-term nature of this problem. And let me ask about another aspect of this, David. We're talking here about income - how much you make in a month or a year. What about household wealth, which crashed so much during the recession as people's home values went down and they lost retirement accounts and other things? WESSEL: Right. So what we know from the big picture is that household wealth for all households together has gone up, and it's back close to where it was before the recession. House prices are rising again, and people who have money in the stock or bond markets have done pretty well. But that doesn't mean that people in the middle are doing well because much of the increase in wealth we've seen has gone to the people at the very top. INSKEEP: What are Americans, particularly in that middle of the middle, saying about their financial situation? What are they feeling about it? WESSEL: It's interesting. Public opinion polls show people are feeling a little better about the economy, but many of them still think the country is on the wrong track, which suggests to me that it's something other than the economy that is making people so anxious. INSKEEP: Something other than. David, thanks very much. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's David Wessel of The Brookings Institution.

But that number hides a big problem. Millions of men in their prime working years have dropped out of the workforce, meaning they aren't working or even looking for a job. This is actually a trend that's held true for a long time. It still has economists puzzled. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: In the 1960s, nearly 100 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. That's fallen over the decades. In a recent report, President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers put male labor force participation at 83 percent, an enormous decline. So essentially, 10 million men are missing from the workforce. NICHOLAS EBERSTADT: One in 6 prime-age guys has no job. It's kind of worse than it was in the Depression in 1940. NOGUCHI: Nicholas Eberstadt is an economic and demographic researcher at the American Enterprise Institute who wrote the book \"Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis. \" He says these men aren't even counted among the jobless because they aren't seeking work. Eberstadt says little is known about the missing men. There are factors that make men less likely to be in the labor force - a lack of college degree, being single or black. So why are men leaving? And what are they doing instead? They might be like Romeo Barnes. He lives in District Heights, Md. And his last job as a Wal-Mart greeter ended 11 years ago. He's 30, black, single and has cerebral palsy. ROMEO BARNES: I have able-bodied friends who can't find work. So it's not just me. NOGUCHI: Barnes says he's sought administrative jobs but says his disability and not having a college degree hold him back. BARNES: Men are traditionally known for labor work. The lower-educated guys have to do stuff like that. And that's being taken away because we have machines. NOGUCHI: Indeed, economists say technology and overseas competition is displacing many jobs. The number of people collecting disability insurance like Barnes has also increased. AEI's Eberstadt says criminal records may also play a factor. Some 20 million Americans have criminal records, the vast majority of whom are men. But, he says, it's hard to know how big a factor that is because the government doesn't keep data on their employment status. EBERSTADT: Something on the order of 1 out of every 8 adult men has got a felony conviction. And we don't have the slightest clue as to their employment patterns. NOGUCHI: What the missing men aren't doing in large numbers is staying home to take care of family. Forty percent of non-working women are primary caregivers. That's true of only 5 percent of men out of the workforce. But they do exist. Virginia Beach dad Jory Rekkedal quit his IT job a year ago to take care of his two girls, a gig he has loved. JORY REKKEDAL: It's still in the back of your brain. You're like, well, what is everybody else going to think? And what about my career? What if I have to go back to work? NOGUCHI: And if he does, he worries about the prospects. REKKEDAL: Things move really, really, really quick. And I'm worried that, you know, if we can't make it work - that I'm going to go looking for a job. And they're going to say, two years out of it - sorry, brother, you know, you don't have what it takes to work here anymore. NOGUCHI: Tara Sinclair is chief economist for job search site indeed. com. She says brawny jobs are being replaced by brainy ones. And that trend doesn't favor men. TARA SINCLAIR: The question is is this the new normal? Or with the right economic conditions - the right opportunities - will those people come back into the labor market? NOGUCHI: Sinclair says if men keep exiting the workforce, that could strain the social safety net and hold back economic growth. Some, like Richard Hintzke, say they hope to go back to work. He shuttered his Detroit home-appraisal business in 2009 after the housing market crashed and considered his options. RICHARD HINTZKE: You know, it looked like the sky was falling. So it was like, if there was ever a good time to disengage, I said this is a good time. NOGUCHI: Hintzke, who is 53 and doesn't have children, relocated to Austin and has lived off income from investment properties. He says he misses the camaraderie he felt while working and the feeling of contributing something. These days, he's mulling a new career in holistic healing. But once you're out of work for a while, he admits, it's easy to lose momentum. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  At 4. 9 percent, the nation's unemployment rate is half of what it was at the height of the Great Recession. But that number hides a big problem. Millions of men in their prime working years have dropped out of the workforce, meaning they aren't working or even looking for a job. This is actually a trend that's held true for a long time. It still has economists puzzled. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: In the 1960s, nearly 100 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. That's fallen over the decades. In a recent report, President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers put male labor force participation at 83 percent, an enormous decline. So essentially, 10 million men are missing from the workforce. NICHOLAS EBERSTADT: One in 6 prime-age guys has no job. It's kind of worse than it was in the Depression in 1940. NOGUCHI: Nicholas Eberstadt is an economic and demographic researcher at the American Enterprise Institute who wrote the book \"Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis. \" He says these men aren't even counted among the jobless because they aren't seeking work. Eberstadt says little is known about the missing men. There are factors that make men less likely to be in the labor force - a lack of college degree, being single or black. So why are men leaving? And what are they doing instead? They might be like Romeo Barnes. He lives in District Heights, Md. And his last job as a Wal-Mart greeter ended 11 years ago. He's 30, black, single and has cerebral palsy. ROMEO BARNES: I have able-bodied friends who can't find work. So it's not just me. NOGUCHI: Barnes says he's sought administrative jobs but says his disability and not having a college degree hold him back. BARNES: Men are traditionally known for labor work. The lower-educated guys have to do stuff like that. And that's being taken away because we have machines. NOGUCHI: Indeed, economists say technology and overseas competition is displacing many jobs. The number of people collecting disability insurance like Barnes has also increased. AEI's Eberstadt says criminal records may also play a factor. Some 20 million Americans have criminal records, the vast majority of whom are men. But, he says, it's hard to know how big a factor that is because the government doesn't keep data on their employment status. EBERSTADT: Something on the order of 1 out of every 8 adult men has got a felony conviction. And we don't have the slightest clue as to their employment patterns. NOGUCHI: What the missing men aren't doing in large numbers is staying home to take care of family. Forty percent of non-working women are primary caregivers. That's true of only 5 percent of men out of the workforce. But they do exist. Virginia Beach dad Jory Rekkedal quit his IT job a year ago to take care of his two girls, a gig he has loved. JORY REKKEDAL: It's still in the back of your brain. You're like, well, what is everybody else going to think? And what about my career? What if I have to go back to work? NOGUCHI: And if he does, he worries about the prospects. REKKEDAL: Things move really, really, really quick. And I'm worried that, you know, if we can't make it work - that I'm going to go looking for a job. And they're going to say, two years out of it - sorry, brother, you know, you don't have what it takes to work here anymore. NOGUCHI: Tara Sinclair is chief economist for job search site indeed. com. She says brawny jobs are being replaced by brainy ones. And that trend doesn't favor men. TARA SINCLAIR: The question is is this the new normal? Or with the right economic conditions - the right opportunities - will those people come back into the labor market?

And I just knew it was my one shot, so I said, you know what, Diane? Will you come with me to the bathroom? She goes, excuse me? I go, I know, I know; it's a little weird. Will you just please come with me to the bathroom. I want to show you my own product before and after. And she - she said OK. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GUY RAZ, HOST: From NPR, it's HOW I BUILT THIS, a show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists and the stories behind the movements they built. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I'm Guy Raz, and on today's show, the story of how Sara Blakely designed a new kind of underwear, called it Spanx and eventually became the youngest female billionaire in America. So when Sara Blakely was growing up in Florida, she didn't exactly dream of designing ladies undergarments. She actually wanted to be a lawyer. But when she took her LSATs, she failed twice. So after college, she got a job at Disney World as a ride reader. And then, in the early '90s, she got another job. It was selling fax machines door to door. By the way, did you ever feel, like, demoralized with all the - with all the rejection and just people sort of saying, you know, no soliciting; please get out of here? Were you - was it, like, water off the duck's back? BLAKELY: Oh, my gosh, no. I would feel very defeated. And many times I would get in my car and drive around the block multiple times, you know, just trying to convince myself to walk through the door. And sometimes I'd walk through the door, and they were small offices where the whole office would turn and look at me at the same time, you know? And sometimes I would completely lose my nerve and just say, oh, sorry, I'm in the wrong place, and turn around and walk out. So I stumbled my way through it, believe me. And I know this sounds crazy, but when I was selling fax machines door to door, I kept feeling like I'm in the wrong movie. You know, like, where's the director? Where's the - where's the producer? This is not my movie. And I was really determined to create a better life for myself. RAZ: So how did working there, like, help you discover what it was you were supposed to be doing? BLAKELY: That was when I first started wearing hosiery daily. And I realized and figured out what the control-top portion of the hosiery was doing for me in my clothes. It was really making my clothes fit so much better. But I had spent money on a pair of cream pants. I spent $98 dollars on them, which, for me, was a lot of money. And they just hung in my closet unworn because every time I would go to wear them, you could see the undergarment. Regular underwear left a panty line. The thong wasn't a great solution. It also left marks that you could see. And then, the shape wear was so - it was like the girdles were so thick and overdone. And I saw an opportunity for something right in the middle that would just create the perfect canvas undergarment for women. RAZ: And I guess I should say, for people who have never worn Spanx, it's just - like, this is an undergarment made out of an elastic material that basically tightens and then smooths everything around your butt and thighs. BLAKELY: Yes. And so when I cut the feet out of my own control-top pantyhose so I could wear those cream pants, the light bulb went off, and then I started pursuing the idea. RAZ: Like, how do you then start to build a business? Like, did you have any money? Did you have access to capital? Did you have wealthy friends or family? BLAKELY: I had set aside $5,000 in savings from selling fax machines door to door, and that's what I started Spanx with. And so the first thing I did was started to research if the idea existed. And I went to the Georgia Tech library in Atlanta every night after work for a week and a half researching every pantyhose patent that ever existed. And then, probably on the seventh or 10th day of me being in there, some guy came up to me and goes, you know there's a website called uspto. gov? And I said, no, what is that? I scribbled it down in my notebook. He's like, you can search - you know, put in a patent and it'll search for you. So that website became one of my best friends. And once I determined that there wasn't anything that existed in a patent form, I then wanted to see if there was any market appetite for it beyond myself. So I literally went and asked one person. I went to the Neiman Marcus down the street from my apartment, went in and asked the sales associate if she thought anybody would ever want something like footless pantyhose to wear underpants. And her face lit up, and she goes, yes. In fact, I have lots of customers who've been making their own homemade version of that because there's no right undergarment to wear under a lot of their clothes. And so that was my whole focus group, Guy. I was like, that's it. OK, there's a market demand (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Had you ever sewn anything in your life? Like, were you - did you have a background in design? BLAKELY: No. RAZ: Did you know how to, like, manufacture stuff? BLAKELY: No. RAZ: What did you do? How did you even start to think - figure out, like, what material you needed to use? BLAKELY: I've never sewn. I have never taken a business class in my life. I didn't have anybody in the industry or even know anybody that worked in fashion or retail. And so what happened when I came up with the idea is I just started taking other pantyhose, and then I went to Hancock Fabrics down the street and all these different arts-and-crafts stores and started trying to paper clip different pieces of elastic to the bottom and different pieces of lace. And, you know, obviously I didn't get very far. And my idea actually needed to be made on a machine. And that's why I really need a manufacturer to give me the time of day to see if I could even make the prototype. RAZ: And in the meantime, you were - you were still selling fax machines, right? BLAKELY: Yeah, because I needed the money coming in and the health insurance and all - all that comes with that. So I was working on my idea at night and on the weekends. And when I kept calling all the manufacturers that I found that were mostly in North Carolina on the phone and not getting anywhere - I mean, no one would take my call, or they didn't - you know, I just learned from my cold-calling days you got to be there in person. So I took a week off of work and drove to North Carolina and just started cold calling manufacturing plants. RAZ: So you just showed up and said, like, make me a prototype? BLAKELY: Yes. So I walked in the door just cold and just said, hi, I'm here to meet - see the owner. And they're like, and you are? They always ask me the same three questions. They'd say, and you are? And I'd say, Sara Blakely. And they'd say, and you're with? I'd say, Sara Blakely. And you're financially backed by? And I'd be like, Sara Blakely. And so you can imagine how that meeting went. You know, most of them were like, have a nice day; it's great to meet you, you know? RAZ: Were they just not interested in the idea at all? BLAKELY: Well, yeah, the manufacturing plants didn't get it at all. And I found it very interesting that all I was meeting with were men. And then it kind of became clear to me why they'd probably been so uncomfortable for so long - because the people that were making them weren't spending all day in them, you know? And so - and if they were, they were not admitting it. So I had a hard time explaining why this product was so important, and they couldn't wrap their mind around. I was basically coming in and disrupting. An entire industry had been looking at something in one way, and they were on a decline year after year. But they were making hosiery to be seen on the leg. And I knocked on their door and said, guys, I just want your hosiery material, and I don't need it to be seen anywhere. It's actually going to be hidden under clothes. It's a new type of undergarment. RAZ: So how did you convince a manufacturer to take you on to make the prototype? BLAKELY: Well, it took a few visits to North Carolina and a lot of, really, persistence. They all sent me away at first. And a couple weeks after I left one manufacturer - Highland mills in Charlotte, N. C. - the owner called me. And he said, Sara, it's Sam. I've decided to help make your crazy idea. And I just paused, and, I mean, I was about to jump out of my chair. And I said, really? Why? Why the change of heart, Sam? And all he said is, I have three daughters. And so later, I found out when I got the chance to do it that he had run the idea by his three daughters over dinner. And they said, Dad, this is actually a really good idea. We think you should give this girl a shot. And he still didn't understand it or think it was a good idea, but he said that my enthusiasm and my - my confidence in how good this idea was going to be stuck with him. RAZ: Did anybody know about what you were doing? BLAKELY: No. So when I came up with the idea, I kept it a secret for one year. I did share my idea with people like manufacturers or lawyers or people that I thought could help me bring my product to life, but I was very careful. Right away, it was just a gut feeling I had to keep it to myself because I believe that ideas are the most vulnerable in their infancy. And it's instinct to turn to your right or left in that moment and tell a friend or tell your husband. RAZ: Yeah, yeah. BLAKELY: And, you know, when you do that, instantly ego's invited into the mix. And then you end up spending all your time defending it, explaining it and not pursuing it. So I needed to be at the place where I knew I wouldn't turn back no matter what I heard. I had invested enough of my time and I had enough sweat equity into the idea that I told people. And the things I heard were, you know, well, honey, if it's such a good idea, why hasn't somebody else already done it? RAZ: Yeah. BLAKELY: And, well, if it is a good idea, Sara, you know, you're going to spend your savings on this, and then in six months the big guys will just knock you out of the water. And that was all coming from a place of love. But I feel like if I had heard that the night that I cut the feet out of my pantyhose, I'd probably still be selling fax machines. RAZ: So once you started to come up with something that you felt was really special, like, unique, remarkable, did you - did you begin the process of getting it patented? BLAKELY: I did. So I went to three different law firms. I couldn't find a single female patent attorney in the state of Georgia. And I even called the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, and they said there isn't one. So I thought, OK, well, I'm going to do my best to explain this to three men. Let's see what happens. And, you know, they were very nice. They were not super impressed, probably, with the idea. And they - they all quoted me between $3,000 and $5,000 to patent it. So I decided to write it myself. And I went to Barnes & Noble on Peachtree in Atlanta and bought a book called \"Patents And Trademarks,\" and I wrote the patent. And then my mom's an artist, and so I asked her if she would sketch me in the prototype for the patent. And that is the picture in the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. I went back to the one lawyer who gave me a little bit more time of day than the other ones. And I said, listen, Dan. I have written my own patent. I have done all of the work except for the claims. That is the part that I am not trained for. I don't understand how to do that. Please, I need your expertise. Is there any chance you would do it for a discounted price? And he was blown away. He goes, you've written basically the entire patent. Yes, for $750 I'll do it over a weekend, and I'll write the claims portion of your patent. RAZ: So you - so then you got the patent. BLAKELY: Yes, but, you know, there was a moment in this journey that was quite funny. I - when we were in the final stages of the claims, the lawyer said, Sara, there is - I need to know what's technically in the garment from a fiber and yarn level. And I said, OK, there's only one person to call on that, and that's Ted. And Ted had become my friend in the back of a manufacturing plant in North Carolina. And Ted had the most thick Southern accent you've ever heard in your life. I mean, it was intense. And so I called Ted on the phone. I said, Ted, my lawyer's on the phone, and we're trying to finalize the patent. Can you tell me exactly what's in the garment? He's like, yeah. They're 70 percent nylon and 30 percent lacquer. (LAUGHTER)BLAKELY: And I said, OK, great. So my lawyer and I are writing. And I go, thanks, Ted. And I'm up all night, Guy, the night before I submit my patent to the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. And I'm thinking, how is there lacquer in this product? Like, how is that possible? So I called Ted the next morning, and I said, Ted, it's Sara. Will you - will you spell lacquer for me? And he's like, yeah - L-Y-C-R-A. (LAUGHTER)BLAKELY: I went, oh my God, it's Lycra. OK, OK, OK, thanks. So I call my lawyer. I'm like, do an all-change on lacquer. It's Lycra. And he laughed so hard. He goes, do you know how fast you would have gotten a patent, Sara, on trying to make pantyhose out of paint thinner? I'm like, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Coming up - how Sara got Spanx into the department stores and into the closets of many women you may know. Stay with us.

So at this point in our story, Sara Blakely has designed a new kind of shapewear, and then she wanted to get it out into the market. But first, she had to come up with a name. BLAKELY: So the name was a journey. Since the time I cut the feet out of my pantyhose till the time I launched it in stores was two years. And I had been writing names on scrap pieces of paper everywhere I was, you know, and most of the names were on the back of rental car agreements because I had great thinking in cars. And I wasn't getting anywhere with that. I didn't like any of the names, and I knew it wasn't right. And then I sort of narrowed down my thinking at one point in time and thought, Kodak and Coca-Cola are the two most recognized names in the world. What do they have in common? And they both had a strong K sound to them. And I had friends that were stand-up comedians, and I knew that the K sound makes your audience laugh. So I just put all that. . . RAZ: I wonder why that is. BLAKELY: I know. I don't know, but it's a - it's a known trade secret among comedians. And so I thought, you know what? I need to have my invention have the K sound in it for good luck. And almost as soon as I narrowed my thinking down that way, the word spanks came to me while I was in my car. I saw the word across - like, in my mind - across the dashboard of my car. And I pulled off to the side of the road and I thought, that's it. And I went home that night. I didn't tell anybody. And I wrote down S-P-A-N-K-S. And I went on uspto. gov, and I typed it in. And I sat there and stared at it for a while. And at the last minute, I backspaced and deleted the K and the S and put in an X. I had read that made up words do better for products than real words do and they're easier to trademark. And even though it didn't actually have the K in it, it had still the K sound, and so I felt great about it. And the name was just right. It's just my product was all about the rear end, and it's about making the rear end look better and no panty lines. And so the word Spanx was kind of naughty and kind of funny and a little bit risky. And it just all worked, and I hit send. And I think it was $150 with my credit card. And then, a couple months later, I got back an official certificate from the government saying that I was the proud owner of the word Spanx. RAZ: OK so you've got a manufacturer, a patent and a name. How did you - how did you start selling it? BLAKELY: My very first account that I called on was Neiman Marcus. RAZ: How did you even get in there? BLAKELY: I called them. Guy, I just called them. I went in the yellow pages, and I looked up the Neiman Marcus number in Atlanta. And I said, hi, I'm Sara. I invented a product; can I come and show it to you? And the lady laughed and goes, ma'am, we have a buying office, and it's in Dallas. I said, oh, well, what's their number? So she gave me their number, and I started calling them. And I just kept calling and trying to get to the hosiery buyer. And I called for days at different times. And she answered the phone, and I took my shot. And I said, hey, hi, I'm Sara Blakely, and I invented a product that is going to change the way your customers wear clothes. And if you give me a few minutes of your time, I'll fly to Dallas and show you. RAZ: And what'd she say? BLAKELY: She said, well, if you're willing to fly here, I'll give you ten minutes of my time. And I said, great. And I jumped on a plane, and I flew to Dallas. And I was in the meeting with her, and she was this beautiful woman, impeccably dressed. I'm at the Neiman Marcus headquarters. I have a Ziploc bag from my kitchen with a prototype in it, a color copy of the packaging that I had created on my friend's computer and my lucky red backpack from college that all of my friends begged me not to bring (laughter). They said, Sara, you cannot go to the Neiman Marcus headquarters with that red Eastpak old, dingy backpack. I said, yes, it's my good luck charm. I have to. And they were really pleading with me. RAZ: So what happened? BLAKELY: In the middle of my meeting with her, I could tell I was losing her. And I just knew it was my one shot. So I said, you know what, Diane? Will you come with me to the bathroom? And she just paused. She goes, excuse me? I go, I know, I know, it's little weird. Will you just please come with me to the bathroom? I want to show you my own product before and after. And she - she said OK, and she walked down the hall with me. And I went in the stall, and I had on my cream pants - that were the reason I invented this - without Spanx on. And then I went in the stall and put Spanx on underneath and came out. And she looked at me, and she goes, wow, I get it. It's brilliant. And she said, I'm going to place an order, and I'm going to put it in seven stores and see how it goes. RAZ: Wow. BLAKELY: And I couldn't believe it. I got in the car, and I was shaking. And I called Sam from the manufacturing plant. I go, Sam, Sam, it's Sara. I need more. I just landed Neiman Marcus. He paused. There was nothing on the other end of the phone for what seemed like a minute ago. I go, Sam, are you there? He goes, Sara, don't take this the wrong way, but I thought you were going to give these away as Christmas gifts or something for the next, like, five years. What do you mean Neiman Marcus just took it? I'm like, Neiman Marcus just took it, and I need more. RAZ: OK, so you are in Neiman Marcus. Are you thinking, all right, I've made it? BLAKELY: Oh, my gosh. That is the biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make. That is when the work begins. First of all, I paid people - basically friends - to go buy the product and create a buzz about it because I was like, you know, I got to have these things move off the shelf or the buyer's not going to give me any - any more chance. RAZ: Wait, you paid people to buy them? BLAKELY: Yes. I called every friend I had in all the seven cities that Neiman sent the Spanx to and called friends that I hadn't even spoken to since fourth grade. And, you know, kind of like, hi, it's Sara. Remember me from fourth grade? Do you mind going to the store and buying Spanx, and I'll send you a check? RAZ: Wow. BLAKELY: And it was really tough because I was one item in a - in a department and a new brand. And I didn't even get a whole row in the hosiery department. I got a pocket (laughter). So I needed to do whatever I could to maximize this chance. And I went to the stores, and I would explain what the product was. I would demo it. I'd show the before and after picture that my friend took. And then I would stand in the store from 9:00, when they opened, until about 5:00 or 6:00 every day. RAZ: So you're basically doing everything. BLAKELY: Yeah. And I realized that one of the biggest challenges I had was that where my product was being sold in the store was an issue. It was being sold in the hosiery department, and my customer was in the shoe department. And she was in the ready-to-wear department. And so I started realizing, I got - I have a challenge. I've got to get my product out of the department it's supposed to be sold in. RAZ: So how'd you - how'd you do that? BLAKELY: Well, I went to Target, and I bought stands, you know, for envelopes. And I ran around the store and put them at every cash register. And everybody thought somebody else approved it, so they kept them there for a while. RAZ: You were in, like, Neiman Marcus moving your, like, piles of Spanx, like, next to the cash register? And they just assumed that was, like, some higher-up. . . BLAKELY: Approved, yes. RAZ: . . . Said do that. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: So other than that, how were you letting people know about what you wereBLAKELY: It was a lot of - a lot of hard work for me to get the word out. I mean, I've never advertised. Spanx is 15 years old, and we've never done any formal ad campaign or anything. And so it's a very word-of-mouth brand. RAZ: I mean, you had no money. You had to get the word out. And you did things like - I read you sent it to Oprah. BLAKELY: Yeah, I did. I sent it to Oprah with a note. And turns out she ended up picking it as her favorite product of the year. RAZ: How did she even find it in the piles of mail she gets? BLAKELY: Well I found out that Andre, her hairdresser, got them and put them in her dressing room. And she tried them and put them on and has basically worn them every day since. RAZ: Wow. So when - after she, like, picked - picked up on them, did it just, like - did the orders start, like, flying out the door? BLAKELY: I was shipping pantyhose to women - or the Spanx - all across the world, basically, from my apartment. So that's an enormous opportunity. And then another thing - I made a decision that was really you, know unconventional at the time. I decided to go on QVC. RAZ: The TV channel, the shopping channel. BLAKELY: Yeah. And had a lot of people say, Sara, your brand is at Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. You can't also sell on QVC. You'll kill your brand. And I just - I just said, guys, I'm going to be the one on QVC, and I'm going to control the message. And it's going to give me an opportunity to explain what this is. And, you know, I felt confident in that. And they gave me five minutes of air time, and I sold 8,000 pair of Spanx in five minutes. And that was after, you know, a year of standing in department stores across the country. And on a really good day, I'd sell between, you know, 35 to 70 pair in a day. RAZ: And sales must have been - must have, like, kept going up because I read that, like, by the end of your second year, you made, like - the company made, like, $10 million. BLAKELY: Yeah. RAZ: So did that feel - I don't know. Did it almost feel like it was too much too fast? BLAKELY: It was great (laughter). It was great. I never was doing it for the money, you know, so I wasn't really ever that focused on it. I mean, I can even remember, after a couple of years of Spanx, I was still in my apartment. And my accountant kept trying to convince me to buy a house. I was like, I don't - I'm not interested. And my little brother was always calling and telling me different ways to spend my money. And I just - it was really just for the art of it. Like, I loved - I loved being able to pay my own rent and stand on my own two feet as a woman. That was a really important thing for myself. But it was really just I love making the product. RAZ: Did you have - like, early on, did you have people coming to you saying, listen, you've got to scale up fast, you're going to need money, let me invest in this company, and let me help you figure this out? BLAKELY: Yeah, I did. I had all kinds of things coming at me in the beginning - and still do, you know, 15 years later. But I remember one of the most interesting was, within the first six months, I started having several people come up to me and say, what's your exit strategy? RAZ: Huh. BLAKELY: And I had no idea what they were talking about because I've never taken a business class. And it dawned on me that people actually start things just to sell them. RAZ: And you still own 100 percent of this company. BLAKELY: Yes. RAZ: Did you ever think the company would fail in its first few years? BLAKELY: No. I was always nervous, but I was always so connected to the product. I mean, I was so - I was so creating this before it happened while selling fax machines door to door. I was - I was thinking about it. I was writing about it. I was visualizing it. I was preparing for it. I thought, you know, I don't have the most money. I don't have a business degree. I have no idea what I'm doing. . . RAZ: Yeah. BLAKELY: . . . In manufacturing or retail or any of this. But I do care the most, so let's see what happens. RAZ: When you see these - these things, when you see things like, you know, Sara Blakely - self-made billionaire - is that weird when you see that, when you - when you see that number, that word? BLAKELY: (Laughter). Yes, it's very weird. It reminds me of - in middle school, there used to be these things in the malls where you could go in and pick the magazine cover you wanted to be on. You know, like, your friends - and we'd all go in the booth. And we'd smile, and then we'd be on the cover of Vogue or whatever. It's just - it feels very surreal to me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx. Fifteen years on, the company has continued to grow and has yet to go public.

And I just knew it was my one shot, so I said, you know what, Diane? Will you come with me to the bathroom? She goes, excuse me? I go, I know, I know; it's a little weird. Will you just please come with me to the bathroom. I want to show you my own product before and after. And she - she said OK. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GUY RAZ, HOST:  From NPR, it's HOW I BUILT THIS, a show about innovators, entrepreneurs, idealists and the stories behind the movements they built. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: I'm Guy Raz, and on today's show, the story of how Sara Blakely designed a new kind of underwear, called it Spanx and eventually became the youngest female billionaire in America. So when Sara Blakely was growing up in Florida, she didn't exactly dream of designing ladies undergarments. She actually wanted to be a lawyer. But when she took her LSATs, she failed twice. So after college, she got a job at Disney World as a ride reader. And then, in the early '90s, she got another job. It was selling fax machines door to door. By the way, did you ever feel, like, demoralized with all the - with all the rejection and just people sort of saying, you know, no soliciting; please get out of here? Were you - was it, like, water off the duck's back? BLAKELY: Oh, my gosh, no. I would feel very defeated. And many times I would get in my car and drive around the block multiple times, you know, just trying to convince myself to walk through the door. And sometimes I'd walk through the door, and they were small offices where the whole office would turn and look at me at the same time, you know? And sometimes I would completely lose my nerve and just say, oh, sorry, I'm in the wrong place, and turn around and walk out. So I stumbled my way through it, believe me. And I know this sounds crazy, but when I was selling fax machines door to door, I kept feeling like I'm in the wrong movie. You know, like, where's the director? Where's the - where's the producer? This is not my movie. And I was really determined to create a better life for myself. RAZ: So how did working there, like, help you discover what it was you were supposed to be doing? BLAKELY: That was when I first started wearing hosiery daily. And I realized and figured out what the control-top portion of the hosiery was doing for me in my clothes. It was really making my clothes fit so much better. But I had spent money on a pair of cream pants. I spent $98 dollars on them, which, for me, was a lot of money. And they just hung in my closet unworn because every time I would go to wear them, you could see the undergarment. Regular underwear left a panty line. The thong wasn't a great solution. It also left marks that you could see. And then, the shape wear was so - it was like the girdles were so thick and overdone. And I saw an opportunity for something right in the middle that would just create the perfect canvas undergarment for women. RAZ: And I guess I should say, for people who have never worn Spanx, it's just - like, this is an undergarment made out of an elastic material that basically tightens and then smooths everything around your butt and thighs. BLAKELY: Yes. And so when I cut the feet out of my own control-top pantyhose so I could wear those cream pants, the light bulb went off, and then I started pursuing the idea. RAZ: Like, how do you then start to build a business? Like, did you have any money? Did you have access to capital? Did you have wealthy friends or family? BLAKELY: I had set aside $5,000 in savings from selling fax machines door to door, and that's what I started Spanx with. And so the first thing I did was started to research if the idea existed. And I went to the Georgia Tech library in Atlanta every night after work for a week and a half researching every pantyhose patent that ever existed. And then, probably on the seventh or 10th day of me being in there, some guy came up to me and goes, you know there's a website called uspto. gov? And I said, no, what is that? I scribbled it down in my notebook. He's like, you can search - you know, put in a patent and it'll search for you. So that website became one of my best friends. And once I determined that there wasn't anything that existed in a patent form, I then wanted to see if there was any market appetite for it beyond myself. So I literally went and asked one person. I went to the Neiman Marcus down the street from my apartment, went in and asked the sales associate if she thought anybody would ever want something like footless pantyhose to wear underpants. And her face lit up, and she goes, yes. In fact, I have lots of customers who've been making their own homemade version of that because there's no right undergarment to wear under a lot of their clothes. And so that was my whole focus group, Guy. I was like, that's it. OK, there's a market demand (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Had you ever sewn anything in your life? Like, were you - did you have a background in design? BLAKELY: No. RAZ: Did you know how to, like, manufacture stuff? BLAKELY: No. RAZ: What did you do? How did you even start to think - figure out, like, what material you needed to use? BLAKELY: I've never sewn. I have never taken a business class in my life. I didn't have anybody in the industry or even know anybody that worked in fashion or retail. And so what happened when I came up with the idea is I just started taking other pantyhose, and then I went to Hancock Fabrics down the street and all these different arts-and-crafts stores and started trying to paper clip different pieces of elastic to the bottom and different pieces of lace. And, you know, obviously I didn't get very far. And my idea actually needed to be made on a machine. And that's why I really need a manufacturer to give me the time of day to see if I could even make the prototype. RAZ: And in the meantime, you were - you were still selling fax machines, right? BLAKELY: Yeah, because I needed the money coming in and the health insurance and all - all that comes with that. So I was working on my idea at night and on the weekends. And when I kept calling all the manufacturers that I found that were mostly in North Carolina on the phone and not getting anywhere - I mean, no one would take my call, or they didn't - you know, I just learned from my cold-calling days you got to be there in person. So I took a week off of work and drove to North Carolina and just started cold calling manufacturing plants. RAZ: So you just showed up and said, like, make me a prototype? BLAKELY: Yes. So I walked in the door just cold and just said, hi, I'm here to meet - see the owner. And they're like, and you are? They always ask me the same three questions. They'd say, and you are? And I'd say, Sara Blakely. And they'd say, and you're with? I'd say, Sara Blakely. And you're financially backed by? And I'd be like, Sara Blakely. And so you can imagine how that meeting went. You know, most of them were like, have a nice day; it's great to meet you, you know? RAZ: Were they just not interested in the idea at all? BLAKELY: Well, yeah, the manufacturing plants didn't get it at all. And I found it very interesting that all I was meeting with were men. And then it kind of became clear to me why they'd probably been so uncomfortable for so long - because the people that were making them weren't spending all day in them, you know? And so - and if they were, they were not admitting it. So I had a hard time explaining why this product was so important, and they couldn't wrap their mind around. I was basically coming in and disrupting. An entire industry had been looking at something in one way, and they were on a decline year after year. But they were making hosiery to be seen on the leg. And I knocked on their door and said, guys, I just want your hosiery material, and I don't need it to be seen anywhere. It's actually going to be hidden under clothes. It's a new type of undergarment. RAZ: So how did you convince a manufacturer to take you on to make the prototype? BLAKELY: Well, it took a few visits to North Carolina and a lot of, really, persistence. They all sent me away at first. And a couple weeks after I left one manufacturer - Highland mills in Charlotte, N. C. - the owner called me. And he said, Sara, it's Sam. I've decided to help make your crazy idea. And I just paused, and, I mean, I was about to jump out of my chair. And I said, really? Why? Why the change of heart, Sam? And all he said is, I have three daughters. And so later, I found out when I got the chance to do it that he had run the idea by his three daughters over dinner. And they said, Dad, this is actually a really good idea. We think you should give this girl a shot. And he still didn't understand it or think it was a good idea, but he said that my enthusiasm and my - my confidence in how good this idea was going to be stuck with him. RAZ: Did anybody know about what you were doing? BLAKELY: No. So when I came up with the idea, I kept it a secret for one year. I did share my idea with people like manufacturers or lawyers or people that I thought could help me bring my product to life, but I was very careful. Right away, it was just a gut feeling I had to keep it to myself because I believe that ideas are the most vulnerable in their infancy. And it's instinct to turn to your right or left in that moment and tell a friend or tell your husband. RAZ: Yeah, yeah. BLAKELY: And, you know, when you do that, instantly ego's invited into the mix. And then you end up spending all your time defending it, explaining it and not pursuing it. So I needed to be at the place where I knew I wouldn't turn back no matter what I heard. I had invested enough of my time and I had enough sweat equity into the idea that I told people. And the things I heard were, you know, well, honey, if it's such a good idea, why hasn't somebody else already done it? RAZ: Yeah. BLAKELY: And, well, if it is a good idea, Sara, you know, you're going to spend your savings on this, and then in six months the big guys will just knock you out of the water. And that was all coming from a place of love. But I feel like if I had heard that the night that I cut the feet out of my pantyhose, I'd probably still be selling fax machines. RAZ: So once you started to come up with something that you felt was really special, like, unique, remarkable, did you - did you begin the process of getting it patented? BLAKELY: I did. So I went to three different law firms. I couldn't find a single female patent attorney in the state of Georgia. And I even called the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, and they said there isn't one. So I thought, OK, well, I'm going to do my best to explain this to three men. Let's see what happens. And, you know, they were very nice. They were not super impressed, probably, with the idea. And they - they all quoted me between $3,000 and $5,000 to patent it. So I decided to write it myself. And I went to Barnes & Noble on Peachtree in Atlanta and bought a book called \"Patents And Trademarks,\" and I wrote the patent. And then my mom's an artist, and so I asked her if she would sketch me in the prototype for the patent. And that is the picture in the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. I went back to the one lawyer who gave me a little bit more time of day than the other ones. And I said, listen, Dan. I have written my own patent. I have done all of the work except for the claims. That is the part that I am not trained for. I don't understand how to do that. Please, I need your expertise. Is there any chance you would do it for a discounted price? And he was blown away. He goes, you've written basically the entire patent. Yes, for $750 I'll do it over a weekend, and I'll write the claims portion of your patent. RAZ: So you - so then you got the patent. BLAKELY: Yes, but, you know, there was a moment in this journey that was quite funny. I - when we were in the final stages of the claims, the lawyer said, Sara, there is - I need to know what's technically in the garment from a fiber and yarn level. And I said, OK, there's only one person to call on that, and that's Ted. And Ted had become my friend in the back of a manufacturing plant in North Carolina. And Ted had the most thick Southern accent you've ever heard in your life. I mean, it was intense. And so I called Ted on the phone. I said, Ted, my lawyer's on the phone, and we're trying to finalize the patent. Can you tell me exactly what's in the garment? He's like, yeah. They're 70 percent nylon and 30 percent lacquer. (LAUGHTER) BLAKELY: And I said, OK, great. So my lawyer and I are writing. And I go, thanks, Ted. And I'm up all night, Guy, the night before I submit my patent to the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. And I'm thinking, how is there lacquer in this product? Like, how is that possible? So I called Ted the next morning, and I said, Ted, it's Sara. Will you - will you spell lacquer for me? And he's like, yeah - L-Y-C-R-A. (LAUGHTER) BLAKELY: I went, oh my God, it's Lycra. OK, OK, OK, thanks. So I call my lawyer. I'm like, do an all-change on lacquer. It's Lycra. And he laughed so hard. He goes, do you know how fast you would have gotten a patent, Sara, on trying to make pantyhose out of paint thinner? I'm like, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Coming up - how Sara got Spanx into the department stores and into the closets of many women you may know. Stay with us.

So at this point in our story, Sara Blakely has designed a new kind of shapewear, and then she wanted to get it out into the market. But first, she had to come up with a name. BLAKELY: So the name was a journey. Since the time I cut the feet out of my pantyhose till the time I launched it in stores was two years. And I had been writing names on scrap pieces of paper everywhere I was, you know, and most of the names were on the back of rental car agreements because I had great thinking in cars. And I wasn't getting anywhere with that. I didn't like any of the names, and I knew it wasn't right. And then I sort of narrowed down my thinking at one point in time and thought, Kodak and Coca-Cola are the two most recognized names in the world. What do they have in common? And they both had a strong K sound to them. And I had friends that were stand-up comedians, and I knew that the K sound makes your audience laugh. So I just put all that. . . RAZ: I wonder why that is. BLAKELY: I know. I don't know, but it's a - it's a known trade secret among comedians. And so I thought, you know what? I need to have my invention have the K sound in it for good luck. And almost as soon as I narrowed my thinking down that way, the word spanks came to me while I was in my car. I saw the word across - like, in my mind - across the dashboard of my car. And I pulled off to the side of the road and I thought, that's it. And I went home that night. I didn't tell anybody. And I wrote down S-P-A-N-K-S. And I went on uspto. gov, and I typed it in. And I sat there and stared at it for a while. And at the last minute, I backspaced and deleted the K and the S and put in an X. I had read that made up words do better for products than real words do and they're easier to trademark. And even though it didn't actually have the K in it, it had still the K sound, and so I felt great about it. And the name was just right. It's just my product was all about the rear end, and it's about making the rear end look better and no panty lines. And so the word Spanx was kind of naughty and kind of funny and a little bit risky. And it just all worked, and I hit send. And I think it was $150 with my credit card. And then, a couple months later, I got back an official certificate from the government saying that I was the proud owner of the word Spanx. RAZ: OK so you've got a manufacturer, a patent and a name. How did you - how did you start selling it? BLAKELY: My very first account that I called on was Neiman Marcus. RAZ: How did you even get in there? BLAKELY: I called them. Guy, I just called them. I went in the yellow pages, and I looked up the Neiman Marcus number in Atlanta. And I said, hi, I'm Sara. I invented a product; can I come and show it to you? And the lady laughed and goes, ma'am, we have a buying office, and it's in Dallas. I said, oh, well, what's their number? So she gave me their number, and I started calling them. And I just kept calling and trying to get to the hosiery buyer. And I called for days at different times. And she answered the phone, and I took my shot. And I said, hey, hi, I'm Sara Blakely, and I invented a product that is going to change the way your customers wear clothes. And if you give me a few minutes of your time, I'll fly to Dallas and show you. RAZ: And what'd she say? BLAKELY: She said, well, if you're willing to fly here, I'll give you ten minutes of my time. And I said, great. And I jumped on a plane, and I flew to Dallas. And I was in the meeting with her, and she was this beautiful woman, impeccably dressed. I'm at the Neiman Marcus headquarters. I have a Ziploc bag from my kitchen with a prototype in it, a color copy of the packaging that I had created on my friend's computer and my lucky red backpack from college that all of my friends begged me not to bring (laughter). They said, Sara, you cannot go to the Neiman Marcus headquarters with that red Eastpak old, dingy backpack. I said, yes, it's my good luck charm. I have to. And they were really pleading with me. RAZ: So what happened? BLAKELY: In the middle of my meeting with her, I could tell I was losing her. And I just knew it was my one shot. So I said, you know what, Diane? Will you come with me to the bathroom? And she just paused. She goes, excuse me? I go, I know, I know, it's little weird. Will you just please come with me to the bathroom? I want to show you my own product before and after. And she - she said OK, and she walked down the hall with me. And I went in the stall, and I had on my cream pants - that were the reason I invented this - without Spanx on. And then I went in the stall and put Spanx on underneath and came out. And she looked at me, and she goes, wow, I get it. It's brilliant. And she said, I'm going to place an order, and I'm going to put it in seven stores and see how it goes. RAZ: Wow. BLAKELY: And I couldn't believe it. I got in the car, and I was shaking. And I called Sam from the manufacturing plant. I go, Sam, Sam, it's Sara. I need more. I just landed Neiman Marcus. He paused. There was nothing on the other end of the phone for what seemed like a minute ago. I go, Sam, are you there? He goes, Sara, don't take this the wrong way, but I thought you were going to give these away as Christmas gifts or something for the next, like, five years. What do you mean Neiman Marcus just took it? I'm like, Neiman Marcus just took it, and I need more. RAZ: OK, so you are in Neiman Marcus. Are you thinking, all right, I've made it? BLAKELY: Oh, my gosh. That is the biggest mistake that entrepreneurs make. That is when the work begins. First of all, I paid people - basically friends - to go buy the product and create a buzz about it because I was like, you know, I got to have these things move off the shelf or the buyer's not going to give me any - any more chance. RAZ: Wait, you paid people to buy them? BLAKELY: Yes. I called every friend I had in all the seven cities that Neiman sent the Spanx to and called friends that I hadn't even spoken to since fourth grade. And, you know, kind of like, hi, it's Sara. Remember me from fourth grade? Do you mind going to the store and buying Spanx, and I'll send you a check? RAZ: Wow. BLAKELY: And it was really tough because I was one item in a - in a department and a new brand. And I didn't even get a whole row in the hosiery department. I got a pocket (laughter). So I needed to do whatever I could to maximize this chance. And I went to the stores, and I would explain what the product was. I would demo it. I'd show the before and after picture that my friend took. And then I would stand in the store from 9:00, when they opened, until about 5:00 or 6:00 every day. RAZ: So you're basically doing everything. BLAKELY: Yeah. And I realized that one of the biggest challenges I had was that where my product was being sold in the store was an issue. It was being sold in the hosiery department, and my customer was in the shoe department. And she was in the ready-to-wear department. And so I started realizing, I got - I have a challenge. I've got to get my product out of the department it's supposed to be sold in. RAZ: So how'd you - how'd you do that? BLAKELY: Well, I went to Target, and I bought stands, you know, for envelopes. And I ran around the store and put them at every cash register. And everybody thought somebody else approved it, so they kept them there for a while. RAZ: You were in, like, Neiman Marcus moving your, like, piles of Spanx, like, next to the cash register? And they just assumed that was, like, some higher-up. . . BLAKELY: Approved, yes. RAZ: . . . Said do that. (LAUGHTER) RAZ: So other than that, how were you letting people know about what you were BLAKELY: It was a lot of - a lot of hard work for me to get the word out. I mean, I've never advertised. Spanx is 15 years old, and we've never done any formal ad campaign or anything. And so it's a very word-of-mouth brand. RAZ: I mean, you had no money. You had to get the word out. And you did things like - I read you sent it to Oprah. BLAKELY: Yeah, I did. I sent it to Oprah with a note. And turns out she ended up picking it as her favorite product of the year. RAZ: How did she even find it in the piles of mail she gets? BLAKELY: Well I found out that Andre, her hairdresser, got them and put them in her dressing room. And she tried them and put them on and has basically worn them every day since. RAZ: Wow. So when - after she, like, picked - picked up on them, did it just, like - did the orders start, like, flying out the door? BLAKELY: I was shipping pantyhose to women - or the Spanx - all across the world, basically, from my apartment. So that's an enormous opportunity. And then another thing - I made a decision that was really you, know unconventional at the time. I decided to go on QVC. RAZ: The TV channel, the shopping channel. BLAKELY: Yeah. And had a lot of people say, Sara, your brand is at Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus. You can't also sell on QVC. You'll kill your brand. And I just - I just said, guys, I'm going to be the one on QVC, and I'm going to control the message. And it's going to give me an opportunity to explain what this is. And, you know, I felt confident in that. And they gave me five minutes of air time, and I sold 8,000 pair of Spanx in five minutes. And that was after, you know, a year of standing in department stores across the country. And on a really good day, I'd sell between, you know, 35 to 70 pair in a day. RAZ: And sales must have been - must have, like, kept going up because I read that, like, by the end of your second year, you made, like - the company made, like, $10 million. BLAKELY: Yeah. RAZ: So did that feel - I don't know. Did it almost feel like it was too much too fast? BLAKELY: It was great (laughter). It was great. I never was doing it for the money, you know, so I wasn't really ever that focused on it. I mean, I can even remember, after a couple of years of Spanx, I was still in my apartment. And my accountant kept trying to convince me to buy a house. I was like, I don't - I'm not interested. And my little brother was always calling and telling me different ways to spend my money. And I just - it was really just for the art of it. Like, I loved - I loved being able to pay my own rent and stand on my own two feet as a woman. That was a really important thing for myself. But it was really just I love making the product. RAZ: Did you have - like, early on, did you have people coming to you saying, listen, you've got to scale up fast, you're going to need money, let me invest in this company, and let me help you figure this out? BLAKELY: Yeah, I did. I had all kinds of things coming at me in the beginning - and still do, you know, 15 years later. But I remember one of the most interesting was, within the first six months, I started having several people come up to me and say, what's your exit strategy? RAZ: Huh. BLAKELY: And I had no idea what they were talking about because I've never taken a business class. And it dawned on me that people actually start things just to sell them. RAZ: And you still own 100 percent of this company. BLAKELY: Yes. RAZ: Did you ever think the company would fail in its first few years? BLAKELY: No. I was always nervous, but I was always so connected to the product. I mean, I was so - I was so creating this before it happened while selling fax machines door to door. I was - I was thinking about it. I was writing about it. I was visualizing it. I was preparing for it. I thought, you know, I don't have the most money. I don't have a business degree. I have no idea what I'm doing. . . RAZ: Yeah. BLAKELY: . . . In manufacturing or retail or any of this. But I do care the most, so let's see what happens. RAZ: When you see these - these things, when you see things like, you know, Sara Blakely - self-made billionaire - is that weird when you see that, when you - when you see that number, that word? BLAKELY: (Laughter). Yes, it's very weird. It reminds me of - in middle school, there used to be these things in the malls where you could go in and pick the magazine cover you wanted to be on. You know, like, your friends - and we'd all go in the booth. And we'd smile, and then we'd be on the cover of Vogue or whatever. It's just - it feels very surreal to me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: That's Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx. Fifteen years on, the company has continued to grow and has yet to go public.

Its annual report on income and poverty shows a sharp improvement in the finances of the typical American household. In fact the increase in median household incomes is one of the largest in nearly 50 years, and there was a big decline in the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Robert Greenstein, one of Washington's best-known economic policy wonks, says this report is the best annual income and poverty report he's seen in decades. ROBERT GREENSTEIN: This is an excellent report. There's no other way to put it. The three key indicators of well-being - income, poverty health insurance - all moved decisively in the right direction. YDSTIE: After years of no significant gains, the Census Bureau says that in 2015 the income for the median household rose almost $2,800. That's a 5. 2 percent increase for the household right in the middle of the income ladder, putting its annual income at about $56,500. That's by far the best increase since the Great Recession. And Trudi Renwick, an economic specialist at the Census Bureau, told reporters in a telephone news conference the gain is broad-based. TRUDI RENWICK: It's up in all four regions. It's up for almost every racial group, and it's one of the largest year-to-year increases in median household income that we've ever had. YDSTIE: The increase in incomes helped drive the poverty rate down more than a full percentage point in 2015. Greenstein, who is president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, says government policies, like an increase in the minimum wage in a number of cities and states, helped boost incomes, but. . . GREENSTIEN: The single-biggest driver on the income and poverty side is more jobs, broader employment, tighter labor market that also pushes up wages. And on the health insurance side, the critical factor is the coverage expansions of the Affordable Care Act. YDSTIE: In 2015 the number of people without health insurance dropped to 29 million, down from 33 million in 2014. Robert Doar, a fellow in poverty studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, also welcomed the report. ROBERT DOAR: I think it's a good start. It's been a long wait. There are significant declines in poverty and significant increases in median income, which is good news. YDSTIE: But Doar says the poverty rate remains elevated. DOAR: It's still a full percentage point above what it was prior to the recession, so I think we could do still better. YDSTIE: Median household incomes are also around $1,500 below levels reached in the late 1990s, says Robert Greenstein. GREENSTIEN: We're still not back to where we were before the Great Recession hit. We need further progress. YDSTIE: Greenstein believes one key to progress is for the Fed to continue to encourage growth by holding off raising interest rates. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Americans, broadly speaking, got a raise in 2015. The median household income grew more than it has in 15 years. That reversed years of stagnation and decline for the middle class. NPR's Pam Fessler has more. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Ever since the economy began to recover seven years ago, the Census Bureau has reported little change and even some declines in household income and not much change in poverty. But this latest report was different. SHELDON DANZIGER: I was pleasantly shocked. FESSLER: Sheldon Danziger is president of the Russell Sage Foundation and a longtime poverty expert. He called the new census numbers remarkable. DANZIGER: It looked to me like good news across the board, poverty falling for children as well as adults, family incomes rising for black and Hispanic households as well as white households. FESSLER: And the increases were striking. Last year, the median household income was $56,500 - 5 percent higher than it was in 2014. Still, household incomes were lower than they were before the recession, and the poverty rate was still higher. Last year, 43 million Americans were poor. Robert Doar with the American Enterprise Institute called the 13. 5 percent poverty rate a good start. ROBERT DOAR: It's still a full percentage point above what it was prior to the recession. And it's a long way from where we were in 2000. So I think we're doing better, but I think we could do still better. FESSLER: What everyone does seem to agree is that incomes are up and poverty's down because more people have full-time, year-round work and their earnings are higher. Valerie Wilson of the Economic Policy Institute says this has been especially notable for African-Americans who have seen some of the biggest gains in the labor force. VALERIE WILSON: The caveat with that is even though we've seen greater improvement, the black unemployment rate is still double the white unemployment rate, is still higher than all other groups. FESSLER: And poverty among African-Americans and Hispanics while down is still more than twice what it is for whites, and that goes for children as well. Almost one-third of all black children in the U. S. were living in poverty last year, according to the census. But Wilson says at least that's better than it was the year before.

And it has been celebrated in song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LOW BRIDGE\")BILLY MURRAY: I've got an old mule, and her name is Sal - 15 years on the Erie Canal. GREENE: That was a 1912 recording of that famous song about the Erie Canal. The waterway in upstate New York is turning 200 next year. And some are asking whether it's still worth subsidizing. Here's NPR's Hansi Lo Wang. (SOUNDBITE OF BLOWING HORN)HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Go up the Hudson River, and you'll see there's still pushing and pulling barges through the Erie Canal. (SOUNDBITE OF ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER)WANG: Deckhands here in the port of Albany are prepping this barge not for lumber, coal or hay but for three electrical transformers headed to a power plant. They're pushed along the water by a tugboat named Margot. Her captain on this day is Mark Smith. And their first stop on the canal is just north of Albany. MARK SMITH: This goes all the way to Buffalo if you keep going west. WANG: When the canal was first completed in 1825, it shortened what would have been a two-week trip by wagon to just five days. By today's standards, though, it's a slow and steady ride. UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR: Erie Lock 2. SMITH: Yeah, good evening. We're headed your way westbound. WANG: Captain Smith radios Erie Canal Lock 2 so an operator can get ready to lift the Margot and her barge like a water elevator. It's the kind of thing that Smith says locals didn't used to pay much attention to. SMITH: The canal used to be very busy. They probably didn't look twice at a tugboat with a fuel barge. Nobody thought anything of it. Now it's kind of a novelty. MAUREEN BUECHNER: It was really neat to see it happen again. WANG: Maureen Buechner watched along the banks of the canal with her grandson sitting in a stroller as the Margot glided through the canal lock in Waterford, N. Y. BUECHNER: That's how everything traveled. Now you have trucks, trains. This is an old way of life. WANG: But the Margot's owners aren't ready to rule it out yet. Rob Goldman is one of the founders of the New York State Marine Highway Transportation Company. And he says his business is growing with steady work towing barges of stone and, sometimes, oversized cargo like fighter planes. ROB GOLDMAN: Let's face it. A barge can't deliver to your front door. A truck can. But if we work with the trucks, and we work with the rail, we could each be as efficient as possible and use as little fuel as possible because we're efficient. WANG: Efficiency, though, is probably not the priority for most of the people who use the canal. (SOUNDBITE OF BELL RINGING)WANG: Lil' Utopia passing us by. ART COHN: That's right. Little pleasure boat - but high-enough profile to need the bridge lifted. WANG: That was Art Cohn, resting outside of Rochester in Fairport, N. Y. He's a co-founder of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. And he toured the canal this summer on the museum's tugboat at about 5 miles per hour. COHN: That's a really interesting way to see the world. Normally, if I'm home, I'm driving, you know, highway speeds. And if someone's moving too slow, I'm getting frustrated - not on a canal. WANG: Recreational boats are driving most of the canal's revenue today. But tolls and permits for all of New York's canals only bring in just over a million dollars every year. It takes about $55 million annually to maintain the canal system. So who was making up most of the difference? Drivers on the New York State Thruway. How much is the toll? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Just 20 cents. WANG: Twenty cents. But the trucking industry sued the state for using highway tolls and won. By the time the judge ruled, the canals were already transferred to another agency, the New York Power Authority. It's using revenues from its hydropower plants to fund the canals now. Still, some residents, like Joe Shaw of Manlius, see the canals as a financial drain. JOE SHAW: If it can't stand on its own two legs and make money, then we need to understand that. WANG: But others, like Debbie Cummings of Syracuse, are proud of the canal's longevity and see potential for growth. DEBBIE CUMMINGS: You think of all the labor that went into digging this huge ditch from Albany to Buffalo. And it's still here. WANG: And it's protected by New York state Constitution.

But when there was something that I needed to do, it was like a door in my brain would drop. And it wouldn't allow me to process any of the information. GREENE: That is Eileen Kushner. Growing up in Detroit in the 1950s, she had trouble with reading and simple math. She married her husband Larry right out of high school, had three kids and hoped that as a stay-at-home mom, she could hide her learning problems. But things did not work out that way. E KUSHNER: Raising the kids - we had no extra spending money. LARRY KUSHNER: Sometimes, for food, it got pretty tough. And I said, how about going to talk to Carl (ph) at the McDonald's? Maybe he could hire you. E KUSHNER: And I said Carl, I'd like to make French fries and make your shakes for you. I'll be the best employee. And he said, you're hired. I remember coming home. And I was so excited, dancing around. I got a job. L KUSHNER: Those days - there were no computers. If a customer wanted a hamburger, dry and a coke, you manually had to add it up. E KUSHNER: Exactly. I had done such a good job. And I was starting to feel really good about myself until one day, Carl leaded me over to the counter and said, Eileen, this is your next responsibility. And in my mind, I knew that I wasn't able to add. I thought I was going to die. I went home that night crying my eyes out to you and saying, I'm going to quit, Larry, because I don't want them to know that I don't know how to count the money back. And you said to me, Eileen, you're going to be OK. You came home. And you brought singles, $5 bills and coins. And we started playing McDonald's. Do you remember? L KUSHNER: I sure do. E KUSHNER: I would stand on one side of the table in the kitchen. And you stood on the other. And you would pretend you were a customer. And the following day, I went back and asked if I could please have some Big Mac boxes, some fry boxes and some cups. And then every day, Larry, with your help, I learned. Larry, thank you. You opened up my world. L KUSHNER: I just opened the door for you. You took the ball and ran with it, though, after that. Do you see yourself differently today than you were 30 years ago? E KUSHNER: I learned a very valuable lesson from Edison after he invented the light bulb. This young gentleman came up to him and asked him, how did it feel to fail over 2,000 times? Edison said, I never failed once. It was a 2,000-step process. And this is what my life has been, Larry - more than 2,000 steps. But we made it. L KUSHNER: We did. E KUSHNER: We made it. GREENE: Eileen and Larry Kushner at StoryCorps in Chicago - they went on to own five McDonald's of their own. Their interview will be archived at the Library of Congress.

And I was so excited, dancing around. I got a job. L KUSHNER: Those days - there were no computers. If a customer wanted a hamburger, dry and a coke, you manually had to add it up. E KUSHNER: Exactly. I had done such a good job. And I was starting to feel really good about myself until one day, Carl leaded me over to the counter and said, Eileen, this is your next responsibility. And in my mind, I knew that I wasn't able to add. I thought I was going to die. I went home that night crying my eyes out to you and saying, I'm going to quit, Larry, because I don't want them to know that I don't know how to count the money back. And you said to me, Eileen, you're going to be OK. You came home. And you brought singles, $5 bills and coins. And we started playing McDonald's. Do you remember? L KUSHNER: I sure do. E KUSHNER: I would stand on one side of the table in the kitchen. And you stood on the other. And you would pretend you were a customer. And the following day, I went back and asked if I could please have some Big Mac boxes, some fry boxes and some cups. And then every day, Larry, with your help, I learned. Larry, thank you. You opened up my world. L KUSHNER: I just opened the door for you. You took the ball and ran with it, though, after that. Do you see yourself differently today than you were 30 years ago? E KUSHNER: I learned a very valuable lesson from Edison after he invented the light bulb. This young gentleman came up to him and asked him, how did it feel to fail over 2,000 times? Edison said, I never failed once. It was a 2,000-step process. And this is what my life has been, Larry - more than 2,000 steps. But we made it. L KUSHNER: We did. E KUSHNER: We made it.

One success story is Columbus, Ohio. The population is growing, and so are wages. The downtown is being revitalized. Housing prices are still low, and so is unemployment. Columbus has become a nearly recession-proof hub of Ohio. All this week, NPR is asking this question. How can you create economic opportunity for more Americans? It's part of our election year project with member stations called A Nation Engaged. We sent NPR's Sonari Glinton to find out if the success of Columbus can be replicated. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: There are few things more annoying than when a national media organization like NPR comes to your town and discovers it. Well, they call it Columbusing, and I'm essentially Colombusing Columbus. TARA DEFRANCISCO: (Laughter) You are. You're the Amerigo Vespucci of the world here. It's really happening. GLINTON: I met Tara DeFrancisco and her husband, Rance Rizzutto, at a coffee shop across from the state capitol. Now, they just moved from Chicago to Columbus to start an improv comedy theater. Now, since they've been touring the country, they thought did they really need to live in Chicago even if it is the epicenter of improv? They recently closed on a house here. DEFRANCISCO: I think we're saving something like $500 a month-ish (ph) on buying a home. I don't think that Rance or I expected to own a home in our lifetime - maybe buying a modest condo but not a house with a yard that has food in it. GLINTON: Now, when DeFrancisco started in improv, there wasn't an improv or sketch comedy scene here, so she had to move to Chicago. Increasingly she found herself coming back to Columbus, and she and her husband thought, well, why not stay? DEFRANCISCO: I think part of the reason we were finally compelled to move is that we didn't feel like we were losing anything. It's a very affordable cost of living. So if you can bring art to those communities, then they don't have to necessarily push out to the bigger cities. GLINTON: Can I get you to introduce yourself for me? CAMERON MITCHELL: Sure. Hi, my name is Cameron Mitchell. I'm the founder and CEO of Cameron Mitchell Restaurants located here in Columbus, Ohio. GLINTON: Mitchell has more than a dozen locations in Columbus and around the country. He and almost anyone you talk to point to the revitalization of a neighborhood called the Short North as a springboard for the new Columbus. MITCHELL: Twenty years ago, this was a Quonset hut here. You wouldn't be caught dead walking around here at night. All these buildings were all dilapidated. There were no hotels here. It was decrepit down here. It was a rundown, dead urban core. GLINTON: It was the tech boom of the '90s, and almost all of Columbus's big players - business, the university, the city - realized they were missing out. MITCHELL: Ten, 15, 20 years ago, we were stagnant here in Columbus, very stagnant, and we deserve the reputation we have. And now the reputation we have today is well-earned, and it's through the work and collaboration of a lot of great people. GLINTON: What do you think the reputation. . . MITCHELL: Smart, open, young, vibrant city. GLINTON: All right, so I headed over from the Short North south to Columbus Commons. That's where I met David Stebenne. He's a professor of law and history at the Ohio State University. Stebenne says just a few years ago Columbus was mocked as being kind of a cow town, a paper-pusher town because many of the city's white-collar jobs were from the university, state government and the insurance industry. He says that was last century. DAVID STEBENNE: In a service economy, Columbus was destined to do better, especially than Cleveland and Youngstown and other places that had a lot of sort of smokestack industry. But there's still a range of how much better. And what has startled all of Ohio and especially the folks in Cleveland and Cincinnati is how much better Columbus has done. GLINTON: Stebenne says population wise Columbus is gaining while Cleveland and Cincinnati are declining. The staples of the economy are white-collar jobs - insurance, state government, retail and the university. Stebenne points out that Columbus didn't have quite the same contentious school desegregation fight that other cities had, and Columbus also annexed a lot of land at the edge as whites began moving to the suburbs. That kept the tax base broad and the taxes low. STEBENNE: The ability of Columbus to attract and retain many of the brightest young people in Ohio is now well known around the state. GLINTON: OK, our next stop is a food truck. What would a Columbusing story about Columbus be without a food truck? It's O Hai Poke. For those unfamiliar, Poke is a sort of Hawaiian sushi. Nile Woodson is the 26-year-old founder. NILE WOODSON: All right, all right, excellent. So you're familiar with Poke. GLINTON: So I think it's hilarious that I find the black guy with the Hawaiian food truck. WOODSON: Yeah. That's it. That's the name of the game. Well, I think that comes down to the entrepreneurial drive. GLINTON: Woodson is an OSU graduate. Now, he had a choice to go home or to stay and start a business with his buddy in Columbus. WOODSON: And it was, like, go to New York where it's extremely competitive and extremely expensive. And even being from there at that point in time, I didn't have as strong of a network. But Columbus is all about support and community and networking, and it's just this awesome place. GLINTON: All right, so this is the moment where I bring out the expert who tells other cities what they could do to duplicate Columbus's success. Well, we have an expert - Enrico Moretti. He wrote a popular book called \"The New Geography Of Jobs. \" He says you can sum up much of Columbus's success with one word. ENRICO MORETTI: Serendipity. I've looked at the history of most clusters of innovation in the U. S. , and it's rarely the case - in fact I couldn't find any example - where it was the local government that decided to create an innovation cluster there. GLINTON: Moretti says Columbus is lucky - the university, the capital being in the center of the state. MORETTI: Cost of living is affordable. The skill of the labor force - it's high, and taxes tend to be generally low. The regulatory environment tend to generally be pro-business. So these are all factors that favor Columbus over other locations. GLINTON: So Columbus didn't mess it up. MORETTI: Columbus didn't mess it up. Columbus took the seed and made the best of it. GLINTON: OK, everybody, I have discovered Columbus - all right, just kidding. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

Much of the anger and anxiety in our current politics is fueled by the sense that that opportunity has dried up for many Americans. As part of our election year project with some members stations, called A Nation Engaged, we are asking a question this week. How can economic opportunity be created for more Americans? We're focusing on two Ohio cities - Springfield and Columbus. NPR's Uri Berliner takes us to Springfield. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: There are plenty of places named Springfield in the U. S. , 33 according to one government count. The Springfield in Ohio is a blue-collar city with a lot of history, pain and pride, a place with an uncertain future. KEVIN ROSE: When you look at what makes America great, what makes America, you know, not great, our ups and our downs, Springfield represents all of it. BERLINER: That's Kevin Rose, a historian with The Turner Foundation, a local philanthropy. For years now, the not so great seems to have the upper hand. Median incomes fell an astounding 27 percent in Springfield between 1999 and 2014. That's more than any metropolitan area in the country. Factory jobs disappeared, or they started paying less. And for many in town, a middle-class life is out of reach. ROSS MCGREGOR: People need to have a little bit more to be able to do the things that we need to have done on the shop floor these days. BERLINER: Ross McGregor is executive vice president of Pentaflex, which makes parts for heavy trucks. He says today's factory jobs require training, analytical skills. The unskilled work, that's what the robots are doing. When we head out to the factory floor, McGregor directs me to a machine moving parts through a stamping operation. MCGREGOR: This is a automated assembly unit. Again, this was a process that required four operators before the automation. Now only one operator needs to run it. BERLINER: For manufacturers like McGregor, those robots, all that automation and keeping a lid on labor costs is what allows them to compete with a country like Vietnam. But for workers, it's all part of what's putting the squeeze on living standards. That squeeze on blue-collar workers, the march of automation and global competition isn't just landing on Springfield. It's happening throughout the country and the industrialized world. GREGG MCGILLIVRAY: I think it would be very hard to be starting out with a family now, like I did 31 years ago. BERLINER: Gregg McGillivray has worked at Pentaflex for 31 years. He said he's made a good life in his job and in Springfield. But for younger people. . . MCGILLIVRAY: I don't think it's as good as it used to be. BERLINER: In what way? MCGILLIVRAY: I just don't think it's as easy to get by in the world today. BERLINER: There's no doubt it's harder to get by in Springfield. As it transitions away from manufacturing, the city relies more on service jobs, like in call centers or nursing homes. But they don't pay well. Some trucking distribution companies have come because Springfield is convenient to two big interstates. And incomes did tick up last year, but that doesn't get Springfield any closer to the knowledge economy of tech or finance or design. WARREN COPELAND: Quite honestly, that's a struggle. BERLINER: Warren Copeland is Springfield's mayor. COPELAND: In Ohio, every city like us is in direct competition with Columbus, which is the go-go-growth city in Ohio. They really have a lot of the well-paying paperwork jobs that are the part of the economy that's performing well. BERLINER: Springfield's population has fallen steadily over the years. Many young people go to college and leave - the brain drain. To help end that exodus, Springfield is banking on a revival of downtown. JIM KING: We're Blue Jacket Dairy. We make farmstead cheese. It's called artisan cheese, meaning, you know, artsy. BERLINER: Jim King is selling those artisanal cheeses at a farmer's market next to the downtown esplanade. It's a warm weekday evening. There's music. The vibe is friendly, exactly the kind of scene tourism and development officials dream about. SAMANTHA SOMMER: Since I've been here, there's been something like more than $300 million invested in downtown. BERLINER: Samantha Sommer is editor of the Springfield News-Sun. She's been at the paper since 2001. SOMMER: That includes a brand new hospital, a new brewery, a new ice rink, multiple renovations of old historic buildings. BERLINER: Including a Frank Lloyd Wright house that's part of the city's promotion of cultural tourism. But less than a mile from downtown is a neighborhood where no tourist would venture. CHARLES ROLLINS: We're on the corner of Selma Road and Linden Avenue in Springfield, Ohio. BERLINER: Pretty tough neighborhood. C. ROLLINS: Yeah, it's pretty bad down here. BERLINER: Charles Rollins is welcoming me to Many Pathways, an addiction recovery clubhouse. The streets here are bleak - dilapidated and abandoned buildings, guys walking around looking lost or haunted. C. ROLLINS: Definitely an increase in young, Caucasian men, you know, turning to heroin. BERLINER: Part of the opioid crisis sweeping this part of the country. MICHAEL ROLLINS: One of the things about the opiate addiction that is crippling our economies is, it is - the addiction itself takes daily maintenance. BERLINER: That's Michael Rollins, who helps his twin brother Charles run the place. Charles and Michael speak from experience. They're recovering addicts. Charles spent time in prison for trafficking cocaine. Now he's getting a degree in social work. Charles and Michael hope their paths set some kind of example. M. ROLLINS: The people come into recovery. They want to quit using drugs, and they come into recovery. And the people that we see that succeed for the longest amount of time are the people that acquire some type of gainful employment. BERLINER: Gainful employment - over and over again, I hear how it's tough to find gainful employment in Springfield but how it can change lives. Blake Drummond is 20, and a few years ago he was a high school dropout making $9 an hour in an unskilled factory job. BLAKE DRUMMOND: We were assembling Corvette manifolds. And my only job was to just push two metal rods down into the manifold. Every day, eight hours a day, two breaks and a lunch. Every day I'm putting the two rods in. I kind of felt like a robot, honestly, just standing there doing the same thing. It was - it was bad. BERLINER: After getting his GED and taking construction and building classes, Drummond now earns $21 an hour. He's supervising a crew renovating a historic building downtown. DRUMMOND: I always say, I feel like I was a carpenter in my past life because I can just pick up a tool sometimes and immediately know what it's used for, what to do with it and how to use it. BERLINER: Drummond says he'd like to stay in Springfield and help build up the city. But if opportunities dry up here, he can always pack up his tools and find work somewhere else.

BERLINER: After getting his GED and taking construction and building classes, Drummond now earns $21 an hour. He's supervising a crew renovating a historic building downtown. DRUMMOND: I always say, I feel like I was a carpenter in my past life because I can just pick up a tool sometimes and immediately know what it's used for, what to do with it and how to use it. BERLINER: Drummond says he'd like to stay in Springfield and help build up the city. But if opportunities dry up here, he can always pack up his tools and find work somewhere else.

They can also vote for new trains and buses. We have a report this morning on ballot measures from NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Think this morning's commute is bad? Well, it's likely to get worse, according to traffic projections. Take Seattle, for example. PETER ROGOFF: Congestion delays on the region's freeways increased more than 95 percent, just in the last five years. SCHAPER: Peter Rogoff is CEO of Sound Transit in the Seattle area, where he says the average commuter wasted 63 hours sitting in traffic last year. ROGOFF: And folks are very much fed up. SCHAPER: So Rogoff is pushing a plan to expand the area's transit options. Ballot Measure ST3 would increase sales and motor vehicle taxes to raise $54 billion over 25 years to build and expand light rail, commuter rail and bus rapid transit. And Seattle isn't alone in asking taxpayers for big bucks to fund transit. There are similar ballot initiatives in Atlanta, Columbus, Detroit, San Diego and even car-crazy Los Angeles, which has the nation's biggest infrastructure referendum. L. A. Transit CEO Phillip Washington says Measure M would hike the sales tax a half a percent to raise $120 billion over 40 years. PHILLIP WASHINGTON: We believe that we will settle once and for all, if you will, the transportation challenges with this measure. SCHAPER: In Atlanta, the Transit Authority is going back to voters after a referendum failed four years ago. MARTA CEO Keith Parker says public attitudes about buses and trains are changing. KEITH PARKER: Transit has really become cool. SCHAPER: Parker says many millennials now prefer transit over driving. PARKER: We are seeing public transit being used as the incentive to bring in new jobs, new investments, new opportunities and just overall improving the quality of life. SCHAPER: But not all of the ballot measure seek to fund shiny new trains and buses. GRACE CRUNICAN: Because we are 44 years old, it's time to upgrade the house. It's time to replace some things. SCHAPER: Grace Crunican heads BART in San Francisco, which is looking to raise $3. 5 billion to fix up a crumbling system. CRUNICAN: It's as unsexy a measure as I've ever seen. SCHAPER: Many transit agencies are hoping to take advantage of relatively low interest rates on municipal bonds with this year's ballot measures. And there's another reason so many are seeking local tax increases. CRUNICAN: There isn't any hope on the horizon at the federal level. Our federal funding has been flat for a very long time. And the state level has gone down a little bit. SCHAPER: Several of the ballot measures have local taxpayer opposition. Some fear they'll be boondoggles because of where the routes would go, or because of potential cost overruns. Robert Poole heads transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank. And he says those are legitimate concerns. ROBERT POOLE: People should really look hard at what is supposed to be delivered if they approve the tax, and whether those projects appear to make sense. SCHAPER: Poole says not all transit projects deliver the congestion relief they promise. But he likes the shift to local taxes over state and federal funds. That means those who want more buses and trains in their cities should get ready to pay higher local taxes in the years ahead. David Schaper, NPR News.

ANTHONY BROOKS, BYLINE: South Boston's waterfront is the heart of the city's Innovation District, the home to biotech and financial services companies, and proliferating steel and glass office towers and luxury condominiums. The U. S. Chamber of Commerce ranks Boston as the American city best positioned to lead the shift to a digital economy thanks to this innovation boom. JAMES ROONEY: So I think it's a significant moment. . . BROOKS: Jim Rooney is president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. ROONEY: . . . That says to anyone who's thinking about where they either want to do their startup, locate their company, that Boston now is the place to be. BROOKS: But J'Neen Skinner and her husband represent another side of this economy. Not long ago, Skinner, who is African-American, and her husband, who's the son of Haitian immigrants, were both unemployed and counted on food stamps, cash assistance and public housing. Things are better now. They both have jobs at a non-profit in Boston. J'NEEN SKINNER: Currently, we're looking to buy a home. And it is quite a struggle across the board. BROOKS: It's a struggle because Boston has some of the highest housing prices in the country, and because when times were tough, J'Neen Skinner and her husband relied on credit cards to pay their bills and fell behind. Skinner also has more than $30,000 in student loans. So their credit score is too low to qualify for a mortgage. SKINNER: We weren't educated on the importance of having a higher credit score. So we are diligently working on, you know, paying off past due balances. BROOKS: And so that's a snapshot of Boston's divided economy. The city's Innovation District, building enormous wealth for some, and J'Neen Skinner, struggling to buy a house. Ana Patricia Munoz, an assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, says it's just one story about the dramatic disparity in wealth. ANA PATRICIA MUNOZ: And when you get deeper into the data, you really realize that the racial differences and ethnic differences are immense. BROOKS: Munoz is the author of a study called \"The Color Of Wealth In Boston. \" Among the key findings, white households have a median net worth - that's the value of their assets minus their debts - of about a quarter of a million dollars. The median net worth of black households - zero. And almost 80 percent of white families own a home while just a third of black families do. Munoz says that means blacks have much less ability than whites to pass wealth onto their children, perpetuating that racial wealth gap. MUNOZ: It's really the money that's passed down from generation to generation. Whites are more likely to get help to buy a house or more likely to get help to pay for education. And so then you see the cumulative consequences reflected in that number. BROOKS: By contrast, consider the experience of Setti Warren, who inherited his home in Newton, a wealthy Boston suburb. SETTI WARREN: I think about my story and how fortunate I've been because there's no way my wife and I would be able to afford to live in that house right now if not for the intergenerational transfer of our home. BROOKS: Warren is not just a fortunate homeowner in Newton. He's the mayor, and he's African-American. But he's keenly aware of the racial wealth gap and that too few blacks are in his position. He says his father was a Korean War vet who bought the family home with the help of the GI Bill. WARREN: This idea that if you work hard, you're able to take care of yourself and you're able to ensure that your child's life will be better off than yours - that story is something that we're losing. BROOKS: The reasons for the wealth gap are many and complicated, including racially discriminatory housing and lending policies of the past. The report from the Boston Fed calls it a public policy challenge requiring immediate attention. For NPR News, I'm Anthony Brooks in Boston.

They are portraits of two cities in Ohio. One, Springfield, has been struggling economically. The other, Columbus, has been a model of prosperity - rising wages, low unemployment. And we've been asking the question this week, how can that model be repeated? What can be done to create economic opportunity for more Americans? Many people feel that is not happening quickly enough, and that's a backdrop in this presidential election. This is all part of a project with member stations we're calling A Nation Engaged. And this morning, we travel with NPR's Chris Arnold to a new school in Springfield that's trying to turn the tide in that struggling community. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: When you drive into the heart of Springfield, you see a majestic hundred-year-old high school. It was modeled after the Library of Congress, actually, and it has a big dome on top of it. It's a monument to a more prosperous time for the city. But as nearby factories shut down, household incomes plummeted and people with more resources moved away from the downtown, this beautiful old high school was closed and boarded up. DEBBIE KELLY: My mom graduated from here years ago and then other relatives. And you just have a lot of history here. ARNOLD: Debbie Kelly is a longtime public school art teacher in Springfield. KELLY: To see it in decline and not used and boarded up, it - you drive by it, and it sort of becomes a metaphor for the town. It becomes like, oh, are we just - is this where we are? Everything's just dying, and nothing good is happening. There's nothing new. ARNOLD: But a few years ago, local officials proposed reopening this school to put in a new STEM academy. That is a public school that focuses on science, technology, engineering and math. This could create a new higher-skilled workforce for local businesses, and it might attract new businesses. Some people who live outside the downtown, though, said, whoa, wait a minute. That area is blighted. It's the wrong side of the tracks. Kids won't go. Let's do this someplace else. But the naysayers lost. And today, the boards are off the windows. JOSHUA JENNINGS: This is one of our math classes. We have two teachers in one classroom, the biggest class that we have at the school. ARNOLD: Joshua Jennings is the founding director of the school. It's called the Global Impact STEM Academy. And it's drawing so many kids now that he's expanding it and having to turn students away. JENNINGS: And we've seen our school grow exponentially. And the demand for it here locally has grown incredibly, as well. ARNOLD: Inside the redesigned modern glass entryway, on the wall, there are painted faces of famous people. And when you touch them, you hear quotes that are read by the students. OK, I'm going to Albert Einstein's tongue. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: You can't use the same thinking to solve a problem that was created by that thinking. ARNOLD: And at its heart, that's what this school is trying to do. The shift in thinking here is that kids shouldn't just trudge off to math or science class when the bell rings. Instead, they're creating more of a workplace environment here, from the way that the kids dress - business casual - to the kinds of projects that they work on. The school, right now, needs a new parking lot, so in math class, that's what they're working on. LOGAN REXROTH: Yeah, let's build a parking lot. (LAUGHTER)ARNOLD: Students Logan Rexroth and Addison Keener are figuring out how to fit in more cars and still leave enough green space. ADDISON KEENER: Have we decided how we're going to angle the parking spaces? LOGAN: I think we settled on 60-degree angle. Wouldn't it be a whole lot more simple if they would just hire someone to do this for us? (LAUGHTER)ARNOLD: Addison Keener says it's her first year at the school. ADDISON: Last year, I was kind of miserable at my school. And I would be so, like, not really depressed, but upset all the time and super stressed. And here, I don't even feel like I'm coming to school every day. I feel like I'm coming to see my friends and have fun and learn some stuff. ARNOLD: But there is a big question hanging in the air here. Will these students stay local after college or move across the country or move to just nearby Columbus, which has higher paying jobs, on average? And being high school students, they, of course, want to do all kinds of things. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #2: I want to go into the agriculture field. I'm not exactly sure where. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #3: Being, like, a family doctor. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #4: I want to go into the Marine Corps. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #5: I'm looking into, like, psychology. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #6: I think I want to go in the cosmetic chemistry. ARNOLD: Over at nearby Clark State Community College, a precision agriculture tractor pulls into a lab building. This is where the students at the STEM school come to take free college classes. Clark State President Jo Alice Blondin says not all of the students will stay local, but a major mission of the STEM school is to get a good number to stay. JO ALICE BLONDIN: It is critical, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing. We have, frankly, a landslide of retirements coming in the next five years. And we are very concerned that the economy doesn't continue to shrink and that it actually goes in the very positive direction we need it to. ARNOLD: So at the STEM school, there's a lot of focus on the biggest industry in the area, agriculture. Students study plants and animal biotech, food science. They do internships, also, at local businesses to make connections. Back over at the high school, Debbie Kelly, the art teacher who was so sad when the school was boarded up - she's now teaching art classes at the STEM academy. KELLY: To take this and revive it - I think now when you drive by, it's a very exciting, happy place. I mean, I think it's just magical. ARNOLD: And it may prove to be a good omen for Springfield. Household income plunged an alarming 27 percent here between 1999 and 2014. But the latest census data shows that incomes rose at least a bit last year. And local officials say that they're excited that some new employers are moving into the area. And together with local companies, they're announcing hundreds of new jobs.

A growing number of people in Silicon Valley now look to an old idea endorsed by both Milton Friedman and Dr. Martin Luther King, a regular paycheck from the federal government, whether you work or not. KQED's Queena Kim reports. QUEENA KIM, BYLINE: When we talk about the economy, we spend a lot of time talking about jobs and wages. But what if, in the future, employers need far fewer workers? Misha Chellam has been asking this question. He's a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco. And he took me to a restaurant to show me where he thinks the economy is headed. MISHA CHELLAM: All right. So we're at Eatsa, which is a future-concept restaurant. KIM: Imagine if Apple opened a fast food joint. And that's sort of what Eatsa looks like. So where are the cashiers? CHELLAM: There are no cashiers. KIM: What? CHELLAM: That is part of the magic here. We're not going to order from anybody. We're going to order from computers. KIM: Chellam and I walk up to one of the eight or so iPads mounted to the wall. CHELLAM: If I just swipe my card - I'm in San Francisco. I feel like I need to go with kale. Oh, but I. . . KIM: A couple clicks later - and we're done. There are about 15 to 20 customers in the restaurant but only one employee. CHELLAM: I have this gut sense from having been in the Valley for a while now that there will be a coming wave of automation that's going to get rid of a lot of jobs. KIM: Chellam and I are at his office in San Francisco. And in Silicon Valley, where there are experiments in automation everywhere, you can see why techies like Chellam are concerned. There's a Lowe's hardware store with a robot that checks inventory. There's a robot butler working at a hotel in Cupertino. And then there's Uber, which has been experimenting with driverless taxis and trucks. CHELLAM: And that would affect 3. 5 million truck drivers, another 5 million people who support the truck-driving industry. I mean, that's just one example of automation. KIM: Chellam says politicians aren't addressing this automated future. At most, they talk about retraining, which, Chellam says, fails to deal with the scope of the problem. CHELLAM: Take the truck-driver example. What are you going to retrain 3. 5 million people to do in a short enough period of time? KIM: Chellum believes as technology replaces more workers, the traditional 40-hour-a-week job could become a thing of the past. If that happens, how will families get health insurance or save for retirement? Some experts say the only answer is a government-guaranteed paycheck that would allow people to buy food and housing. That would not only help the individuals but would help keep the economic wheels spinning and generate tax revenues. NATALIE FOSTER: Silicon Valley's interest in the universal basic income is one part guilt and one part optimism. KIM: That's Natalie Foster. She's a fellow at the Institute of the Future. It's a nonprofit research organization in Palo Alto. Foster says techies understand that there's a lot that seems impossible about the basic income. And right now they're in an inquiry and research phase. They're hosting panels that ask. . . FOSTER: What would it mean to give people money that they didn't work for? And that's a notion that challenges a lot of people. KIM: Chris Hughes says, whether you like the idea or not, there won't be an alternative because decent-paying jobs are disappearing for millions of people. He's a co-founder of Facebook and active in the basic-income movement. CHRIS HUGHES: The reality is that work has changed. You know, 40 percent of jobs are now contingent, meaning they're part-time, independent contractors, Uber drivers. KIM: Hughes says that shift has already left middle-class Americans economically insecure. And that feeling of insecurity is evident in this tumultuous presidential election. HUGHES: I think there's a sense that our economy is broken in many ways. But rather than try to restructure our economy so it looks like the 1950s, I think we have to be honest with ourselves. KIM: That those days aren't coming back - machines and software are replacing workers every day. And Hughes says that means basic income isn't an idea for the distant future but one we need to consider today. For NPR News, I'm Queena Kim.

The D. C. Circuit Court here in Washington is hearing an appeal of the Clean Power Plan. This is an Obama administration rule that would restrict carbon emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants. Reporter Stephanie Joyce is with Inside Energy. That's a public media collaboration focusing on energy issues. And she is in Washington covering this case and joins me in the studio. Hey, Stephanie. STEPHANIE JOYCE, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So you were really talking this up when we were outside the studio coming in here, saying that, I mean, this could have huge implications for a major industry in this country - not exaggerating, you're telling me. JOYCE: Yeah, this is a big deal. You know, the outcome of this court case really has the potential to shut down a huge chunk of coal-fired power plants in this country, and it will also have a very big impact on coal-producing states in the U. S. So the Clean Power Plan is really the most ambitious carbon regulation to come out of the Obama administration, actually, really probably the most ambitious carbon regulation proposed to date in the United States. It requires a 32 percent cut in carbon emissions from power plants by 2030, although individual states have their own requirements and targets, which are in some cases much stricter than that. And so two dozen states have sued the EPA over this rule, which I think gives you some sense of its magnitude. GREENE: These are states that would basically make the argument, if you shut down these power plants, it could hurt the economy. It could hurt jobs in our state and so forth. JOYCE: Exactly, lots of arguments against this, including, you know, this will hurt our industries, like our coal industry. This will make power more expensive for consumers, although the EPA argues the opposite of that. So people are opposing this for a variety of different reasons, but there's really a lot of opposition. GREENE: Is there one legal question that there's disagreement on that this really rests on? JOYCE: This doesn't really rest on a single legal argument. GREENE: OK. JOYCE: You're going to hear opponents argue against this in a number of ways, today. You know, everything from the notion that this is unconstitutional to super technical arguments about whether the EPA can regulate pollutants under two different sections of the Clean Air Act. You're also going to hear an argument today about whether the EPA basically changed too much between the draft of this rule and the final version of this rule and whether they gave adequate notice of that. GREENE: Oh, well, we're really getting into legal nitty-gritty. But the unconstitutional - that's a word that probably refers to the larger argument by someone in the Republican Party that President Obama has overreached his executive authority. And this is one example of that in their mind. JOYCE: This is certainly a prime example of what people would say is federal overreach, yes. GREENE: OK, so what exactly is happening in this courtroom? This is a full D. C. Circuit Court of judges that will hear this case today? JOYCE: Yes, and that's highly unusual. The court was supposed to hear this case back in May, and that was going to be in front of a panel of just three judges. They decided back in May that, in fact, the full court would hear this case. And I think that obviously signals how important this is. And people are going to be watching these oral arguments very closely to see, you know, what questions the judges ask and whether, you know, they give any signal of which way they might rule. This is a particularly important hearing because with Justice Scalia's death earlier this year, this could be the final time this case is heard. This case was always expected to go to the Supreme Court. But, you know, this court's ruling could end up being the one that holds if the Supreme Court is divided or decides not to take up the case. GREENE: Oh, you're saying because of Scalia's death, it could be 4-4 of the justices of the Supreme Court, and that would basically mean that whatever this lower court decides is what will hold. JOYCE: Exactly. GREENE: Got it. So that really does tell us how important this court decision could be. Talking to reporter Stephanie Joyce - she is with Wyoming Public Radio and also Inside Energy, which is a public media collaboration focusing on energy issues. Stephanie, thanks a lot.

Many companies don't know whether they pay men and women differently for similar jobs unless they investigate it, and many are. Employers are under pressure from regulators and from their own workers to find pay gaps and eliminate them. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: They say the first step to addressing a problem is recognizing you have one. But Glassdoor, a website where workers review their employers, didn't know whether it had a pay gap. So it analyzed it. DAWN LYON: If we just look on average, we have a 20 percent pay gap. NOGUCHI: That's an average, says Dawn Lyon, a Glassdoor vice president. When it takes experience, education and performance into account, the gap disappears. And in some cases, women are a bit ahead at Glassdoor. Evaluating the gender pay gap is tricky precisely because how you calculate it makes a big difference. There's an often-cited statistic that nationally women earn about 20 percent less than men, but after adjustments for things like title and tenure, Lyon says that narrows to about 5 percent. There are jobs where the gap is very big, even after adjustments. Among software engineers, it's 28 percent. LYON: Chefs, 28 - dentists, 28 - psychologists, 27 percent - pharmacists, 21 percent - physicians. . . NOGUCHI: Glassdoor is just one of many firms offering pay gap analysis for employers. LYON: Companies are taking action now to evaluate where they stand. And the reality is that most just don't know. NOGUCHI: The Obama administration has made equal pay for women a cause celebre. In early 2018, federal regulators will require employers with more than a hundred workers to file pay data by gender. U. S. firms with operations in the U. K. face a similar law taking effect the same year. Besides that, recruiters and executives say workers are demanding pay transparency. This year salesforce. com says it spent $3 million to close its pay gap. CEO Marc Benioff told CNN in March identifying it was easy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARC BENIOFF: We know every employee's name, their address. We know how much they're paid. We know their title. Every company does. That's the modern world. And with just the push of one button, I was able to know exactly what the discrepancy was and how I needed to fix it, which I've now done. NOGUCHI: Cheryl Behymer says in fact the process is not straightforward. Behymer, an attorney representing employers, says the numbers can be misleading. For example, say someone worked a night shift that earns more than working dayside. CHERYL BEHYMER: That could look like there's discrimination potentially present when in fact none really exists. NOGUCHI: Behymer says worker lawsuits are on the rise, so she cautions clients to keep pay data information closely held. BEHYMER: We wouldn't want the employer to have something that could be used against it as an admission that there was an inequity that required adjustment. NOGUCHI: That's not to say adjustments shouldn't be made, she says, just made quietly in a way that doesn't inspire more complaints. But not everyone agrees. At GoDaddy, a domain name registrar, a gender pay analysis last year led to raising the salaries of about 70 people. Katee Van Horn, vice president of engagement and inclusion, says they did so proudly. KATEE VAN HORN: You know, it's great to be able to share. Hey, we're doing the right thing. NOGUCHI: Van Horn says it wasn't just about adjusting pay. VAN HORN: While our pay was pretty close, we're still looking at our women getting promoted at the same pace that men are. And we have some work to do there. NOGUCHI: She says the company is also trying to hire more women in its managerial ranks. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

And 2015 the disparity between pay rates for black and white men climbed to 31 percent. That's according to a new study from the Economic Policy Institute. That's a research institution that leans left. The study's most surprising finding, though, might be that the gaps get even wider when workers have more education. To hear more, we invited one of the authors of the study, Valerie Wilson, to the studio to give us some details. We were also joined by Adia Harvey Wingfield. She's a professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis. She studies the ways race, gender and class affect the working world. And I started our conversation by asking Valerie Wilson why these gaps have been growing. VALERIE WILSON: A big part of what we did in this study was to try to pin down all of the factors that would reasonably affect what workers get paid. We controlled for level of education. We looked at years of experience, what region of the country you live in, whether or not you live in an urban area or a rural area. And even after controlling for those factors, there was a sizable difference between what black and white workers were paid. When we look at how this gap has changed over time, most of the change in that gap hasn't been the result of those observable factors - education, experience, etc. Most of it is that part of the gap that remains, quote, unquote, \"unexplained\" on the part that we identify as discrimination. MARTIN: One of the things, again, that leapt out to a lot of people looking at this is that many people, including the president, have continued to press, you know, education, education, education. That is the bulwark against discrimination or it's the antidote to discrimination. And one of the, I think, truly disturbing findings is that that is not the case, that even when all things are equal, that they turn out not to be at least in terms of the salaries. What's your take on this? WILSON: I think there's an important distinction to be made when we talk about the role of education in the labor market. Unquestionably, people with higher education, more years of schooling earn higher wages, so education is effective in terms of economic mobility. Education is not, however, the answer to racial inequality. MARTIN: Let's hear from professor Adia Harvey Wingfield. First of all, I have to ask you, as a person who works with data, tell me some of the things that jumped out to you. ADIA HARVEY WINGFIELD: Well, I wasn't surprised by the wage gap in particular because I think that's pretty consistent with what we would expect to find from the research. But in looking at what I know from the sociological literature, I think that that fills in some gaps as to why we see this happening. For example, my colleague Vinny Reseno (ph) at Ohio State University has done a lot of work that documents the ways in which discrimination is present for workers of color, particularly black workers. He finds that they're often subjected to different rules than their white counterparts are, that they're held to different standards, that rules that may be applied to them are not necessarily applied to other co-workers. My other colleague Lauren Rivera has done an excellent study that focuses on the hiring processes for workers in the lead professional services firms and what she finds are that these social patterns where people tend to want to hire people who are like them matter in terms of who has access to these jobs in the first place. MARTIN: One of the findings is that black workers are offered lower starting salaries right out of college. Why might that be? WINGFIELD: Well, I think, again, that some of the issues that come out from sociological research play a role in this that when black Americans, generally speaking, are largely stereotyped to be less intelligent, less capable, less focused, it's not surprising that that might translate into the perceptions that managers have in terms of offering starting salaries, particularly if their perception is that workers who are white workers are seen to be more suitable for the culture of a particular firm or the culture and the unspoken norms of a particular environment. I think that these types of stereotypes and perceptions exist in the broader society and that hiring managers aren't exempt from being influenced by them. MARTIN: I have to ask the question that there will be those who will listen to this and say if these workers - white workers - are getting paid more, then they must be more qualified. WILSON: No, that's not the case. WINGFIELD: No, and her data show that that's not the case and the bulk of sociological research makes the point to show that that's not the case that we aren't looking at a disparity in terms of qualifications or education or experience. When those things are controlled for, then if there's still a disparity, then that disparity can be attributed to discrimination. And the research shows that those discriminatory processes are in place. MARTIN: Before we let you go - we're running out of time - I wanted to ask if people agree that this is not acceptable that people who are equally qualified should be equally desired and should be equally compensated, and that is not the case, what should they do? WILSON: So the other sort of big finding from this report is that this widening of the racial wage gap has happened in a time we've seen overall growing wage inequality. So there are really two approaches here. One is to address that broader issue of wage stagnation that we see affecting black and white workers alike, but then on the specific - race-specific side of things, we really have to begin to sort of pull back the covers because a lot of this happens because workers don't know what other people in their job are making. A lot of that has to do with which employers are required to report on what they pay workers by race, ethnicity and gender, as well as the fact that, you know, we've gone through different administrations over time when there's been less emphasis and enforcement of existing anti-discrimination laws. So I think that we have to combine both the broad economic policies that are going to boost wages for all workers - middle-class workers in particular - but then also those very race-specific solutions as well.

This week, we're looking at the minimum wage because it's on its way up to $15 an hour in California and New York, which is an unprecedented wage bump at the state level. And it's going to have an effect both on workers and employers. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has more. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Shopping these days is a little easier on Edica Reese's wallet. She works as a cashier at a McDonald's in New York City, where the minimum wage is on the rise. EDICA REESE: It's helping. I guess I can get more essentials. Before, I couldn't get what I needed. WANG: Sometimes she would have to ask neighbors for toilet paper when she ran out. But now she and other fast-food workers in the city are making at least 10. 50 an hour. That's set to go up to $12 an hour at the end of the year. (SOUNDBITE OF CASH REGISTER BEEPING)WANG: And that means she can afford to keep up her own stock of toiletries. Are you finished shopping? REESE: Yes, I am. WANG: But it's going to be a while before the minimum wage finally hits the planned $15 an hour. That's because the wage hikes in New York state and California are being phased in with small bumps every year. Reese says 15 an hour would make a big difference for her and her 3-year-old daughter. REESE: I guess I could pay my bills on time instead of waiting for the next check to come and the next check. I live check to check still. I need to save a little bit more money, you know? WANG: For a full-time worker, a year's salary at 15 an hour, before taxes, adds up to just over $31,000. And some employers say they're not sure how they're going to afford it, including Kurt Samuels. He owns Family's Pots and Grill, a Jamaican restaurant in Mount Vernon, N. Y. , where, at 5:30 in the morning, he starts making. . . KURT SAMUELS: Brown stew chicken, curry goat, oxtail, and soon I'll have some jerk chicken ready. WANG: This is all for the lunch rush? SAMUELS: For the lunch rush. WANG: Samuels has one part-time employee who helps take orders. She's currently making the minimum wage, and he says when it goes up. . . SAMUELS: It's going to be hard, you know? Maybe her hours most likely going to be cut, you know, 'cause the end of the day, got to pay the rent, pay the bills, the gas, light, insurance. WANG: He recently raised prices, but he's worried about losing customers if he does it again. (SOUNDBITE OF POTS CLANGING)WANG: A few blocks away, Miesha Stokley is trying to figure out how to keep staffing her cupcake shop. She has one minimum-wage worker who helps with baking. MIESHA STOKLEY: She's definitely worth minimum wage, so I can't argue with that. I just have to, you know, work harder so we can make more money and I'll be able to pay. But I don't argue with it because it's expensive to live in New York. WANG: For now, Stokley's putting more hours in herself at Cupcake Cutie Boutique. STOKLEY: I work nights as a nurse. So I'm here in the morning and the afternoon, and then I go to work at night. WANG: So when do you sleep? STOKLEY: I barely sleep (laughter). WANG: It's part of the pressure many other small-business owners are facing in cities, including Seattle and Washington, D. C. , where the minimum wage is also rising to $15 an hour. But lawmakers and economists are paying extra attention to the wage bumps in New York state and California. LINDA BARRINGTON: For most economists, this is untrodden territory. WANG: Linda Barrington heads Cornell University's Institute for Compensation Studies. She says it's hard to predict how raising the minimum wage at the state level will impact New York and California's economies. That's because past studies have not looked at increases this big and that affect this many people. Besides workers and employers, though, she says we should keep an eye on how these wage hikes will affect prices. BARRINGTON: The more that businesses can pass it along to consumers, the less it's going to negatively affect employment. WANG: Those consumers, of course, include minimum-wage workers. That's partly why some critics of minimum-wage hikes say increases are not effective tools for reducing income inequality. Still, Barrington adds, any increase will touch not only fast-food chains and other large-scale industries but also those on the smaller scale, like families hiring a home health care worker. For Edica Reese's family, though, it's a change that can't come soon enough. She lives in a public housing development in Harlem, where she pays $300 a month for a small studio apartment she shares with her daughter, Kayleene. REESE: And you like the fight for 15, right? KAYLEENE: Uh-huh. WANG: Kayleene went to rallies with her mother, where she and other fast-food workers protested for minimum wage increases. REESE: What do you say? KAYLEENE: What do you want? Fifteen. When do you want it? Now. We don't get it, shut it down. REESE: Yay. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yay. WANG: Workers in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington are also calling to raise their state's minimum wages, though to a few dollars shy of 15. Those hikes will be on the ballot on November 8.

S. nuclear power industry is shrinking. Another plant goes offline today. Nuclear power is expensive compared to some alternatives. Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports that that's forcing the industry to reckon with what critics call a broken system. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: This plant where I'm standing is a good example. This is the Fort Calhoun nuclear power plant half an hour north of Omaha, Neb. This plant is full of new equipment. There's a building right across from me, a white concrete box that's still under construction. It's licensed until 2033, but this plant is shutting down. BROCK LINDAU: I think we're going 100 miles an hour running perfect and somehow they just took the wheels off from underneath us and now we're trying to skid to a halt. MORRIS: Brock Lindau spent most of his career at the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant. He helped install almost $700 million in upgrades that got the plant through a flood and a fire and helped get a license to operate until 2033. In turn, the plant's given Lindau a good income which he's used to buy a big house. LISA LINDAU: So today, I have to paint the trim around the windows. MORRIS: Lisa Lindau says they love this place, but they have to get it ready to sell when Brock loses his job. L. LINDAU: And it's kind of sad because you think as you're painting, you think a lot, you know? And you can't help but think as you paint, you're painting for the next people. MORRIS: If the Lindaus are perplexed, it's understandable. The Fort Calhoun plant cranked out electricity for 43 years, and it was licensed for another 17. Decommissioning will cost up to $1. 5 billion and take up to 60 years. Still, Tim Burke figures eating all of that is cheaper than keeping the plant in production. Burke runs the Omaha Public Power District, which owns Fort Calhoun, and he says that operating a small plant like this one, especially in a region with abundant wind power and natural gas just doesn't make sense. TIM BURKE: So we had low-cost energy primarily due to increased wind, low cost natural gas and a lot of capacity now in this regional transmission organization. MORRIS: And it's not like his customers are using more power. Across the U. S. , demand has been flat for a decade. New capacity drives down price. Nuclear power with its stiff regulations and fixed expenses can have a hard time competing. ALLISON MACFARLANE: There's certainly accelerated decommissioning. There's a lot more decommissioning going on now than there was, say, 10 or 15 years ago. MORRIS: Allison Macfarlane, former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be like this. A decade ago, low carbon nuclear power had a bright future as a tool to fight climate change. Now the industry's shrinking. MACFARLANE: There are now more plants going offline than coming online. MORRIS: Then what happens to the nuclear waste? MACFARLANE: Yeah. Well, that's an excellent question. It doesn't go anywhere (laughter). There isn't any solution for it right now, which is a big problem. MORRIS: The government had a solution, Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Utility rate payers kicked in $34 billion to develop a long-term storage facility there. But Christina Simeone with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy says that plan's not going anywhere. CHRISTINA SIMEONE: So what is happening is plants across the country are having to store waste on site. That's every nuclear power plant in the country is storing this high-level radioactive waste on site. MORRIS: Simeone says that set up is, A, dangerous - nuclear power plants and de facto nuclear waste dumps are sited near water which can spread nuclear waste and, B, expensive - waste has to be stored in heavy concrete casks and guarded. The government has already paid more than $5 billion for that. And Simeone says that figure is likely to mushroom to about 30 billion minimum a decade from now. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Kansas City. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  The U. S. nuclear power industry is shrinking. Another plant goes offline today.

MORRIS: If the Lindaus are perplexed, it's understandable. The Fort Calhoun plant cranked out electricity for 43 years, and it was licensed for another 17. Decommissioning will cost up to $1. 5 billion and take up to 60 years. Still, Tim Burke figures eating all of that is cheaper than keeping the plant in production. Burke runs the Omaha Public Power District, which owns Fort Calhoun, and he says that operating a small plant like this one, especially in a region with abundant wind power and natural gas just doesn't make sense. TIM BURKE: So we had low-cost energy primarily due to increased wind, low cost natural gas and a lot of capacity now in this regional transmission organization. MORRIS: And it's not like his customers are using more power. Across the U. S. , demand has been flat for a decade. New capacity drives down price. Nuclear power with its stiff regulations and fixed expenses can have a hard time competing. ALLISON MACFARLANE: There's certainly accelerated decommissioning. There's a lot more decommissioning going on now than there was, say, 10 or 15 years ago. MORRIS: Allison Macfarlane, former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be like this. A decade ago, low carbon nuclear power had a bright future as a tool to fight climate change. Now the industry's shrinking. MACFARLANE: There are now more plants going offline than coming online. MORRIS: Then what happens to the nuclear waste? MACFARLANE: Yeah. Well, that's an excellent question. It doesn't go anywhere (laughter). There isn't any solution for it right now, which is a big problem. MORRIS: The government had a solution, Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Utility rate payers kicked in $34 billion to develop a long-term storage facility there. But Christina Simeone with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy says that plan's not going anywhere. CHRISTINA SIMEONE: So what is happening is plants across the country are having to store waste on site. That's every nuclear power plant in the country is storing this high-level radioactive waste on site. MORRIS: Simeone says that set up is, A, dangerous - nuclear power plants and de facto nuclear waste dumps are sited near water which can spread nuclear waste and, B, expensive - waste has to be stored in heavy concrete casks and guarded. The government has already paid more than $5 billion for that. And Simeone says that figure is likely to mushroom to about 30 billion minimum a decade from now.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. SIEGEL: The problem, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, might be finding enough skilled workers to fill those jobs. YUKI NOGUCHI: Clinton proposes spending $275 billion over five years and setting up a mechanism to privately fund additional projects. Trump is proposing tax credits to encourage private investment of up to a trillion dollars over a decade. But then there's the question of how to find the skilled labor to build all those roads and bridges. Brian Turmail is a spokesman for the Associated General Contractors, a trade group. BRIAN TURMAIL: Two-thirds of commercial construction firms in the country report they are having a hard time finding qualified workers to hire. NOGUCHI: Construction employment in the country is at a healthy and consistent 6. 6 million, which is sufficient to sustain today's low levels of infrastructure investment. But about 40 percent of the workforce is made up of baby boomers aging into retirement, and Turmail says there aren't enough young people lining up to replace them. TURMAIL: One measure that we see is the average age of a new construction worker in this country is 28, and that tells us that most people view construction as a career of last resort. NOGUCHI: One reason, he says, is that over the years, educational institutions cut back on training programs. TURMAIL: There was a point in time when virtually every school system in the country had what was then known as vocational education, which was an incredible pipeline for manufacturing and for construction trades. NOGUCHI: Turmail says there are potential sources of labor if spending increases. Firms are recruiting military veterans and laborers who left during the Great Recession and found work in the energy sector. Cities and states are already working with schools to revive vocational and on-the-job programs that could address demand in the longer term. Companies would keep raising wages and pay more overtime to attract more new workers. TURMAIL: Many of our members tell us that they have increased pay, that they've increased signing bonuses, that they've added benefits. NOGUCHI: This is true for JAR Construction in El Paso where Angelica Rosales is director of business development. She says the company attracts and retains workers by paying wages above market rates.

S. , inflation doesn't get much attention. That's partly because of numbers like this - prices for U. S. consumers rose 1. 7 percent over the last year, according to a report released this morning by the federal government. But as Jacob Goldstein of our Planet Money podcast reports, inflation is hugely important to some of the most powerful people in the economy. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: The figure is called personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, and it's the key inflation figure for the leaders of the Federal Reserve. This is a big deal because the Fed has a huge influence on the economy. The Fed has the power to raise and lower interest rates. And it's supposed to use this power to steer the economy for both full employment and low inflation. When unemployment is high, the Fed lowers interest rates. When inflation is rising, the Fed raises rates. And a few years back, the Fed publicly announced that it would target 2 percent a year inflation as measured by PCE. Why 2 percent? To find the answer, I called up Alan Blinder. He's an economist at Princeton. Why 2 percent? ALAN BLINDER: That's a really good question so. . . GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). BLINDER: . . . Because it's not so obvious that two is the right number. GOLDSTEIN: Blinder was vice chair of the Fed back in the mid-'90s. He told me back then, even people within the Fed couldn't agree on what inflation rate the Fed should target. BLINDER: Some people thought we should be shooting for zero. Some people thought we should be shooting for 2 percent. Some people were content with the 3 percent, which is about where we were. GOLDSTEIN: In the years after Blinder left the Fed, there was this convergence on that 2 percent number. Here's why - you want inflation to be low. High inflation creates all kinds of problems. But you also do not want inflation to go below zero. You do not want deflation. That means you have falling prices and falling wages. And that's bad for people who have debts, tends to lead to more bankruptcies. It's bad for the economy overall. And, Blinder says, the Fed knows that whatever inflation rate it targets, they're not going to hit it right exactly on the nose. BLINDER: Whatever long-run target the central bank sets, what you're going to see in history is random fluctuations above and below. So if you're quite worried about going below zero that argues to give yourself a buffer. GOLDSTEIN: So you start at zero, give yourself a little buffer so you don't slip into deflation, and you get to 2 percent. Blinder says it took the Fed a long time to agree on this number internally. And then after that, they had to decide, OK, now we're ready to talk publicly about this. And so finally on January 25, 2012, Ben Bernanke, who was the chairman of the Fed at the time, had this press conference where he told the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEN BERNANKE: The committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with our statutory mandate. GOLDSTEIN: Boom - 2 percent. So here we are now, almost five years later. And it's a good thing that the Fed gave itself that buffer. A few months after Bernanke made this announcement, inflation fell below 2 percent. And since then it's been below 2 percent every single month. That is a big part of the reason that the Fed has held interest rates so low for so long. Jacob Goldstein, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Here in the U. S. , inflation doesn't get much attention.

JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Across New Jersey yesterday, drivers raced to fill up their tanks before the tax hike took effect. MATT BURKE: Not a fan, obviously - more money. JAZMINE ROGERS: I'm speechless 'cause I really relied on this. It's going to hit my pockets hard unfortunately. TOBIN GRINGRAS: I mean I already went to a couple different stops.

You know, they put these taxes on, and where does it go? ROSE: There's no disputing that New Jersey's roads are in bad shape. The state's transportation trust fund ran out of money this year. So lawmakers reached a bipartisan deal to raise the state's gas tax by 23 cents a gallon. Governor Chris Christie says the deal will generate billions of dollars a year for transportation projects and allow the state to lower the sales tax and phase out the estate tax altogether. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS CHRISTIE: That will be good for the state's economy. That will be good for the citizens of our state. ROSE: New Jersey is in good company when it comes to raising gas taxes. It's the 19th state to do it in the last three years alone. That's according to Kevin Pula at the National Conference of State Legislatures. KEVIN PULA: There's a shortfall of transportation funding around the country at both the federal and the state level. It's not just an issue in one region of the country or that only affects urban states or rural states. A lot of states are struggling with this. ROSE: Still, Pula says New Jersey's gas tax hike is notable for a couple of reasons. For one, it's designed to go up or down depending on how much gas drivers consume. So even if fuel efficiency improves and drivers buy less gas, the state can still count on a steady stream of revenue. And two, New Jersey's gas-tax hike is unusually big. It'll cost the average driver several hundred dollars a year, and it could cost gas station owners a lot more than that. MEER FAZALDIN: I think it's too high and too quick. They should have staggered, you know? But all of a sudden, 23 cents - that's too much at this - you know, all at once.

Financial markets don't typically move too much based on presidential campaigns, but this time, as Donald Trump's prospects have improved, stocks have been falling. The S&P 500 is down nearly 3 percent in a little more than a week, and some researchers say there is a lot more at stake depending on who wins the White House. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Eric Zitzewitz is an economist at Dartmouth who has a pretty cool job right now. He's basically decoding movements in the stock market to calculate the economic impact of a Trump versus a Clinton presidency. ERIC ZITZEWITZ: This election is going to be a very big deal economically. The market really cares. ARNOLD: Zitzewitz says that the market usually favors the Republican candidate, but in this at times bizarre election, that's been flipped on its head. The market wants Hillary Clinton to win. He says quite simply, stocks will be worth less if Donald Trump wins and more if Clinton wins - and quite a bit more. ZITZEWITZ: We have a 12 percent difference in the value of the S&P under the two candidates. ARNOLD: That is, the market anticipates that stocks would be 12 percent higher under Clinton than under Trump at least early on. ZITZEWITZ: When we did this work on past elections, we were getting results more like 2 percent. This election is very different in that regard. The economic stakes are quite high. ARNOLD: OK, so why does Zitzewitz say this? The first part actually has a lot to do with gambling. There are Internet sites you can go onto to bet on the outcome of the election. Zitzewitz calls them political prediction markets. ZITZEWITZ: You have a lot of smart people trading in those markets who are looking all - at all of these different signals like polls and like aggregations of the polls and things like how the economy is doing. ARNOLD: And so these betting sites give you the odds. They say 75 percent - Clinton wins. And now here's the key thing. Something happens, an event like the first debate where Clinton was seen to be the clear winner. It takes days or a week for the polls to reflect that. But on those gambling sites, the odds start changing right away. ZITZEWITZ: Because everybody's trying to get in there before the other traders and profit from being the first to incorporate that information. So we're looking for very quick movements. ARNOLD: So Zitzewitz says during that first debate, it quickly got 6 percent more likely for Clinton to win. So then he just matches that up with movements in financial markets for that same limited time window, and he could do the math and see how the stock market's pricing that in. Zitzewitz's published all this in a paper after the first debate. ZITZEWITZ: We circulated the paper, and then we had this FBI letter event on Friday. And it really was striking how closely our results predicted how the markets reacted on Friday. ARNOLD: So in other words, that seemed to strongly confirm. ZITZEWITZ: The stock market doesn't want Trump to win. ARNOLD: We should note that Zitzewitz wrote the paper with another economist whose partner worked in the Obama White House. Zitzewitz himself is a registered Independent. Now, some people might be thinking, hey, this guy's probably just like a closet Hillary supporter, and he's cooking his numbers to make Trump look bad. Here's what he says. ZITZEWITZ: This cycle, it came out making Clinton supporters really happy. But when we did this for all of the elections eight years ago, it came out suggesting that the stock market did better under Republicans. So you know, we're - you're always going to make at least some people mad with some of these results. We just try to do everything honestly. ARNOLD: Several mainstream analysts and money managers we spoke with explained it this way. Donald Trump is just much more of a wild card with greater uncertainty as far as what his policies would be. And so Wall Street this time around is rooting for the Democrat. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

Financial markets don't typically move too much based on presidential campaigns, but this time, as Donald Trump's prospects have improved, stocks have been falling. The S&P 500 is down nearly 3 percent in a little more than a week, and some researchers say there is a lot more at stake depending on who wins the White House. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Eric Zitzewitz is an economist at Dartmouth who has a pretty cool job right now. He's basically decoding movements in the stock market to calculate the economic impact of a Trump versus a Clinton presidency. ERIC ZITZEWITZ: This election is going to be a very big deal economically. The market really cares. ARNOLD: Zitzewitz says that the market usually favors the Republican candidate, but in this at times bizarre election, that's been flipped on its head. The market wants Hillary Clinton to win. He says quite simply, stocks will be worth less if Donald Trump wins and more if Clinton wins - and quite a bit more. ZITZEWITZ: We have a 12 percent difference in the value of the S&P under the two candidates. ARNOLD: That is, the market anticipates that stocks would be 12 percent higher under Clinton than under Trump at least early on. ZITZEWITZ: When we did this work on past elections, we were getting results more like 2 percent. This election is very different in that regard. The economic stakes are quite high. ARNOLD: OK, so why does Zitzewitz say this? The first part actually has a lot to do with gambling. There are Internet sites you can go onto to bet on the outcome of the election. Zitzewitz calls them political prediction markets. ZITZEWITZ: You have a lot of smart people trading in those markets who are looking all - at all of these different signals like polls and like aggregations of the polls and things like how the economy is doing. ARNOLD: And so these betting sites give you the odds. They say 75 percent - Clinton wins. And now here's the key thing. Something happens, an event like the first debate where Clinton was seen to be the clear winner. It takes days or a week for the polls to reflect that. But on those gambling sites, the odds start changing right away. ZITZEWITZ: Because everybody's trying to get in there before the other traders and profit from being the first to incorporate that information. So we're looking for very quick movements. ARNOLD: So Zitzewitz says during that first debate, it quickly got 6 percent more likely for Clinton to win. So then he just matches that up with movements in financial markets for that same limited time window, and he could do the math and see how the stock market's pricing that in. Zitzewitz's published all this in a paper after the first debate. ZITZEWITZ: We circulated the paper, and then we had this FBI letter event on Friday. And it really was striking how closely our results predicted how the markets reacted on Friday. ARNOLD: So in other words, that seemed to strongly confirm. ZITZEWITZ: The stock market doesn't want Trump to win. ARNOLD: We should note that Zitzewitz wrote the paper with another economist whose partner worked in the Obama White House. Zitzewitz himself is a registered Independent. Now, some people might be thinking, hey, this guy's probably just like a closet Hillary supporter, and he's cooking his numbers to make Trump look bad. Here's what he says. ZITZEWITZ: This cycle, it came out making Clinton supporters really happy. But when we did this for all of the elections eight years ago, it came out suggesting that the stock market did better under Republicans. So you know, we're - you're always going to make at least some people mad with some of these results. We just try to do everything honestly. ARNOLD: Several mainstream analysts and money managers we spoke with explained it this way. Donald Trump is just much more of a wild card with greater uncertainty as far as what his policies would be. And so Wall Street this time around is rooting for the Democrat.

It shows the U. S. economy improved in October. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, it was strong wage growth that grabbed the spotlight. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Job growth was not quite as robust as economists had forecast, but 161,000 additional workers were added to payrolls last month and the unemployment rate dropped a tick to 4. 9 percent. Not a spectacular report, but certainly positive, says Dan White, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. DAN WHITE: If you look at some of the details of the report, there are even more positives to be had, the biggest one of course being that we had a 0. 4 percent increase in wages. YDSTIE: That may not sound like much, but it's the latest solid reading in a trend toward higher wages that's been building in recent months. In fact, during the last 12 months, wages have risen 2. 8 percent. That's the best showing since the Great Recession. And if job gains continue at this pace, upward pressure on wages should continue. Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, says there are other reasons wages are rising. DIANE SWONK: Changes in the minimum wage at the state and local level. Low-wage workers are starting to see the benefits of lifting the minimum wage. YDSTIE: Swonk says another thing boosting wage growth is more hiring in higher-paying jobs. SWONK: We're seeing this sort of move up the food chain from temporary hires into more full-time hires, and the composition of job gains is moving up the pay scale.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - Democracy on Trial. Ideas about when democracy works and how to improve it, even if it'll never be perfect. YANIS VAROUFAKIS: It's good to strive for it. You never get there. It's a bit like the horizon. RAZ: This is Yanis Varoufakis. VAROUFAKIS: I was an academic all my life, teaching mathematical economics and political economy. I was Minister of Finance in Greece. RAZ: So should I call you Mr. Minister? VAROUFAKIS: I insist you call me Yanis. RAZ: OK, great. Just out of curiosity, has there ever been a functioning democracy in your view that worked well? VAROUFAKIS: No, there hasn't. But that doesn't mean that democracy is not a powerful weapon against tyranny. RAZ: A strong democracy, Yanis says, is just much better equipped to handle crisis than, say, a dictatorship is. And a couple of years ago he was at the center of a crisis. It was in Greece. The country was basically bankrupt. And Yanis had to negotiate paying Greece's debts to the European Union. VAROUFAKIS: People asked me, what was the worst part of the negotiations? Well, the worst part of the negotiations is that there were no negotiations. I was negotiating for the right to negotiate. RAZ: Yanis, like the Greek people, had very little say in what actually happened to his country, which ultimately was forced to accept a huge austerity plan. And the outcome made a lot of people in Greece and in Europe feel like democracy wasn't exactly living up to its promise. VAROUFAKIS: Liberal democracy is the child, if you want, of the Magna Carta. RAZ: Yeah. VAROUFAKIS: And later on the Federalist Papers. The whole point was to have legitimacy of an oligarchic structure. The idea was to keep the riffraff, to keep the hoi polloi out of power, but to consult with them and to have their representatives speak on their behalf in a Congress, in a parliament in order to create checks and balances. But it was never about empowering them with the right to govern. So the problem is that we haven't had democracy for quite a while, if ever. RAZ: Yanis argues that in an authentic democracy, the power has to sit with the demos - with the people. But today in most western democracies, he says, power is tied to money. Here's Yanis on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VAROUFAKIS: In the West, we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't. Allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak is the mountain of debts that is - has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. But few people discern its twin, mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and the corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts. The result is stagnant wages and consequently low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle reinforces the pessimism of the investors. This is my quarrel with capitalism, its gross wastefulness. The more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the greater the waste of humanity's wealth. RAZ: So essentially what you're saying is that the notion of power residing in the people in a democracy is a smokescreen and that a capitalist system ultimately means that power will reside in the hands of corporations? VAROUFAKIS: Well, you just stated it. And there's nothing - I need to answer this. Isn't it so? Is there anyone who disagrees? The idea of, you know, people power because that's what democracy means. The demos is the people. It is the regime of the people by the people for the people. This is a wonderful, a splendid notion. It is something to aspire to and something to struggle for. But it's not a reality. The reality is there is a huge tension between capitalism and democracy. And this is the point I was making in my TED Talk. RAZ: So democracy and capitalism are not compatible in your view? VAROUFAKIS: There is a great deal of incompatibility that is baked into capitalism. Think about it. In political science departments throughout the United States - but everywhere else as well - professors like to compare and contrast two different kinds of voting systems. One is the one-person, one-vote that you have in general elections like the one in November now for the president of the United States. But there's another voting mechanism called the market. When you go to the supermarket, to a store and you purchase an iPhone or a bottle of fizzy water, you are voting for it. Except that you don't have one vote, you have as many votes as you have money. If you go to a shareholders meeting for any corporation, you'll find that there is voting. Except that it's not one-person, one-vote. So in capitalism the whole point about profit maximization is all about monopoly power. There is a quest for monopoly, which is exactly the opposite of what democracy's all about. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VAROUFAKIS: Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated. (LAUGHTER)VAROUFAKIS: It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere which is separate. Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece, the newly elected Greek government in the eurogroup as its finance minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process - our elections - could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. In our democracies today, this separation of economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable epic struggle between the two with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself causing economic crisis. RAZ: It seems like when you talk about capitalism undermining itself, I wonder whether the very same market forces that produced the inequality you talk about, you know, could also in theory produce the kind of democracy that you're looking for. VAROUFAKIS: That has always been my mindset, my way of thinking about history. History, as far as I'm concerned, is what happens when two forces clash - one is technological innovation which constantly destabilizes the existing order, and the second force is the social relations of production and the power relations production. And the result of this clash between the power relations generates history, but that, of course, I didn't invent this historical theory. This is Karl Marx. But think about it. Capitalism burst upon the scene historically in the 18th century in England, so we must never imagine that capitalism is a natural system of doing things. It is just one phase of human development. It will certainly pass. My great worry is what happens after capitalism? Capitalism is undermining itself magnificently with technologies which it is producing. Now we're going to have a multitude of machines capable of becoming our slaves, but at the same time capable of enslaving us. What we do with this magnificent technology - and don't get me wrong I'm completely gung ho about technology. I think that it is the greatest weapon against misery - but what do we do with this technology? It will depend on politics, and it better be democratic politics that determines our future. RAZ: What would an ideal democracy look like, one that you had a hand in in creating or one that you at least could influence? What would that democracy be like? VAROUFAKIS: So imagine a world in which our political rights and our economic rights were in sync. They're not in sync at the moment. Imagine that you worked in a corporation where the only people who had the right to be shareholders of a corporation is those who worked in it. But, you know, the kind of model that I'm describing to you is not just buying this kite. It exists. I know companies in the United States that operate on those lines. RAZ: Yeah. Profit sharing. Yeah, right. VAROUFAKIS: Profit sharing - this is a market system what I am describing, by the way, except that the rules are different. The whole point about democracy is that we have a capacity to control our lives on the basis of one person, one vote. If corporate power can shape our lives, can destroy our lives or in the case of a very small minority it can make us supremely rich, but that corporate power is not subject to democratic checks and balances then effectively what I am proposing a surge of democracy. Either we are going to democratize our societies and civilize our civilization or our societies are going to come tumbling down. RAZ: What are you optimistic about when it comes to democracy? Anything? VAROUFAKIS: I'm optimistic that the idea of democracy is consistent with the better side of humans and that it will always resonate with them. Democracy is the kind of regime that people who don't think they have all the answers favor. Those who believe that they know best and they know everything, they obviously don't like the idea of democracy because it's a constraint. But those of us who believe that none of us have the answers and the only way of finding the answers to the interesting questions about social life is to get together, we appreciate the possibility that democracy gives us.

The economy continued adding jobs at a solid pace in October. That's according to government numbers released this morning. NPR's John Ydstie has more. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: An additional 161,000 people were hired by employers last month - a bit below what was forecast - and the unemployment rate ticked down a notch to 4. 9 percent. Dan White, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics, says the job growth, though not spectacular, was positive. DAN WHITE: If you look at some of the details of the report, there are even more positives to be had, the biggest one, of course, being that we had a 0. 4 percent increase in wages, which is a sign that we're headed in the right direction. YDSTIE: Wage growth has been stubbornly slow during this recovery, but after today's report is included, wages have grown 2. 8 percent over the last 12 months. But is this jobs report enough to change the minds of many voters? WHITE: I don't think so. I think this is a very - it's a positive but it's a very run-of-the-mill positive. This wasn't exactly a shock to the upside or the downside. So I'm not sure that this will have much, if any, impact on debt marginal voters. YDSTIE: Job growth has been one of the most positive features of the U. S. economy over the course of this campaign. Monthly job growth during the past couple of years has averaged over 200,000 a month. White, who oversees the Moody's Analytics presidential election model, says that's a net positive for the party currently in control of the White House. The Moody's model currently predicts a win for Hillary Clinton with 330 electoral votes - many more than the 270 needed. But White says while the model has correctly predicted all the presidential elections since 1980, this one is different. WHITE: Our model looks at a generic race between a generic Democratic candidate and a generic Republican candidate. YDSTIE: And White says Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are anything but generic. The Moody's model tilts toward Clinton largely because the economic variables in the model are positive. Those variables include household income, home prices and the price of gasoline. White says while most voters cast their ballots based on party loyalty or ideology, marginal voters often vote based on their economic well-being. Another prominent presidential election model that focuses on broad growth points to a Trump win because growth has been so slow this year. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Another prominent presidential election model that focuses on broad growth points to a Trump win because growth has been so slow this year.

Over the past 40 years, about 7 million U. S. manufacturing jobs have disappeared. A new report from an advocacy group funded by both labor groups and manufacturers is saying that these losses have hurt many workers, but they've had a particularly dire impact on African-Americans. The report is called \"Unmade In America: Industrial Flight And The Decline Of Black Communities. \" The group also says that these negative effects can be turned around. They make suggestions to do just that through infrastructure investment, workforce development and so-called worker-friendly trade policies. Here to tell us more about this is Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, and Gerald Taylor, author of the report. And we started by asking Scott Paul about what changed in American manufacturing. SCOTT PAUL: What changed was really globalization and competition. And after 2000, we were competing with China head-on, combined with the fact that we've had much slower growth since 2000 than we ever had in the '90s or the '80s. And that lack of growth and the competition with China - and then the economic bet that we placed on the financial services sector to carry us through really didn't pay off. And so that's why a lot of industry is in the situation that it's in right now. MARTIN: OK, Gerald, one of the things that you say in the piece is that the water crisis in Flint, Mich. , which is something that our listeners are very familiar with, is a direct result of the city losing so many manufacturing jobs with the decline of the auto industry. How is that? GERALD TAYLOR: So you look at something like the flint water crisis, the common explanation of why this happened is that emergency managers were appointed to try and get the city out of the state of fiscal emergency that it was in and they messed up. But when you asked the deeper question, which is why was Flint in a state of emergency in the first place, what you find is essentially the legacy of industrial flight in Flint. You know, in the '70s and '80s, Flint had a very booming auto industry. And then as this trend away from manufacturing employment was taking place, Flint lost a lot of manufacturing jobs. You know, I think since that booming industry, they've lost tens of thousands - like, over 70,000 manufacturing jobs. And it kicks off this downward spiral where the city loses financial resources, can't keep up with its provision of public resources like infrastructure, police and fire protection and things like that. And there's a downward spiral that happens. MARTIN: So, Scott, let me ask you about - you know, you have recommendations to reversing this phenomenon. But I do have to point out that your organization is not neutral. It's a research group, but it is an advocacy group. It's a combined sort of entity involving participation by manufacturers and the Steelworkers Union. By definition, your intention is to grow the manufacturing sector. So I do want to hear your recommendations, but I also need people to understand that they do come from a world view. PAUL: Absolutely. And I would argue that our approaches are pragmatic. They're not philosophical. And I think that investing in infrastructure, investing in training, having a results-based trade policy would get broad support. In addition, I think we need a better system for both training and retraining, one that recognizes the realities of today, that it's probably not an 18-year-old kid. It might be someone who's transitioning at the age of 50. And at the same time, you know, we need a rational trade policy. We're not going to be ripping up our old trade agreements like Donald Trump suggests. MARTIN: What does a rational trade policy mean? PAUL: A workers-focused trade policy that's going to create opportunities for them overseas, not just the big companies that do benefit from these. Right now, the benefits don't often come back to the workers in the United States. This administration has, I think, begun to do a good job of enforcing those rules, but we need to turbocharge that in order to give our manufacturing sector a chance. MARTIN: Well, the argument, I think, that people have made on the other side is that that sounds good in theory but that that actually leads us to stasis and a lack of innovation. PAUL: I'm not arguing for, like, a '50s assembly line nostalgic view of manufacturing. But I think that there are great opportunities out there and there are going to be inventions that we can't even imagine 10 years from now. And the question is going to be - who's going to make those? MARTIN: OK, Gerald, before we let you go, we're down to our last couple of minutes here. Is there something that you - you mentioned in the epilogue to your report that you grew up in Youngstown, Ohio and that you kind of witnessed some of these trends yourself firsthand. Is there something in the course of investigating this holistically as a research project that surprised you? TAYLOR: I think the thing that surprised me the most is that this pattern that we were talking about, this kind of downward spiral that can happen in a city when it loses its manufacturing base - but that's a story that can be told, you know, dozens of times. You know, you look at places, you know, like Detroit and Gary and Pittsburgh or Flint or Milwaukee, Baltimore - like, all of these places which are so often the sites of economic distress and civil unrest now, they have stories like this. And that was one of the things that was really surprising to me, is that, you know, Youngstown is not even close to rare in this way. It's a pattern that's played out over and over.

Yesterday, the S&P 500 posted the ninth consecutive day of declines. That's the longest stretch of downward movement since December 1980, and analysts are convinced that this is a reaction to political news. We wanted to hear more about this, so we brought in Marilyn Geewax. She's NPR's senior business editor. Hi, Marilyn. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So what is the stock market telling us? Is this a window into how big investors see the coming election? GEEWAX: It really is a pretty clear story, actually. Two weeks ago, there was conventional thinking on Wall Street, and that's that Democrats would win the White House and probably the Senate but Republicans would hold on to the House. So that would mean the economy would stay on pretty much the current path. And that was based on the idea, too, that Clinton wouldn't change things very much from Obama policies. She would stick with the Affordable Care Act, she'd push for a higher minimum wage and so forth. But that assumption changed on Friday, October 28 when the FBI said that they were looking at emails again. That surprising announcement, it seems to have triggered some changes in the polls. People became more uncertain, and they're worried about the outcome of this election. And that started this beat-down in the markets. MARTIN: I think that would be a surprise to many people because I think that people traditionally think of big investors as represented in the stock markets of being more favorable to the Republican Party. GEEWAX: Well, I think it would be fair to say that investors prefer certainty. And with Clinton, they feel like they know where she's coming from. And actually, you know, there are a lot of fond memories of the Clinton years - that is, in the 1990s. If you look back on that, there was a lot of job growth, the stock prices really shot up. So the brand name Clinton actually conjures up some positive thoughts among a lot of investors. With Trump, there's uncertainty. He's never held political office, so he has no voting record, and his statements on economic issues can actually be pretty confusing. Let's just take the minimum wage. Trump is - he's switched his opinion. First he said that he was against a higher wage. Then he said he was for it. But he's also said he thinks it should be up to the states. I went on his website. I couldn't find an official position on it. So it's not entirely clear where he stands on that. But, you know, there are things where he's also very clear, and those positions can be opposed to what Republicans typically believe. For example, on trade, he really talks down NAFTA and TPP. These trade deals - Republicans in general favor those. So my point is that big investors either don't really know what his positions are or the ones they do know, in many cases, they don't like. MARTIN: Has this market preference for a Clinton victory actually been tracked? Or are there other factors that could be affecting the market? GEEWAX: There are economists who are tracking this. And what they've found is that bad news for Clinton has been bad news for investors. Their work suggests that actually there would be quite a large differential. If Clinton wins, it could be a rally in the market. If Trump wins, it could be a pretty big plunge. So that's just the short-term outlook. MARTIN: Is there any precedent to guide how long something like this might last? GEEWAX: Well, this is a very unusual election, so I don't know that we can look at any past elections to determine what'll happen. But the Trump campaign would certainly argue that these will be very short-lived jitters, and that eventually the investors will realize that Trump would help the economy, and that that would actually make the stock prices rise over time. But, you know, Michel, the thing is nobody really knows what happens with markets in the long term. If we knew that, we would all be Warren Buffett and we wouldn't be working for nonprofit public radio. We'd be millionaires somewhere. MARTIN: So in the short term, the volatility that people are seeing right now is real. GEEWAX: Yes. MARTIN: And it seems to be rooted in uncertainty about what would happen. . . GEEWAX: Yes. MARTIN: . . . After next week. GEEWAX: I read an awful lot of analysts and look at what's happening, and the phrases fear gauge, jitters (laughter) those are the phrases that people are using right now.

S. Supreme Court examines a case about the not-so-distant past. This case dates back to the time around the housing market collapse in 2008. The city of Miami wants to sue Wells Fargo and Bank of America under the Fair Housing Act. The city claims racial discrimination in the way that people were given mortgages and in the way they lost their homes. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The city of Miami alleges that the banks discriminated against black and Latino homeowners in terms in fees that made mortgages more expensive than they otherwise would have been. And when these homeowners ran into trouble, the suit says, the banks refused to refinance mortgages on terms equal to those offered to white borrowers in similar economic circumstances. It is a novel lawsuit, brought not by individual homeowners but by the city of Miami, which was ground zero in the housing foreclosure crisis. Supported by two dozen other cities, Miami contends that local governments are in the best position to enforce the Fair Housing Act against large lending institutions that discriminate against certain borrowers. The city claims that the bank's foreclosures were racially disproportionate. They also say the foreclosures resulted in a dramatic drop in property values, which in turn resulted in a drastic drop in property tax revenue at the very time the city needed to spend more to deal with the resulting urban blight. A federal appeals court based in Atlanta ruled in favor of the city, allowing it the chance to prove its claims at trial. The banks appealed to the Supreme Court, contending that Congress never authorized such suits. They also contend the city has not shown that the bank's discriminatory practices were the proximate cause of the drop in property tax revenue. There's little doubt that foreclosures lead to empty houses, blight and lower property values, but the banks argue that economic downturns can be just as responsible as the terms of any loan or series of loans, whether those terms are discriminatory or not. If Miami can sue over declining property taxes in this case, they ask, what will be next - a lawsuit over declining property values brought by a neighbor or a store? Miami replies that municipalities differ from private individuals, such as neighbors or private enterprises such as stores, because municipalities have an interest in promoting fair housing.

It resonated strongly with white, working-class voters, manufacturing workers hit by globalization, coal miners hurt by a movement to cleaner energy. But what exactly will Trump's broader economic policy agenda actually look like? He has no political track record. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Donald Trump has said stuff about the economy that's just been all over the map. He spooked the financial world when he seemed to suggest that the U. S. should default on Treasury bonds. He's talked about slapping trade tariffs on China, which could start a trade war. So how do you separate the campaign bluster and odd pronouncements from what Donald Trump is likely to actually try to do for the economy as president? Well, maybe one thing we can say most confidently about Donald Trump is that he likes to build things, often very big things. And in his acceptance speech last night, that was pretty front and center. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We are going to fix our inner-cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. ARNOLD: OK, so of course this is something that President Obama has wanted to do for years - big infrastructure spending to create jobs. But he was blocked by the Republican Congress. So one of the outcomes in this crazy campaign and election may be that President Trump does what President Obama wanted to do but couldn't. David Kotok is chief economist at Cumberland Advisors. DAVID KOTOK: I believe an infrastructure bill of 500 billion is now possible, and the introduction of it comes in early 2017 after the new regime takes office. ARNOLD: Trump talked about spending half a trillion dollars on infrastructure in his speech on the economy this past summer. Stephen Calk is a senior economic adviser to Trump. He says another big priority will be trying to create more jobs in the energy sector. STEPHEN CALK: He wants to create those jobs he promised by generating clean coal, developing and expanding safe fracking as well as safe offshore energy production. ARNOLD: Lower taxes also seem likely. Still, campaign promises are one thing, but many businesses may decide to be cautious about hiring and spending until they know what Trump's real policies will be. So economists say that might cause at least a brief slowdown in the economy. Many business leaders are hoping that Trump quickly assembles a really good, level-headed economic team. That would provide clarity. And they hope that that would move Trump off of the trade-bashing rhetoric of the campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CARLOS GUTIERREZ: We've got to get off this thing. You know, what got him elected is not going to make him a good performer. ARNOLD: Carlos Gutierrez is a former Republican commerce secretary under George W. Bush and the former CEO of Kellogg. Speaking on CNBC this afternoon, he said the things that got Trump elected. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GUTIERREZ: Demagoguery, populism - we're going to bring jobs back. What does that mean? We're going to bring textile jobs back? We should be talking about bringing new jobs here - innovation, new businesses, start-ups. I mean it's either very cynical, or it betrays any knowledge of how the world works. ARNOLD: So all this creates a tricky path for President-elect Trump. He campaigned hard on dismantling NAFTA, threatening trade barriers with Asia. And just about all economists - Republicans and Democrats alike - say retreating from global trade in this way would hurt the overall economy, not help it. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Donald Trump has said stuff about the economy that's just been all over the map. He spooked the financial world when he seemed to suggest that the U. S. should default on Treasury bonds. He's talked about slapping trade tariffs on China, which could start a trade war. So how do you separate the campaign bluster and odd pronouncements from what Donald Trump is likely to actually try to do for the economy as president? Well, maybe one thing we can say most confidently about Donald Trump is that he likes to build things, often very big things. And in his acceptance speech last night, that was pretty front and center. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We are going to fix our inner-cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. ARNOLD: OK, so of course this is something that President Obama has wanted to do for years - big infrastructure spending to create jobs. But he was blocked by the Republican Congress. So one of the outcomes in this crazy campaign and election may be that President Trump does what President Obama wanted to do but couldn't. David Kotok is chief economist at Cumberland Advisors. DAVID KOTOK: I believe an infrastructure bill of 500 billion is now possible, and the introduction of it comes in early 2017 after the new regime takes office. ARNOLD: Trump talked about spending half a trillion dollars on infrastructure in his speech on the economy this past summer. Stephen Calk is a senior economic adviser to Trump. He says another big priority will be trying to create more jobs in the energy sector. STEPHEN CALK: He wants to create those jobs he promised by generating clean coal, developing and expanding safe fracking as well as safe offshore energy production. ARNOLD: Lower taxes also seem likely. Still, campaign promises are one thing, but many businesses may decide to be cautious about hiring and spending until they know what Trump's real policies will be. So economists say that might cause at least a brief slowdown in the economy. Many business leaders are hoping that Trump quickly assembles a really good, level-headed economic team. That would provide clarity. And they hope that that would move Trump off of the trade-bashing rhetoric of the campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CARLOS GUTIERREZ: We've got to get off this thing. You know, what got him elected is not going to make him a good performer. ARNOLD: Carlos Gutierrez is a former Republican commerce secretary under George W. Bush and the former CEO of Kellogg. Speaking on CNBC this afternoon, he said the things that got Trump elected. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GUTIERREZ: Demagoguery, populism - we're going to bring jobs back. What does that mean? We're going to bring textile jobs back? We should be talking about bringing new jobs here - innovation, new businesses, start-ups. I mean it's either very cynical, or it betrays any knowledge of how the world works. ARNOLD: So all this creates a tricky path for President-elect Trump. He campaigned hard on dismantling NAFTA, threatening trade barriers with Asia. And just about all economists - Republicans and Democrats alike - say retreating from global trade in this way would hurt the overall economy, not help it.

NPR's Jim Zarroli went there to talk to Trump supporters. He asked them how their economic concerns factored into their vote and what they're expecting the president-elect to do for them. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Northampton County is a bellwether area. It's long voted for the winner in presidential elections. And it did so again on Tuesday. Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, says voters in the rural parts of the county showed up in big numbers to support Trump. CHRIS BORICK: We saw the turnout go off the charts in areas that are more white, working-class. And in areas where it's more diverse, turnout wasn't bad, but it wasn't at the level that we saw in those white, working-class areas. ZARROLI: And Borick says economics clearly played a part in the vote. The economy here used to be dominated by Bethlehem Steel, which closed in 1995, leaving a lot of people out of work. There's now a Sands Casino where the mill used to be. This is not some depressed corner of the Rust Belt. The county is a mix of cement plants, office parks and, increasingly, bedroom communities for Greater Philadelphia and New York City. Still, there's a lot of economic anxiety here. Inside the one-room headquarters of the County Republican Committee, Mary Barket cleans up some of the detritus left from Tuesday's celebration. Barket, who headed a pro-Trump women's group, is a volunteer for her church's help line. MARY BARKET: I have had people calling in, and the conversation is, I never thought we'd find ourselves in this position. But my job was cut. And I'm having a hard time finding another position. ZARROLI: Barket says Democrats lost because they've left those people behind, people such as Trump supporter Michael Hard. MICHAEL HARD: I come from a very liberal family. So Thanksgiving is going to be awkward (laughter). ZARROLI: In 2008, Hard, who's married with four kids, was laid off from his job at a paint company. He says automation made his job redundant. Today he sells insurance and makes more money, but he also works longer hours. Standing outside a diner in Easton, he says the United States embraced the global economy too quickly. HARD: Now we're seeing sort of the results of that. We have more people taking orders and less people making things these days. And I think that's something that people are tired of. They want opportunities. ZARROLI: Hard wants Trump to slow down the pace of globalization or at least make an effort to do so. HARD: If we don't see real, measurable progress within the first 18 months, that's going to spell doom for him the next time he wants to be elected. ZARROLI: Like a lot of supporters, Hard doesn't expect Trump to do everything he's promised. Keith Hornick works at a family-owned construction company in another part of the county. Fox News plays on the office TV. Small business owners tend to dislike government regulation, and Hornick is no exception. He says the Obama years have been especially onerous for people like him, and he is expecting Trump to ease the burden. But his support for Trump is not unconditional. KEITH HORNICK: Why I like Trump so much is because he wasn't from in the Beltway. He was a complete outsider, never held political office. If he starts gravitating towards the ruling class in Washington - done. I'm done. ZARROLI: Trump won Northhampton County by convincing voters such as Hornick he understands the problems they face.

First to Mexico. The president-elect's pledge to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he repeated often, has gotten much attention there. While it isn't clear how far Donald Trump can or will go to fulfill that promise, Mexicans are already getting a taste of what that could mean economically. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico City. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: On election night, Mexico's peso began to slide. And as it looked more likely that Donald Trump was going to win, it took a plunge. By this weekend, it hit a new low of 21 pesos to the dollar, a nearly 13-percent loss since just Tuesday. Eduardo Reyes, standing outside a crowded Mexico City restaurant, says tough times are coming. EDUARDO REYES: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"If the United States gets a fever, it turns into pneumonia for us. That's just the way it always is,\" says Reyes. That old adage is ringing true as Mexicans are already seeing prices rise. Those hikes are showing up in a lot of goods Mexicans have come to enjoy in recent years, everything from General Mills cereals, Nabisco cookies, to the American barley used to make their Mexican beer. Mexican economist Luis de la Calle says the two economies are more intertwined and dependent on each other than ever before, and it will be hard to break that apart. LUIS DE LA CALLE: Mexico buys from the U. S. , co-produces with the U. S. for the world, and we also compete with the U. S. But it's a two-way street. KAHN: De la Calle, who helped negotiate the free trade deal more than two decades ago, says ripping up NAFTA will also hurt American consumers and American jobs. Every day, nearly a billion and a half dollars' worth of trade crosses the U. S. -Mexico border. According to the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D. C. , more than 5 million U. S. jobs are directly dependent on trade with Mexico. But while Trump offended Mexicans with his harsh rhetoric directed at them, there are some here who agree with his depiction that NAFTA was the worst trade deal ever. ALEJANDRO ALVAREZ: Mexican agriculture has been destroyed. KAHN: Alejandro Alvarez, an economist at Mexico's National Autonomous University, says small Mexican farmers couldn't compete against U. S. agribusiness. ALVAREZ: We used to be self-sufficient in corn, and now more than half of the supply that we need comes from the U. S. KAHN: Alvarez says Mexican agriculture lost nearly a million and a half jobs. He says many of those displaced workers headed north in one of the biggest surges of Mexican migration to the U. S. Two decades later, though, net migration between the two countries is now at virtually zero. Carlos Petersen of the Eurasia Group, a political analysis firm, says if President-elect Trump keeps his promise to rip up the trade agreement, he could do that with just six months' notice. Duties would once again be placed on Mexican products entering the U. S. Some economists here say Mexico would then impose duties on U. S. imports. But Eurasia's Petersen says Mexico and its much smaller economy wouldn't win that trade war. CARLOS PETERSEN: The impact for the Mexican economy against the impact to the U. S. economy is overly disproportioned, right? And that's why Mexico doesn't have a lot of tools to really force the hand of Donald Trump into a more beneficial agreement for Mexico. KAHN: Many economists say the factories now in Mexico wouldn't go back to the U. S. They probably would head to cheaper labor countries like Vietnam or China. In the end, Petersen says soon-to-be President Trump will come under great pressure from U. S. businesses and their Republican congressional allies to move cautiously.

I do - including myself. I do. YDSTIE: A pre-election survey by the RAND Corporation, a research group, found at least half of Trump's supporters agreed with Trump on that, according to RAND's Michael Pollard. MICHAEL POLLARD: Just before the election, after the last debate, 51 percent of them intending to vote for Trump supported increasing taxes on these high-earning individuals. YDSTIE: But Lily Batchelder says Trump's plan does the opposite. She's a law professor at NYU and a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center. LILY BATCHELDER: If you look at the most wealthy, the top 1 percent would get about half of the benefits of his tax cuts. And a millionaire, for example, would get an average tax cut of $317,000. YDSTIE: But, Batchelder says, a family earning between $40,000 and $50,000 would get a tax cut of only $560. And, she says, millions of middle-class working families will see their tax bills rise under Trump's plan, especially single-parent families. BATCHELDER: A single parent who's earning $75,000 and has two school-age children - and they would face a tax increase of over $2,400. YDSTIE: That's if they had no child care deductions. The increase in taxes comes partly because the Trump plan eliminates the $4,000 exemption for each person in a household. Steve Calk, a Trump economic adviser, says the loss of the exemption is partially offset by other changes in the Trump plan. He takes issue with the Tax Policy Center's analysis and argues there will be big tax cuts for middle-income families. Calk says, take a family earning $50,000 a year. . . STEPHEN CALK: And their child care costs are, you know, let's say $7,000 or $,8000 a year. They're going to save 35 percent on their net tax bracket. YDSTIE: Batchelder says that calculation is misleading because it focuses on the tax rate reduction rather than a family's after-tax income, how much money they have left in their pocket after taxes. But Calk argues that personal income tax cuts and the Trump proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent will help taxpayers by boosting economic growth. CALK: The single best way to help people that are in the lower-income bracket or unemployed or underemployed is, number one, to get them employed in real jobs with real benefits. YDSTIE: Economists disagree on whether the tax plan would be good for the economy. The Tax Policy Center says over the first decade, the government would lose $6. 2 trillion dollars in revenue, producing huge budget deficits that could hurt the economy. One other element of the Trump plan that's worth noting - it would eliminate the federal estate tax entirely. Only the wealthiest taxpayers, less than 1 percent, now pay that tax. Ending it would lead to an even greater concentration of wealth in America. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

CALK: The single best way to help people that are in the lower-income bracket or unemployed or underemployed is, number one, to get them employed in real jobs with real benefits. YDSTIE: Economists disagree on whether the tax plan would be good for the economy. The Tax Policy Center says over the first decade, the government would lose $6. 2 trillion dollars in revenue, producing huge budget deficits that could hurt the economy. One other element of the Trump plan that's worth noting - it would eliminate the federal estate tax entirely. Only the wealthiest taxpayers, less than 1 percent, now pay that tax. Ending it would lead to an even greater concentration of wealth in America. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.", "section": "Politics", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

To talk about this, we have two economists who have become our semi-regular guests over this last year. One from the right - he's actually sitting to my right. Peter Morici teaches at the University of Maryland. He's a columnist who has published in The New York Post, The Washington Times and Breitbart. Peter Morici, good morning. Thanks for coming back. PETER MORICI: Nice to be with you. GREENE: And to my left is Jared Bernstein. He's a former chief economist for Vice President Biden. He is author of the new book \"The Reconnection Agenda: Reuniting Growth And Prosperity. \" Thanks for you for coming in as well. JARED BERNSTEIN: My pleasure. GREENE: Let's talk about possible picks for treasury secretary. The name Jamie Dimon is out there. He's maybe the best known, the head of J. P. Morgan, but, you know, certainly from the business world. What - is that the kind of pick that you guys think would work for a President Trump? Jared Bernstein, I'll start with you. BERNSTEIN: I'm skeptical in the sense that Donald Trump obviously ran very much an anti-establishment election and at least on the surface suggested he would work against the kind of Wall Street-Washington connections that have become pervasive and problematic. If you look on the other side of the aisle, you've got Senator Warren, Bernie Sanders and even Hillary Clinton saying, we want to be very careful not to seat our administration with those whose alliances are too close to Wall Street. And the issue here, especially regarding a Trump presidency, is that these folks would probably want to take down the Dodd-Frank financial reform. That was. . . GREENE: Which we should say - explain that in 10 seconds for people - a very important banking law. BERNSTEIN: A very important law that came after the financial crisis in 2008 that was designed to provide, in my view, the adequate amount of regulation so that Wall Street wouldn't continue to blow up the economy cycle after cycle. GREENE: But hasn't Donald Trump suggested that he - that's very much what he wants to do, to give banks more freedom and. . . BERNSTEIN: Donald Trump - and it's not just - correct. And it's not just Donald Trump. It's Donald Trump and Paul Ryan and the Republicans. And now that they control the Congress and the White House, Dodd-Frank may very well go. You put some - a Wall Street banker in charge of the Treasury, the likelihood of that goes up. And the reason that's a problem is, again, because we have what I call a shampoo cycle going on - bubble, bust, repeat. And that's not the way to run an economy. GREENE: (Laughter) That's a wonderful image. Peter Morici, someone from inside Wall Street who might, you know, clear away banking regulations - if that's what Donald Trump is looking to do - is that a good thing? MORICI: Well, I don't know how you have someone as treasury secretary who doesn't have a deep understanding of Wall Street and what (unintelligible) it is to work there. A lot of things are said during a campaign. Dodd-Frank is not going out the window in totality, but there's a great deal of bureaucratic overreach. The reality is the establishment on Wall Street has become Washington. Every day, over a hundred regulators go to work. They have their offices inside of Jamie Dimon's building. And they're looking over everybody's shoulder all the time to the point that it is very, very difficult for you or I to even move money from one IRA account to another without going through a compliance officer and scads of paperwork, to no - to no positive effect. GREENE: Wall Street's overregulated you're saying. MORICI: Well, absolutely. It didn't keep the London Whale from coming - from happening, a big trading scam at Dimon's bank. And it didn't keep Wells Fargo from creating all those false accounts. You know, people running around with clipboards doesn't necessarily give you better banking. GREENE: But are you worried Donald Trump could go too far, clear away too many regulations. . . MORICI: Oh, absolutely, but I think. . . GREENE: . . . And the banks could get away with murder in some ways? MORICI: I think he can, but I don't think he's going to. If you - if you read what's been said since the election, since we, you know, sobered up on Thursday morning, you find that they're not talking about throwing the whole thing out. Nobody really wants to preside over another bubble bust. But let's face it. The banks are still big - too big to fail. We just have the Federal Reserve hassling the living hell out of them so they can't lend any money, and they don't. One of the problems we have is small banks can't lend money, and we have a shortage of small entrepreneurs as a consequence. BERNSTEIN: So. . . GREENE: Jared Bernstein, very briefly, I want to get on to another topic. BERNSTEIN: Sure, OK. What I hear Peter saying is that we can't regulate the banks, and the banks are already causing precisely the kind of problems that. . . MORICI: I didn't say that. What I said is is that. . . BERNSTEIN: Hold on. MORICI: . . . You have to have an adequate amount of regulation. . . BERNSTEIN: No, no. MORICI: . . . Not an excessive amount of regulation. BERNSTEIN: OK, so wait, you spoke. Now I speak. (LAUGHTER)MORICI: Good, but please, don't change my words. BERNSTEIN: So what Peter was suggesting, that the system is overregulated - in fact, that's what he said. GREENE: Right. Is it overregulated? BERNSTEIN: No. In fact, Peter just ticked off a number of examples of ways in which regulation doesn't go far enough - the London Whale and the Wells Fargo. Somehow - how do you look at Wells Fargo and what they did and conclude that we need less regulation? That's beyond me. GREENE: Sounds like this will be a very important part of the debate when it comes to the treasury secretary. MORICI: Well, one of the ways you do that is to have a structural solution, and that is to separate investment banking from commercial banking, go back to Glass-Steagall and then break up the large banks. GREENE: Let me move on to trade. We just have a couple. . . MORICI: I would be all in favor of that, that's another story for another day. GREENE: I want to ask you both about trade. Donald Trump has suggested during the campaign that he is going to literally dismantle a lot of trade deals. Peter Morici, is this similar to what you were talking about with Dodd-Frank? He's really not going to dismantle. He's going to sort of nitpick and improve trade agreements. Or what do you think? MORICI: Well, he's talked all along about negotiating better deals. And then the media says he wants to blow up the system. Over and over again, his words have been distorted. GREENE: Although, he has said pretty strongly, like, you know, NAFTA's terrible. The TPP is terrible. BERNSTEIN: Disastrous. GREENE: I mean. . . MORICI: Well - and we use that kind of hyperbole in campaigns, if you hadn't noticed, on both sides. GREENE: And you excuse that. MORICI: I basically try to focus as an economist. Remember, I'm not a Trump surrogate. GREENE: Yes. MORICI: I try to focus on what I think will actually happen. GREENE: And what will actually happen? MORICI: I think what will happen is they'll put pressure on China and Mexico to renegotiate China's accession agreement to the WTO and to renegotiate NAFTA in places where American industry has complaints. Of course, with NAFTA, I think that probably the Mexicans will have complaints of their own, and it'll be a very interesting enterprise. With regard to China, the trade deficit with China is so one-way. You know, Barack Obama campaigned on the very same thing. He said he was going to do something about China. And one of the reasons we only have 2 percent growth in this recovery as compared to Ronald Reagan's 4. 5 percent growth during his recovery is because of the whopping trade deficit he said he'd fix and did not. GREENE: Is that a fair point, Jared Bernstein? BERNSTEIN: No. I mean, I think the - what I hear Peter saying is what I hear a lot of people saying right now from the conservative side. He said Donald Trump said he'd do a lot of things that are pretty scary to an economist, but I don't really believe he'll do them. He says he'll start a trade war with China and slap 35 or 45 percent tariffs on it, but he won't really do that. He says he's going to deport all these people. He won't really do that. He has a $6 trillion tax cut and, no, don't worry. That's not going to happen. A trade war, a wall with Mexico, he's going to ignore climate change. Everyone is now trying to - everyone on the conservative side who's now trying to say really he's not going to be that bad, and, by the way, including Trump himself - now, maybe that's true. Maybe Donald Trump, you know, campaigned on a bunch of stuff he's not going to do, but he doesn't has - he certainly doesn't have a reservoir of trust with people like myself. And let me tell you. . . GREENE: But could he gain that trust? We have about 20 seconds left. I mean, if he does sort of make. . . BERNSTEIN: Of course he could. GREENE: . . . Small improvements on trade deals, would you come around to support those things? BERNSTEIN: Well, I mean, it would take a lot more than small improvements on trade deals. But no, look, I'm with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama who say open mind. Let's hope for success. But I - neither do I have the kind of amnesia that I'm hearing from a lot of his supporters - don't worry. He's really not going to do all that nasty stuff he said he'd do. GREENE: OK. Well, this is a conversation that is certainly going to continue, and I look forward to having you guys back on. Jared Bernstein, former chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden, and Peter Morici, a conservative columnist who teaches business at the University of Maryland, thank you both so much.

NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Many voters in the Rust Belt swing states of Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan who had voted for Barack Obama last week voted for Donald Trump, and some said a big reason was that they felt left behind and disconnected from the more prosperous parts of the country.

He signed a petition against Hillary Clinton's economic plan during the campaign, and it turns out Trump's people just reached out to him. RICHARD BURKHAUSER: Some people who asked me if I was interested in applying for a job. ARNOLD: And what did you say? BURKHAUSER: It's a very exciting possibility.

BURKHAUSER: And I think it would be extraordinarily exciting to be part of an administration that uses Republican ideas to do something for workers in the middle who have not enjoyed the benefits of economic growth in the last 20 or 30 years. ARNOLD: But could you do that just with Republican ideas? DAVID AUTOR: I don't think so. ARNOLD: David Autor's an economist at MIT known for his groundbreaking work on international trade with the U. S. and China, both its benefits and its devastating impact on some Americans. He says, look; Trump won with a fiery, populist, kick-the-bums-out-of-Washington campaign that promised to help working- and middle-class voters. But. . . AUTOR: I think the Republican Party has done extremely little for them. ARNOLD: Autor says he's not registered with any political party, but he says if Trump really wants to help the people in the Rust Belt, people left behind, this is not easy. And he needs to reach out beyond traditional Republican economists because he says they mostly focus on cutting taxes and regulation. AUTOR: Yes, I mean the irony is that, you know, if the Trump administration were looking for expertise in policy to improve the living conditions and working conditions of less-affluent Americans, they would look to a lot of Democratic and left-of-center scholars. ARNOLD: So Autor says it might be a moon shot, but if Trump can draw from the best ideas on the left and the right, then you might see a really effective mix of policies - tax credits for the working class that conservatives support, help with education and health care costs - more traditionally liberal ideas.

And even if they did, Autor says he's among many economists who would have a hard time forgetting Trump's campaign, which he saw as marked by race baiting, misogyny and xenophobia.

CECIL ROBERTS: (Chanting) UMWA, UMWA. . . DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: So it's Thursday afternoon in Uniontown. And that voice you're hearing right there is Cecil Roberts. He is the president of the United Mine Workers of America. They have a rally going on. You can just hear his voice echoing through the streets of this city, Uniontown, in Fayette County. It's one of the poorest counties in the state - heavily supported Donald Trump. This is coal country. There's a coal-town saloon right over there. But a lot of the coal jobs have gone away. There are closed businesses here, as we walk up to the square, where there are a lot of mine workers who've gathered. ROBERTS: Let's give our officers here a round of applause. They fight for you every single day. GREENE: So the rally's ended. I'm sitting here in the square, as they wrap up, with Walter Plevin (ph). Mr. Plevin, thanks for taking a few minutes. WALTER PLEVIN: No problem. GREENE: Tell me about you. Are you involved with the mine workers? PLEVIN: My whole family's been coal miners all their life. My dad, my uncles, grandpaps - and everything. And what we'd like to see - they do something with the coal again because so many people in this area - in our area around here - worked in the mine, you know? And now there's a lot of mines closed. And there's a lot of fellows without jobs. And to find a new job, you start all over again. If you've had 20 years in the mine, it's hard to do. GREENE: So Donald Trump promised to bring coal jobs back. PLEVIN: So he says. You know, we'll see. GREENE: Did you vote for him? PLEVIN: Yes, I did. GREENE: You're a Republican? PLEVIN: I'm a Democrat. GREENE: You're Democrat. Is that one reason you supported him - hoping to get the coal jobs back here? PLEVIN: Correct. Yes, I did. GREENE: How long will you give him to start bringing those jobs back? PLEVIN: That I couldn't answer (laughter). How could anybody really answer that? You know, we got four years so far, right? So see what happens. GREENE: All right, Mr. Plevin. Thank you. PLEVIN: I'm going to move along. GREENE: Really appreciate it. PLEVIN: My back's killing me. GREENE: Thanks for the time. PLEVIN: All right, bud. GREENE: Nice to meet you. PLEVIN: You, too. GREENE: So now the scene is kind of shifting here in this square from union event to the event that's taking place tonight, which is Home for the Holidays. And the person who's now going have to rush to set up the square is Tina Allen (ph). And I'm standing here with her. How much work is this going to be? TINA ALLEN: Well, most of it's already done - the hard part. I just have a little bit of touch-ups to do. I have to wait for my vendors to get here. GREENE: You're a busy woman. ALLEN: I'm very busy. Today's a very busy day for me (laughter). GREENE: And who did you vote for? ALLEN: I voted for Donald Trump. GREENE: And then tell me why. ALLEN: Well, my husband is a coal miner. And if he's unemployed, where's he going to go? He's almost 60 years old. You know, where are you going to go find a job? You're not. So I'm hoping that at least the mine that is existing now will stay for a while. GREENE: And Donald Trump said he's going to bring coal jobs back. ALLEN: You know, I don't know. You know, I know his heart is there. It's a difficult job, I believe, to actually say, I'm going to open this mine or I'm going to do that. I can only hope that what is there now - maybe they'll hire more people. Maybe they'll get more places for our coal to go to. That's what I'm hoping for. GREENE: What do you need to see him do - and how quickly - for you to stay on board? ALLEN: My main thing is with Obamacare. I think insurance should be the No. 1 priority because I know my daughter - what they're paying for insurance now is ridiculous. GREENE: And she's on Obamacare? ALLEN: I'm not sure if it's Obamacare. But it's still with - you know, the insurance is just outrageous. Everyone I talked to that's on Obamacare - it has almost doubled. So something needs done. GREENE: You want Trump to repeal the law like he says? ALLEN: I hope so - or modify it. GREENE: Or improve it? ALLEN: You know - yeah, either or. GREENE: Are you a Democrat? Republican? ALLEN: I'm a Democrat. But I'm ready to change Republican. So, you know, I've gotten into fights with my mother over it because she's a strict Democrat. We didn't speak for days. I was told if my grandfather was living, he would disown me. GREENE: You stopped speaking to your mother for. . . ALLEN: Oh, yes. My mother stopped speaking to me over it. And I said, Mum, I've got to do what I have to do. And, actually, the following day, you know, she was OK with it. GREENE: So tell me about tonight. What is this square going to look like in a few hours? ALLEN: Well, tonight, it's going to be absolutely beautiful. We'll have - the mayor will turn the lights on. It should be wall to wall with people. And it'll be a lot of joy and happiness. GREENE: Is there something even more special about tonight, given what this country's just been through? ALLEN: It is. It is. I cannot wait to see everybody. My phone's been ringing off the hook. They can't wait to be here. They've thanked me. They cannot wait to be a community that's gathered for something very good. GREENE: So it's a few hours later now. And this downtown and main street has just been transformed into small-town holiday fever. If this is a struggling community, I mean, it is a community with a lot of spirit. I mean, the cheerleaders are right over there getting ready for the parade. They're selling hot chocolate - and antique chair is set up for Santa Claus. And there are people who come from different political persuasions because I'm standing with a Hillary Clinton supporter, Jim Davis, who we've actually had on the program before. You're the Democratic county chairman for Fayette County. How are you? JIM DAVIS: I'm fine. I'm fine. It is a very festive occasion, isn't it? GREENE: Oh, it's the perfect time of night. DAVIS: It's beautiful. GREENE: Jim, I mean, you were telling me back in the spring you saw a lot of Democrats switching their party registration for Donald Trump, saw Republicans turn out in bigger numbers in the primary. Do you feel like you saw the writing on the wall at that point in this election? DAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, we did. We did. And maybe we didn't want to see it. We didn't want to accept it. But yes, we did. It was obvious. GREENE: Do you blame Hillary Clinton for this? DAVIS: I don't blame her. I blame - I think our system is one in which we tend to think that people have a right to run for a certain office. And that's not good. There shouldn't be a right. It should be - you earn it. And competition is better. GREENE: You feel like there was just sort of an assumption she's the. . . DAVIS: Yeah. I think a lot of good candidates assumed she would be the candidate, she would be the next president. And they stepped out. GREENE: What should your party do right now broadly? DAVIS: I think the first thing we have to do is reinvent what we stand for. We have to start appealing to working-class people that live here and work here and not worry about the social issues that seem to be what we keep talking about in the national media. We need to talk about how we can develop infrastructure for jobs, how we can bring jobs here - jobs that are decent - not a job that pays $8 an hour and no benefits - but a job that can pay a reasonable wage with benefits - that a man can raise his family, can hopefully buy a house and send his children off to college - maybe state school - but college. That's the kind of thing we've got to start talking about. GREENE: Jim Davis, attorney and Democratic county chairman for Fayette County, thanks a lot. DAVIS: Thank you. GREENE: And everyone in town seems to be gathering now in the square, where we began the day. The mayor's getting ready to light the Christmas tree. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Five, four, three, two, one.

It's the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Group. It's likely President Obama's last international trip as president and the first big discussion of trade since the election of Donald Trump as president, who has promised to pull out of major trade deals. Now world leaders are also trying to figure out the way forward for the largest ever U. S. proposed trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which aimed to open up markets between the U. S. , Canada and 10 other Pacific and Asian nations other than China. To find out more about the summit, we reached Financial Times world trade editor Shawn Donnan, who is in Lima covering the summit. Shawn, thanks so much for joining us. SHAWN DONNAN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Well, you know, obviously these meetings are planned well in advance. But in the wake of the election of someone with such a diametrically different view of policy, what's the goal of these talks both for President Obama and other nations? DONNAN: APEC is an organization that's all about economic integration. It's all about trade. It's all about lowering trade barriers. And clearly, when you have Donald Trump, someone who ran on a platform that was about ripping up trade agreements, about pulling the U. S. out of this agreement that President Obama has spent so many years negotiating, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, there's a feeling that there is potentially a real big change on the horizon, that the U. S. may be moving towards a more protectionist stance towards some of its Asian trading partners. We're also seeing a kind of rebalancing at the table, if you will. Traditionally, the U. S. has really been the leading power in the room when they have gathered for these summits, and this time around there's a lot of people looking to China and to President Xi Jinping for leadership. And he, on Saturday, gave this pretty extraordinary speech where basically he said, hey, you know the big advocate of free trade in the world? Well, that's us now. That's China. MARTIN: How was that received? DONNAN: I mean, he drew two standing ovations. He drew great cheers in the room. The audience here, these are really the advocates of free trade in the world. These are countries like China, countries like Indonesia, Canada, Mexico that really feel that they've done very well from trade over the years in trade agreements. And so they're gathered this morning and they're trying to figure out what it is that they're seeing in the West. This wave of anti-globalization that you saw that helped elect Donald Trump, they're trying to figure out how that is upending things. MARTIN: As we mentioned, the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be between the U. S. , Canada and 10 other Pacific and Asian nations. China is not currently included in that. Was there any discussion about how this could go forward without the U. S. ? DONNAN: Absolutely. The other countries that are involved in the TPP have been talking for a few days now about how they might reconstitute this thing. Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, saying, look, we're still committed to this thing. This is still important to us. If the U. S. can't be part of it then we're going to try and find a way to make sure that it goes ahead. Likewise Pena Nieto, the Mexican president. We expect to hear the same thing from Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister. On the other hand, there's a rival trade agreement on the table, something called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership which China is leading that has 16 countries in it, including at least seven TPP countries. And China's saying, well, you know what? If the U. S. isn't ready to sign this TPP, come over here and have a look. And we're starting to hear countries in Latin America like Peru and Chile and others say, well, maybe we'll take a look at joining that.

Now, a freeze is not unprecedented. Other administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have used them. But as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, even those who support the idea of paring down the federal workforce say a freeze is not the way to do it. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The civilian federal workforce is about 2 million, largely unchanged from the 1960s. With federal contractors and grantees, however, that figure balloons to 7 to 9 million workers. Cato Institute tax policy director Chris Edwards thinks the federal workforce should be smaller, but a hiring freeze, he says, won't get you there. CHRIS EDWARDS: If incoming president Donald Trump wants to reduce the size of the federal workforce, what he should really do is decide which programs he wants to cut or eliminate. NOGUCHI: Trump rode to victory in part promising thinner, more effective federal ranks. Rhetorically, a hiring freeze and his promises to drain the swamp seemed to address both issues. But they won't, says Paul Light, public policy professor at New York University. Big government may be unpopular, he says, but people do like their programs, from national parks to food inspection to Medicare. PAUL LIGHT: When you start really looking at what these jobs are, Americans kind of like what most federal employees do. NOGUCHI: Light says payroll and benefits make up less than 10 percent of the federal budget. He says freezes alienate good workers and don't save money. LIGHT: Some of your very best employees who can get a job in the private sector will take it. NOGUCHI: A 1982 Government Accountability Office report still cited by many experts found past hiring freezes cost the government more while also resulting in less collection of taxes and other revenue. LIGHT: You might end up bringing in service contract employees who are more expensive. NOGUCHI: And Trump's hiring freeze does not specifically cover contractors. James Sherk, research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, says using contractors is still preferable to hiring workers directly. He says because of unions and appeals processes, it's far too difficult to fire underperforming federal workers. JAMES SHERK: It's essentially a lifetime commitment, and if you're not satisfied with the work, there's not much you can do about it. With a contractor, if you're dissatisfied with the work, you just don't renew the contract. NOGUCHI: Sherk says without a hiring freeze, agencies have less incentive to look for fat to cut. SHERK: You're not looking for the efficiencies because you don't need to find them. NOGUCHI: Donald Kettl, public policy professor at University of Maryland, says he believes the freeze reflects a desire among Americans for a better functioning government. DONALD KETTL: The irony here is that if the goal was to make government work better to try to get it more under control, the hiring freeze is exactly the opposite of what you need to do. NOGUCHI: Kettl says government agencies don't just need to blindly downsize. They need to do a better job of identifying the skills and talent they need, especially in a crisis. KETTL: The bottom line here is, we have to figure out what it is we want to do and what it's going to take to be able to do it well and hire the people with the skills to make that happen. And we don't have a very good system in the federal government right now for doing that. NOGUCHI: Kettl warns that simply using freezes to cut federal agencies could backfire. Americans demand robust and functional government services when they need it. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   One item on Donald Trump's agenda for his first hundred days in office is to place a hiring freeze on federal employees. Now, a freeze is not unprecedented. Other administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have used them. But as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, even those who support the idea of paring down the federal workforce say a freeze is not the way to do it. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The civilian federal workforce is about 2 million, largely unchanged from the 1960s. With federal contractors and grantees, however, that figure balloons to 7 to 9 million workers. Cato Institute tax policy director Chris Edwards thinks the federal workforce should be smaller, but a hiring freeze, he says, won't get you there. CHRIS EDWARDS: If incoming president Donald Trump wants to reduce the size of the federal workforce, what he should really do is decide which programs he wants to cut or eliminate. NOGUCHI: Trump rode to victory in part promising thinner, more effective federal ranks. Rhetorically, a hiring freeze and his promises to drain the swamp seemed to address both issues. But they won't, says Paul Light, public policy professor at New York University. Big government may be unpopular, he says, but people do like their programs, from national parks to food inspection to Medicare. PAUL LIGHT: When you start really looking at what these jobs are, Americans kind of like what most federal employees do. NOGUCHI: Light says payroll and benefits make up less than 10 percent of the federal budget. He says freezes alienate good workers and don't save money. LIGHT: Some of your very best employees who can get a job in the private sector will take it. NOGUCHI: A 1982 Government Accountability Office report still cited by many experts found past hiring freezes cost the government more while also resulting in less collection of taxes and other revenue. LIGHT: You might end up bringing in service contract employees who are more expensive. NOGUCHI: And Trump's hiring freeze does not specifically cover contractors. James Sherk, research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, says using contractors is still preferable to hiring workers directly. He says because of unions and appeals processes, it's far too difficult to fire underperforming federal workers. JAMES SHERK: It's essentially a lifetime commitment, and if you're not satisfied with the work, there's not much you can do about it. With a contractor, if you're dissatisfied with the work, you just don't renew the contract. NOGUCHI: Sherk says without a hiring freeze, agencies have less incentive to look for fat to cut. SHERK: You're not looking for the efficiencies because you don't need to find them. NOGUCHI: Donald Kettl, public policy professor at University of Maryland, says he believes the freeze reflects a desire among Americans for a better functioning government. DONALD KETTL: The irony here is that if the goal was to make government work better to try to get it more under control, the hiring freeze is exactly the opposite of what you need to do. NOGUCHI: Kettl says government agencies don't just need to blindly downsize. They need to do a better job of identifying the skills and talent they need, especially in a crisis.

During his campaign, Trump promised the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution in the 1980s. A big chunk of Trump's tax cut would go to businesses. The president elect says that will lead to more investment and growth. Skeptics say the tax plan would explode deficits. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The president elect's proposal would slash the top business tax rate from 35 percent, the highest in the industrial world, to just 15 percent. But, Trump says, at the same time as he's cutting tax rates, he'll also close lucrative tax loopholes, like one called carried interest. It allows billionaire hedge fund managers to cut their taxes in half on big chunks of their income. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest. The - one of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you - I give up a lot when I run. YDSTIE: Len Burman of the independent Tax Policy Center says, far from being hurt, overall, Trump will probably be a huge beneficiary of his proposed tax plan. LEN BURMAN: Donald Trump has said that his 15 percent rate would apply to all businesses. And if that's the case, billionaire real estate magnets will get a very big tax cut. YDSTIE: Steve Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a senior economic adviser to Trump, helped develop the tax cut proposal. Moore says it would not just aid big businesses but also small ones. STEVE MOORE: Every small business in America would also get this 15 percent tax rate as long as they reinvest the profits back into the company. YDSTIE: But the Tax Policy Center sees a huge loophole opening here, one that would benefit high income people. Len Burman says these top wage earners could decide to transform themselves into business contractors. BURMAN: I would tell my employer I'm now a contractor rather than an employee. And, you know, I'll send you an invoice for my services. And then I'll pay a 15 percent tax rate instead of a 33 percent tax rate. YDSTIE: The Tax Policy Center estimates this would cost the U. S. government $650 billion in lost tax revenue over 10 years. But Steve Moore says if individual wage earners tried this strategy, the Trump administration would respond. MOORE: That's scamming the system, and we want to make sure that people don't have an opportunity to shift their income from one type to another just to take advantage of these lower tax rates. We're going to try to slam shut those loopholes. YDSTIE: That's easier said than done, says Len Burman. Steve Moore says in addition to the huge cut in business tax rates, the Trump proposal would also allow businesses to immediately write off the cost of investments rather than deducting them over a period of years. The result, he says, will be more investment that will boost worker productivity, wages and growth. And that will produce more tax revenue, he says. MOORE: Now, look, I'm not saying the tax cuts are going to pay for themselves. But I do think there's an economic growth dividend that you get. YDSTIE: In the short run, that may be true, says Len Burman. But in the long run, he argues the economy will suffer because the tax cuts will create huge budget deficits and higher interest rates. BURMAN: Over the long run, there'd be less investment, lower wages and a smaller economy than there would have been without the plan. YDSTIE: Steve Moore says any shortfall in tax revenue will be covered by cuts in federal spending. If that's the case, it would require cutting about half of all the government's non-defense discretionary spending, which includes federal funding for law enforcement, education, transportation and research.

NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam is here once again. Hi, Shankar. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: How could you find that out? VEDANTAM: Well, we've known for a long time that there are correlations between wealth and cognitive function, Steve. People with more money are less likely to suffer from cognitive decline, although we don't know why that's the case. You know, maybe having more money reduces the risk of things like Alzheimer's disease, but maybe it's also something else. Maybe you could say smart people earn more money. INSKEEP: People with healthier brains. . . VEDANTAM: Right. INSKEEP: . . . Earn more money over time, sure. VEDANTAM: And those smart people also have the kind of brain wiring that makes it less likely that they'll get Alzheimer's disease. So there could be all kinds of reasons for this correlation. I was speaking with the health economist Padmaja Ayyagari at the University of Iowa along with David Frisvold. She told me she's just analyzed data from an unusual natural experiment. INSKEEP: Natural experiment meaning something that just happened that gives an opportunity to test this question of whether money makes the brain work better? VEDANTAM: Precisely. So in the 1970s, Congress made a computational glitch in the way it gave out Social Security benefits, leading to some people essentially getting higher benefits for the rest of their lives than the next cohort that came right after them. Now, in social science terms, we essentially had two groups or cohorts very similar to one another. INSKEEP: One's getting paid more. VEDANTAM: Exactly. One got about $1,900 dollars a year more in today's money. Ayyagari and Frisvold analyzed survey data looking at cognitive function among members of these two cohorts. PADMAJA AYYAGARI: We find that people who received higher Social Security benefits, they end up with better cognitive function. And maybe more interestingly, we also find that this improvement is clinically meaningful, that it's not just a small change, that there is a change in the probability that someone would be classified as cognitively impaired or as demented. INSKEEP: So I'm going to have a healthier brain if I'm getting paid more? VEDANTAM: That seems to be the case. Now, it's almost as if you ran an experiment where you gave one group of people more money in retirement and then compared them to another group that was very similar in every other way. Now, you couldn't conduct an actual experiment like this because it would be unethical, but this formula glitch in Social Security in the 1970s produced this natural experiment. INSKEEP: Well, what are the implications of this, Shankar? VEDANTAM: Well, I asked Ayyagari about that. Here's what she said. AYYAGARI: Policies like Social Security, they can have benefits that go beyond just the financial. This can lead to improvements in the health of older adults. This also has implications for the families and caregiving and things like that. VEDANTAM: You know, Steve, if you wanted to, you could look at this only from a financial perspective. When you're asking how much to spend on things like Social Security, one thing to consider is that some of that money might reduce spending elsewhere, such as in the treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive problems down the road.

The reservation lies in the heart of the Bakken oil patch, and oil production is embraced here. Edmund Baker is the tribal environmental director. EDMUND BAKER: We're in this oil play already.

He walks with me around Newtown, with lots of retail and traffic heavy with pickups - a telltale sign we're in the oil patch. Oil's a way to help MHA's 15,000 tribal members be self-sufficient, and there's a ton of money involved - upwards of nearly $2 billion in revenue just since 2008. Here's tribal chairman Mark Fox. MARK FOX: All this high cost of living that the oil boom created - we're trying to alleviate that. SISK: With the new apartments for residents, a new health care system and payments of a thousand dollars to each tribal member three times a year, with that oil wealth has come a spike in crime and some environmental risks. FOX: And we sure as hell don't want to do it in such a way that we taint or diminish the value of our most important asset, which is water. SISK: One million gallons of wastewater leaked from a pipeline in 2014, threatening the reservoir holding the reservation's drinking water. Though they embrace oil production, tribal leaders are also embroiled in a dispute over pipelines, much like the Standing Rock Sioux to the south. They're concerned about a pair of new crude and natural gas lines slated to cross under the reservoir. FOX: We're not against all pipelines, the ones on our land. But what we are against is when pipelines come onto Fort Berthold through other entities and think they're going to develop or utilize pipelines without the approval of our tribe. SISK: MHA Nation has tried to halt construction, but a federal judge is allowing work to continue, saying the company has the necessary permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, the same agency Standing Rock is fighting in courts over the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Companies like Amazon and FedEx who help you shop and ship are especially interested in the development of automated vehicles. That's where the future of driverless cars might first become a reality. NPR's Sonari Glinton joins us. Sonari, thanks so much for being with us. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: It's a pleasure as always. SIMON: So driverless cars - this is where we'll see them first? GLINTON: Yeah. I mean, think of when you're driving down an interstate, and you look at the line of tractor trailers that stretches to the horizon. Those trucks will likely be the place where we get it first because, if you think about it, the consumer - the hundreds of millions of us who are, you know, drive around in cars - we might be reluctant. But you know who's not? Trucking companies, which employ about 9 million people in the U. S. SIMON: That's a lot of jobs. Will they all be lost? GLINTON: Well, some of those jobs are definitely going to be lost. But it is in that last mile that is the most critical part of delivery. But if you think of the long haul, that's likely where it's going to go first. SIMON: Let's understand why, too. Automated trucks don't have to stop to sleep. They don't have to stop to go to the bathroom. They don't have to go to a truck stop to eat. Fill in the blanks. GLINTON: Exactly. There are a lot of things that these vehicles won't do. And one of the things is that they will be safer. They'll be more efficient, be 24 hours. And when we look at job losses, I mean, 120 years ago, people, you know, feared for the blacksmith. And then we got the rise of the auto industry. But what it looks like here is that the jobs that will replace those long-haul trucking jobs will be a lot more difficult, require a lot more training and a lot more technological skill than, say, driving a long-haul tractor trailer. SIMON: Right now, when we read about experimental runs from long-haul trucks - driverless long-haul trucks - they emphasize that they have someone in the cab in case something goes wrong or just to be there to oversee the process. Would delivery companies eventually like to get rid of that person in the cab? GLINTON: You can see, you know, that that is a cost that the companies want to get rid of. I mean, right now, you know, in the wake of Black Friday, people want free shipping, free shipping, free shipping. And that is a place where companies are looking to lower their costs - right there. And because we're demanding it - the consumers want that. They want that free shipping. SIMON: Sonari, I have to ask you about the attitude of labor unions. I mean, long-haul truckers. These are teamsters. They don't say, welcome future. Here are our jobs. GLINTON: No, definitely not. And these are - a lot of these are good, well-paying jobs. And this is - you know, the labor unions in part are trying to retrain workers. But there is this fear in general about - what are we going to do with these thousands of workers who will be likely out of jobs very soon? This is not in, you know, 15 years. This is in five to 10. SIMON: NPR's Sonari Glinton, thanks so much. GLINTON: Always a pleasure, Scott. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   A lot of Americans ask themselves these days, why brave the crowds in stores when you can do your holiday shopping in your pajamas on your sofa? Companies like Amazon and FedEx who help you shop and ship are especially interested in the development of automated vehicles. That's where the future of driverless cars might first become a reality. NPR's Sonari Glinton joins us. Sonari, thanks so much for being with us. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: It's a pleasure as always. SIMON: So driverless cars - this is where we'll see them first? GLINTON: Yeah. I mean, think of when you're driving down an interstate, and you look at the line of tractor trailers that stretches to the horizon. Those trucks will likely be the place where we get it first because, if you think about it, the consumer - the hundreds of millions of us who are, you know, drive around in cars - we might be reluctant. But you know who's not? Trucking companies, which employ about 9 million people in the U. S. SIMON: That's a lot of jobs. Will they all be lost? GLINTON: Well, some of those jobs are definitely going to be lost. But it is in that last mile that is the most critical part of delivery. But if you think of the long haul, that's likely where it's going to go first. SIMON: Let's understand why, too. Automated trucks don't have to stop to sleep. They don't have to stop to go to the bathroom. They don't have to go to a truck stop to eat. Fill in the blanks. GLINTON: Exactly. There are a lot of things that these vehicles won't do. And one of the things is that they will be safer. They'll be more efficient, be 24 hours. And when we look at job losses, I mean, 120 years ago, people, you know, feared for the blacksmith. And then we got the rise of the auto industry. But what it looks like here is that the jobs that will replace those long-haul trucking jobs will be a lot more difficult, require a lot more training and a lot more technological skill than, say, driving a long-haul tractor trailer. SIMON: Right now, when we read about experimental runs from long-haul trucks - driverless long-haul trucks - they emphasize that they have someone in the cab in case something goes wrong or just to be there to oversee the process. Would delivery companies eventually like to get rid of that person in the cab? GLINTON: You can see, you know, that that is a cost that the companies want to get rid of.

Economist Stephen Moore told lawmakers they're not in the party of Ronald Reagan anymore. STEPHEN MOORE: Donald Trump's victory has changed the party into a more populist working-class party in some ways that conservatives like myself will like and some that will be uncomfortable with. INSKEEP: Now, we don't know how much the party will change, but Trump adviser Stephen Moore came by to tell us why he changed. Like Reagan and many Republicans, Moore backs free markets and free trade. Just last year he criticized Trump for his attacks on trade deals, his threats to rework them or impose big tariffs. Moore insists he is still a free trader. But after meeting Trump, he says he sees the issue differently. MOORE: I think Americans are generally in favor of trade but they want to make sure that it happens in a way that doesn't cost people in the Midwest their livelihoods. INSKEEP: If protectionism was a bad idea economically before, isn't it still? MOORE: Sure. Protectionism is a bad idea. And obviously trade is a good thing. But I think we also have to recognize that even though as a country we benefit from free trade, that there are people who have been victimized by trade. And those are a lot of the people in these industrial Midwestern states. And I have to say, I traveled a lot with Donald Trump on the campaign trail. And I did a lot of campaigning myself. And I went to these places like York, Pa. and places like Milwaukee, Wis. And I saw this economic distress of these areas. And you can understand why these people are skeptical of trade. INSKEEP: Well, let's remember though, there have been a lot of presidential candidates and some successful presidents who criticized China specifically on trade or other issues during the campaign. And then the reality strikes and either you deal with China or you don't deal with China. Is there really a way to make all the deals so much better without becoming a protectionist and yanking up tariffs? MOORE: I guarantee you that Donald Trump is going to be a much tougher negotiator with China. Now how that turns out, I don't know. I believe that China's economy is highly dependent on the United States market. And Donald Trump has made this point, look, we have leverage over China. They need us probably more than we need them. INSKEEP: Since you talked about leverage over China I have to put this on the table, whether China is going to have leverage over the president-elect who has borrowed money from a Chinese bank for a building in Manhattan, who wants to do real estate deals in China. MOORE: You mean - you're talking about his personal deals? INSKEEP: I'm - his personal deals, yes. MOORE: Right. INSKEEP: Are they going to have leverage over him? He hasn't clarified how, if at all, he would separate himself. MOORE: No, I don't believe so. I think Donald Trump is going to put his business dealings aside. And, by the way, he must do that if he's going to be a successful president. And I believe he will be. He has got to put his personal business concerns to the side and act in the national interest. And Americans are going to demand that. INSKEEP: So we had Jonah Goldberg of National Review on the program on Friday. And your name came up because you had made this statement that Republicans were no longer the party of Reagan. And let's listen to something of what Jonah Goldberg said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)JONAH GOLDBERG: Steve Moore, who I've known for a long time, I'm friendly with Steve, but he has been the foremost deacon in the church of Ronald Reagan for decades. And for him to go out and say that this is no longer the party of Ronald Reagan, I can't find a better analogy but it's pretty close to the pope saying, you know, Jesus shmesus (ph), you know? INSKEEP: (Laughter). We were laughing there, you're laughing here. MOORE: I'll laugh, too. And Jonah is a friend of mine, by the way. Look, as pertains to Ronald Reagan, I worked for The Gipper. Jonah's right, I think Ronald Reagan truly was one of our great presidents. I think - if I had my way, I would put him on Mount Rushmore. But the point I've made over and over to these lawmakers is, look, this is 2016. It's not 1986. We have different problems in this country that we did when Ronald Reagan was president. The voters have different concerns. I think what Donald Trump did which was so amazing, one of the things I admire the most about the president-elect is the way that he saw something out there in the voters that no one else saw. INSKEEP: It's interesting that you said it's 2016, not 1986, because it's pretty well documented that a lot of the things that Trump has said that appeal to people about the economy especially are things that he has been saying since the 1980s. And that he wants to revive industries that were big in the '80s or even before that in the '50s, saying we're going to bring all the steel jobs back even though the steel industry has transformed in ways that it just doesn't employ as many people. MOORE: True. INSKEEP: Does it make sense to just turn back the clock 50 or 60 years economically? MOORE: No. But it's - and there's no question about the fact that a lot of the jobs that have been lost are never coming back. INSKEEP: Even though he said, we're going to bring all the jobs back? Just not going to happen? MOORE: Well, let me kind of clarify my position. INSKEEP: Sure. MOORE: By the way, you know, I remember when I was 9 years old and my parents took me to a auto plant in Michigan. And I remember it as if it was yesterday, you know, it had a big impression on me. People on the lines working hard, you know, lifting heavy equipment and, you know, those were grimy jobs. Those were hard working hard hat workers. You go into a - just a few months ago I went into a Ford plant, you know, it's nothing like that. It's people working with. . . INSKEEP: It's robots. MOORE: . . . Yeah, robots. And people were working with diagnostic equipment and so on. And so, yes, of course things are different. But I do believe that we can bring factories and jobs and companies back to the United States with a better tax system and a better regulatory system. So this idea that these areas have to be left for dead, no. I think we can have coal mining jobs again in this country. I think we can have steel jobs. I think we can have manufacturing jobs. We can make things again. And we can do that because we have the best-trained workers. We have the lowest-cost energy. And when then we're going to have a public policy system that makes America competitive. INSKEEP: During the campaign, Mr. Trump said that he was going to work to preserve jobs that the Carrier Corporation has in Indiana. . . MOORE: OK. INSKEEP: . . . Making air conditioners so forth. . . MOORE: Yes. INSKEEP: . . . Basic manufacturing jobs. They're supposed to go to Mexico where wages are much, much cheaper. MOORE: Right. INSKEEP: He demanded that Carrier preserve the jobs in Indiana. Carrier said, not going to do that. Then over the Thanksgiving holiday, the president-elect tweeted that he was talking with Carrier and that he was working on that. Now as a guy from Indiana, I totally sympathize with the idea of keeping good jobs in Indiana. But I do wonder if, as a conservative economist, you can approve of the idea of the president of the United States calling a specific company and demanding that they make a specific change that they don't feel is in their business interest? MOORE: I certainly don't think any president should demand that of a company. But I don't have a problem with a president working with a company to try to keep jobs here in the United States. I think that's one of the reasons that Donald Trump was elected. I mean, these voters really took a leap of faith that this is a man who will stand for them. INSKEEP: If it gets right down to it on free trade. If the president tries to get a new deal with China, get a new deal with Mexico, doesn't work out and he says, OK, time for the 35 percent tariff that I've talked about. MOORE: I hope not. I oppose tariffs. I think tariffs are a terrible idea. I've told Donald Trump that. I view my role, to the extent I have one with Donald Trump, is to try to push him in as much the right direction on some of these issues as I can. And I've tried to tell him and he's actually used this in some of his speeches - trade is good. He says, I'm not a protectionist. I'm not an isolationist. But we have to make sure when we do trade, it's fair and free. And you know what? I've come around to that idea, too. INSKEEP: Stephen Moore, thanks for coming. MOORE: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)INSKEEP: He's an adviser to President-elect Trump and a consultant with FreedomWorks.

They based this on research that seemed sound, and they tracked movements in the market. But the market has been on a big rally since Trump won, so what happened? NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Right before the votes were cast, economist Eric Zitzewitz was making a pretty dire prediction about what would happen if Donald Trump won. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ERIC ZITZEWITZ: This election is going to be a very big deal economically. The market really cares. ARNOLD: Zitzewitz said in past years, he and his research partner predicted a 2 percent swing in the U. S. stock market, depending on which presidential candidate won. This time, though, it was a far bigger swing - 12 percent - trillions of dollars hanging in the balance. It seemed that Trump was such a wild card he was scaring investors. ZITZEWITZ: The stock market doesn't want Trump to win. ARNOLD: Of course, that turned out to be completely backwards. The markets hit new all-time records after Trump won. So some people are saying that these respected economists kind of messed up here, and one of those people is my editor, NPR's Uri Berliner. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Yeah, right. So the S&P 500 is up 3 percent since Trump's win, so they were totally wrong, like so many of us were about this election. I mean, they were not even close. ARNOLD: Well, I think there were actually right. And to me, it just seems like the market changed its mind - that they were measuring something properly, but then something changed. BERLINER: No, I think they were totally wrong. ARNOLD: OK. So Uri and I have been having a mostly friendly argument about this since the election. So we decided to go back and talk to the economists about this and also about what is going on with the stock market. ZITZEWITZ: My name is Eric's Zitzewitz, and I'm an economist at Dartmouth. JUSTIN WOLFERS: My name is Justin Wolfers. I'm a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. ZITZEWITZ: I don't want to sound defensive, but - correct me if I'm wrong, Justin - but both of us agree with Chris that the market changed its mind. WOLFERS: Yeah. So I think Eric and I have had exactly the same debate between ourselves. This is where I say we were right until we were wrong. ARNOLD: Justin Wolfers says, look, what they were measuring was pretty simple. They were looking at moments where key events happened in the campaign. When, say, the FBI said it was looking at Clinton's emails, the odds of Clinton winning went down, and the stock market went down. They could do math and figure out how much this was affecting the stock market, and both economists stick by their numbers. And on election night, at first, the market kept behaving that way. WOLFERS: As the count proceeded and it became increasingly likely that Trump was going to be president, we saw stock markets cratering. By about midnight on election night, the U. S. stock market was down about 5 percent, which actually hit the circuit breakage, so our predictions looked very good. ARNOLD: But then Trump came out and spoke. He talked about infrastructure spending. He looked more presidential. Maybe that's why, but for some reason, more investors got more optimistic and started buying stocks, and the market went up. Now, maybe it's not surprising that the economists agree that they were measuring things properly, but here's the part that they admit Uri is right about. Uri asks what is the use of research like this if the accuracy of the results is so short-lived? BERLINER: They were right for maybe the first few hours after it was clear that Trump won. But I think they failed to understand or predict what would happen when people started to absorb the Trump victory. WOLFERS: It's dead right, and I plead guilty. And let me say the other people who should plead guilty is every trader in financial markets. ARNOLD: But why did investors in the market so completely change their minds? There are a bunch of theories out there. One is that there's something about human psychology that makes us look at things differently once they're a reality and not just some imagined future. So maybe that's why investors started focusing more on the stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending instead of fear and uncertainty. Also, maybe there's a momentum factor here. ZITZEWITZ: That's a possible story where, you know, the rally feeds back into political capital for Trump, which makes it possible for him to do a mix of things that's more helpful for the economy. ARNOLD: And because of that, the stock market keeps rising. And while it's embarrassing that their prediction only lasted a few hours, Zitzewitz says. . . ZITZEWITZ: I really hope the market's current forecast about Trump, which is much more benign, turns out to be more correct than the pre-election one. ARNOLD: But I guess as we just learned, everything might change tomorrow. ZITZEWITZ: Yeah, exactly. ARNOLD: Chris Arnold, NPR News.

There are a bunch of theories out there. One is that there's something about human psychology that makes us look at things differently once they're a reality and not just some imagined future. So maybe that's why investors started focusing more on the stimulus of tax cuts and infrastructure spending instead of fear and uncertainty. Also, maybe there's a momentum factor here. ZITZEWITZ: That's a possible story where, you know, the rally feeds back into political capital for Trump, which makes it possible for him to do a mix of things that's more helpful for the economy. ARNOLD: And because of that, the stock market keeps rising. And while it's embarrassing that their prediction only lasted a few hours, Zitzewitz says. . . ZITZEWITZ: I really hope the market's current forecast about Trump, which is much more benign, turns out to be more correct than the pre-election one. ARNOLD: But I guess as we just learned, everything might change tomorrow. ZITZEWITZ: Yeah, exactly. ARNOLD: Chris Arnold, NPR News.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

It was the second timber mill to close in the area in six months. Now, this part of the country is a Republican stronghold, and as NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, there are mixed feelings there on whether President-elect Trump can help the industry recover. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Two mill closures putting a hundred people out of work is a big deal for any community, but it's especially a shock for a small, tight-knit town like Orofino, Idaho, population 3,000. MIKE REGGEAR: Yeah, as of October 4 - was the closure date to the saw mill. SIEGLER: So most of the offices have emptied out apart from yours, and. . . REGGEAR: Correct. SIEGLER: The only employee left on the Tri-Pro payroll is Mike Reggear, the manager. He's tying up some loose ends. The shuttered lumber yard is eerily quiet - the old mill, the kilns, the saws ready to be hauled out. REGGEAR: You know, it's - (laughter) it's going to be a struggle, quite honestly. It really is. I mean they were living-wage jobs that now have been lost. SIEGLER: The story behind Tri-Pro's closure is an all too familiar one lately in North Idaho. Reggear says there just weren't enough local logs available to keep the saw mill running and profitable. Imports from Canada are cheaper, and the amount of federal land around here open to logging has dropped tenfold since the 1980s. But just like any economic story in rural America right now, it's more complicated than that. Timber towns like Orofino that are situated along railroad lines and rivers were put on the map more than a hundred years ago when it seemed like there was a limitless supply of timber in these woods and the federal government actively promoted logging. But the environmental mood of the country is a lot different today, and so is the economy. Mechanization has meant that fewer people are needed to log the woods and work in the mills. (CROSSTALK)SIEGLER: One night over Coors Lights at the Ponderosa Restaurant in town, Jerry Spencer says he feels lucky he can still find work as a logger around here. JERRY SPENCER: Logging anymore's about an eight-month-a-year deal, so we try to diversify a little bit because - can't live on eight months a year. SIEGLER: Spencer and a buddy had been splitting time between here and the oil fields over in North Dakota until oil prices tanked. He's not that eager to talk politics, but he's glad Donald Trump won. SPENCER: I really hope that things are going to be better, but I'm not going to bet on it just yet, you know? I'm Republican. Almost everybody in this county is Republican. It's logging, resource-based county, and that's just how it is. SIEGLER: Spencer isn't that optimistic because he says that even if Trump were to open up more federal land to timber companies, there's hardly any infrastructure left. But he says the president-elect's talk about returning to a time when natural resources were king resonates here. SPENCER: Those resources is what built this country. I mean you say what you want, but it was all built off of mining, timber, oil. You know, the United States wasn't built off of tech companies. SIEGLER: Folks around Orofino are proud of their heritage as loggers and miners. Today, Clearwater County has one of the highest unemployment rates in Idaho. In the small downtown, there are for-lease signs and empty storefronts. A lot of people work two or three jobs at the school, the Best Western or for one of the outfitters where they have to commute 40 miles downriver to Lewiston. But when it comes to the latest mill closure, most folks will tell you everyone's seen this coming for years. CHRIS ST GERMAINE: Well, the first thing you do is, you know, cuss and kick the ground and rant a little bit, but the second is, you pull yourself up by those bootstraps and figure, OK, where do we go from here? SIEGLER: Chris St. Germaine moved to Orofino to take a job with the Forest Service in the '80s. She now runs the county's one-person Office of Economic Development where she's trying to figure out how to diversify the economy. And it hasn't been all doom and gloom. A new rifle scope manufacturer opened up. So did a jet boat company. The hope is to draw more manufacturers that cater to the fishing and hunting economy. ST GERMAINE: Drift boating is something that I think that would go over very well here. And there's a lot of drift boats on the river today if you look because they're fishing for steelhead and salmon. SIEGLER: But this is all long-term stuff, and it's not going to help people like Pat Goetz, who's trying to figure out what she can do for work right now. PAT GOETZ: Good question (laughter) - I don't know. SIEGLER: She lost her job and - worse, she says - her health insurance when the mill shut down. So far, she says the only job she's seeing advertised are minimum wage. GOETZ: Once you take timber out of the equation in counties like Idaho County, Clearwater County, there isn't much else. SIEGLER: Goetz is 63. She's not yet eligible for Medicare, and she's not sure if she can afford the cost of health care on the exchanges. She also didn't think twice about voting for Trump. She's hoping he can bring back timber towns like hers. GOETZ: Young kids have to go somewhere else in order to make a living. My children had to move out. My youngest daughter did and her husband. SIEGLER: Goetz says she gets depressed watching, as she puts it, an industry that's being strangled to death. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Orofino, Idaho.

He railed against Wall Street. But now as president-elect, he's tapped Wall Street veterans for key economic posts - Stephen Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross for secretary of commerce. NPR economic correspondent John Ydstie joins us now to talk about how Trump's choices match up with his campaign rhetoric. And, John, it sounds like these choices aren't very populist. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Right. These are two very wealthy individuals who made lots of money on Wall Street. At least one, Wilbur Ross, is a billionaire who made a fortune buying and restructuring distressed industrial companies. The other, Steve Mnuchin, is a veteran of Goldman Sachs who currently runs a private hedge fund. And back during the financial crisis, he and some partners bought a failed California bank from the FDIC. After managing it for seven years, they sold it for a tidy $1. 5 billion profit. Critics called the bank a foreclosure machine and say that under Mnuchin it failed to help homeowners modify their loans so they could keep their homes. So neither comes off as much of a populist, but both are viewed as smart, solid, very capable businessmen. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Right. Stocks have actually been up sharply since the election. Wall Street seems to like the direction Trump is going in. So can we read that the market thinks these guys are on their side? YDSTIE: Well, you know, big banks have enjoyed big gains during this - since the election partly because Trump has promised to roll back banking regulations. But I think Mnuchin and Ross would say the stock market is mostly responding positively to the centerpiece of Donald Trump's economic plan - his huge tax cut proposal. It would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent way down to 15 percent. They say that's going to boost business investment, create more jobs and produce faster growth and higher wages. And they say the individual part of the tax plan will provide a big income tax cut for the middle class but no reduction in taxes for the rich. CORNISH: So that's basically how they address this question of whether Trump's policies will match his populist message. But you've reported on this, and you've talked with tax analysts who take issue with those claims, right? YDSTIE: That's right. Both conservative and liberal tax experts say the rich will actually gain the most. They also say the big tax plan will add between $3 trillion and $6 trillion to the deficits over the next 10 years, which would actually hurt long-term growth. CORNISH: Now, what about trade policy because Donald Trump said he would walk away from trade agreements like NAFTA that he says are bad for workers. So with these kind of Wall Street veterans at the helm, is that likely to happen? YDSTIE: Well, you know, Wilbur Ross will be an interesting player here. He's owned companies in the steel industry, for instance, that have faced intense foreign competition but also benefited from protectionism. He's moved factories overseas. He's dealt with all kinds of trade issues. He argues that the U. S. is actually hurt by these big, multi-nation trade deals like the Transpacific Partnership which Trump says he'll scuttle. Ross says you can make better deals in negotiating with countries one by one. That would be a significant change from the approach of the last 20 years, with the potential for big economic effects, both positive and negative. So it's going to be interesting to see how it all plays out. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

President-elect Trump yesterday celebrated a deal that will keep close to 1,000 jobs at Carrier in Indianapolis, though other Carrier jobs will still go to Mexico. Trump fans cheered this move. Mr. Trump himself says he forgot his campaign promise to save Carrier but was reminded after the election by a TV report. Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate, doesn't like this, noting that the government paid incentives to Carrier, which other corporations may now demand. The debate is especially stark on the right. And we're going to hear two views from the right on this move. First, Don Evans, commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, who likes the symbolism. DONALD EVANS: I think what the president-elect is clearly doing is talking about how he's going to focus on jobs in America. It's clear that he's going to take the government's attitude toward the private sector in a different direction than it has been going for the last eight years, I would say. As to getting involved, I mean, you can't get involved in every business all across America. You have to create the environment for those businesses to do so well, and that's exactly what President-elect Trump has in mind. INSKEEP: I think I'm hearing you say that this is a perfectly nice thing to do symbolically but not a good idea to do all the time. EVANS: Well, I'm just saying you cannot do it all the time. You've got too many things on your plate, you know? There will be isolated situations from time to time. This happens to be one of them that was brought up during the course of the campaign. He wanted everybody to know that, as president, he's going to fight for jobs in America. Now, exactly how this all came down and what added incentives were thrown in there or not thrown in there, I have no idea. But I don't think it's a bad thing for the president to send the strong message to the workers of America that he's going to create the environment for them to do well right here and - and send that same message to the corporations of America. INSKEEP: Is there a right way and a wrong way for a president to intervene economically with different companies? EVANS: Well, look, you can't - certainly, over the long haul, you can't get into the mode of picking winners and losers. I mean, the great hallmark of this country is we love to compete. And so what I think government's role needs to be, should be, will be under this president-elect, I'm confident, is create a playing field for our companies in America to compete not only here at home but around the world and provide that environment so companies here in America are willing to stay here, employ more people and build their companies here in America instead of some other country in the world. INSKEEP: Sounds like you very much favor the direction that tax policy seems to be going here. Republicans in Congress and the new president want tax rates - corporate tax rates, especially - to be lower. What do you think of the new president's approach to free trade? EVANS: Fair trade - I think he wants fair trade. That's what I would want. I think the world is continuing to become more integrated all the time. Ninety-five percent of the people live outside the borders of the United States. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're going to trade with the rest of the world, but it's got to be fair trade. INSKEEP: If President-elect Trump goes after one of his signature campaign promises - to revoke NAFTA or renegotiate it - it sounds like maybe you would hope for the renegotiate side - tweaking it but keeping it. EVANS: Yeah, no, I'm absolutely for keeping it, no question about it. Are there some provisions in it that need to be reviewed and looked at? I'm sure there are. But the idea that you're going to shut off trade with countries around the world and turn it into some kind of trade war makes no sense. INSKEEP: Don Evans, it's a pleasure talking with you. Thanks very much. EVANS: Thank you. Great - yeah, enjoyed it very much. INSKEEP: Don Evans was commerce secretary during the first term of President George W. Bush. A different view of President-elect Trump's move with Carrier comes from Tyler Cowen, who is a professor of economics at George Mason University and identifies as libertarian. Don Evans says this is a way for the president-elect to send a strong message to workers and to corporations about what his priorities are. What's wrong with that? TYLER COWEN: We're supposed to live under a republic of the rule of law. Not the rule of man. This deal is completely non-transparent. And the notion that every major American company has to negotiate person-to-person with the president over Twitter is going to make all business decisions politicized. INSKEEP: What do you mean it's nontransparent, first of all? COWEN: We don't know exactly what the company is getting. There's plenty of talk that the reason Carrier went along with the deal was because they were afraid their parent company would lose a lot of defense contracts. So this now creates the specter of a president always being willing to punish or reward companies depending on whether or not they give him a good press release. INSKEEP: Why don't you explain to me the thing about the parent company, which is United Technologies? COWEN: Yes, they do a lot of defense contracting. It's at least 10 percent of their revenue. Carrier, from the state of Indiana, was already offered the tax break before the election. They turned it down. Now, all of a sudden, Trump is President. Bernie Sanders is telling Trump to threaten the defense contract of the parent company, and now, all of a sudden, the company takes the deal. And Trump is known for being somewhat vindictive. This, to me, is scary. It indicates an environment where business decisions are now about how much you please the president. INSKEEP: Now, you just said an interesting thing. Bernie Sanders, a socialist of the Democratic Party, did, a few days before the deal was announced, say that Trump ought to use the leverage of the defense contracts to get United Technologies to change its behavior. We don't know on a factual basis that's actually what happened, but - but you're noting that this is kind of a leftist thing to do. COWEN: That's correct. Trump and Bernie Sanders, for all of their populist talk, their are actual recipes in both cases lead to crony capitalism. INSKEEP: What's crony capitalism? COWEN: Crony capitalism is a system where businesses who are in bed with the government and who give the president positive press releases are rewarded and where companies who oppose or speak out against the president are, in some way, punished. INSKEEP: David Wessel of the Brookings Institution said on our air the other day that this act reminded him of something that is done from time to time in France - under the socialist government in France. And I'm also thinking of Venezuela, where the late President Hugo Chavez would go on TV and denounce companies and demand that companies do specific things. And of course, the economy there has ended up being a complete mess. Is that - is that a fair comparison at all? COWEN: Well, we're not close to that point yet, but we're taking baby steps in that direction. And the way you avoid getting to that point is by having people speak out when they see the baby steps. INSKEEP: If the president-elect gets results, at least some of the jobs - at least for now - are staying in Indiana. Does it really matter how he does it? COWEN: Well, keep in mind the broader numbers. Since the year 2000, Indiana has lost 150,000 manufacturing jobs. And this, at best, assuming all goes well, saves a thousand of those. So to actually make a dent in the problem, jawboning isn't the way to do it. It's changing economic incentives and making it more cost-effective to hire people in the United States. And none of this really does that. INSKEEP: Tyler Cowen, thanks very much. COWEN: Thank you. INSKEEP: He's with George Mason University, and he's one of the views we're hearing about a deal to save some jobs at Carrier. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Let's hear two of the many interpretations of a move to save some jobs in Indiana.

But I don't think it's a bad thing for the president to send the strong message to the workers of America that he's going to create the environment for them to do well right here and - and send that same message to the corporations of America. INSKEEP: Is there a right way and a wrong way for a president to intervene economically with different companies? EVANS: Well, look, you can't - certainly, over the long haul, you can't get into the mode of picking winners and losers. I mean, the great hallmark of this country is we love to compete. And so what I think government's role needs to be, should be, will be under this president-elect, I'm confident, is create a playing field for our companies in America to compete not only here at home but around the world and provide that environment so companies here in America are willing to stay here, employ more people and build their companies here in America instead of some other country in the world. INSKEEP: Sounds like you very much favor the direction that tax policy seems to be going here. Republicans in Congress and the new president want tax rates - corporate tax rates, especially - to be lower. What do you think of the new president's approach to free trade? EVANS: Fair trade - I think he wants fair trade. That's what I would want. I think the world is continuing to become more integrated all the time. Ninety-five percent of the people live outside the borders of the United States. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're going to trade with the rest of the world, but it's got to be fair trade. INSKEEP: If President-elect Trump goes after one of his signature campaign promises - to revoke NAFTA or renegotiate it - it sounds like maybe you would hope for the renegotiate side - tweaking it but keeping it. EVANS: Yeah, no, I'm absolutely for keeping it, no question about it. Are there some provisions in it that need to be reviewed and looked at? I'm sure there are. But the idea that you're going to shut off trade with countries around the world and turn it into some kind of trade war makes no sense. INSKEEP: Don Evans, it's a pleasure talking with you. Thanks very much. EVANS: Thank you. Great - yeah, enjoyed it very much. INSKEEP: Don Evans was commerce secretary during the first term of President George W. Bush. A different view of President-elect Trump's move with Carrier comes from Tyler Cowen, who is a professor of economics at George Mason University and identifies as libertarian. Don Evans says this is a way for the president-elect to send a strong message to workers and to corporations about what his priorities are. What's wrong with that? TYLER COWEN: We're supposed to live under a republic of the rule of law. Not the rule of man. This deal is completely non-transparent. And the notion that every major American company has to negotiate person-to-person with the president over Twitter is going to make all business decisions politicized. INSKEEP: What do you mean it's nontransparent, first of all? COWEN: We don't know exactly what the company is getting. There's plenty of talk that the reason Carrier went along with the deal was because they were afraid their parent company would lose a lot of defense contracts. So this now creates the specter of a president always being willing to punish or reward companies depending on whether or not they give him a good press release. INSKEEP: Why don't you explain to me the thing about the parent company, which is United Technologies? COWEN: Yes, they do a lot of defense contracting. It's at least 10 percent of their revenue. Carrier, from the state of Indiana, was already offered the tax break before the election. They turned it down. Now, all of a sudden, Trump is President. Bernie Sanders is telling Trump to threaten the defense contract of the parent company, and now, all of a sudden, the company takes the deal. And Trump is known for being somewhat vindictive. This, to me, is scary. It indicates an environment where business decisions are now about how much you please the president. INSKEEP: Now, you just said an interesting thing. Bernie Sanders, a socialist of the Democratic Party, did, a few days before the deal was announced, say that Trump ought to use the leverage of the defense contracts to get United Technologies to change its behavior. We don't know on a factual basis that's actually what happened, but - but you're noting that this is kind of a leftist thing to do. COWEN: That's correct. Trump and Bernie Sanders, for all of their populist talk, their are actual recipes in both cases lead to crony capitalism. INSKEEP: What's crony capitalism? COWEN: Crony capitalism is a system where businesses who are in bed with the government and who give the president positive press releases are rewarded and where companies who oppose or speak out against the president are, in some way, punished. INSKEEP: David Wessel of the Brookings Institution said on our air the other day that this act reminded him of something that is done from time to time in France - under the socialist government in France. And I'm also thinking of Venezuela, where the late President Hugo Chavez would go on TV and denounce companies and demand that companies do specific things. And of course, the economy there has ended up being a complete mess. Is that - is that a fair comparison at all? COWEN: Well, we're not close to that point yet, but we're taking baby steps in that direction. And the way you avoid getting to that point is by having people speak out when they see the baby steps. INSKEEP: If the president-elect gets results, at least some of the jobs - at least for now - are staying in Indiana. Does it really matter how he does it? COWEN: Well, keep in mind the broader numbers. Since the year 2000, Indiana has lost 150,000 manufacturing jobs. And this, at best, assuming all goes well, saves a thousand of those. So to actually make a dent in the problem, jawboning isn't the way to do it. It's changing economic incentives and making it more cost-effective to hire people in the United States. And none of this really does that. INSKEEP: Tyler Cowen, thanks very much. COWEN: Thank you. INSKEEP: He's with George Mason University, and he's one of the views we're hearing about a deal to save some jobs at Carrier.", "section": "Politics", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

They're just a tiny fraction of the thousands of young adults that make the nation's capital their temporary home for the duration of their unpaid government internship. CARLOS VERA: If America runs on Dunkin' Donuts, D. C. runs on unpaid internships. SHAH: That's Carlos Vera. He interned at the White House two years ago. VERA: For any person that loves politics, it's a dream being at the White House. And then once I was in that other side, I realized it's not as glamorous as sometimes you think. SHAH: Interns are expected to work at least 9 a. m. to 6 p. m, Monday through Friday - 40-plus hours a week with no pay. Vera says work was fulfilling.

So, yeah, at that point, I was like, I think I've done enough unpaid internships. SHAH: So Vera started a campaign called Pay Our Interns. Their guiding principle - how much money your parents make shouldn't keep you from getting work experience. It's something that hits close to home for Vera. VERA: One thing that the White House required is you had to bring in a suit every day, and that's something that they don't think about. Like, suits cost a lot of money. So my dad, my two aunts and my uncle had to all pitch in money so I could just buy one suit. SHAH: There are federal laws that regulate unpaid internships.

The president-elect has been promising big change, though he will inherit an economy delivering better results than many had predicted. So let's talk it through. Peter Morici teaches at the University of Maryland. He's a conservative economist. Welcome back. PETER MORICI: Nice to be with you. INSKEEP: And he's here once again with Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist to Vice President Biden and also wrote the book \"The Reconnection Agenda. \" Glad to reconnect with you, Jared. JARED BERNSTEIN: Thank you. INSKEEP: Glad you're both here. So, Peter, let me let you start. Unemployment is the lowest in years - 4. 6 percent. Wages are finally climbing, but the president-elect described the situation as a disaster. Does the country really need drastic economic change right now? MORICI: Well, the country does need economic change. We've only been growing at a slow 2 percent. And the reason the unemployment rate is so low is because so many people have opted out of the labor force. It would be beneficial if we could get wages moving a little bit more quickly and we could create, say, 250,000 jobs a month instead of 170. INSKEEP: And do you feel you see how the president-elect is going to do that? MORICI: Well, I know how he's going to try. We're going to get a Republican-style tax cut. We're going to roll back regulation. And in some vague way, we're going to get tough on trade. It's going to be very interesting to see how he quite does that, but more to be written. INSKEEP: Jared Bernstein, can this work? BERNSTEIN: Well, first of all, I think the economy is doing much better than the word disaster would imply. I mean, the 4. 6 percent unemployment rate, a 9-year low, is as Peter suggested somewhat depressed by low labor force participation. But in fact, we've been creating jobs at a healthy clip, such that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to raise interest rates because they think the economy's growing too quickly. I think that would actually be a mistake, but we definitely are closing in on full employment. So will it work? Look, tax cuts and the deregulatory agenda, we've tried that before. And all that does is exacerbate this inequality problem because these tax cuts give, in the Trump case, 300,000 in tax cuts to the top 1 percent and $900 to the middle class. So they do that. Meanwhile, the deregulatory agenda is just the type of thing that inflates these bubbles we've been having trouble with. INSKEEP: Peter Morici, you look skeptical as he's giving these points. MORICI: Well, I mean, we have to look at the cycle of tax cuts we had. Reagan cut taxes on everybody and Clinton raised them mostly on upper-income individuals. Bush, the second Bush, cut taxes for everybody and Obama raised them mostly on upper-income individuals. So we have a tax structure that is much more skewed towards taxing the wealthy than we did, say, 30 years ago. It's hard to avoid if you're going to have tax cuts to create growth, giving wealthy people more of the benefits. Now, we have been through this before, right? And we cut taxes, we deregulated all that business, right? And with Reagan we had 4. 5 percent growth. From Reagan to Clinton, we had 3. 5 percent growth. Obama Bush, - 2. 2 we Do need a change in direction. INSKEEP: Well, let me ask about the regulatory side of this because the president-elect has let it be known that his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency is the Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. He's a skeptic of human-caused climate change. He's a harsh critic of regulations on carbon emissions and so forth. So he's against regulation, I get that part. But before. . . MORICI: Well, he's against foolish regulation. INSKEEP: . . . Before the election I was in the poorest county in North Carolina. And it's a place that is regularly flooding now in ways that may very well be linked to climate change. And it's not good for people to be constantly flooding. I mean, I have to ask if setting aside concerns about climate is really going to be good for people on the bottom economically. MORICI: Well, I think we have to have a reasonable climate change program. And what we're seeing here is a course correction. The EPA got very extreme and now the pendulum is swinging back. INSKEEP: Is it a course correction or just saying climate isn't a problem and going to ignore it? I mean, is that. . . MORICI: I don't - I cannot apologize for that for you. I'm not going to support that position. And asking me to do so is silly 'cause it's never been a position I've embraced. INSKEEP: Understand. MORICI: A change is a real problem. However, cutting back CO2 emissions in the United States with China adding another Japan every two years, I mean, not having meaningful. . . INSKEEP: You mean in terms of the amount of climate. . . MORICI: . . . Commitments really isn't going to solve the problem. Until we really have a China policy that requires them to toe the line on climate change among a plethora of other issues, we're not going to get much by cutting down fossil fuel use in the United States. INSKEEP: Jared. BERNSTEIN: I think this is way - I think you're this much too complicated. If you look back at what George W. Bush did when he got elected - by the way, the last guy to win the presidency without the popular vote. What you see there is a deregulatory. . . INSKEEP: I see how you dropped that in there, by the way. Go on. MORICI: He had to get that. . . INSKEEP: He got it in, got it in. BERNSTEIN: Well, the reason I do that, it's not just arbitrary. It's that this is - these folks are acting on a really - an illegitimate mandate in my view. And. . . MORICI: No, it's legitimate. It's not illegitimate. BERNSTEIN: . . . Hold on, wait, let me finish, Peter. So and what you see in the George W. Bush years was these very big high-end tax cuts and a deregulatory agenda including climate and financial markets. Now, what did you end up with? In the case of financial markets, you ended up with a massive housing bubble inflated by this deregulated finance and our budget deficit was massively disadvantaged by these high-end tax cuts. We're looking at precisely the same economic policies now. And the thing about Trump which is interesting is he's dangling the keys over here with things like the Carrier plant and now, you know, the Air Force One being too expensive and getting lots of attention for these, you know, sort of sideshows and these optical things, where this is a very damaging economic agenda and let's not overlook that. INSKEEP: Is this a fact that that cutting taxes and spending more infrastructure and other things that the president-elect wants to do will explode deficits? Is that just basic math? Peter. MORICI: Well, I think it depends on how much you cut taxes. I don't think we can have the kind of tax cut package that he campaigned on. However, I think we need to reform the tax structure so it's more reasonable and people spend less time gaming it and more time focused on being productive. INSKEEP: I want to give you each about 30 seconds to answer one other thing. We had the libertarian economist Tyler Cowen on the other day who complained about crony capitalism by the president-elect, calling out individual companies, demanding things from them that he wants in a way that has - have no rules to it that seem to reinforce his power. Is the president-elect engaging on his way to crony capitalism? Jared, you get 20, 30 seconds here. BERNSTEIN: Sure. This is - yeah. I mean, it is in the sense that this is not a systemic kind of approach to the downsides of trade or globalization and thereby it won't work. If you essentially go around and cherry pick this company that gets a check and that one that gets a check to bribe them to keep jobs here, that's not a systemic approach. INSKEEP: Peter, you get the last word. MORICI: We need systemic change. I agree with Jared on that. And I think the Carrier issue we don't want to see repeated over and over again. It's not crony capitalism. It's just selective incentives. But rather, what it is is a signal. You know, companies like Apple know if they don't do - invest in China, China will violate their intellectual property, make it difficult for them to sell their phones and so forth. Now what the president is saying is if you don't invest in America, you're going to have problems here, too. INSKEEP: Peter Morici, thanks very much for coming by. He's with the University of Maryland. Also Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Thanks to you as well. BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

Is the president-elect engaging on his way to crony capitalism? Jared, you get 20, 30 seconds here. BERNSTEIN: Sure. This is - yeah. I mean, it is in the sense that this is not a systemic kind of approach to the downsides of trade or globalization and thereby it won't work. If you essentially go around and cherry pick this company that gets a check and that one that gets a check to bribe them to keep jobs here, that's not a systemic approach. INSKEEP: Peter, you get the last word. MORICI: We need systemic change. I agree with Jared on that. And I think the Carrier issue we don't want to see repeated over and over again. It's not crony capitalism. It's just selective incentives. But rather, what it is is a signal. You know, companies like Apple know if they don't do - invest in China, China will violate their intellectual property, make it difficult for them to sell their phones and so forth. Now what the president is saying is if you don't invest in America, you're going to have problems here, too. INSKEEP: Peter Morici, thanks very much for coming by. He's with the University of Maryland. Also Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Thanks to you as well.

People may have felt that for a long time. Now there's a body of research to back that up. One definition of the American dream is that your children will make more money than you did. Now economists have charted the percentage of people who make more than their parents did at the same age, and the picture is striking. David Leonhardt is a columnist for The New York Times, and he suggested that the economists do this research. Welcome to the program. DAVID LEONHARDT: Hi, good to be on. SHAPIRO: David, you call this the index of the American dream. First tell us what the economists looked at. LEONHARDT: These economists led by Raj Chetty, a professor at Stanford, and also professors at Harvard and Berkeley - they managed to take records that track people over years to figure out whether people out-earn their parents once you adjust for inflation, which I think is a really good basic definition of the American dream because we know our parents for our whole lives. You can see their living standards. And so you get a sense for, am I making progress? Is my community making progress? Is my country making progress? SHAPIRO: So you start in, like, 1940. And if you were born in 1940, what was the likelihood that you would make more money than your parents did? LEONHARDT: That's what's remarkable. It's 92 percent, which is to say, if you were born in 1940, you were virtually guaranteed to out-earn your parents even if you encounter difficulties in your life, even if you didn't finish a level of school, even if you dealt with an illness. So really because the economy was growing so rapidly and its gains were being shared widely, nearly everyone could expect to have at least their parents' living standards. SHAPIRO: When you look at people who were born in 1980, which is the most recent data - so today, you're 36 years old. What's the likelihood that you make more money than your parents did? LEONHARDT: It's only 50 percent. And I know that people sometimes now talk so despairingly about the state of the economy, that they might say, wow, it's still 50 percent. But 50 percent to come down from 92 percent is really worrisome. It's come down the most, maybe not surprisingly, in the industrial Midwest. And so we now have essentially half the country that is not out-earning their parents, that by this very basic standard is not achieving the American dream. SHAPIRO: What fundamentally changed to make that number fall so dramatically? LEONHARDT: Two things changed. The economy doesn't grow as rapidly as it used to. But that's not the most important change. The most important change is the rise in inequality. When you dig into the numbers, what you see is the main reason most people are not out-earning their parents is that the gains from our economic growth goes so disproportionately to a small group of people at the top. And that makes it harder for most people to get ahead. SHAPIRO: What sorts of policies could reverse these trends? LEONHARDT: I think the evidence says that the single most important policy is education. College graduates do appear to be out-earning their parents despite the scare stories you hear about student debt. It's not just education, though. You also want to think about tax policy. If inequality is much higher than it used to be, it's not clear to me that you want to cut taxes on the rich rather than cutting them on the middle class and the poor. There are a whole set of policy things to think about. They're not easy, but we do basically know how to reduce inequality if, as a society, we want to set our minds to that. SHAPIRO: The group that did the best, that was born in the 1940s, lived through an incredible post-World War II boom before globalization and technology started taking away jobs. Is it realistic to believe that America will someday see an economy like that again? LEONHARDT: That's a really important point. No, it is not realistic to think that we can get back to the economy of the 1950s and '60s. But I do think it's realistic to do better than we are doing now. Again, the main reason why this index of the American dream has fallen is that inequality has risen so much. It is possible to have an economy with less inequality. It is possible to have a tax code that gives fewer of its benefits to the wealthy and more to the middle class. It is possible to spend more of our societal resources and attention improving education for kids in the middle and at the bottom. So while we're not going to get back to those nostalgic days of the 1950s and '60s, we can do substantially better than we're doing. SHAPIRO: It's possible to do those things. Is it realistic to do those things? Do you see the country moving in those directions? LEONHARDT: I don't, which worries me. One of the striking things about this moment is that Donald Trump won in part by tapping into the frustration of this declining American dream more effectively than any politician had in the last several years. It is not at all clear from his list of policies that he is going to do things to improve the situation. And so while I tend to be an optimist, I do not see huge reasons for short-term optimism about this turning around. SHAPIRO: That's David Leonhardt, New York Times columnist.

Donald Trump certainly hammered that theme home during this year's campaign. The country's lost more than 7 million factory jobs since the late 1970s, and yet the amount of stuff the U. S. produces is at an all-time high. A lot of these jobs have not been lost to other countries, according to Michael Hicks who's an economist. He co-authored a report last year - \"The Myth And Reality Of Manufacturing In America. \" He says automation is responsible. Michael Hicks who teaches at Ball State University joins us now from the studios of Indiana Public Radio in Muncie. Professor Hicks, thanks for being with us. MICHAEL HICKS: It's good to be with you. SIMON: And, boy, Indiana has been in the crosshairs of this recently - hasn't it? - because of the Carrier plant. What do you make of President-elect Trump's representation that hundreds of jobs were saved? HICKS: Well, clearly, for the workers that are there, it appears that there are going to be more jobs available for the next several years. The question that I have is whether or not the jobs are saved or the workers are saved? As the plant probably goes through an automation period, we just don't know how many of the workers that are there now are going to be able to fit into the new, highly technical automated factory of 2020. SIMON: Yeah. Do you believe people that talk about our outsourcing haven't accounted for the powerful impact of automation in industry? HICKS: You know, it's very clear to me in talking about the subject and writing about it for the past couple of years that there's a real disconnect between what we talk about, which is jobs floating overseas to Mexico and China and Vietnam, and the reality, which is that automation and technological improvement have really accounted for the vast majority of job losses in Indiana nationwide. SIMON: Yeah. Well, explain to us how that works. How could we be producing more stuff with fewer people? HICKS: Everything from statistical process control that cuts down on waste and mistakes and measurement to robotics. And digitisation of a production process is going to make things quicker. So to sort of put in context, in 1990, the average American autoworker made 13 cars a year. In 2010, the average American autoworker made 18 cars a year. So we don't need as many auto workers as we did a generation and a half ago. SIMON: Are new jobs being created by automation? HICKS: To be sure, they're harder to see, but the entire tech industry is really fueled by the need for factories and for service providers to have more technology. And then, you know, of course, logistics - between the time that manufacturing peaked in 1977 and today, we're down about 7 and a half million manufacturing jobs, but we're up about 9 and a half million logistics jobs. SIMON: What about the promise that I daresay some people find to be smug that is sometimes made to people who work in factories? Oh, don't worry. More jobs are going to be created, and we'll train you for those. Is that practical? HICKS: You know, it's a difficult thing to ask a 56-year-old guy or gal who hasn't been around middle school math since the early '70s to, you know, jump into a training program at our community technical college or with our workforce development board and get retooled for a technology job or to work in a health care setting. It's a very difficult thing to do. I mean, we may have to face up to it, but it's not a simple and seamless task. SIMON: Are we talking about a landscape eventually in this country - and I don't mean in two or three years, but I perhaps within the lifetimes of people listening - where there is no manufacturing? Everything is robotic. HICKS: That's an interesting question. I think it's - to think about the challenge that manufacturing may face, is - it's good to look at agriculture. We were, within living memory, at a time when most Americans in the Midwest and certainly the grain states - Nebraska, Kansas - were working in agriculture, and those are very important industries. Two thousand fifteen was a record agricultural production here in the United States. We're doing that with a very, very small share of the population. So the challenge of places like Muncie or Youngstown or Detroit that have a lot of manufacturing is - what are you going to do afterwards to keep people here that was less successful for much of the agricultural industry?

That's when workers get paid time off to recover from a birth, to take care of a newborn or a sick family member or themselves. The U. S. is one of the few Western countries without some kind of paid leave, which is one reason it made such a splash when the daughter of then candidate, now President-elect Donald Trump pushed a paid leave proposal. Earlier this year, we looked at a local proposal for paid leave here in Washington, D. C. As originally proposed, it would have been the most generous in the nation at 16 weeks. The proposal is moving forward with the local city council, but it remains controversial for many of the same reasons that such plans are moving slowly nationwide. Mainly they put a lot of pressure on small business. To sort all this out for us, we invited back Councilmember Elissa Silverman, one of the proposal's authors, to give us an update. Welcome back. Thanks for coming. ELISSA SILVERMAN: Great to be here, Michel. MARTIN: We also have here with us in the studio restaurant owner Jonathan Cho. He's got two restaurants in Washington, D. C. - Sakuramen, and he's the co-owner of BUL Korean Restaurant. JONATHAN CHO: That is correct. MARTIN: All right. Thanks so much for joining us as well. CHO: Thank you. MARTIN: So first, Councilwoman, to you. The original proposal was 16 weeks. Now it's down to eight weeks for parental leave, six weeks for family leave, two weeks for self-care. And it's also taken a long time, it seems to me, to move this through the system. Is that true? SILVERMAN: We've had a robust discussion about this bill, Michel. We've had three public hearings. I introduced the bill with my co-introducer, David Grosso, in October of 2015, and here we are in December of 2016 debating the bill. We've had a first vote. It passed 11 to 2. And we're on to our second vote and hopefully implementation soon. MARTIN: Remind us again of how this is paid for. SILVERMAN: This is paid for through an employer-based payroll tax. It's a . 62 tax - so very modest. In terms of the business side, we have done a study in our council's budget office showing that in fact in California, where they've had a program for a dozen years - in New Jersey, in Rhode Island - in fact this can be a very pro-business bill because there are business benefits. MARTIN: Jonathan, let's hear from you on this. CHO: I think that any existing program, whether it's across this country or around the world, are at least partially if not fully funded by payroll deductions. And it's not solely upon the business. Now, here in D. C. , here we have this - a very well-intentioned goal to try to implement a paid family leave program which I believe most people are certainly supportive in principle. MARTIN: I was going to ask you that, though, because we didn't even get to that question - is, do you in principle think it's a good idea? CHO: Absolutely, but there are also. . . MARTIN: Wouldn't it be hard on you, though? I mean you're not a huge. . . CHO: It will definitely be. . . MARTIN: . . . Business. I mean you're not, like, a big-box store. . . CHO: No, we're not. MARTIN: . . . With hundreds of employees. How many do you have? CHO: No, we're not. We have about close to 50 total between the two restaurants. That's both full-time and part-time. MARTIN: So you would be covered by this. CHO: Yes, absolutely. MARTIN: OK. CHO: I think the D. C. law would actually cover anyone no matter how many employees you have. MARTIN: And you have to pay their entire salary for the entire period of leave. CHO: D. C. - no - D. C. is up to a thousand-dollar cap. I believe it's per week, which is the highest in the country. MARTIN: Elissa Silverman, (unintelligible) go back to this question because as my understanding is, as this bill was originally conceived, the original idea was that everybody would pay a little bit. Both workers and owners would pay a little bit. Wasn't that right? SILVERMAN: So Michel, I want to - I hope that Jonathan will be enrolled in our problem and your listeners will be enrolled in our problem that we're not a state. Congress restricts our ability to tax income at its source, which means we can't tax commuters who live out of state and then work in our city, which is a majority of the workers in our city. MARTIN: Well, that leads to the question, though, that the major paper in the Washington, D. C. , area, The Washington Post, has suggested that that's part of the problem here - that you've got a benefit that is being paid for solely by district business people. But most of the people who would benefit don't live in the city. Is that, A, true? And is that fair? SILVERMAN: I don't think it's fair because this is a pro-business bill. MARTIN: But it's true. SILVERMAN: Well, it helps district businesses in terms of lower costs because they're going to have lower employee turnover. That is a tremendous savings to businesses. MARTIN: And how do you respond to that, Jonathan? CHO: I already take very good care of my employees, and they're already well-incentivized through our regular compensation. The fact that D. C. has raised the minimum wage and it's going to be 15 - a full $15 - we've already made adjustments to try to accommodate that law. Now we're being asked yet again to make adjustments. And to exactly your point, we can't tax Maryland and Virginia residents who work in D. C. - that somehow we're going to still force this law through on the backs of small businesses. You know what? They'll just make more assessments. Just by saying this is going to help businesses long-term does not make it true. SILVERMAN: Every time we do something to benefit working families in our city - when we banned smoking, I heard that every restaurant was going to move to Virginia and, you know, the heart of tobacco country and Altria's headquarters. Then when we raised the minimum wage, I heard that this was going to devastate businesses. Our economy is one of the strongest in the country and stronger than our neighbors. When we gave workers paid sick days - heard the same thing. Our economy continues to grow. So I can make a correlation saying, you know what? When we pass bills that actually help working families, our economy improves. MARTIN: Jonathan, I gave Councilmember Silverman in the first word, so I'll give you the last word on this. CHO: OK. When you present a very human situation at people who may encounter life situations, whether that's a baby or a sickness and so on, of course the human, natural, obvious reaction is society needs to do something that's going to help them. But at the same time, I think that the D. C. Council - in their zeal to accomplish the very noble goal of delivering paid family leave, they've ultimately violated a fundamental principle of sustainable governance, which is, if you're trying to be socially responsible in your governing but if you do so in a fiscally irresponsible manner, it's going to be ultimately self-defeating and non-sustainable. MARTIN: That's Jonathan Cho. He owns two restaurants in Washington, D. C. We also heard from D. C. Councilmember Elissa Silverman. Thank you both so much for talking with us. SILVERMAN: Thank you, Michel. CHO: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  One of the big issues we've been talking about on this program over the past year is paid family leave.

And we're on to our second vote and hopefully implementation soon. MARTIN: Remind us again of how this is paid for. SILVERMAN: This is paid for through an employer-based payroll tax. It's a . 62 tax - so very modest. In terms of the business side, we have done a study in our council's budget office showing that in fact in California, where they've had a program for a dozen years - in New Jersey, in Rhode Island - in fact this can be a very pro-business bill because there are business benefits. MARTIN: Jonathan, let's hear from you on this. CHO: I think that any existing program, whether it's across this country or around the world, are at least partially if not fully funded by payroll deductions. And it's not solely upon the business. Now, here in D. C. , here we have this - a very well-intentioned goal to try to implement a paid family leave program which I believe most people are certainly supportive in principle. MARTIN: I was going to ask you that, though, because we didn't even get to that question - is, do you in principle think it's a good idea? CHO: Absolutely, but there are also. . . MARTIN: Wouldn't it be hard on you, though? I mean you're not a huge. . . CHO: It will definitely be. . . MARTIN: . . . Business. I mean you're not, like, a big-box store. . . CHO: No, we're not. MARTIN: . . . With hundreds of employees. How many do you have? CHO: No, we're not. We have about close to 50 total between the two restaurants. That's both full-time and part-time. MARTIN: So you would be covered by this. CHO: Yes, absolutely. MARTIN: OK. CHO: I think the D. C. law would actually cover anyone no matter how many employees you have. MARTIN: And you have to pay their entire salary for the entire period of leave. CHO: D. C. - no - D. C. is up to a thousand-dollar cap. I believe it's per week, which is the highest in the country. MARTIN: Elissa Silverman, (unintelligible) go back to this question because as my understanding is, as this bill was originally conceived, the original idea was that everybody would pay a little bit. Both workers and owners would pay a little bit. Wasn't that right? SILVERMAN: So Michel, I want to - I hope that Jonathan will be enrolled in our problem and your listeners will be enrolled in our problem that we're not a state. Congress restricts our ability to tax income at its source, which means we can't tax commuters who live out of state and then work in our city, which is a majority of the workers in our city. MARTIN: Well, that leads to the question, though, that the major paper in the Washington, D. C. , area, The Washington Post, has suggested that that's part of the problem here - that you've got a benefit that is being paid for solely by district business people. But most of the people who would benefit don't live in the city. Is that, A, true? And is that fair? SILVERMAN: I don't think it's fair because this is a pro-business bill. MARTIN: But it's true. SILVERMAN: Well, it helps district businesses in terms of lower costs because they're going to have lower employee turnover. That is a tremendous savings to businesses. MARTIN: And how do you respond to that, Jonathan? CHO: I already take very good care of my employees, and they're already well-incentivized through our regular compensation. The fact that D. C. has raised the minimum wage and it's going to be 15 - a full $15 - we've already made adjustments to try to accommodate that law. Now we're being asked yet again to make adjustments. And to exactly your point, we can't tax Maryland and Virginia residents who work in D. C. - that somehow we're going to still force this law through on the backs of small businesses. You know what? They'll just make more assessments. Just by saying this is going to help businesses long-term does not make it true. SILVERMAN: Every time we do something to benefit working families in our city - when we banned smoking, I heard that every restaurant was going to move to Virginia and, you know, the heart of tobacco country and Altria's headquarters. Then when we raised the minimum wage, I heard that this was going to devastate businesses. Our economy is one of the strongest in the country and stronger than our neighbors. When we gave workers paid sick days - heard the same thing. Our economy continues to grow. So I can make a correlation saying, you know what? When we pass bills that actually help working families, our economy improves. MARTIN: Jonathan, I gave Councilmember Silverman in the first word, so I'll give you the last word on this. CHO: OK. When you present a very human situation at people who may encounter life situations, whether that's a baby or a sickness and so on, of course the human, natural, obvious reaction is society needs to do something that's going to help them. But at the same time, I think that the D. C. Council - in their zeal to accomplish the very noble goal of delivering paid family leave, they've ultimately violated a fundamental principle of sustainable governance, which is, if you're trying to be socially responsible in your governing but if you do so in a fiscally irresponsible manner, it's going to be ultimately self-defeating and non-sustainable. MARTIN: That's Jonathan Cho. He owns two restaurants in Washington, D. C. We also heard from D. C. Councilmember Elissa Silverman. Thank you both so much for talking with us. SILVERMAN: Thank you, Michel. CHO: Thank you.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's the promise to bring jobs back to the coal mines. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I went to Ohio coal country to hear what people there think of Trump's promise. The path of the Ohio River snakes southwest out of Pittsburgh. It's the border between Ohio and West Virginia. The foothills of the Appalachian Mountains rise along its banks, and beneath that Appalachian soil lay the minerals that have sustained the valley's economy - coal and now natural gas. To people far away who consume goods made with energy fueled by the Ohio Valley, coal and gas may be harmful agents of global warming. But to people in Ohio coal country, a good life on the ground is paid for by what's underneath it. And when Donald Trump made a thank-you tour appearance in Cincinnati this month, he said what many of them want to hear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: On energy, we will pursue energy independence and cancel the job-killing restrictions on the production of shale energy, oil, natural gas and clean coal. And we're going to put the miners of Ohio back to work. (CHEERING)SIEGEL: It's not hard to find Ohio miners who want to get back to work. ERIC MATTHEWS: My name's Eric Matthews. I'm recently laid off coal miner at the Ohio High Valley Coal Company from Shadyside, Ohio. SIEGEL: Eric Matthews is 37. He was born and grew up here in Belmont County along the Ohio River. After working for an engineering company in Columbus and getting an associate's degree there, he came back home and took up mining in 2010. His mine had a good union contract. MATTHEWS: Time and a half on Saturdays, double time Sundays, triple time holidays, triple time birthdays. We had nice insurance package. SIEGEL: And what was your best year working there? What did you make? MATTHEWS: Around $90,000. SIEGEL: It's a good job. MATTHEWS: Yeah. SIEGEL: Matthews now spends a lot of time at home with his kids. (CROSSTALK)SIEGEL: He was laid off in November when his employer declared his coal mine spent and shut it down. Matthews is very hopeful that his seniority will land him a job at one of the company's West Virginia mines. The prospects outside mining aren't nearly so attractive. MATTHEWS: My neighbor just two doors down - he's I think two years younger than me. He got laid off, and he recently got a job with the water department here in Shadyside. SIEGEL: Can you get a job with the water department that pays. . . MATTHEWS: No. SIEGEL: . . . Eighty, $90,000 a year? MATTHEWS: No, no - a fraction (laughter). He actually told me the other day that he makes less at his job now than he did when he was on unemployment. So. . . SIEGEL: Eric Matthews says he usually votes Republican, and he voted for Donald Trump. In fact, Belmont County, Ohio, which is historically Democratic, went overwhelmingly for Trump. But Matthews says he voted with little hope that Trump can bring back coal jobs. MATTHEWS: It's sort of one of those things where everybody says what they think you want to hear (inaudible). SIEGEL: But what you're saying is when it came to promises made about coal and jobs, you voted for Donald Trump despite assuming that he couldn't make good on what he was. . . MATTHEWS: I think he'll do more than what Hillary Clinton could, you know? SIEGEL: In this coal mining region of Ohio and neighboring West Virginia where most families have some history of working in mining, they speak of a war on coal. I met with a man who's a commander of the side defending coal. This is a transport hub on the Ohio River. It's operated by Eric Matthews' old employer, Murray Energy. Coal comes in by train and truck, and it leaves by river barge for power plants along the Ohio. It's a market of coal consumers that is rapidly shrinking as utilities convert to natural gas. In 2008, coal-fired plants produced 48 percent of the country's electricity. Last year, it was down to 33 percent. Bob Murray owns Murray Energy. It's the fifth-biggest producer of coal in the country. BOB MURRAY: On May 1, Mr. Siegel, 2015, we had 8,400 coal miners. Because of the destruction of Barack Obama and his administration, that number has dropped now to less than 6,000. SIEGEL: Bob Murray is a larger-than-life character in the coal business. At age 76, he's battling lung disease that's likely related to the years he spent in the mines. He blames the Obama administration's regulations limiting emissions of mercury and air toxics, for example, for driving the push to natural gas. He rejects scientific evidence of global warming or any contribution to it by burning fossil fuels. Murray supported Donald Trump and says Trump can bring back coal jobs if he takes several steps. MURRAY: Step one is to end the regulations. Step two - withdraw from the United Nations' climate change agreement which basically is an attempt by developing countries to get American money. Three - end the subsidies for windmills and solar panels and other forms of energy. SIEGEL: Bob Murray took the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to court to block clean air regulations, and he won a stay. He says Trump should name a Supreme Court justice who will block presidential excesses, and Trump should fire Justice Department lawyers whom he describes as criminals. And that's not all. MURRAY: He needs to eliminate one half of the employees in the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. He needs to cut the staff drastically in the Department of Interior. He needs to eliminate the Department of Energy altogether. SIEGEL: If Trump did everything you want him to do in a reasonable amount of time that's possible to do it, how long are we talking about? MURRAY: I think much of it can be done in a matter of two or three months. SIEGEL: You mean in Washington? And then you would already be powering up. MURRAY: I'd be ready. My mines are cut back. They're sitting there. The people aren't working because of the regulations on them. SIEGEL: So conceivably by the spring. . . MURRAY: By the. . . SIEGEL: . . . You could have a couple of thousand more miners working. MURRAY: Oh, yeah, absolutely. SIEGEL: But even Bob Murray, the crusader against the so-called war on coal, concedes this. So many coal-fired plants have shut down. The promise of more coal mining jobs will be hard to keep. MURRAY: I've told Mr. Trump to caution and temper his statements about bringing the miners back to work. SIEGEL: In fact, the big talk of new jobs in Belmont County, Ohio, isn't about coal. It's about natural gas and things you can make from natural gas. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I'm not talking about politics. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I want to talk in politics. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Laughter). SIEGEL: This is the weekly luncheon of the Wheeling, W. Va. , Kiwanis Club at the WesBanco Arena, home to the Nailers, the city's minor league hockey team. Belmont County is just across the river. President Mike Taylor introduced the day's guest. MIKE TAYLOR: I think y'all are aware of Mark Thomas, who has spoke here before - Belmont County commissioner. He's here to be our speaker today. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)SIEGEL: As one of Belmont County Ohio's three commissioners, Democrat Mark Thomas is excited about the big construction project that is almost certainly coming to the county. MARK THOMAS: This project here is probably going to be the largest economic development project in monetary terms ever in the state of Ohio - the largest. SIEGEL: A company based in Thailand, PTT, is planning to build a plant that converts natural gas that would come in by pipeline to plastic pellets. The process breaks down molecules of ethane or cracks them, so it's called a cracker plant. When PTT gives the final go ahead, new jobs will start coming. THOMAS: About a four- to four-and-a-half-year build with thousands of construction jobs throughout that entire time period - thousands. SIEGEL: Then five or six hundred jobs at the cracker plant itself. And then, if all goes right, other factories with more jobs will go up nearby. THOMAS: And we've already had a dozen to 15 calls from companies asking for land and/or buildings. SIEGEL: Companies that use plastic, like a regional dairy that uses plastic milk jugs that are made at a plant in Nebraska. THOMAS: In talking with one of the owners about a month ago, he said, if the plant comes here, we would be able to cut our plastics costs that include the shipping by 65 to 75 percent. SIEGEL: The Kiwanis Club members had plenty of questions about the cracker plant. Blake Williams, who works in tech support, told me that he grew up near a paper plant and remembers the fumes. He expressed some environmental concerns. BLAKE WILLIAMS: How might you address any questions on the impact of our health? THOMAS: With regard to the cracker plant - great question. These plants do come with - call it pollutants. But those pollutants will be governed, if you will, and/or regulated by Ohio EPA and the U. S. EPA. SIEGEL: The federal EPA, Mark Thomas told the group, has experience with cracker plants in Louisiana and Texas, where they're located close to offshore gas fields. Thomas was asked about how the Wheeling region can make some permanent gain out of the bonanza coming across the river. He was also asked about homelessness. One Kiwanian pointed out that the region's boom and bust cycle of building pipelines and drilling for gas attracts workers, drives up rents and forces some tenants to the streets. Thomas answered, government cannot do very much about that. For the Belmont, Ohio, county commissioner, the pluses of the cracker plant far outweigh the minuses. We went to the site on the Ohio River where the plant would be built. Unlike nearby Pennsylvania where the mountain tops are dotted with windmills, there are none to be seen here. We are in fossil fuel country, whether the fuel is coal or the fuel is gas. THOMAS: The site, as we stand here today - look; going back 60, 70 years, it was the home of a coal-fired power plant that for many, many years, hundreds of employees here created living-wage jobs with benefits that helped the Belmont County economy tremendously. SIEGEL: We're seeing a transition from the old coal and steel economy to the new natural gas and plastic economy. THOMAS: Absolutely. Coal has been a great friend of Belmont County and still is to this day. The coal industry is on hard times - various factors in the economy. What we are trying to do as elected officials here in the region and in the county is accept where we are with that industry and embrace the new industry and these beautiful reserves that we have all over eastern Ohio that will result in this plant. SIEGEL: Barring some unforeseen obstacle to the cracker plant breaking ground, there will be jobs coming to Ohio coal country soon. They won't have much to do with Donald Trump's promises or policies, and they won't have much to do with coal, either.

The deal hinged on $7 million in state tax credits, some of which came from a rarely used fund for job retention. It has other manufacturers wondering what the deal might mean for them, as Indiana Public Broadcasting's Annie Ropeik reports. ANNIE ROPEIK, BYLINE: Indiana doles out tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives to companies like Carrier every year, but usually those are for creating new jobs, not retaining existing ones. Andrew Berger, a lobbyist with the Indiana Manufacturers Association, says that's because it's easier to measure the economic benefit of a new job than one that was already there. ANDREW BERGER: The overall goal is to grow the income base, not just maintain it. So that's I think the policy decision on why it's such a - retention is such a small portion. ROPEIK: Small portion indeed. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation caps its credits for job retention at $10 million a year, and it's only actually awarded $15 million total since 2005. Compare that to awarding $1. 2 billion in job creation credits. So deals like the Carrier one are rare. In fact, it'll eat up 5 percent of all the state's job retention funds over the next decade. But what's to stop companies from feeling emboldened by Carrier asking for more of that money? Not much, says Berger, but with the spectacle around Carrier and uncertainty around other reforms, most businesses seem cautious. BERGER: My guess right now is that people are kind of in a wait-and-see mode, particularly if they haven't kind of committed to, you know, an investment overseas, whether that's in Mexico or anyplace else. ROPEIK: Employees are waiting, too. At Rexnord, another Indianapolis factory Trump has criticized for plans to shift jobs to Mexico, production worker Tim Mathis has his hopes up. TIM MATHIS: We're tickled to death that President-elect Trump was potentially able to save Carrier's jobs. But we also want our jobs and all the other jobs that are being sent out of this country. We want our jobs to stay as well. ROPEIK: It's shift change at the TRW factory in Lafayette, Ind. Most workers are already inside for their 5:30 p. m. start time. They're going to be making commercial steering equipment for big rig trucks until about 3 a. m. tonight. Now, there are two Lafayette TRW factories, and the other one is going to be closing in just a few weeks' time. Some of its workers are going to come here, and some of them are going to be laid off. LARRY DEBOER: You know, so what's the balance between carrots and sticks on that sort of thing as well? ROPEIK: Larry DeBoer is an economist at Purdue University and says companies like TRW don't really face penalties for offshoring jobs. The company wouldn't comment on the role its overseas business played in the 65 layoffs it's planning in Lafayette, but workers did get a federal certification saying the jobs were impacted by global trade as positions move to China. DeBoer says the company could have asked the state for retention money or incentives to expand its factories or teach workers new skills instead of firing them - all breaks Carrier got. But what happens if that's still not enough to keep jobs here? DeBoer says companies need more than just incentives. They're watching to see if Trump will impose the kind of offshoring penalties he campaigned on. DEBOER: Eventually there's got to be some nationwide policy passed by Congress presumably that addresses this problem, but you can't possibly have the president occupy himself business by business by business every time there's a report that somebody's going to move offshore. ROPEIK: Or can you? Expectations like DeBoer's haven't seemed to limit the president-elect so far. He has pledged to make some big trade and regulatory reforms in his first hundred days in office.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  It's been a few weeks since President-elect Donald Trump celebrated Carrier's decision to keep some factory jobs in Indiana rather than move them to Mexico. The deal hinged on $7 million in state tax credits, some of which came from a rarely used fund for job retention. It has other manufacturers wondering what the deal might mean for them, as Indiana Public Broadcasting's Annie Ropeik reports. ANNIE ROPEIK, BYLINE: Indiana doles out tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives to companies like Carrier every year, but usually those are for creating new jobs, not retaining existing ones. Andrew Berger, a lobbyist with the Indiana Manufacturers Association, says that's because it's easier to measure the economic benefit of a new job than one that was already there. ANDREW BERGER: The overall goal is to grow the income base, not just maintain it. So that's I think the policy decision on why it's such a - retention is such a small portion. ROPEIK: Small portion indeed. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation caps its credits for job retention at $10 million a year, and it's only actually awarded $15 million total since 2005. Compare that to awarding $1. 2 billion in job creation credits. So deals like the Carrier one are rare. In fact, it'll eat up 5 percent of all the state's job retention funds over the next decade. But what's to stop companies from feeling emboldened by Carrier asking for more of that money? Not much, says Berger, but with the spectacle around Carrier and uncertainty around other reforms, most businesses seem cautious. BERGER: My guess right now is that people are kind of in a wait-and-see mode, particularly if they haven't kind of committed to, you know, an investment overseas, whether that's in Mexico or anyplace else. ROPEIK: Employees are waiting, too. At Rexnord, another Indianapolis factory Trump has criticized for plans to shift jobs to Mexico, production worker Tim Mathis has his hopes up. TIM MATHIS: We're tickled to death that President-elect Trump was potentially able to save Carrier's jobs. But we also want our jobs and all the other jobs that are being sent out of this country. We want our jobs to stay as well. ROPEIK: It's shift change at the TRW factory in Lafayette, Ind. Most workers are already inside for their 5:30 p. m. start time. They're going to be making commercial steering equipment for big rig trucks until about 3 a. m. tonight. Now, there are two Lafayette TRW factories, and the other one is going to be closing in just a few weeks' time. Some of its workers are going to come here, and some of them are going to be laid off. LARRY DEBOER: You know, so what's the balance between carrots and sticks on that sort of thing as well? ROPEIK: Larry DeBoer is an economist at Purdue University and says companies like TRW don't really face penalties for offshoring jobs. The company wouldn't comment on the role its overseas business played in the 65 layoffs it's planning in Lafayette, but workers did get a federal certification saying the jobs were impacted by global trade as positions move to China. DeBoer says the company could have asked the state for retention money or incentives to expand its factories or teach workers new skills instead of firing them - all breaks Carrier got. But what happens if that's still not enough to keep jobs here? DeBoer says companies need more than just incentives. They're watching to see if Trump will impose the kind of offshoring penalties he campaigned on. DEBOER: Eventually there's got to be some nationwide policy passed by Congress presumably that addresses this problem, but you can't possibly have the president occupy himself business by business by business every time there's a report that somebody's going to move offshore. ROPEIK: Or can you? Expectations like DeBoer's haven't seemed to limit the president-elect so far. He has pledged to make some big trade and regulatory reforms in his first hundred days in office.

The Commonwealth is still mired in debt to the tune of nearly $70 billion. A federal oversight board is working on a plan to restructure at least some of that debt, but that could mean severe budget cuts. There's talk of shutting down such basic services as schools and hospitals, a prospect that could surely cast a cloud over Christmas for many island residents. So we thought this would be a good time to check in on Puerto Rico. Luis Trelles is a producer for the podcast Radio Ambulante. He joins us from San Juan to talk about how residents are coping. Luis, thanks so much for joining us. LUIS TRELLES, BYLINE: Oh, thank you. Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: So you've been covering the debt crisis over the past year. Could you just talk a little bit about the plan that's being discussed over the summer? As people will probably remember, Congress passed a law putting in place this federal oversight and management board. Can you just tell us a bit more? TRELLES: Exactly. The oversight board recently started to operate here. It's met three times now, and they recently announced for the people of Puerto Rico that they can expect deep cuts to the government in the coming year. And not only that, but government pensions might be on the table as well. So people are concerned. MARTIN: Can you tell us a little bit more about how conditions are there now? Are people feeling the effects of this debt crisis in any tangible way? TRELLES: Yes. Yes, they are. It's been a very hard year for Puerto Rico. It's been one bad news after the other in terms of the economy, in terms of austerity measures and the debt crisis. And so I talked with Teresa Garcia (ph). She's a retired chemist. She's in her 70s. She's very concerned about what's going on, and when I talked to her recently, this is what she told me. TERESA GARCIA: (Speaking Spanish). TRELLES: And what she's saying here is that she has definitely been affected because she doesn't receive what she used to get paid by the government. It's been cut down by about a third. And her husband is a diabetic, and he's been having trouble sleeping at night, you know, how economic worries have a tendency to creep up on you. And she's just concerned for herself and for her husband as well. MARTIN: I understand that, though, the cost of services is actually rising. I wanted to know, first of all, how is that possible? And secondly, how are people like Teresa Garcia coping? TRELLES: It's getting more expensive to live in Puerto Rico definitely. Gas prices are up. Electricity has usually been very high, and it's getting - the cost of it is getting higher. And people are feeling it. Teresa Garcia - she and her husband have really cut down on anything that is not basic household expenses. MARTIN: So many people look forward to Christmas at this time of year. What does Christmas look like in San Juan in the middle of all this? TRELLES: Well, the holiday season is very important. Usually in Puerto Rico people take it seriously. They look forward to it. But this year, it's been different. There's a tense calm that has settled over the island. People are expecting more cuts to come in the coming year. In previous years, you could see Christmas lights and decorations all around, but there's been none of that this year. And almost no one is decorating their house in part because of the rising power bills. But what's really interesting is that she just doesn't see that Christmas spirit this year and that she's not feeling it either. MARTIN: What lies ahead? Could you just give us some sense of what is coming in the coming months? TRELLES: Well, the oversight board has taken control of the island's finances, and they have the power to renegotiate some of that debt. But as part of that process, they will be looking for more and deeper austerity measures, so there's a wait-and-see attitude, and people are expecting that something better will come, but they're also bracing for what's ahead.

For decades, the assumption has been that with hard work the next generation will do better than their parents. Over the course of this past year, people on both the political right and left have argued that the American dream is no longer true. And now there's a growing body of academic research supporting that argument with data. A new paper published this month says that in fact, fewer American children are making more than their parents did. Lead economist on this report is Raj Chetty. He's the founder of the Equality of Opportunity Project. That's a research group that focuses on economic mobility. He's also a professor of economics at Stanford University, and that's where we reached him. We began by talking about his research, which looked at baby boomers. RAJ CHETTY: If you look at kids born in the 1940s, in the 1950s and compare their incomes at age 30 to what their parents were earning at age 30, adjusting for inflation, you find that 90 percent of them were earning more than their parents. But when you look at kids born in the 1980s, kids turning 30 today, that number has dropped to 50 percent. It's basically a coin flip as to whether you will do better than your parents for the current generation. MARTIN: What caused this? CHETTY: One is declining economic growth. So GDP growth is now lower than it was in prior decades. And so think of that as the economic pie is now growing more slowly than it did in the past. The second major trend that's occurred is that we have more inequality, so more of the growth that is occurring is going to a handful of people at the very top of the income distribution. So we ask, how much did these two trends contribute to the decline in upward mobility? And what we find is that the vast majority of the reduction is because of growing inequality rather than reduced growth rates. If all of the growth is going to, say, a single person, then of course it's going to be very difficult for a large fraction of kids to do better than their parents. That is, it's really about how the pie is divided rather than the total size of the pie. MARTIN: Are there particular people whose share of the slice of the pie, as it were, has gotten smaller? CHETTY: Yes. So the middle class is now getting a much smaller slice of the pie of economic growth. So if GDP has basically doubled from 1980 to today, on average, American incomes have gone up by a factor of two since 1980. Yet for - most Americans didn't see any of that gain at all. MARTIN: What do we know about the other half of kids who are doing better than their parents? CHETTY: These are kids who, you know, were very talented and did extremely well based on their own abilities and ambitions. But also, I suspect many of them had the opportunity to go to great schools, live in excellent neighborhoods, have mentors who really helped them succeed, had access to great job opportunities, internships, colleges. There's still a large fraction of kids who luckily have those opportunities. The question is how we can extend those opportunities to the remaining 50 percent of American kids. MARTIN: I think the question for a lot of people would be would similarly situated people living in different places have different results? For example, is some of this not just individual, but is it also geographic? CHETTY: Absolutely. And when we look at the subset of people who do choose to move to different areas, we find that some parts of the country - for example, Salt Lake City, Utah or parts of the West Coast, like here in the Bay Area, San Francisco or the Northeast - have incredibly high rates of upward mobility. But if you look at other places, like many cities in the industrial Midwest - think of places like Detroit or Cleveland, Ohio - these places have much lower rates of upward mobility. And when we look at families that move, we find that the earlier they make that move, the better their kids do in the long run. MARTIN: OK, but how can you disaggregate the who from the what? I mean, given that if you have the wherewithal to get yourself to San Francisco, which is a very expensive city, how could that not be about the person? CHETTY: So what we do is we don't actually just compare the outcomes of kids who made that move with kids who didn't make that move. What we're actually exploiting is the timing of when families make this move. So take a family that moved from Oakland to San Francisco with, say, a 9-year-old and a 13-year-old. We find the 9-year-old does better than her 13-year-old brother or sister in proportion to that four years of additional exposure to the schools and the environment in San Francisco. So those kinds of tests rule out the possibility that it's just different families because we're comparing kids within the same family. MARTIN: But going back to your first answer here, which is that, you know, you said it's a coin flip. Like, half of kids are earning less than their parents did and half of kids are earning more. How would any of those factors that you cited - you know, geography, better schools - change that? CHETTY: Look, so people usually talk about income inequality in the U. S. in the context of the current generation. How do we raise American workers' incomes? How do we deal with issues like globalization and competition with technology and so forth? And I think thinking about things like immigration or trade and so forth can matter for the current generation. But if you think about the next generation and going forward, my view is that what really matters in the end is education, investments in human capital starting at a young age, giving kids the opportunity to grow up in good neighborhoods, go to good schools, be exposed to a variety of pathways that will allow them to succeed themselves by having higher incomes. MARTIN: That's Raj Chetty. He's a professor of economics at Stanford. He is the founder of the Equality of Opportunity Project. He was nice enough to interrupt his weekend to speak to us from the studios at Stanford University. Professor Chetty, thank you so much for speaking with us. CHETTY: Thank you.

GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Donald Trump owns more than a dozen golf courses from Scotland to California, but none make more money than Trump National Doral. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: So we're very proud of this. It's 800 acres in the middle of Miami. It's been a tremendous success. ALLEN: That's Trump in October, just weeks before the election. He made a campaign appearance at Doral with some of his workers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We have over a thousand employees, well over a thousand employees at Doral, 80 percent of them are Hispanic. ALLEN: For Doral and for all golf courses around the country, new labor regulations by the Obama administration are having an impact on how they do business, and many aren't happy. BRAD STEELE: To say the least, the last eight years have been relatively difficult. ALLEN: Brad Steele is with the National Club Association, a trade group that represents golf courses. The recession was hard on the industry and Steele says new labor rules have made recovery more difficult. A rule of particular concern is the one expanding eligibility for overtime pay. It's been criticized by business groups and Republicans in Congress and was recently put on hold by a federal judge. It's a rule that Steele thinks a Trump White House will change. STEELE: We certainly anticipate that the Trump administration will re-evaluate this particular rule. ALLEN: Amending it would have a direct impact on wages for many employees at Trump's hotels, resorts and golf clubs. And at Doral, disputes over wages and overtime aren't just hypothetical. Rod Hannah is a lawyer who represented nearly 50 temporary workers who sued the Trump Organization after not being paid for staffing a 10-day event in 2014. ROD HANNAH: It was the combination of overtime and not being paid even their minimum wages. They were actually stiffed out of all of their wages. ALLEN: The workers got a settlement, but Hannah says it took a lengthy legal battle. HANNAH: Trump took a very hard line, aggressive, defensive stance on the case up until the time we actually resolved it that they were not the employer of these individuals. ALLEN: Hannah said to help win the settlement, he cited a National Labor Relations Board ruling that makes it easier for employers to be held liable in disputes involving workers hired by an outside contractor. That's a ruling Trump's designated labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, has said he wants changed. But it's not just labor laws that can affect golf course profits. There are four golf courses at Trump National Doral and under a new federal rule, regulations may increase. The waters of the U. S. rule tries to protect water quality by giving the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers authority over thousands of new waterways and wetlands. That's angered farmers and other landowners and, Brad Steele says, golf course owners. STEELE: Any time a club were to place fertilizes or chemicals on property that might actually have to have a federal permit. ALLEN: Trump has promised to repeal the Obama-backed rule. TREVOR POTTER: By definition it's a conflict of interest. ALLEN: Trevor Potter is a former Federal Elections Commission chairman and president of the Campaign Legal Center, a government ethics watchdog group. Unless Trump sets up a blind trust, Potter says, those conflicts will remain. POTTER: The point that the Trump people have been making is we're the president and the conflict of interest statute doesn't apply to us. That doesn't mean there's not a conflict - there is. ALLEN: Potter says if Trump doesn't want to sell off his businesses, he might turn them over to an independent party. But in tweets, Trump has only said that he plans to turn over his business operations to his oldest sons. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

That's a ruling Trump's designated labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, has said he wants changed. But it's not just labor laws that can affect golf course profits. There are four golf courses at Trump National Doral and under a new federal rule, regulations may increase. The waters of the U. S. rule tries to protect water quality by giving the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers authority over thousands of new waterways and wetlands. That's angered farmers and other landowners and, Brad Steele says, golf course owners. STEELE: Any time a club were to place fertilizes or chemicals on property that might actually have to have a federal permit. ALLEN: Trump has promised to repeal the Obama-backed rule. TREVOR POTTER: By definition it's a conflict of interest. ALLEN: Trevor Potter is a former Federal Elections Commission chairman and president of the Campaign Legal Center, a government ethics watchdog group. Unless Trump sets up a blind trust, Potter says, those conflicts will remain. POTTER: The point that the Trump people have been making is we're the president and the conflict of interest statute doesn't apply to us. That doesn't mean there's not a conflict - there is. ALLEN: Potter says if Trump doesn't want to sell off his businesses, he might turn them over to an independent party. But in tweets, Trump has only said that he plans to turn over his business operations to his oldest sons.

NPR's John Ydstie reports that will be a difficult promise to keep. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Trump isn't talking about a temporary boost in growth. He says he can make the economy grow long term at the rate of about 4 percent a year. Most economists think America's potential growth is only about 2 percent a year. And most agree there are only two ways to make it higher - get more people working and make those workers more productive. If you don't do that, stimulating the economy with government spending or tax cuts will just boost growth short term and cause inflation. So let's start with the challenge to get more people into the labor force. ROBERT GORDON: We have a huge wave of baby-boom-era people retiring. YDSTIE: That's economist Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University whose latest book is titled \"The Rise And Fall Of American Growth. \"GORDON: Right now, we've got a shortage of construction workers. We've got a shortage of long-distance truck drivers. We've got a shortage of many kinds of skilled workers needed to work in manufacturing. YDSTIE: So what's the solution to this mass retirement of baby boomers? GORDON: The best way to counteract that is through immigration. YDSTIE: In fact, in the past couple of decades, half the growth in the labor force has come from immigration. But, Gordon points out, Donald Trump has said he will deport millions of immigrants. This is from an interview with CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"NEW DAY\")DONALD TRUMP: They're called illegal immigrants, and they're here illegally. They're going to have to go, and they're going to have to come back in legally.

JOSE AGUILUZ: His rhetoric was very negative during the election. But now he has to contemplate and analyze reality. YDSTIE: Aguiluz came to the U. S. at age 15 for a life-saving surgery after a car accident in his native Honduras. He and most of his family stayed illegally. Then, Aguiluz says, an executive order from President Obama provided two-year deportation deferments for young, undocumented immigrants like him. Donald Trump says he'll rescind that order. Aguiluz says if he could talk to Trump, here's what he'd say. AGUILUZ: I am a very contributing individual in the American society. I save American lives in the OR. They don't care about my immigration status. What they care about is that I'm a very capable nurse that will carry them through the surgery. YDSTIE: In fact, about a quarter of all doctors and nurses in the U. S. are immigrants. Steve Moore, who has advised Donald Trump on his economic growth policy, says Trump isn't against immigration, just illegal immigration. Moore says, personally, he believes even some undocumented workers shouldn't be deported. STEPHEN MOORE: People who are in this country - are working and productive Americans, who are contributing, I personally would not like to see those people deported. YDSTIE: Moore argues that a faster growing economy will attract even more unemployed American workers back into the labor force, including some retirees. Most economists are skeptical that could provide enough workers to get to a 4-percent growth rate. So what about the other side of the growth equation, making workers more productive? Moore says that will come from big tax cuts for businesses that will boost investment in new equipment and technologies, like autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence. MOORE: And we could see very rapid rises in the productivity that is a key part to making growth possible.

S. jails have not been convicted of a crime. Many defendants are awaiting trial behind bars simply because they can't afford to make bail. Starting next month, New Jersey hopes to drastically reduce its reliance on bail money. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, activists in other states are watching to see how that works. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Mustafa Willis has seen the bail process in New Jersey up close. Willis was arrested in Newark in 2010 for unlawful possession of a firearm. The charges were later dropped, but he spent three months in jail before his family could scrape together $3,000 to bail him out. MUSTAFA WILLIS: When you feel like you don't have that kind of money or no way to get out, the only thing you're going to do is say I'll take probation so I can get home and get back to my job and get back to my family. That's the only thing because how the rules work, if you don't bail out, you're going to sit there. ROSE: Willis' story is not unusual. In 2013, a study found that three-quarters of people in New Jersey county jails were waiting for their day in court. Forty percent could have walked out of jail except that they couldn't afford to make bail. ROSEANNE SCOTTI: They sit in jail for months and sometimes for years. They lose jobs. They lose housing. They lose connections to families. They can lose their children. ROSE: Roseanne Scotti is the director of the Drug Policy Alliance of New Jersey, which helped fund that study. SCOTTI: Most of these individuals are low-risk individuals who could be released pending trial. But because we are a money-based system and not a risk-based system, they sat there because they didn't have money. ROSE: How much money are we talking? SCOTTI: About 12 percent of the people who are in jail are there for less than $2,000. And that was something that shocked everyone, legislators, judges, people in the system and the public. ROSE: Most reports about pretrial detention just sit on the shelf. But this one prompted some serious soul-searching in New Jersey and not just from liberal activists. Here's Republican Governor Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, signing the state's bail reform law in 2014. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS CHRISTIE: Under these reforms, our justice system will be both more effective in protecting our communities from dangerous, violent, repeat offenders and fairer to those nonviolent offenders who do not deserve to sit in what has become the equivalent of debtor's prison because they can't afford to post the bail. ROSE: New Jersey isn't the first place to move away from bail. The federal government did it years ago; so did Washington, D. C. A handful of other states have tried various reforms, but New Jersey's maybe the most extensive, according to Insha Rahman at the Vera Institute of Justice. INSHA RAHMAN: It was really we're going to sort of from top to bottom clean house and start over with something that essentially looks pretty new. So it's sort of the great experiment. ROSE: Here's how the experiment will work. Starting next month, judges in New Jersey will use what's called a risk assessment tool to help decide if a defendant is likely to flee or commit another crime. For high-risk defendants, judges can order them held without bail, like the federal system. On the other hand, judges are encouraged to release the majority of low-risk defendants without bail. Stuart Rabner is the chief justice of New Jersey. STUART RABNER: What has been seen in other jurisdictions where this has been done is that the prison population has gone down. People are showing up in court, and the rate of crime while people are on release has actually gone down as well. ROSE: In Washington, D. C. , for example, the vast majority of defendants are released without bail. Almost 90 percent show up for court, but Washington's pretrial detention system is elaborate and expensive. Counties in New Jersey complain that they're being forced to hire more sheriffs and prosecutors without any extra money. Jeff Clayton directs the American Bail Coalition, an industry trade group. JEFF CLAYTON: We are simply sitting back and saying we told you in 2014 this would be expensive and difficult to implement. And then the fundamental question of, you know, whatever fairness it is we're buying, is it worth it? ROSE: But the new system seems a lot fairer to Mustafa Willis. He wound up owing thousands of dollars to a bail bondsman after his arrest in Newark. WILLIS: I was in debt from this, and the case was still dismissed, and I still had to pay them for nothing, something that I didn't even have, like. ROSE: There is one thing that reformers and the bail industry seem to agree on - if New Jersey's experiment goes well, other states will try to copy it. Joel Rose, NPR News, East Orange, N. J.

So we asked David Wessel, a frequent guest on this program, to do that for the U. S. economy. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. MARTIN: So here's a big question - was 2016 a good year when you think about the U. S. economy? WESSEL: It was a pretty good year, not a great one. The economy got off to a disappointingly slow start at the beginning of the year. And despite an impressive third-quarter performance, over the past year the economy has grown at a mediocre pace of about 1. 7 percent. But the unemployment rate is down 4. 6 percent, a 9-year low. And the fraction of adults who are working or looking for work was steady, although it's still lower than it has been over most of our recent history. Employers added 180,000 jobs a month so far this year - pretty good. Nearly all of them were in the private sector. Inflation is quiet. And wages, finally, are beginning to rise faster than prices. MARTIN: All right, all of that seems good, but we did just go through a presidential election where all kinds of people were talking about how bad the economy was, so it couldn't have been all rosy. WESSEL: There are some blemishes. One big one is that the amount of stuff we get for each hour of work has been growing at a distressingly slow rate. Now, productivity growth is important. It's the reason we have more goods and services than our grandparents did, even though we work fewer hours. And lousy productivity growth is a poor portent for future wages. Another thing is that there are still a huge number of people on the sidelines of the job market. 15 percent of the men between the ages of 25 and 54 aren't working, and that has been rising over time. MARTIN: So that brings up another issue, right? I mean, you talk about the economy doing really well on the whole, but is it just certain parts of the American demographic? Is it just certain groups who are benefiting? WESSEL: That's a persistent issue. The growth we've had has not been enjoyed evenly across the population. If you look at the incomes of people at the middle of the middle class, they're rising, and they're back to where they were before the Great Recession - about $58,000 a year. But adjusted for inflation, they're still lower than they were back in 2000. More young adults are living with their parents than at any time since 1940, apparently unwilling or unable to get out on their own. And these national averages always obscure the places that are really doing bad. In El Centro, Calif, the unemployment rate is 22 percent. And in Yuma, Ariz. , it's 19 percent - just unbelievable and distressingly poor. MARTIN: When you do look ahead to 2017, what do you see? WESSEL: Financial markets seem to be signaling good times ahead. All the measures of consumer, business and investor confidence, they've gone up quite a bit since the Trump election. All that's a good sign. Most economic forecasters see faster growth than we had this year, but there's plenty to worry about. One, the euphoria over the Trump victory could dissipate if he can't deliver on all that he's promised or if he starts a trade war that gets out of hand. Two, the Fed is raising interest rates, and it could do too much and hurt the economy just when it was taking off. And third, we're pretty big, but the rest of the world matters, too. And there's plenty that's going wrong abroad. We could have problems with the viability of the European Union. There's a huge debt problem among companies in China. And the U. S. dollar has been very strong, and that's having ripple effects on foreign borrowers that could wash back on our shores. MARTIN: OK, lots of things to watch out for.

NPR's Yuki Noguchi explains. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The Great Recession ended seven and a half years ago, and job gains have been steady since. But the greater demand for workers is only starting to increase pay. MICHAEL STRAIN: The mystery has been that we've seen a decline in the unemployment rate, but we haven't seen the kind of increases in wage growth that we would expect. NOGUCHI: Michael Strain is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. He speculates that, all this time, employers figured they didn't have to increase wages. STRAIN: A lot of people have left the workforce and are no longer exerting upward pressure on the unemployment rate because they're not actively looking for work. But businesses kind of have the sense that they're out there, they are a pool of available workers. So that has, I think, suppressed wage growth. NOGUCHI: But wage growth did pick up this year, and economists say there are reasons to believe it will continue to. The biggest reason is simply that the supply of labor is declining. The unemployment rate is near a level economists say is close to a natural unemployment rate. Simply put, that means employers are having to shell out more to attract and retain workers. New state and local minimum wage laws are another reason wages are rising. Since 2014, 21 states in Washington, D. C. , changed their minimum wage laws. Last month, voters approved initiatives in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington. AEI's Michael Strain says those rate increases have a ripple effect beyond just the lowest paid workers. Many union contracts, for example, benchmark to the minimum wage. STRAIN: There's no question minimum wage increases cause wage growth to accelerate. How much of that can be attributed to minimum wage increases, I think, is a more open question. NOGUCHI: In Anggie Godoy's case, minimum wage hikes made a big difference. She started working as a McDonald's drive-thru cashier three years ago making $8 an hour. Since then, the Los Angeles City Council raised the minimum wage to $10. 50. Without the city's new law, she says, she would only have seen a tiny increase. ANGGIE GODOY: Working three years there, I only got a 10-cent raise. NOGUCHI: Godoy, who participated in fast food worker strikes demanding a $15 hourly wage, says, as her wages increased, so did those who were in more senior positions. GODOY: When the bottom rises, everybody is going to rise, too. NOGUCHI: Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist for online job site Glassdoor says Godoy is right. ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN: Like dominoes up the pay scale, you see wage hikes all across the board. NOGUCHI: But Chamberlain says minimum wage isn't the biggest factor. He says data suggest wages are growing fastest where demand is strongest. Pay for truck drivers, construction workers and machine operators is surging - not so in some white-collar jobs. Sales jobs and financial analysts, for example, are losing ground to technology. CHAMBERLAIN: Clever coders are finding ways to program around them. Insurance agents today are largely being replaced by self-service insurance websites. NOGUCHI: David Levine is CEO of the American Sustainable Business Council, a progressive advocacy group. He says increasing pay can be a way to address another labor market problem - low productivity growth. DAVID LEVINE: With that retention, they're also getting employees that are more committed to the business. Therefore, productivity goes up. NOGUCHI: Simply put, you pay more to get more. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  It's taken years, but in 2016, wages finally started to go up. NPR's Yuki Noguchi explains. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The Great Recession ended seven and a half years ago, and job gains have been steady since. But the greater demand for workers is only starting to increase pay. MICHAEL STRAIN: The mystery has been that we've seen a decline in the unemployment rate, but we haven't seen the kind of increases in wage growth that we would expect. NOGUCHI: Michael Strain is director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. He speculates that, all this time, employers figured they didn't have to increase wages. STRAIN: A lot of people have left the workforce and are no longer exerting upward pressure on the unemployment rate because they're not actively looking for work. But businesses kind of have the sense that they're out there, they are a pool of available workers. So that has, I think, suppressed wage growth. NOGUCHI: But wage growth did pick up this year, and economists say there are reasons to believe it will continue to. The biggest reason is simply that the supply of labor is declining. The unemployment rate is near a level economists say is close to a natural unemployment rate. Simply put, that means employers are having to shell out more to attract and retain workers. New state and local minimum wage laws are another reason wages are rising. Since 2014, 21 states in Washington, D. C. , changed their minimum wage laws. Last month, voters approved initiatives in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington. AEI's Michael Strain says those rate increases have a ripple effect beyond just the lowest paid workers. Many union contracts, for example, benchmark to the minimum wage. STRAIN: There's no question minimum wage increases cause wage growth to accelerate. How much of that can be attributed to minimum wage increases, I think, is a more open question. NOGUCHI: In Anggie Godoy's case, minimum wage hikes made a big difference. She started working as a McDonald's drive-thru cashier three years ago making $8 an hour. Since then, the Los Angeles City Council raised the minimum wage to $10. 50. Without the city's new law, she says, she would only have seen a tiny increase. ANGGIE GODOY: Working three years there, I only got a 10-cent raise.
