Reid Frazier of The Allegheny Front spoke to coal miners who say they don't expect miracles, but they do want results. REID FRAZIER, BYLINE: It's been over a year since the coal mine Dave Hathaway worked in closed. He spent most of 2016 sending out resumes, looking for work. The search gained urgency when his son Deacon was born in August. DAVE HATHAWAY: I like when he gets milk drunk and just passes back out (laughter). Little coma. FRAZIER: On Election Day, Hathaway made a choice he hopes will help his long-term job prospects. HATHAWAY: I voted for Trump. I mean, a coal miner would be stupid not to. FRAZIER: Hathaway has had a hard time finding a job to replace the $80,000 dollars he made in the coal mines under Greene County, Pa. , a few miles from the West Virginia border. He just got hired at a nearby mine. He thinks the election of Donald Trump means he'll have a better shot at keeping this job even though he didn't really like a lot of the things Trump had to say during the campaign. HATHAWAY: He is a wacko. He still - I mean, he's never going to stop being a wacko. You know what I mean? But, I mean, the things that he did say, the good stuff, was good for the coal mining community. But we'll see what happens. FRAZIER: Trump won over coal country voters like Hathaway by promising to slash environmental regulations. That message clearly resonated in Greene County, where over the last four years a third of the coal mining jobs like Dave Hathaway's disappeared. Trump won the county by 40 points eight years after Barack Obama basically tied John McCain here. Tom Crooks witnessed the decline in coal firsthand. He's a vice president at R. G. Johnson, a construction firm that builds mine shafts. TOM CROOKS: Two years ago this week we had 145 employees, and right now we have 22. FRAZIER: Crooks doesn't use the phrase war on coal, but he does think federal regulations mounted by Obama's EPA have weighed down his industry. One example - the EPA's Clean Power Plan. That rule, which Trump has pledged to eliminate, limits the amount of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants. Instead, Crooks wants to see more government research into making coal as clean as possible. CROOKS: And really what's happened over the last eight years is the smart people stopped working on coal, in part because of the way the federal government and the state governments looked at us. We just want them to start looking to coal as an option. FRAZIER: Trump's promise of bringing the coal industry back has attracted interest from at least one Democratic lawmaker in this corner of Pennsylvania. Pam Snyder is a state representative in Greene County. Snyder invited the president-elect to visit her district to tell coal miners his specific plan to help them, but she has yet to hear back from him. Snyder won't say who she voted for, but she does think Trump can help the industry by rolling back environmental regulations. PAM SNYDER: I care deeply about the environment. But there's a social environment, too, that I have to care deeply about. And when a big chunk of my constituency is thrown into the unemployment lines, what about that social environment? FRAZIER: Snyder acknowledges what many here know - there's only so much Donald Trump can do to bring back coal. Probably the biggest factor in coal's decline has been the low price of natural gas, some of it produced in gas wells right here in Greene County. Even though she doesn't expect Trump to return coal to the position it once held here, at this point she'll take a modest rebound over none at all. For NPR News, I'm Reid Frazier in Waynesburg, Pa.

It was a way to bridge the gap in earnings between servers and kitchen staff. It's been about a year since he started this new policy. And we wanted to see how it's going so far. Danny Meyer is CEO of the Union Square Hospitality Group, which is behind high-end restaurants in New York City like Gramercy Tavern and The Modern. He joins us from New York City. Welcome, Danny. DANNY MEYER: Thank you so much, Ailsa. CHANG: How did your staff react to these new policies, particularly your servers? Were any of them confused or upset about this? MEYER: All of our staff members listened very, very carefully when I shared the thing that was non-negotiable for me, which was this. If we're going to be a restaurant organization that believes and says we believe that our guests will never have a better time dining with us, we cannot responsibly preside over an economy that only takes care of tipped employees and does not take care of kitchen employees. And then I asked our staff members - kitchen and dining room - to help me and help our senior leadership team do the math to create a system that would be a winning system for everybody. And people trusted us. CHANG: But what's the incentive to be the best possible server they can be if you get rid of tips? MEYER: Well, that incentive has to come from someone internally. I have never, ever subscribed to the notion that it motivates somebody to be friendly to me who otherwise would not have been friendly to me simply because they believe that, in two hours, I'm going to pull more money out of my pocket. CHANG: Really? That seems like a reality of the restaurant business. MEYER: I think that's the reality that the tipping system has tried to create. But if you've ever had bad service in a restaurant, then I would argue that the tipping system did not prevent bad service. CHANG: Well, what about complaints about higher menu prices? Are there customers who are confused about why those prices seem way higher than they used to be? MEYER: Well, what we decided to do with our program, which we call hospitality included, is that we would give you one price on the menu. So if your chicken costs $28 on the menu, that's the cost. That's going to cover the linen, the flowers, the cook, the reservationist, the server, the wine director, the rent. There's not an additional line on your bill for gratuity. And so it is a jolt when you first see it. But we've not, to my knowledge, lost any guests. As a matter of fact, what we've gotten over this past year is an overwhelmingly strong thumbs-up chorus from our guests. CHANG: I was going to ask you, have profits been affected at all? MEYER: Well we've seen an initial dip in every restaurant. And then as our managers learn to operate under a new economy, they tend to come back up. So a great example is The Modern, where we started this. It's a very, very different math if you're a chef and you're used to working towards a certain food-cost percentage. And all of a sudden, that math changes dramatically. Or, for example, taxes - we're actually paying more taxes right now because tips are not something that you have to include in your sales tax. So in the early stages, this is a very, very challenging thing. And any restaurant that was considering undertaking this, I would say, overcommunicate. Be patient. But it's completely worth it. And I wouldn't go back. CHANG: Danny Meyer, CEO of the Union Square Hospitality Group, thanks for joining us. MEYER: Well, It was my pleasure. And thank you.

S. trade policy. For one thing, Trump has repeatedly talked about renegotiating NAFTA, this is the free trade agreement among the U. S. , Canada and Mexico. U. S. companies are the biggest foreign investors in Mexico, and the U. S. -Mexican trade is worth about half a trillion dollars each year. But lately, some of those companies are coming under fire from Trump, often in tweets. NPR's Yuki Noguchi looks at which U. S. companies might find themselves in the crosshairs. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: When Donald Trump takes to Twitter, some companies shudder. This week, Ford said it would scrap a $1. 6 billion plant in Mexico in favor of expanding an existing one in Michigan. That happened on the same day Trump tweeted criticism of General Motors for manufacturing its Chevy Cruze vehicles in Mexico. GM says only a small number of the cars produced in Mexico are sold in the U. S. BARRY BOSWORTH: Since most of these are companies that produce consumer-type goods, they can't afford bad publicity. NOGUCHI: Barry Bosworth is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He notes, so far, Trump's targets are companies that are expanding or planning to build operations in Mexico. So far, he has not singled out U. S. companies that have built plants long ago. BOSWORTH: He focuses in on these individual cases, but there doesn't seem to be a rule. NOGUCHI: In November, under pressure from Trump, heating and cooling firm Carrier said it would keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to a plant in Mexico. Who might be next? Bosworth says the Trump Twitter spotlight is shining the most on big companies with well-known household brands. Automakers are especially at risk because of the high volume of cross-border trade that happens in that industry, and because it's so vulnerable to consumer opinion. He says going after a maker of obscure chemicals or a small firm that makes car components doesn't make for great headlines, nor does it move public sentiment. It's about the finished products. BOSWORTH: If they're not assembled, they can't be identified in the terms of like a specific model of a General Motors car. It doesn't have the same public appeal. NOGUCHI: Trump has issued tough trade talk on China as well, but Bosworth notes Trump has not, for example, taken Apple to task for its huge iPhone assembly operations in China. China's economy is almost as big as the U. S. 's, and it has the power to inflict lots of pain on U. S. companies like Boeing, so interfering there could backfire for American workers. Bosworth says picking on Mexico is like fighting the weak kid on the playground. It's less likely to elicit a retaliatory response. BOSWORTH: It's a much weaker economy, much fewer options available to them. NOGUCHI: Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, says retailers, banks and other service providers aren't likely to be targeted. And, he says, he hopes the singling out of individual companies will stop once Trump takes office. DEREK SCISSORS: When you're president, you shouldn't be bothering one company. You should be changing policies such as corporate taxes to change the whole landscape. Getting down into the details can't be done by Twitter. NOGUCHI: Scissors says tweeting about trade does accomplish a few things. First, it appeals to Trump's base. SCISSORS: Probably the reason that he won the election is the effort re-shore manufacturing, not to accept it as inevitable that manufacturing will head overseas. NOGUCHI: And the tweets also telegraph a message, not just to the companies he's already mentioned, but to firms in other industries, ones that might be thinking about expanding elsewhere besides Mexico. SCISSORS: It's not going to stop at very high-profile manufacturers that consumers know about. It will continue, he's just sending the signal now to everyone, this is your chance to make an adjustment. NOGUCHI: Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

Those two dozen states include some more conservative places where any talk of higher taxes would normally provoke a backlash. Here's Joe Wertz from StateImpact Oklahoma. JOE WERTZ, BYLINE: Here's how long it's been since Oklahoma lawmakers increased taxes on gasoline and diesel. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LIVIN' ON A PRAYER\")BON JOVI: (Singing) We'll give it a shot. Oh, we're halfway there. WERTZ: . . . 1987. Bon Jovi was setting fire to the charts, and Oklahoma lawmakers were scrambling. The state's energy-fueled economy was shaken by low oil prices and dwindling revenue streams to fund state government. Today, the tune at the state capitol is the same. Finance officials say the state is facing a $900 million budget hole. Taxes at the pump are an easy target. CARL DAVIS: The state has one of the oldest gas-tax rates in the country. WERTZ: Carl Davis is research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Over the decades, the value of that unchanged tax rate, 16 cents per gallon of gasoline and a little less for diesel, has eroded with inflation. Davis says more fuel-efficient cars and trucks have also taken a bite. DAVIS: It's just the math just doesn't work. To levy the same gas-tax rate for 30 years - it just loses purchasing power. WERTZ: And Oklahoma is not the only state with budget problems considering hiking motor-fuel taxes. Davis says about a dozen states are looking at increases, a list that includes Republican strongholds like Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi and Indiana. (APPLAUSE)WERTZ: Here's Governor Eric Holcomb at his recent State of the State address. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIC HOLCOMB: The fact is existing sources of revenue are just not keeping up. WERTZ: Why would so many conservative politicians support tax increases? Davis says one reason is that motor-fuel taxes pay for popular projects like this. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)RICK LOWRY: What we're working on today - we're just chipping the bridge. We're getting loose concrete and stuff off our bridge. WERTZ: Rick Lowry is supervising a crew of men armed with a scissor lift and shovels. They're under a bridge, battling three of the Department of Transportation's biggest enemies, salt, sand and water. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOVELING)LOWRY: You know, it could fall off the bridge, straight through a car window or something. And that's the thing we're more concerned about than anything. WERTZ: Motor-fuel taxes are a relatively small revenue stream in Oklahoma. But here and in most other states, the money pays for roads and highways and transportation, things Davis says have bipartisan and public support. DAVIS: There's really no such thing as a Republican pothole or a Democrat bridge. It's an issue that brings the parties together. WERTZ: Davis says conservative states support motor-fuel taxes because it's the user who pays them. He warns gasoline and diesel taxes are regressive. They affect low-income people more than those with higher incomes. But in recent years, gas prices have been pretty low. And unlike other taxes, Davis says the business community often supports increasing them. DAVIS: At some point, it's just not worth refusing choosing to pay a few more pennies per gallon if the cost is going to be having to hit a pothole and get your vehicle realigned or wasting time and money stuck in traffic. WERTZ: Any tax increase proposed by Oklahoma lawmakers will need a legislative supermajority, a tall order even with a $900 billion budget gap. But there's another reason why motor-fuel tax hikes might fly in 2017. It's not an election year. For NPR News, I'm Joe Wertz in Oklahoma City.

They affect low-income people more than those with higher incomes. But in recent years, gas prices have been pretty low. And unlike other taxes, Davis says the business community often supports increasing them. DAVIS: At some point, it's just not worth refusing choosing to pay a few more pennies per gallon if the cost is going to be having to hit a pothole and get your vehicle realigned or wasting time and money stuck in traffic. WERTZ: Any tax increase proposed by Oklahoma lawmakers will need a legislative supermajority, a tall order even with a $900 billion budget gap. But there's another reason why motor-fuel tax hikes might fly in 2017. It's not an election year.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse the Great Recession, reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history. . . (APPLAUSE)SIEGEL: You might have said that our sights were set a little too high, but that's what we did, the president said in his farewell address last week. So what is likely to be Barack Obama's economic legacy? For an answer to that, we turn now to Kenneth Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard, who was in the John McCain camp back in 2008. He joins us now from Davos, Switzerland. Welcome to the program once again. KENNETH ROGOFF: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: The first monthly jobs report of the Obama presidency showed the country had lost 791,000 jobs in January 2009. The last one assessing this past December showed job growth of 156,000, 75 consecutive months showing job gains, not losses. Is that a fair measure of Obama's economic legacy? ROGOFF: Well, I think it's one measure. He pulled us out of a very deep abyss. We could have had a second Great Depression and we didn't. I mean, there were a lot of people who helped. And frankly, even George Bush did things he couldn't imagine towards the end of his presidency with fiscal stimulus and such to help. But Obama really ramped it up, really took control. And I think history will judge him as a great president on the economic side, on par with Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. SIEGEL: Not just one who continued the policies of George W. Bush, you say, but who really did intensify that effort. ROGOFF: Oh, he certainly didn't just continue the policies of George W. Bush. I was just trying to make sure George Bush got a little credit here. I mean, he did some stimulus and Obama ramped it up. He put in financial regulation. There were some really key technical things he did with stress-testing the banks that really helped. And, of course, he supported the Federal Reserve's policy, and this in an extremely fractious, difficult political climate at a very grave time for our country. SIEGEL: I recall your being somewhat skeptical of the auto bailout, saying that, yes, the U. S. would always be involved in the financial sector very heavily, but the auto industry might not figure that much in our future. Was Obama more right than you thought to have bailed out GM and Chrysler? ROGOFF: It worked and I think it helped stabilize things, so yes. I mean, it's true that the future of manufacturing in the U. S. is probably going to go the way the future of agriculture. It already is way less than 10 percent of jobs, although you'd never know that from the political rhetoric. It's likely to decrease. But no, I mean, that was certainly, I'd say, a flourish on his policy. It's not a central one. But it worked much better than I thought it would. SIEGEL: Obama extended health insurance to - said 20 million Americans. There was a rise in median household income last year, and the earned income tax credit was expanded. Do you think there'll be any Obama legacy about reversing the trend toward inequality of wealth, or just a couple of years that were blips on the radar? ROGOFF: Well, he certainly brought a lot of people back to work. But you have to understand these are global events going on that are hurting the middle class in advanced countries. Every single advanced country is suffering from a similar problem, even though, you know, you can go from France to Germany to Canada, they have all different policies. So it's a big, long, historical wave that he's fighting against. SIEGEL: You're in Davos at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Of course, the remarkable thing about Davos is the appearance of President Xi of China. I guess first just that he's there, and second that he's the world leader expressing great confidence in the world economic market. ROGOFF: They have not been able to get major Chinese representation here ever before. Suddenly, with Donald Trump coming in, he sees an opening. The U. S. is retreating from trade. They're talking protectionism, talking about pulling back on NATO, and China's moving to fill in the gap. I mean, there's a bit of hypocrisy there in the sense that the fact is the U. S. is way more open to the world than China is. It's not that easy to invest in China. But nevertheless, from a political strategy point of view it's a master stroke.

One of them is Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor who's the choice for commerce secretary. Another is Steven Mnuchin, the hedge fund investor who's the pick for secretary of the Treasury. We brought in part of our own economic team. Jared Bernstein is a former chief economist to Vice President Biden, author of the book \"The Reconnection Agenda. \" Good morning to you again, sir. JARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning. INSKEEP: And also Peter Morici, a conservative economist who writes for The New York Post, among many other publications. Thanks to you as well for coming in. PETER MORICI: Nice to be with you. INSKEEP: So how do these Cabinet choices compare with what the president-elect promised while campaigning? Peter, you can start. MORICI: Well, he didn't really promise much in terms of who he would put there. But essentially, we're getting generals, billionaires and people with PR experience, not a lot of economics, not a lot of policy expertise. And it draws concern as to whether he's really going to put together a coherent plan that reflects what he campaigned on. INSKEEP: But did he promise disruption when he was campaigning? Is it fair to say this is a disruptive set of choices, Jared? BERNSTEIN: Well, you know, I very much agree with Peter's assessment of the Cabinet's experience. But what I would see differently is that I actually think he did very much make a set of promises to a group of people who were instrumental in his getting elected, and that's working-class folks who've been on the wrong side of globalization, on the wrong side of inequality. I think many of those would be rightly very surprised to see a Cabinet that was largely billionaires, that as far as I can tell right now is talking mostly about big, fat tax cuts for rich people. INSKEEP: They're also talking about protectionist policies and that sort of thing, though. They are talking about trying to shift the way the United States approaches globalization. MORICI: But it seems to be deal-making. Let's lean on General Motors. Let's lean on Carrier. Let's lean on United Technology. You know, all the deals in the world are not going to give you the kind of turnaround and jobs growth that he needs. For example, 100,000 more jobs a month would mean a hundred deals a month. INSKEEP: Oh. MORICI: That's absurd. Instead, he needs to create a suitable environment for trade. And he's pooh-poohing congressional proposals to change the tax structure and things of that nature. It doesn't seem like he's interested in the kinds of holistic solutions that will give rise to fundamental change and incentives to locate here. INSKEEP: He did talk about changes to the health care system over the weekend. He talked with Robert Costa of The Washington Post. And he claimed, although he did not give any details, that he was very close to having a replacement ready, his own plan to replace Obamacare. Wouldn't say what it was, but he said it would be \"insurance for everybody\" - that's a quote - lower prices for the insurance, lower deductibles for the insurance, lower drug prices. What do you make of all this, gentlemen? BERNSTEIN: Well, look, I mean, this is - it sounds a little bit like Medicare, by the way, Medicare for All, which is something Ted Kennedy was for years ago. INSKEEP: Socialized medicine. BERNSTEIN: Yeah. So, I mean, it's very - it's a very important set of statements because it flies in the face of what we're actually seeing from folks like Tom Price, his designee for Health and Human Services, the kinds of plans that depend on cost shifting back on to people. So high deductibles - so, you know, these high-risk pools, plans that shift costs back on to folks that the Affordable Care Act was actually trying to take off of them. So it really goes the opposite way. One other quick point on this. One - another piece of this is that when you get rid of the ACA - when you get rid of the Affordable Care Act, you're implementing a huge tax cut for millionaires and actually a tax increase for people who were formerly getting the premium subsidy tax cuts. INSKEEP: Oh, because there were a lot of tax changes as part of Obamacare. BERNSTEIN: Exactly. Well. . . INSKEEP: Peter Morici, what do you think, as a conservative economist, of what the president-elect set out as principles that he wants, insurance for everybody, et cetera, et cetera? MORICI: A fundamental problem that Donald Trump has to address - the Democrats have to address, the Republicans have to address, everyone has to address - is that we pay substantially more for specific health care services, drugs, medical devices and so forth than the Europeans, about 50 percent more. It sounds to me like he is circling around a European system where they regulate prices. The only way he can deliver on what he promised is to regulate prices. Now, as for cutting taxes on billionaires, you know, some of his taxes kick in on families that make $250,000 a year. That is a substantial income. But to say it's just tax cuts for billionaires is wrong. The thing is is that he is willing to take on the issues that neither Obama nor the conservatives and Republicans - conservative Republicans are. INSKEEP: I want to ask one other question, though. Is he taking them on realistically? Philip Klein, managing editor of the Washington Examiner, which is a conservative-leaning publication, said this over the weekend. Quote, \"what Trump said on health care is like we're going to Mars without fuel for the price of a Popsicle stick. NASA is figuring out details. \" Is the president-elect wrestling seriously with the issues here? MORICI: That was demagoguery. My feeling is that he is wrestling with - seriously by entertaining those solutions because the Europeans have a range of systems. Some have a single provider system. . . BERNSTEIN: Yeah. MORICI: . . . Some have a single-payer system, some have private insurance. BERNSTEIN: So I just, look, I. . . MORICI: Hold on. What - they all deal with pricing, and he seems to be willing to take that on. BERNSTEIN: So I don't think he's willing to take on any of that stuff. I think he's just - I don't think he actually has a plan. I think he's just making stuff up as he goes along, and I don't believe what he's talking about. What I think is particularly important here, though, is that he is completely at odds with his Republican caucus, who, again, has a plan that shifts costs back on to individuals much in the way that the Affordable Care Act was trying to take cost back the other way. In fact, what Donald Trump is talking about is much closer - and I agree with Peter on this - is much closer to the type of health care reform that Democrats have been trying to move forward for years. MORICI: In his press conference, he specifically talked about drug pricing. He specifically talked about it. BERNSTEIN: Yeah, true. INSKEEP: Negotiating for drugs, yeah. MORICI: And that's not the first time. He's also talked about. . . BERNSTEIN: It's actually a good idea. MORICI: He's also talked about a single-payer system in the past. The real question for Democrats then is, are you willing to work with him, or are you going to criticize everything he says or does? 'Cause he's embracing some of your ideas, and you're trashing him right now. BERNSTEIN: No, no. I just say that - there's no question that Democrats would be happy to work with him if that's the direction he's going in. No one believes that that's really the direction he's going in. INSKEEP: Let me ask about one other thing, gentlemen. The inauguration is coming up on Friday. Perhaps you've noticed. And The New York Times reports that more than $100 million has been raised by the Trump Inaugural Committee. More than $100 million, that's a record. It's more, I believe, than both of Obama's inaugurations combined. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean a lot because the prices of all these things always go up. But it's a lot of money, including from corporations like Boeing. And here's a detail from the Times article. For the most important guests, his new hotel, blocks from the White House, will serve as a defacto home base. How are you feeling about this man's relationship to business? BERNSTEIN: Well, the last point you made sounds like it generates constitutional problems 'cause you're not supposed to take gifts that way. But to me, this is just part and parcel of his whole resistance to actually divest and to put his assets in a blind trust. And I think the conflicts of interest here are deep. I recognize that he doesn't have to, by law, do much about them. But I think optically, he absolutely should. INSKEEP: Peter Morici. MORICI: Well, these things are always becoming more expensive. But I think this notion that presidents have to go out and raise money for their own party their first day in office is silly. And we really do need reform in that regard. INSKEEP: Do you think that this man is going to - this man - do you think the president-elect, as president, is going to be independent of the special interests that he's now collecting money from? MORICI: Well, he's going to be more independent than other presidents 'cause he certainly has - is going to have to worry about where his money's going to come from when he leaves office. He's so incredibly wealthy that he - that's one advantage of having an incredibly wealthy guy. INSKEEP: Jared. BERNSTEIN: Yeah, I see nothing but downside from that perspective. I mean, I understand that it's difficult to divest that kind of a fortune, but he absolutely should try to do it. And the fact that he hasn't suggests deep conflicts of interest. He actually owes money to the Chinese. I mean, this is a serious problem. INSKEEP: Hundreds of millions of dollars. Gentlemen, thanks very much, always a pleasure talking with you. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland. Glad that you came by. MORICI: Thank you. BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

MCEVERS: That's Brownie Harjo reading the historical plaque outside the entrance to his martial arts studio, his dojo. It's up a flight a creaky wooden stairs - a big, open area with blue mats, punching bags and other equipment. And every Thursday night, a group of kids climbs those stairs for a taekwondo class with Harjo. HARJO: On your feet. Let's go. Enough chit-chat. We're going work now. (Unintelligible). Feet together, out - jumping jacks. Go. I've lived in Holdenville for over 50 years. I've taught martial arts for over 30 years. Hoy, hoy, hoy, hoy, hoy, hoy (ph). I've been here at this current location, which is the old Chestnut Hardware Store, for about five years. Actually, my grandpa used to work here when it was a hardware store. Sam Coleman (ph) - Salesman Sam, they called him - and they stored caskets up here. One. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: One. HARJO: Two. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Two. HARJO: Three. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Three. HARJO: Four. It's not an industrial town. It's not a rich town. It's a poor town. There's a lot of empty buildings and houses here that just - are just falling in. And we have the same problem as the United States has, as far as greedy people. They'd rather see a building of theirs fall in than to let somebody get some use out of it, you know. On your feet. (Unintelligible). I don't know if Holdenville was ever great, but Holdenville is always home. The pride just kind of went away lately. There's good people at Holdenville. Some of the best people I've ever met are here, and a lot of them are right here in my dojo, you know. No, other way. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Like this, Brownie? HARJO: Let me see. Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Like this? Like this? Like this? Like this? HARJO: We're not just here just to punch and kick. We're here to improve ourselves. UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Yeah, 'cause it'll be more faster. HARJO: We all have between 10 to 20 kids, ages 12 and under. Say tae. UNIDENTIFIED BOY: Taekwondo. HARJO: Kwon. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Kwon. HARJO: Do. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Do. HARJO: Good. Close your eyes. Forget about whatever you've been thinking about. They all do baseball, football, soccer, basketball where they compete. And sometimes you need to kind of keep in perspective that it's a game, that you're competing and there's going to be a lot of animosity developed during then between you and other kids and you and parents. The parents want every kid to be superstars, and not every kid is a superstar, as opposed to what I want here - is every kid is as good a superstar as they can be. Who's your toughest opponent? Jocelyn (ph), who's your toughest opponent? JOCELYN: Me. HARJO: You are. That's right. You are your toughest opponent. I think everyone needs to have pride in something. If you don't have pride in something, you lose hope. Good job. Jimmy, don't attack me. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Unintelligible). HARJO: There's good here in Holdenville. One. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hyah (ph). HARJO: Two. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hyah (ph). HARJO: This building - this is the oldest building in town. Three. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hyah (ph). HARJO: It's cold in the winter, it's cold in here. When it's hot in the summer, it's hot in here. It's still standing, so this building's has got a lot of character. It's got a lot of stories probably, so I guess we're just adding to the legacy of it. Four. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Hyah (ph). MCEVERS: That was Brownie Harjo at his martial arts studio in Holdenville, Okla. His story was produced by Alison Herrera, with help from Emily Wendler. It comes to us from Localore: Finding America, a national production of AIR, the Association of Independents in Radio. You can find more stories at NPR and at Finding America. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  In our series Finding America, we've been visiting some of the communities that make up the country Donald Trump will soon lead. Today, we go to Holdenville, Okla. , home to about 5,800 people. It has a small downtown - banks, restaurants and a few shops. Some are closed. BROWNIE HARJO: G. W.

Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross actually sees eye to eye with some Democrats and makes some Republicans nervous. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Wilbur Ross is a former Democrat. He's won the support of labor unions. He saved tens of thousands of jobs buying and basically rescuing bankrupt steel companies. And Democrats today largely offered Ross a warm reception, though that did not extend to the incoming president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think you have really made a very personal sacrifice. ARNOLD: Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said he was impressed by Ross' decision to sell off a huge portion of his assets to avoid conflicts of interest. BLUMENTHAL: I don't want to embarrass you or presume, but of all of the billions of dollars in holdings, you have divested more than 90 percent. You have resigned from 50 positions. The process has been enormously complex and challenging and costly to you personally, correct? WILBUR ROSS: Yes, sir. BLUMENTHAL: And I want to ask you very directly - shouldn't the president of the United States do the same? ROSS: Well, as I understand it, the ethics rules that apply to Senate to approve nominees do not apply to the president. BLUMENTHAL: But simply as a matter of appearance and morality, for that matter, you were able to do it. Why not the president? ROSS: I'm not familiar enough, Senator, with the exactitudes of his holdings. ARNOLD: Ross politely deflected ethical questions about Donald Trump during the hearing, but, interestingly, some of the deepest concerns about Ross came not from Democrats, but from Republicans. Both Ross and Trump have talked about protecting U. S. businesses by erecting tariffs against foreign competitors. That makes many free trade Republicans nervous. Senator Todd Young from Indiana said a lot of people in his state work for foreign companies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TODD YOUNG: Subaru in Lafayette employs 5,000. Toyota in Princeton - roughly 4,500 Hoosiers. So can you reassure the tens of thousands of autoworkers and others whose jobs rely on free trade that their livelihoods will not be put at risk by restrictive tariffs? ARNOLD: Several other Republicans sought similar assurances from Ross. Ross basically said that he had no intention of damaging the U. S. economy by starting a trade war, but he also said that if other countries cheat, break trade agreements, that tariffs are crucial for enforcement. (SOUNDBITE CONGRESSIONAL HEARING)ROSS: We are a country of the rule of law. Some of these other countries are instead the law of the ruler. That's an asymmetry that permeates all kinds of sectors of their economies and ours, and we need to deal with that. ARNOLD: Ross also said that the first thing he wants to do is deal with unfair trade barriers imposed by other countries, and he repeatedly talked about China. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROSS: It's a little weird that we have very low tariffs, and China has very high tariffs. That seems to me to be a bit of an imbalance. ARNOLD: Unlike Donald Trump's often oversimplified rhetoric about trade, Ross offered nuance in his answers. He said he preferred carrots to sticks for dealing with trading partners. He acknowledged at one point that technology kills a lot of jobs and didn't just blame cheap labor abroad. This afternoon, Democrat and ranking member Senator Bill Nelson of Florida thanked Ross for his non-evasive answers and summed things up this way.

Boeing is one of them. It also happens to be one of the corporate sponsors for his inauguration. As Tom Banse of the Northwest News Network reports, the nation's single largest exporter enters the Trump era with plans for buyouts and layoffs. TOM BANSE, BYLINE: A 32-year career at the Boeing company comes to a close in April for engineer Dave Baine of suburban Seattle. DAVE BAINE: Yeah, it's been a long road. It's been a good career in many ways. But like everything else, you know, yeah. There's been good things. There's been bad things. BANSE: Baine was already prepared to retire when Boeing sealed the deal by making him a buyout offer last week. BAINE: It's better than a gold watch, by the way. (Laughter). BANSE: As in six months' pay in a lump sum and extended health insurance. BAINE: It will help the younger folks that want to stick around and allow some of the older folks to exit quickly and quietly. BANSE: The buyout offer Baine received is part of a new wave of Boeing downsizing. This comes on top of nearly 11,000 job cuts across the company last year, according to a union tally. The company's PR department declined to say whether there's a specific target number for job cuts this year. Most of the trims are coming from the commercial jetliner workforce in western Washington state. Boeing has a lot of planes on order, but new jet sales are slowing. Plus, Canada, Brazil and China are getting in the game, making for increased competition and pricing pressure. Richard Aboulafia is an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. RICHARD ABOULAFIA: We're not seeing any evidence of a serious downturn, but there's just a lot more risk of a downturn materializing. BANSE: Aboulafia says Boeing is a prime example of the kind of major manufacturing company that will be in the spotlight under President Trump. He says the incoming administration creates additional risks as well as opportunities. ABOULAFIA: Obviously, anything that caused any kind of trade ruckus, particularly with China - that would be very bad news. BANSE: On the other side of the ledger, the prospect of higher military spending could help major defense contractors like Boeing. New fighter jets and a multibillion-dollar contract to replace the aging Air Force One jumbo jets spurred a second face-to-face meeting between President-elect Trump and Boeing's CEO. Dennis Muilenburg left Trump Tower Tuesday saying he felt very encouraged. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DENNIS MUILENBURG: We're all on the same page here. Our objective is to provide the best capability for the country most affordably. We want to generate jobs in the U. S. BANSE: Trump did not speak with reporters after this meeting with Boeing, but the president-elect was pretty candid about his strategy for pressing for cost concessions.

It closed above 20,000. The stock market has been rising since Donald Trump's election. The Dow is up more than nine percent, and the broader S&P 500 is up more than 7 percent. As NPR's Chris Arnold reports, investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be good for big companies and for the economy as a whole. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: One reason investors keep bidding up stock prices seems to be that the president has said and done a bunch of things that the stock market likes. He's talked of cutting taxes, a big infrastructure program, less regulation. He's chosen top executives from industry and finance for Cabinet positions. Juli Niemann is an analyst with Smith Moore and Company. JULI NIEMANN: What we have going on now is a huge optimistic rally that this is pro-growth, pro-USA. And money is just going to start pouring into the economy, so it's a tremendous amount of optimism. The only fudge factor, though, is a lot of unrealistic optimism out there as well. ARNOLD: Other market watchers agree that investors are probably a bit over excited. David Kotok is chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors. He says, OK, let's take infrastructure spending. That could be good. DAVID KOTOK: It's a great idea to rebuild airports like LaGuardia in New York and to fix bridges and fix roads and schools and sewer plants and so forth. No one objects to those issues. ARNOLD: That could create a lot of jobs and get money flowing like Niemann was talking about. There's no lack of old, rundown bridges to fix, but. . . KOTOK: How do you pay for them? ARNOLD: Part of Trump's plan for how to pay for them is to lower corporate taxes. He wants to entice multinational corporations to bring more of their profits back to the U. S. and pay taxes here - that is, instead of stashing the money in tax havens around the world. But Trump can't do that by waving a magic wand. It very well could be a long, protracted debate in Congress. KOTOK: So Trump is going to learn that when you govern as president, you're not the king and the czar, but you also have to deal with the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. ARNOLD: But both Niemann and Kotok say investors are pricing stocks as if those pro-growth policies are going to get enacted quickly and spur bigger earnings. KOTOK: What if that all doesn't come together? In that case, the market has gone too far too fast. ARNOLD: OK, so what should the everyday investor do now that the Dow has crested 20,000? We talked to Daniel Egan, the director of behavioral finance and investing at betterment. com. It's an online financial adviser. We should also say they've been an NPR sponsor. And as the Dow approached 20,000, this supposed milestone, Egan was not on a trading floor. He was home giving his baby a warm bottle. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY COOING)DANIEL EGAN: OK, come here. We're going to do this. Come here, you. ARNOLD: Egan says all the hoopla could be used as a reminder of the importance of what's called rebalancing your portfolio. Say you have a long-term financial plan of holding 50 percent in stocks, the rest in bonds and real estate. When stocks surge like they just have, you might have 55 percent of your holdings in stocks, so you sell some stock to get back to your target 50 percent. That's the rebalancing part. Egan says, though, that people often don't like to sell stocks when they're rising. EGAN: It's like taking your best football player off the field right after he's been doing amazingly well. ARNOLD: But Egan says you want to buy stocks low and sell them high, and that's part of what rebalancing does. Egan recommends setting up automatic rebalancing four times a year so you can forget about the market and spend more time with your baby or your family. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

ARNOLD: But both Niemann and Kotok say investors are pricing stocks as if those pro-growth policies are going to get enacted quickly and spur bigger earnings. KOTOK: What if that all doesn't come together? In that case, the market has gone too far too fast. ARNOLD: OK, so what should the everyday investor do now that the Dow has crested 20,000? We talked to Daniel Egan, the director of behavioral finance and investing at betterment. com. It's an online financial adviser. We should also say they've been an NPR sponsor. And as the Dow approached 20,000, this supposed milestone, Egan was not on a trading floor. He was home giving his baby a warm bottle. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY COOING) DANIEL EGAN: OK, come here. We're going to do this. Come here, you. ARNOLD: Egan says all the hoopla could be used as a reminder of the importance of what's called rebalancing your portfolio. Say you have a long-term financial plan of holding 50 percent in stocks, the rest in bonds and real estate. When stocks surge like they just have, you might have 55 percent of your holdings in stocks, so you sell some stock to get back to your target 50 percent. That's the rebalancing part. Egan says, though, that people often don't like to sell stocks when they're rising. EGAN: It's like taking your best football player off the field right after he's been doing amazingly well. ARNOLD: But Egan says you want to buy stocks low and sell them high, and that's part of what rebalancing does. Egan recommends setting up automatic rebalancing four times a year so you can forget about the market and spend more time with your baby or your family. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

It would have lowered the cost of FHA loans to homeowners. That's not going to happen, at least for now, because in his very first hours in office, President Trump issued an order suspending that fee cut which had many people asking, what's up with that? NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The Obama administration had authorized the fee reduction for FHA loans. Geoff McIntosh is the president of the California Association of Realtors. He is not happy that President Trump moved to suspend it. GEOFF MCINTOSH: We were disappointed. It would have made a difference to California homebuyers of about $860 a year. ARNOLD: So why would the new administration want to keep that money out of Americans' pockets? Well, conservatives had warned that cutting the fees for FHA borrowers, that might leave taxpayers on the hook in another housing crash. Ed Pinto is a director with the American Enterprise Institute's Center on Housing Risk. ED PINTO: FHA insures over $1 trillion in outstanding mortgage loans. ARNOLD: So, OK, here's how all this works. The FHA allows Americans to buy homes with as little as a 3 percent down payment. Private lenders actually make the loans and the FHA guarantees them. And the homebuyers, as part of this deal, agree to pay fees into a reserve fund that covers losses on loans that go bad. Those fees went up during the foreclosure crisis, and the Obama administration had been lowering them back down as things got back to normal. The money in that emergency fund, by the way, is also back above its legally required level, but Pinto says. . . PINTO: There's been a lot of concern that the level of that fund is insufficient to really cover FHA in the event there were another serious event in terms of foreclosures. ARNOLD: The FHA did require a bailout after the housing crash, but for the sake of comparison it was less than 1 percent of the money that the government had to use to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which also guarantee home loans. So other experts say that concerns like Pinto's are overblown. Chris Mayer is a housing economist at Columbia University. He says for a long time, some conservatives have been warning that the FHA is a trillion dollar time bomb that we should be really worried about. CHRIS MAYER: We just went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the FHA didn't take down taxpayers or the federal government in any way shape or form. You know, at some point you can't keep saying this thing's going to blow up, this thing's going to blow up. ARNOLD: As far as the Trump administration blocking this fee cut, the optics don't seem terribly good. That is just after his inaugural address where President Trump said he wanted to help working class Americans, one of his first executive orders blocks working class homebuyers all across the country from saving money on their mortgages. Geoff McIntosh with the realtors group says. . . MCINTOSH: Yes, I did find it somewhat ironic, but I can also appreciate that they wanted to make sure that it was a sound fiscal decision before they executed it. ARNOLD: McIntosh says though he's cautiously optimistic that after the Trump administration reviews all the facts and figures that it will allow the fee cut to go through to help make homeownership a bit more affordable for Americans with FHA loans.

The year started with Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passing so-called right-to-work laws that affect how labor unions collect dues. That made Kentucky the 27th state with right-to-work laws. Missouri and New Hampshire could be next in line. Todd Bookman of New Hampshire Public Radio reports that if the bill passes in his state, it will be the first in the northeast to rollback union rights. TODD BOOKMAN, BYLINE: Union leaders have successfully fended off right-to-work bills in New Hampshire for decades, so it wasn't a surprise when hundreds of rank-and-file members, many in red T-shirts, filled the statehouse during a recent public hearing. State Senator Dan Innis held the gavel, but at times struggled to handle the crowd. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAN INNIS: Let me first ask those in attendance if we could please refrain from applause and other activities so we can continue to move this forward. . . (BOOING)INNIS: . . . Including booing - I would greatly appreciate it, as would your fellow folks who are here today. So please. . . BOOKMAN: While opponents were fired up, their preferred candidates didn't fare as well during the November elections. Republicans now control the New Hampshire House, Senate and governor's office, and they've made passage of right-to-work a priority. Broadly speaking, these laws prohibit unions from forcing non-union members to pay fees to cover the cost of collective bargaining. For State Senator Andy Sanborn, that policy is a natural fit for New Hampshire, where about 10 percent of the workforce is unionized. ANDY SANBORN: This is the Live Free or Die state, so we're about personal freedom. We're about personal liberty. And what makes a stronger statement than reaffirming the fact that you're not being compelled to have to pay into a union if you don't want to pay into it? BOOKMAN: But for opponents, the laws create what's called a freeriding problem. Bobby Jones is with AFSCME Local 3657, which represents public safety and corrections workers. He says employees who don't chip into the union still get the advantages of collective bargaining, like higher wages and benefits. BOBBY JONES: So it's just like you and I want to go out one night for a couple of beers. I choose the bar. We go out. We both have a couple of drinks. We're talking about whatever the topic is - the Patriots going to the Super Bowl. You know, when the bill comes out, I pull out my wallet, and you don't reach for yours. BOOKMAN: Both sides of this debate toss around competing statistics. Backers say it will draw jobs and investment to New Hampshire, while opponents call it right-to-work-for-less and say that workers will lose bargaining power and see their wages erode. But in the end, it's become less of an economic argument and more of a purely partisan fight - one aimed at weakening unions, which generally back Democratic candidates with campaign cash and volunteers. DEAN SPILIOTES: Some people do view it as kind of Republican payback against the role of unions in elections. BOOKMAN: Dean Spiliotes is a political analyst with Southern New Hampshire University. He says right-to-work laws are a central part of the conservative platform, even if it's not an issue that gets lots of attention from most voters. SPILIOTES: From time to time, you have these issues that kind of transcend the impact that they may have on an individual state and become kind of a litmus test for where you are ideologically. BOOKMAN: After years of trying, New Hampshire Republicans are turning that ideology into action. The bill cleared the state Senate by a single vote and now heads to the House, where the GOP holds a 50-seat majority. For NPR News, I'm Todd Bookman in Concord, N. H.

For State Senator Andy Sanborn, that policy is a natural fit for New Hampshire, where about 10 percent of the workforce is unionized. ANDY SANBORN: This is the Live Free or Die state, so we're about personal freedom. We're about personal liberty. And what makes a stronger statement than reaffirming the fact that you're not being compelled to have to pay into a union if you don't want to pay into it? BOOKMAN: But for opponents, the laws create what's called a freeriding problem. Bobby Jones is with AFSCME Local 3657, which represents public safety and corrections workers. He says employees who don't chip into the union still get the advantages of collective bargaining, like higher wages and benefits. BOBBY JONES: So it's just like you and I want to go out one night for a couple of beers. I choose the bar. We go out. We both have a couple of drinks. We're talking about whatever the topic is - the Patriots going to the Super Bowl. You know, when the bill comes out, I pull out my wallet, and you don't reach for yours. BOOKMAN: Both sides of this debate toss around competing statistics. Backers say it will draw jobs and investment to New Hampshire, while opponents call it right-to-work-for-less and say that workers will lose bargaining power and see their wages erode. But in the end, it's become less of an economic argument and more of a purely partisan fight - one aimed at weakening unions, which generally back Democratic candidates with campaign cash and volunteers. DEAN SPILIOTES: Some people do view it as kind of Republican payback against the role of unions in elections. BOOKMAN: Dean Spiliotes is a political analyst with Southern New Hampshire University. He says right-to-work laws are a central part of the conservative platform, even if it's not an issue that gets lots of attention from most voters. SPILIOTES: From time to time, you have these issues that kind of transcend the impact that they may have on an individual state and become kind of a litmus test for where you are ideologically. BOOKMAN: After years of trying, New Hampshire Republicans are turning that ideology into action. The bill cleared the state Senate by a single vote and now heads to the House, where the GOP holds a 50-seat majority. For NPR News, I'm Todd Bookman in Concord, N.

That was arrived at so that presidents and politicians look good. The real number is 20 percent, and it could be more than that. CORNISH: So how did Trump get from 5. 2 percent to 20 percent? Well, at that time he cited the fact that the Labor Department excludes a large swath of unemployed people from the count.

SWONK: It's very hard to have conspiracies in terms of distorting this data because I spent time with statisticians, they're bureaucrat statisticians. And you almost have to drink because they're that boring to be around. You know, they're really just thinking about how to measure the economy the best. They've done this over decades.

NPR's Debbie Elliott wanted to know how small business owners think the new president is doing, so she went to Atlanta and brought back this report. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: At lunch hour, the line stretches out the door at Taqueria del Sol on Atlanta's west side. Inside the tiny kitchen is a swirl of activity. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking Spanish). EDDIE HERNANDEZ: This is my crew. They're all from Mexico. ELLIOTT: Co-owner Eddie Hernandez is the creator of the menu here - a hybrid of cuisine from his native Monterrey, Mexico and down-home southern cooking, like tangy turnip greens seasoned with red chilies and re-fried black-eyed peas. HERNANDEZ: The food can get us together and make us think differently about each other. ELLIOTT: Hernandez and his partner Mike Klank have been running restaurants together since 1987. I ask what they expect from the Trump administration. MIKE KLANK: I hope President Trump turns out to be better than I expect him to be (laughter). I don't know if that's an expectation. That's just hope. I hope he turns out to be more reasonable and centrist than he is because I think Eddie and I are both conservative economically but liberal socially. So we're hoping that maybe we can get some stuff done, but I doubt - I don't expect anything to get done. HERNANDEZ: Every four years we go through same thing - you know, a lot of promises and nothing gets done. KLANK: I'm 67 years old. I've been through a lot of presidents. I'm not crazy about some. HERNANDEZ: (Laughter). ELLIOTT: Klank says there should be a better system for businesses to sponsor immigrants, not more obstacles. In Atlanta, a majority Democratic city in a mostly Republican Georgia, the transition to a Trump administration brings mixed expectations. Atlanta has long fashioned itself the cosmopolitan business capital of the southeast. It's home to major corporations like Delta and Coca-Cola, but it's also a center for small business. It ranks second behind New York among cities with the most African-American owned companies. And since 2000, metro Atlanta's Hispanic population has more than doubled. Latino businesses line the busy Buford Highway, a main artery that stretches from Atlanta to the suburbs. EDUARDO FERNANDEZ: Quiero un cuatro de pollo. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Para aqui o para llevar?

ELLIOTT: Sitting near the kids carnival area in the mall, Fernandez talks about the new president. FERNANDEZ: I'm worried about his orders and ideas and things he's implementing, his attitude. ELLIOTT: Fernandez was born in Laredo, Texas, but spent his childhood freely crossing back and forth over the border to be with family in Mexico. He says Trump is moving recklessly, harming longstanding relations between the two countries. Fernandez says he's particularly alarmed by what he perceives as an effort to single out certain groups. FERNANDEZ: For me, that's evil. You can have an issue with me. You can have an issue with Mr. Jones. But you cannot have an issue with all white people or all gays or all Muslims. That's not Christian. ELLIOTT: Fernandez has watched the turmoil over the executive order limiting visitors from certain mostly Muslim countries. He says he doesn't think President Trump thought through the implications of making good on his campaign promises at such a frenetic pace. FERNANDEZ: I will give him that. He's (laughter) - he's doing what he promised. He keeps doing one and another and another. It's like, please. ELLIOTT: Fernandez says he's unsure what the new administration will mean for his business. So for the short term, he won't be looking to expand. But some small businesses are banking on Trump's policies to help them. Michael Flock is the founder and CEO of Flock Specialty Finance. In the sub-prime, higher-risk lending market, he's optimistic about Trump's presidency. MICHAEL FLOCK: I wasn't for him initially. I'm a middle-of-the-road Republican. ELLIOTT: Flock says he voted for Trump after feeling the impact of, what he calls, onerous regulations during the Obama administration. FLOCK: We needed some regulation because in this industry of debt collection, there are a bunch of cowboys, and we needed some new rules. But, in America, sometimes we go too far. ELLIOTT: He says middle-market firms like his have been squeezed, so he welcomes Trump's promise to roll back the red tape and cut taxes. Flock's high-rise office on the perimeter of Atlanta is lined with portraits of Thomas Jefferson, Winston Churchill and Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican reformer. That's how he sees President Trump. FLOCK: I think, you know, he's a radical reformer. I think we need major change, and I think it takes somebody outside the government to do that. So I think he may be the right guy at the right time if he can stay focused.

LATASHA KINNARD: I'm pretty much just embarrassed to have him as my president. ELLIOTT: Kinnard is the CEO of Start Young Financial Group. KINNARD: I don't reject him but having him has me be embarrassed. ELLIOTT: From a trendy bakery in downtown Atlanta, Kinnard says she used to work in finance for a large corporation but now has her own business that encourages young black professionals to build wealth. She says she votes Democratic but doesn't think either political party serves her interests. Her expectations for the president are pretty low. KINNARD: There is a lot of fear, like, not just nervousness or anxiety, but just flat out here that Donald Trump isn't fit to run the country simply because of a lack of empathy for the people who make up this country. ELLIOTT: She checks off a litany of worries - health care, immigration, the idea that alternative facts have a place in political discourse.

People will be mad tweeting during the game tomorrow, and we don't know whether President Trump will be among them. But whether you are a supporter, who thinks the president's tweets keep it real, or a critic, who thinks Trump is crude and mean, you probably noticed by now that the president keeps his followers on their toes because he's unpredictable. But the effect of those tweets is becoming more predictable, according to one company that is trading on them. On Monday, President Trump tweeted that Delta Airlines computer failure was partly to blame for the chaos in airports over the weekend. By the end of the day, Delta's stock was down 4 percent, and one company says it is making a lot of money on that tweet. Ben Gaddis is the president of the advertising company T3. That company has built a bot that analyzes the president's tweets and short sells stocks in companies that he attacks. And we reached Ben Gaddis in Austin. Welcome. BEN GADDIS: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: So, Ben, just define terms briefly for people who don't follow this stuff. What's a bot? GADDIS: A bot is - it's a program, and it's actually based on an algorithm. And the bot listens to President Trump's tweets. So anytime he tweets, it takes the tweet and determines if there's a publicly traded company in - mentioned in it. And if it's negative, we've seen the stock drop very quickly, so the bot actually shorts that stock in real time. And it all happens in less than 20 milliseconds. MARTIN: Twenty milliseconds. So OK, and for those who don't follow this stuff, what does short selling mean? GADDIS: Short selling means that you essentially buy the stock, or borrow the stock, at a high price predicting that it's going to go down. And then as the stock goes down, you actually buy back shares of that at a lower price and close out your short. And the difference between the two is your profit. MARTIN: So you basically - you're profiting off of the stock dropping in value. . . GADDIS: That's correct. MARTIN: . . . Predicting it's going to drop. You're predicting that it's going to drop in value. So you call your algorithm the Trump and Dump Bot. It's actually able to detect whether a tweet is positive or negative. OK. Now, without giving away any company secrets, how? GADDIS: So we do what's called sentiment analysis, and it's actually a pretty standard practice. We actually use sentiment analysis for our large clients, like UPS and Capital One and Allstate, as we look at their Twitter feeds and social presence. So what we do is we're able to measure, based on key words, the type of sentiment associated with the tweet. So when President Trump tweeted about Toyota, on a scale of one to 100 - one being very negative and 100 being very positive - that tweet had a 17. 9 percent sentiment ranking, meaning it's very low. So we're able to extract that and then put a threshold. And if anything is below that, then we actually make the trade. MARTIN: Now, what would you say to people who might argue that that's kind of a messed up way to earn money? GADDIS: Well, I would say that we agree that the negativity around a stock and their prices going down is not a good thing, but it's happening. And so the bot that we built actually donates all its profits to the ASPCA. So our belief now is if President Trump tweets something negative, we save a puppy. So that's something that I think almost anybody can get behind. MARTIN: OK. Well, that's Ben Gaddis. He is the president of the advertising company - they actually prefer the term innovation company - T3. He was kind enough to join us from Austin, Texas.

He signed executive orders to begin to roll back the financial regulations of the Dodd-Frank bill that was passed in 2010 after the U. S. financial crisis. To talk more about what we know and what might be likely, we're joined by Karen Petrou. She's managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, which advises financial firms on public policy. Thanks very much for being with us. KAREN PETROU: Thank you. SIMON: Do you get a sense of what's on the chopping block? PETROU: It's hard to tell from the executive order, but I think it is queer that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is on the chopping block, along with some of the rules that the president believes suppress credit availability. SIMON: Well, explain that bank shut to us, if you - if you will - about credit availability - because a lot of people think a low interest rate is a good idea for them. PETROU: That's true, but low interest rates combined with some of the cost of the new requirements, especially the capital requirements for the biggest banks, make it very difficult for the banks to lend profitably at these very low rates. Their cost of capital and their operating cost is very high. And ultra low rates make it very inexpensive to borrow, although the growth in the economic development that supports recovery is also made weaker by them. SIMON: And what's the case against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that some people have had? PETROU: I think the case against it is from some in the industry and many Republicans - is that it is insulated from congressional accountability, freed from the appropriations process and, from some in the industry's perspective, out there writing very binding, very difficult and very complex rules. Defenders believe those rules are critical to protect borrowers, but that's the case the opposition has against the CFPB. SIMON: Yeah, and the numbers have changed in the Congress, so they feel they have the votes to do it. PETROU: I think that's right, although it will be very controversial. The CFPB was originally Senator Elizabeth Warren's idea, and she is really mounting the barricades to defend her baby. SIMON: Dodd-Frank was put together with full advice from the financial community on Wall Street. In fact, there were some Democrats that were critical of that. They felt that, on the contrary, it protected the major lending institutions and banks - investment banks - too much. How are they likely to receive a rollback now? PETROU: I think it depends on what it is. A critical aspect of what appears to me Mr. Trump's plan would be to roll back a part of the law that President Obama thought was essential, but big banks do, too. And that's the way a very large financial institution and not just a bank - a company like ARG or Lehman - would be handled if it failed. There are provisions in Dodd-Frank where I think there's a strong difference of opinion between congressional Republicans and, I think, the Trump administration. And some of the bigger banks who are fearful about changing that aspect of the law. SIMON: Is there a provision, in particular, that you think valuably protects consumers that you would worry about disappearing? PETROU: Yes and no. I think the provisions in Dodd-Frank that built on, but were not necessarily required in addition to old law give the regulators the authority to sanction bad actors and particularly the Justice Department. The real - in my opinion, the real benefits to consumers is clear information on which to make the best informed decision they can. But because even simple products like mortgages are complex, especially for people who may not speak English or whose literacy is compromised, I think you need really tough enforcement to make lenders do the right thing. And we haven't seen that, Dodd-Frank notwithstanding. SIMON: Karen Petrou is managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. Thanks very much for being with us. PETROU: Thank you, Scott. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Donald Trump moved to fulfill a campaign promise this week. He signed executive orders to begin to roll back the financial regulations of the Dodd-Frank bill that was passed in 2010 after the U. S. financial crisis. To talk more about what we know and what might be likely, we're joined by Karen Petrou. She's managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, which advises financial firms on public policy. Thanks very much for being with us. KAREN PETROU: Thank you. SIMON: Do you get a sense of what's on the chopping block? PETROU: It's hard to tell from the executive order, but I think it is queer that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is on the chopping block, along with some of the rules that the president believes suppress credit availability. SIMON: Well, explain that bank shut to us, if you - if you will - about credit availability - because a lot of people think a low interest rate is a good idea for them. PETROU: That's true, but low interest rates combined with some of the cost of the new requirements, especially the capital requirements for the biggest banks, make it very difficult for the banks to lend profitably at these very low rates. Their cost of capital and their operating cost is very high. And ultra low rates make it very inexpensive to borrow, although the growth in the economic development that supports recovery is also made weaker by them. SIMON: And what's the case against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that some people have had? PETROU: I think the case against it is from some in the industry and many Republicans - is that it is insulated from congressional accountability, freed from the appropriations process and, from some in the industry's perspective, out there writing very binding, very difficult and very complex rules. Defenders believe those rules are critical to protect borrowers, but that's the case the opposition has against the CFPB. SIMON: Yeah, and the numbers have changed in the Congress, so they feel they have the votes to do it. PETROU: I think that's right, although it will be very controversial. The CFPB was originally Senator Elizabeth Warren's idea, and she is really mounting the barricades to defend her baby. SIMON: Dodd-Frank was put together with full advice from the financial community on Wall Street. In fact, there were some Democrats that were critical of that. They felt that, on the contrary, it protected the major lending institutions and banks - investment banks - too much. How are they likely to receive a rollback now?

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross who's off this week visiting family. We heard a lot in the presidential campaign about anger and frustration among working-class voters in America's heartland. Today, we're going to focus on one factory town in central Ohio that was once a bustling center of industry and employment, but is now beset by low wages, unemployment and social decay. Lancaster, Ohio, isn't just a research subject for our guest, Brian Alexander. It's his hometown. His new book tells the story of the company that was once Lancaster's largest employer. The Anchor Hocking glass company was a Fortune 500 company with its headquarters in the town. The company provided jobs, civic leadership and community pride. Its decline, Alexander argues, isn't just a product of increased competition and changing markets. He says the firm was undone by Wall Street investors who had little knowledge of the company and little interest in anything besides short-term profit. Brian Alexander has written three previous books about aspects of American culture and has written for a variety of publications including The New York Times, Science, Outside and Esquire. His new book is \"Glass House: The 1% Economy And The Shattering Of An American Town. \" Brian Alexander, welcome to FRESH AIR. You did a lot of reporting for this book, but it wasn't just reporting. You grew up in Lancaster? BRIAN ALEXANDER: I did grow up in Lancaster, yes. DAVIES: Yeah. What's your relationship with the place been over the years? ALEXANDER: I've loved the place. I always loved the place, even when I was graduating high school and knew I would be going away to college and probably would never live there full-time again. It was an emotional experience to leave. I'll never forget the Christmas before I left. I had served midnight mass at St. Mary's Catholic Church, and I was driving back home after mass. And it had snowed a lot during the service. I stopped at a stoplight at the corner of Cherry Street and Pleasantville Road which is a main intersection in town, and the town was absolutely still because of the snow - acted like a sound barrier. I looked around at all the lights and everything. And I let the stoplight just sort of turn green and red and green and red a few times, and I started to cry because even though I wanted to leave the town, it was my town. And I knew that I was never going to feel that same way about a place ever again. DAVIES: You describe it as an all-American town. When was it an all-American town and in what way? What do we mean by that? ALEXANDER: Well, you know, it's interesting. I think it's always been an all-American town and still is in some of its negative respects now. But I think what you mean is that what Forbes magazine meant, so in the - after the war - after World War II, Forbes devoted almost its entire 30th anniversary issue to Lancaster, Ohio, of all places, and positioned Lancaster as the epitome and the apogee of the all-American town, a sort of perfect balance between large industry, agriculture, small businesses like retail and merchants and so on, workers, a kind of gentry and that everything was in a - this state of almost utopian equilibrium. And for the most part, it really was like that, which is not to say there were not problems. There's always been problems. There's always been small-town scandals, and there's always been an element of poverty, a fair amount of drinking in Lancaster. My grandfather used to say that he was an old glassman from Western Pennsylvania, and he would come to visit. He would say that he never saw a town with more churches and more bars. DAVIES: (Laughter). Now, Anchor Hocking was this big glass manufacturer. Just describe this company a bit, how big it was, what kinds of stuff it made. ALEXANDER: At its peak, Anchor Hocking was the world's largest maker of glass tableware, the second largest maker of glass containers - beer bottles, peanut butter jars, mayonnaise jars and so on. It made other kinds of glass, too, like the little domes that went over electric meter covers, you know - the electric meters. It had 40 plants - could be a glass plant, but it could also be an office, it could be an R&D, it could be a distribution center. But they had 40 facilities all over the United States. DAVIES: And it's - I guess an important part of the story is it didn't just have production plants in Lancaster. The headquarters were there. The executives lived. . . ALEXANDER: Precisely. So you had a core of college-educated, sophisticated people who made good livings, working right downtown at the corner of Broad and Main Street. And more importantly, in some ways, their wives - because their wives - remember this is '40s, '50s, '60s and into the '70s - their wives typically did not work at a career-type job outside the home. They threw themselves into the town, so they did hospital benefits. They did benefits for preserving the old antebellum homes in Lancaster. They did vaccination drives. They made sure the sidewalks got repaired, the streets got paved. They attended city council meetings. I mean, this was a core of civic leadership. DAVIES: So there's a real and civic investment in the town not just economic gain. One of the things that you note is that the infrastructure that makes a town work - building new schools or hospitals - that happened in Lancaster and citizens taxed themselves to do it. ALEXANDER: They did. When natural gas was discovered in Lancaster, the citizens got together and formed their own municipal gas company, their own water company. When they decided that they needed a hospital in the teens - 19-teens - they got together, and they passed a hospital levy. When it came time for new schools, they got together and said we need new schools. So they did it. They taxed themselves, and there was a great willingness to do this. DAVIES: Now there were thousands of blue-collar workers in the town working in Anchor Hocking's glass manufacturing plants and others. . . ALEXANDER: And others, yes. DAVIES: . . . And there were wealthy or better off white-collar employees. Did the executives and their workers drink in the same bars? ALEXANDER: Absolutely. So for - you know, I told - I was sitting in this particular bar that I used to sit in when I was in my youth called Old Bill Bailey's it's on the west side. And I heard all kinds of stories about, you know, hey, Elwood was in here back in, you know, '75. And I got hired because Elwood was a vice president, and he was in there drinking beer and singing songs with the glass guys. It's not to say that everything was always harmonious. I mean, there were definitely union management fights and so on and so forth. But more than one person told me stories about getting hired by one of the executives inside a bar. DAVIES: It sounds like an idyllic town in so many ways, often in an industrial setting, things are gritty and tough and hot and sometimes dangerous. Could you take us inside the glass plant, one of these for a moment and just give us a sense of what it looked like, how it worked? ALEXANDER: What you said is true. It is gritty. It's often dangerous even. It's old, and yet I think it's important to note that a lot of guys really like working in there. They may complain about working in there, but when you listen to them talk, they actually love their jobs partly because it's kind of so extreme. And so here's why it's extreme. There are two ends to a glass plant, the hot end and the cold. The hot end is really the business end where minerals come in - melted in big furnace, comes out, and it's taken to mold machines. And guys operate these machines to make product or what's called ware. There's fire everywhere. There are flames bursting up. There's a long tunnel called a lehr where the annealing process takes place. There's fire jutting out from that. There are - a mold station, for example, where a glass baking dish is made in a glob of lava-like glass flows into the mold, and a plunger comes down and shapes the glass into a baking dish and a burst of fire comes out of that. And so when you're in the hot end of Plant 1, everything is dark, partly because it's old, and the machines are dark. And you see all these flames, and you see men silhouetted against all these flames. It's an incredibly impressive thing to see. DAVIES: Brian Alexander's book is called \"Glass House: The 1% Economy And The Shattering Of An All-American Town. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, we're speaking with Brian Alexander. He's written a new book called \"Glass House. \" It's about a manufacturing town in Ohio - Lancaster, Ohio - and how it suffered as the financial practices in America changed. So Lancaster was a town that provided employment at living wages. There was a social compact between the owners and the workers that worked for the community. And what we're going to talk about and what the book talks about is how that changed and disintegrated. And we'll get there, but first, just for a glimpse of Lancaster today, you know, you open the book by talking about a guy named Eric Brown who's a police officer, a police commander. And it's rare to see a cop cry, but he - tears come to his eyes talking about Lancaster. Tell us about him and what so troubled him about what's become of Lancaster. ALEXANDER: Eric - Eric's a great guy, first of all. He was the commander of the MCU - the Major Crimes Unit - which is a multicounty task force that comprised of member agencies. Eric grew up in Lancaster, was a local football star at the high school, tried his hand at big-time college football, decided that wasn't going to work for him. So he came back to Lancaster to become a sheriff's deputy and then joined the Lancaster Police Force, worked his way up and eventually became a commander. I think what upsets him is he - like so many people that I interviewed and spoke to in Lancaster and like me really - they still love the town. And so it's heartbreaking for them to see some of Lancaster's problems. And Eric knows probably better than anybody that it's not just drugs. Drugs are a very serious problem in the town. There's no question about that. But I think he believes that drugs are a symptom of some sort of larger, rather vague and nebulous problem that he cannot control. There's nothing he can do about this problem or series of problems. And I think it leads to an enormous level of frustration because he still has big stakes in the town. As he says, his son is still there. His son is still raising his family there. His in-laws are there. He's invested personally in the fate of the town. And when you feel there's nothing you can be doing and you meet this frustration, it's got to find an outlet. And he sort of teared up a little bit in the middle of our conversation in a bar. DAVIES: He's arresting guys he grew up with and their kids, I assume. ALEXANDER: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, this is a town where you know people, and so people you know and have known all your life - or you knew their fathers or their uncles or their cousins - you end up meeting these people in the back of a squad car or in a police office or in a jail. DAVIES: You know, there's a familiar narrative about industries of the Northeast and Midwest that, you know, they enjoyed prosperity in the post-war years when America was dominant and everybody wanted American products. And then over time, there was competition from foreign manufacturers and from other regions of the country that offered union-free, low-wage labor. And a lot of these companies had old plants that were expensive to run and maintain and kind of lost out in the competition. To what extent does that describe what happened to Anchor Hocking, this glass company and the businesses in Lancaster? ALEXANDER: That is - all that is an element. Absolutely. It's all an element. When you can pay a foreign worker a third or less of what you're paying a unionized Flint glass worker in Lancaster, that's an element. But it's far from the only one. There's - we seem to have this shrugging shoulders belief that this is all some sort of natural evolution - like how the dinosaurs died. But what I'm trying to argue in the book is that some of this at least in part results from a series of conscious decisions. DAVIES: Right. Decisions by, well - let's get to the. . . ALEXANDER: Yeah. Politicians, economists, businesspeople, financiers. DAVIES: And a change in the way the country's economy works, the way financial systems work. ALEXANDER: Right. DAVIES: So let's go through some of this. When did outside financial interests first pose a challenge to the management of Anchor Hocking, this giant of a company? ALEXANDER: The first time was Carl Icahn. So it's the 1980s. Carl Icahn has really just begun his career of what became known at the time as greenmailing. DAVIES: Corporate raiding, taking over companies. . . ALEXANDER: Corporate raiding. Saying, you know, I've just now bought 5 percent of your stock. I want to see it on the board. You're running your company in a lousy way, and so I'm going to come and make all sorts of trouble for you. But, you know, if you want to buy me out at a profit, at a premium, well, maybe I'll go away. And so that's exactly what happened with Carl Icahn. Carl Icahn bought over 5 percent of the stock of Anchor Hocking, agitated the board saying, you know, you need to make some different decisions. You could be returning more shareholder value. And was eventually bought off at a - what I calculated to be about a $3 million profit to Carl Icahn. That episode did not last long. But I argue that it changed Anchor Hocking forever from then on. DAVIES: In what way? ALEXANDER: It scared people. For 80 years, Anchor Hocking had been this very boring, widows and orphans, old-time manufacturer. Everybody had an Anchor Hocking measuring cup. Everybody had an Anchor Hocking glass or a baking dish in their home. It was just there. It paid dividends every year. Nobody paid attention to it. Now suddenly, Carl Icahn has done what's called putting it in play. And this is a term of art where business becomes a game. So Anchor Hocking now is in play. And it draws the attention of Newell partly because in its panic, Anchor Hocking sold off its container division. All those beer bottles, mayonnaise jars, peanut butter jars and so on - that was about 50 percent of the income of the company, so they essentially have the value of the company making itself a much smaller target in what is now an ocean full of sharks. DAVIES: And there's a business principle behind this idea that I, as an outsider, can look at a company and see something that I think I could do better or that it isn't doing well enough. What's the business principle behind the idea that this corporate raiding is a good thing? ALEXANDER: Well, the argument that activist investors often say - and, look, sometimes it's true - is that CEOs and executive officers and even boards become complacent and lazy. They don't look at how to better make the company more efficient, have increased sales, what have you, better corporate strategies. I don't deny that at times that might be true. Anchor Hocking did make some mistakes on its own before Carl Icahn ever got there. And so he may have had some legitimate argument in that. I'm sure he would say he did anyway. And so they say that they make the American economy more efficient. The other side of the argument is that they hold people up, and they take money. And they walk away. DAVIES: So in the 1980s, the company is bought by some - by the Newell Corporation which was this manufacturing empire. And. . . ALEXANDER: Right. DAVIES: . . . That had some serious effects on the company in the town. What happened? ALEXANDER: Right. Well, Newell buys it, and - in what was a hostile takeover. It's still a little bit mysterious exactly how hostile it was. But they buy it in a hostile takeover, and the first thing they do is fire all the executives and close down the headquarters. So now you have gutted a core group of people that were active in the life of the town. As one person of Lancaster, an old timer, who I interviewed said, it ripped the heart out of this town. So you've taken away the executives, you've taken away their wives, their families, even some of those people who stayed there, of course. Not everybody left, but many of them did leave because they were too young. They had to go find a job someplace else. So leadership class is no longer there. DAVIES: And from Newell's point of view, you know, this is one company among many they own. Why would they need many headquarters? So there's a rational basis for them, but devastating for the town. ALEXANDER: Devastating for the town, and the new incoming people, the people that Newell picked to run Anchor Hocking never lived in Lancaster. They all lived in Columbus. There is a long-standing belief, unshakable belief that Newell instructed its incoming executives to not live in Lancaster, so as not to be involved in the United Way and other Lancaster civic activities. I found - I could not find any proof of that, but you cannot shake Lancasterians' (ph) belief that that was in fact the case. In any way, they all lived in another town. They did not live in Lancaster. They were not active in Lancaster. DAVIES: And what about workers, the number of people employed, wages, benefits? ALEXANDER: Workers will tell you that Newell was not a bad employer. They were not necessarily unhappy under Newell. It wasn't the same. It was less of a family atmosphere. That - workers who are hourly people and salaried people all say the same thing. They say that the company became somewhat more efficient, that they made money, they made money for Newell, that they were not unhappy under Newell. But it didn't feel like the old Anchor Hocking, and, of course, it never would again. DAVIES: Brian Anderson's (ph) new book is \"Glass House. \" After a break, he'll talk about how Lancaster voters responded to President Thomp's (ph) message, and we'll remember Bharati Mukherjee who died last month. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross who's off this week visiting family. We're speaking with writer Brian Alexander. His new book \"Glass House\" is about his hometown Lancaster, Ohio, a once bustling factory town whose largest employer, the Anchor Hocking Glass Company, has declined due to market forces, and, he argues, mismanagement by a series of Wall Street investors who bought the firm. In 2004, Anchor Hocking, the glass company's bought by Cerberus this private equity group And I - this is worth going over in just a bit of detail what happens under this private equity group. But let's just, first, clarify a couple of terms. What is private equity? What is its goal and its business model? ALEXANDER: Well, the basic business model is that, I'm a private equity guy. I go out and I try to find investors to create a pool of cash. So I go to pension funds, I go occasionally to very wealthy individuals, I go to other money managers, and I say, give me money. I'll form a pool. And I will go out, and I will buy a variety of companies, help these companies operate and so that, at some point, we can exit the company, either sell it or have an IPO and make a profit. And I'll return that profit to you. DAVIES: Right. So in theory we're buying companies and maybe combining them with other companies, but making them perform better, increasing their value and everybody makes money. Let's see how it worked in Lancaster, Ohio. To buy Anchor Hocking, the glass company, they formed a company called Global Home Products. And then, that company borrowed a bunch of money to buy Anchor Hocking and some others. So Anchor Hocking now finds it's owned by a new company, but it has all this debt because money was borrowed to buy it. What's the effect of that debt on this company? ALEXANDER: Right. I mean, private equity is essentially a rebranded version of leveraged buyout. So the effect of this debt is you've now got to pay interest on the debt. And that's an enormous expense because the debt can be huge. And it can shackle you. You also might have to undergo things like selling off some of your assets as a way to attack the debt, which can then hamper things like marketing, research and development and so on. DAVIES: Right. And they brought in new managers. And you write that they had some bright ideas. One of them was buying a new information technology system, you know, for processing invoices and all that and rushing that in. What was the effect of that? ALEXANDER: Well, as one person told me in the book, it brought us to our knees. They essentially collapsed, had very serious cash flow problems. They couldn't make it work. And as a result, the long story short is that they went into bankruptcy. DAVIES: What was the effect of this experience on the workers, their lives, their morale, their connection to the company? ALEXANDER: You know, that's - I think that's the biggest issue. This was a - if I can be so bold as to say it - a spiritually destructive experience for them. People in Lancaster, and I think people all over the country, feel that capitalism is supposed to work a certain way. And these people had firsthand experience with a kind of 'nother brand of capitalism that they were not expecting and did not fully understand. And there's no reason why they should understand. It's not that, you know, they're not smart. They are smart. It's that this is not the way they were told the system worked. And so it left them incredibly disillusioned and wary and untrusting. And I think that really follows through in other elements of their lives within the town and within this country. DAVIES: We talked about how Lancaster, Ohio, was an all-American town in the '40s, '50s, '60s and into the '70s, in part because there was, you know - there were people of all incomes and a corporate leadership that was invested in the town. Look at the town now and tell us how it compares. ALEXANDER: Man, it - well, it's not the same town by any stretch of the imagination. Although, if you were to look at the town you'd say, well, it looks about the same. The houses, for example, are not quite as well kept up as they used to be. The west side, which has always been sort of the working-class side of town, is even more disheveled than it used to be. People are genuinely struggling. Parents are in jail, so grandparents or aunts or uncles have the kids. I saw just the other day a map of the state of Ohio that showed the percentage of kids who are now part of the social service system and what the percentage is their parents who are opiate users. In Fairfield County, 58 percent of the kids who are in the system - their parents used opiates. The county next door, Hocking County, it's over 70 percent. So now you've got drugs in the community, which are an escape from all this sort of stuff. The economy of the town is struggling, not because there's high unemployment because the employment that there is is all minimum wage or even lower than minimum wage, and so 30-year-old guys are working at Buffalo Wild Wings or Taco Bell making 8. 50 an hour. And they say, there's no place else for me to go from here. This is going to be it. DAVIES: You know, I'm sure you began this project long before Donald Trump was a serious presidential candidate in 2016. Does what happened here connect to the support that he got in places like this in Ohio? ALEXANDER: Absolutely, absolutely (laughter). You know, I was - I'd be sitting in a lot of bars, and I'd have people discussing, you know, the primary season and so on. And somebody would say something about Trump. And they'd say, yeah, you know, I kind of like that Trump, and other people would laugh. But then, as the months went on, it became more and more obvious that there was actually some real support for Trump. And in fact, Fairfield County went heavily for Donald Trump. And it's - I believe - and this is a theory - that it really is this disaffection. You know, on Election Day morning, a woman in Lancaster who I spent some time with for the book called me up. And I said have you been to the polls? She said, yeah, Trump, baby. And I said, really? Why is that? And she said, I just want it to be like it was. And I, you know, even saying it now I almost want to cry. I mean, there is this - she's old enough to remember the way it was. And she wants to put her vote with somebody who says he's going to make it the way it was. DAVIES: And how much do the people affected by what happened here even know of these, you know, distant owners and complex financial transactions? ALEXANDER: Almost nothing. So, you know, some of the executives within the company, you know, sort of middle management and slightly above know a bit about it. But even some of them didn't know all that much about it. There's - a lot of this stuff doesn't come public. One of the only reasons I gained a fair amount of information was because eventually there was a - an IPO, an initial public offering. And so then it became subject to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and also there were bankruptcy cases. So there's a fair amount of documentation. Otherwise, a lot of this stuff goes unreported because it's tough to look inside. DAVIES: Yeah. Has the town tried to remake itself in any way? ALEXANDER: It's trying constantly to and is meeting with some success. I don't want to paint too dire of a picture of Lancaster. I mean, there are some little smaller businesses that are opening up, some restaurants that are opening up there. They're always trying to attract some new business there. The best thing going for Lancaster is how much people love their town, and they want it to work. But they're up against some very tough, tough situations. You know, just this morning's paper in a nearby town Chillicothe, Ohio, there were seven overdose deaths in seven hours in that town. That was just reported this morning. And it's not - again, it's not just the drugs. It's the whole sort of social decay because there isn't this glue that is holding people together the way it used to. DAVIES: So what's left of Anchor Hocking? Do they still make glass products there? ALEXANDER: They still do make glass in Lancaster, Ohio, at what's called Plant One over on Pierce Avenue. And they also have mainly a bottle-making plant for liquor bottles, for example, in Monaca, Penn. DAVIES: How many people are employed there now? ALEXANDER: Roughly about 900. It's been between 900 and 1,000 people all told. It varies somewhat, according to season. DAVIES: Down from 5,000 years back. Was it racially diverse? ALEXANDER: No. Lancaster people to this day will say that they live in the whitest town in America. It's a highly dubious statement, but it shows you that it's virtually an all-white town, slightly more diverse than it used to be, but not by much. And in the '40s, '50s, '60s, it was very, very sort of Anglo-Saxon, Protestant and Catholic in that town to the point where the Klan in the '20s, for example, the Klan was a force. The sheriff and the mayor were Klan members. DAVIES: Those who voted for Trump in Lancaster, Ohio, what do you think they're going to be looking for? How will they judge his presidency? ALEXANDER: I spoke to somebody day before yesterday, an old high school friend of mine who actually went to Trump's inauguration. That's how much of a supporter she is. I don't know. I don't have a good answer for that question. I believe that they will ultimately be extremely disappointed. But I think partly Trump has already fulfilled at least one expectation, and that is to sort of express this sort of generalized anger and aggressiveness that they wish they could do. And Trump, I think, is sort of their paladin doing it for them. Ultimately, I believe they'll find that to be empty, but I can't be sure. DAVIES: Brian Alexander, thanks so much for speaking with us. ALEXANDER: Thank you, Dave. I appreciate it very much. DAVIES: Brian Alexander's book is \"Glass House: The 1% Economy And The Shattering Of The All-American Town. \" Coming up, we remember writer Bharati Mukherjee who died last month. This is FRESH AIR. DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross who's off this week visiting family. We heard a lot in the presidential campaign about anger and frustration among working-class voters in America's heartland. Today, we're going to focus on one factory town in central Ohio that was once a bustling center of industry and employment, but is now beset by low wages, unemployment and social decay. Lancaster, Ohio, isn't just a research subject for our guest, Brian Alexander. It's his hometown. His new book tells the story of the company that was once Lancaster's largest employer. The Anchor Hocking glass company was a Fortune 500 company with its headquarters in the town. The company provided jobs, civic leadership and community pride. Its decline, Alexander argues, isn't just a product of increased competition and changing markets. He says the firm was undone by Wall Street investors who had little knowledge of the company and little interest in anything besides short-term profit. Brian Alexander has written three previous books about aspects of American culture and has written for a variety of publications including The New York Times, Science, Outside and Esquire. His new book is \"Glass House: The 1% Economy And The Shattering Of An American Town. \" Brian Alexander, welcome to FRESH AIR. You did a lot of reporting for this book, but it wasn't just reporting. You grew up in Lancaster? BRIAN ALEXANDER: I did grow up in Lancaster, yes. DAVIES: Yeah. What's your relationship with the place been over the years? ALEXANDER: I've loved the place. I always loved the place, even when I was graduating high school and knew I would be going away to college and probably would never live there full-time again. It was an emotional experience to leave. I'll never forget the Christmas before I left. I had served midnight mass at St. Mary's Catholic Church, and I was driving back home after mass. And it had snowed a lot during the service. I stopped at a stoplight at the corner of Cherry Street and Pleasantville Road which is a main intersection in town, and the town was absolutely still because of the snow - acted like a sound barrier. I looked around at all the lights and everything. And I let the stoplight just sort of turn green and red and green and red a few times, and I started to cry because even though I wanted to leave the town, it was my town. And I knew that I was never going to feel that same way about a place ever again. DAVIES: You describe it as an all-American town. When was it an all-American town and in what way? What do we mean by that? ALEXANDER: Well, you know, it's interesting. I think it's always been an all-American town and still is in some of its negative respects now. But I think what you mean is that what Forbes magazine meant, so in the - after the war - after World War II, Forbes devoted almost its entire 30th anniversary issue to Lancaster, Ohio, of all places, and positioned Lancaster as the epitome and the apogee of the all-American town, a sort of perfect balance between large industry, agriculture, small businesses like retail and merchants and so on, workers, a kind of gentry and that everything was in a - this state of almost utopian equilibrium. And for the most part, it really was like that, which is not to say there were not problems. There's always been problems. There's always been small-town scandals, and there's always been an element of poverty, a fair amount of drinking in Lancaster. My grandfather used to say that he was an old glassman from Western Pennsylvania, and he would come to visit. He would say that he never saw a town with more churches and more bars. DAVIES: (Laughter). Now, Anchor Hocking was this big glass manufacturer. Just describe this company a bit, how big it was, what kinds of stuff it made. ALEXANDER: At its peak, Anchor Hocking was the world's largest maker of glass tableware, the second largest maker of glass containers - beer bottles, peanut butter jars, mayonnaise jars and so on. It made other kinds of glass, too, like the little domes that went over electric meter covers, you know - the electric meters. It had 40 plants - could be a glass plant, but it could also be an office, it could be an R&D, it could be a distribution center. But they had 40 facilities all over the United States. DAVIES: And it's - I guess an important part of the story is it didn't just have production plants in Lancaster. The headquarters were there. The executives lived. . . ALEXANDER: Precisely. So you had a core of college-educated, sophisticated people who made good livings, working right downtown at the corner of Broad and Main Street. And more importantly, in some ways, their wives - because their wives - remember this is '40s, '50s, '60s and into the '70s - their wives typically did not work at a career-type job outside the home. They threw themselves into the town, so they did hospital benefits. They did benefits for preserving the old antebellum homes in Lancaster. They did vaccination drives. They made sure the sidewalks got repaired, the streets got paved. They attended city council meetings. I mean, this was a core of civic leadership. DAVIES: So there's a real and civic investment in the town not just economic gain. One of the things that you note is that the infrastructure that makes a town work - building new schools or hospitals - that happened in Lancaster and citizens taxed themselves to do it. ALEXANDER: They did. When natural gas was discovered in Lancaster, the citizens got together and formed their own municipal gas company, their own water company. When they decided that they needed a hospital in the teens - 19-teens - they got together, and they passed a hospital levy. When it came time for new schools, they got together and said we need new schools. So they did it. They taxed themselves, and there was a great willingness to do this. DAVIES: Now there were thousands of blue-collar workers in the town working in Anchor Hocking's glass manufacturing plants and others. . . ALEXANDER: And others, yes. DAVIES: . . . And there were wealthy or better off white-collar employees. Did the executives and their workers drink in the same bars? ALEXANDER: Absolutely. So for - you know, I told - I was sitting in this particular bar that I used to sit in when I was in my youth called Old Bill Bailey's it's on the west side. And I heard all kinds of stories about, you know, hey, Elwood was in here back in, you know, '75. And I got hired because Elwood was a vice president, and he was in there drinking beer and singing songs with the glass guys. It's not to say that everything was always harmonious. I mean, there were definitely union management fights and so on and so forth. But more than one person told me stories about getting hired by one of the executives inside a bar. DAVIES: It sounds like an idyllic town in so many ways, often in an industrial setting, things are gritty and tough and hot and sometimes dangerous. Could you take us inside the glass plant, one of these for a moment and just give us a sense of what it looked like, how it worked? ALEXANDER: What you said is true. It is gritty. It's often dangerous even. It's old, and yet I think it's important to note that a lot of guys really like working in there. They may complain about working in there, but when you listen to them talk, they actually love their jobs partly because it's kind of so extreme. And so here's why it's extreme. There are two ends to a glass plant, the hot end and the cold. The hot end is really the business end where minerals come in - melted in big furnace, comes out, and it's taken to mold machines. And guys operate these machines to make product or what's called ware. There's fire everywhere. There are flames bursting up. There's a long tunnel called a lehr where the annealing process takes place. There's fire jutting out from that. There are - a mold station, for example, where a glass baking dish is made in a glob of lava-like glass flows into the mold, and a plunger comes down and shapes the glass into a baking dish and a burst of fire comes out of that. And so when you're in the hot end of Plant 1, everything is dark, partly because it's old, and the machines are dark. And you see all these flames, and you see men silhouetted against all these flames. It's an incredibly impressive thing to see. DAVIES: Brian Alexander's book is called \"Glass House: The 1% Economy And The Shattering Of An All-American Town. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, we're speaking with Brian Alexander. He's written a new book called \"Glass House. \" It's about a manufacturing town in Ohio - Lancaster, Ohio - and how it suffered as the financial practices in America changed. So Lancaster was a town that provided employment at living wages. There was a social compact between the owners and the workers that worked for the community. And what we're going to talk about and what the book talks about is how that changed and disintegrated. And we'll get there, but first, just for a glimpse of Lancaster today, you know, you open the book by talking about a guy named Eric Brown who's a police officer, a police commander. And it's rare to see a cop cry, but he - tears come to his eyes talking about Lancaster. Tell us about him and what so troubled him about what's become of Lancaster. ALEXANDER: Eric - Eric's a great guy, first of all. He was the commander of the MCU - the Major Crimes Unit - which is a multicounty task force that comprised of member agencies. Eric grew up in Lancaster, was a local football star at the high school, tried his hand at big-time college football, decided that wasn't going to work for him. So he came back to Lancaster to become a sheriff's deputy and then joined the Lancaster Police Force, worked his way up and eventually became a commander. I think what upsets him is he - like so many people that I interviewed and spoke to in Lancaster and like me really - they still love the town. And so it's heartbreaking for them to see some of Lancaster's problems. And Eric knows probably better than anybody that it's not just drugs. Drugs are a very serious problem in the town. There's no question about that. But I think he believes that drugs are a symptom of some sort of larger, rather vague and nebulous problem that he cannot control. There's nothing he can do about this problem or series of problems. And I think it leads to an enormous level of frustration because he still has big stakes in the town. As he says, his son is still there. His son is still raising his family there. His in-laws are there. He's invested personally in the fate of the town. And when you feel there's nothing you can be doing and you meet this frustration, it's got to find an outlet. And he sort of teared up a little bit in the middle of our conversation in a bar. DAVIES: He's arresting guys he grew up with and their kids, I assume. ALEXANDER: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, this is a town where you know people, and so people you know and have known all your life - or you knew their fathers or their uncles or their cousins - you end up meeting these people in the back of a squad car or in a police office or in a jail. DAVIES: You know, there's a familiar narrative about industries of the Northeast and Midwest that, you know, they enjoyed prosperity in the post-war years when America was dominant and everybody wanted American products. And then over time, there was competition from foreign manufacturers and from other regions of the country that offered union-free, low-wage labor. And a lot of these companies had old plants that were expensive to run and maintain and kind of lost out in the competition. To what extent does that describe what happened to Anchor Hocking, this glass company and the businesses in Lancaster? ALEXANDER: That is - all that is an element. Absolutely. It's all an element. When you can pay a foreign worker a third or less of what you're paying a unionized Flint glass worker in Lancaster, that's an element. But it's far from the only one. There's - we seem to have this shrugging shoulders belief that this is all some sort of natural evolution - like how the dinosaurs died. But what I'm trying to argue in the book is that some of this at least in part results from a series of conscious decisions. DAVIES: Right. Decisions by, well - let's get to the. . . ALEXANDER: Yeah. Politicians, economists, businesspeople, financiers. DAVIES: And a change in the way the country's economy works, the way financial systems work. ALEXANDER: Right. DAVIES: So let's go through some of this. When did outside financial interests first pose a challenge to the management of Anchor Hocking, this giant of a company? ALEXANDER: The first time was Carl Icahn. So it's the 1980s. Carl Icahn has really just begun his career of what became known at the time as greenmailing. DAVIES: Corporate raiding, taking over companies. . . ALEXANDER: Corporate raiding. Saying, you know, I've just now bought 5 percent of your stock. I want to see it on the board. You're running your company in a lousy way, and so I'm going to come and make all sorts of trouble for you. But, you know, if you want to buy me out at a profit, at a premium, well, maybe I'll go away. And so that's exactly what happened with Carl Icahn. Carl Icahn bought over 5 percent of the stock of Anchor Hocking, agitated the board saying, you know, you need to make some different decisions. You could be returning more shareholder value. And was eventually bought off at a - what I calculated to be about a $3 million profit to Carl Icahn. That episode did not last long. But I argue that it changed Anchor Hocking forever from then on. DAVIES: In what way? ALEXANDER: It scared people. For 80 years, Anchor Hocking had been this very boring, widows and orphans, old-time manufacturer. Everybody had an Anchor Hocking measuring cup. Everybody had an Anchor Hocking glass or a baking dish in their home. It was just there. It paid dividends every year. Nobody paid attention to it. Now suddenly, Carl Icahn has done what's called putting it in play. And this is a term of art where business becomes a game. So Anchor Hocking now is in play. And it draws the attention of Newell partly because in its panic, Anchor Hocking sold off its container division. All those beer bottles, mayonnaise jars, peanut butter jars and so on - that was about 50 percent of the income of the company, so they essentially have the value of the company making itself a much smaller target in what is now an ocean full of sharks. DAVIES: And there's a business principle behind this idea that I, as an outsider, can look at a company and see something that I think I could do better or that it isn't doing well enough. What's the business principle behind the idea that this corporate raiding is a good thing? ALEXANDER: Well, the argument that activist investors often say - and, look, sometimes it's true - is that CEOs and executive officers and even boards become complacent and lazy. They don't look at how to better make the company more efficient, have increased sales, what have you, better corporate strategies. I don't deny that at times that might be true. Anchor Hocking did make some mistakes on its own before Carl Icahn ever got there. And so he may have had some legitimate argument in that. I'm sure he would say he did anyway. And so they say that they make the American economy more efficient. The other side of the argument is that they hold people up, and they take money. And they walk away. DAVIES: So in the 1980s, the company is bought by some - by the Newell Corporation which was this manufacturing empire. And. . . ALEXANDER: Right. DAVIES: . . . That had some serious effects on the company in the town. What happened? ALEXANDER: Right. Well, Newell buys it, and - in what was a hostile takeover. It's still a little bit mysterious exactly how hostile it was. But they buy it in a hostile takeover, and the first thing they do is fire all the executives and close down the headquarters. So now you have gutted a core group of people that were active in the life of the town. As one person of Lancaster, an old timer, who I interviewed said, it ripped the heart out of this town. So you've taken away the executives, you've taken away their wives, their families, even some of those people who stayed there, of course. Not everybody left, but many of them did leave because they were too young. They had to go find a job someplace else. So leadership class is no longer there. DAVIES: And from Newell's point of view, you know, this is one company among many they own. Why would they need many headquarters? So there's a rational basis for them, but devastating for the town. ALEXANDER: Devastating for the town, and the new incoming people, the people that Newell picked to run Anchor Hocking never lived in Lancaster. They all lived in Columbus. There is a long-standing belief, unshakable belief that Newell instructed its incoming executives to not live in Lancaster, so as not to be involved in the United Way and other Lancaster civic activities. I found - I could not find any proof of that, but you cannot shake Lancasterians' (ph) belief that that was in fact the case. In any way, they all lived in another town. They did not live in Lancaster. They were not active in Lancaster. DAVIES: And what about workers, the number of people employed, wages, benefits? ALEXANDER: Workers will tell you that Newell was not a bad employer. They were not necessarily unhappy under Newell. It wasn't the same. It was less of a family atmosphere. That - workers who are hourly people and salaried people all say the same thing. They say that the company became somewhat more efficient, that they made money, they made money for Newell, that they were not unhappy under Newell. But it didn't feel like the old Anchor Hocking, and, of course, it never would again. DAVIES: Brian Anderson's (ph) new book is \"Glass House. \" After a break, he'll talk about how Lancaster voters responded to President Thomp's (ph) message, and we'll remember Bharati Mukherjee who died last month. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross who's off this week visiting family. We're speaking with writer Brian Alexander. His new book \"Glass House\" is about his hometown Lancaster, Ohio, a once bustling factory town whose largest employer, the Anchor Hocking Glass Company, has declined due to market forces, and, he argues, mismanagement by a series of Wall Street investors who bought the firm. In 2004, Anchor Hocking, the glass company's bought by Cerberus this private equity group And I - this is worth going over in just a bit of detail what happens under this private equity group. But let's just, first, clarify a couple of terms. What is private equity? What is its goal and its business model? ALEXANDER: Well, the basic business model is that, I'm a private equity guy. I go out and I try to find investors to create a pool of cash. So I go to pension funds, I go occasionally to very wealthy individuals, I go to other money managers, and I say, give me money. I'll form a pool. And I will go out, and I will buy a variety of companies, help these companies operate and so that, at some point, we can exit the company, either sell it or have an IPO and make a profit. And I'll return that profit to you. DAVIES: Right. So in theory we're buying companies and maybe combining them with other companies, but making them perform better, increasing their value and everybody makes money. Let's see how it worked in Lancaster, Ohio. To buy Anchor Hocking, the glass company, they formed a company called Global Home Products. And then, that company borrowed a bunch of money to buy Anchor Hocking and some others. So Anchor Hocking now finds it's owned by a new company, but it has all this debt because money was borrowed to buy it. What's the effect of that debt on this company? ALEXANDER: Right. I mean, private equity is essentially a rebranded version of leveraged buyout. So the effect of this debt is you've now got to pay interest on the debt. And that's an enormous expense because the debt can be huge. And it can shackle you. You also might have to undergo things like selling off some of your assets as a way to attack the debt, which can then hamper things like marketing, research and development and so on. DAVIES: Right. And they brought in new managers. And you write that they had some bright ideas. One of them was buying a new information technology system, you know, for processing invoices and all that and rushing that in. What was the effect of that? ALEXANDER: Well, as one person told me in the book, it brought us to our knees. They essentially collapsed, had very serious cash flow problems. They couldn't make it work. And as a result, the long story short is that they went into bankruptcy. DAVIES: What was the effect of this experience on the workers, their lives, their morale, their connection to the company? ALEXANDER: You know, that's - I think that's the biggest issue. This was a - if I can be so bold as to say it - a spiritually destructive experience for them. People in Lancaster, and I think people all over the country, feel that capitalism is supposed to work a certain way. And these people had firsthand experience with a kind of 'nother brand of capitalism that they were not expecting and did not fully understand. And there's no reason why they should understand. It's not that, you know, they're not smart. They are smart. It's that this is not the way they were told the system worked. And so it left them incredibly disillusioned and wary and untrusting. And I think that really follows through in other elements of their lives within the town and within this country. DAVIES: We talked about how Lancaster, Ohio, was an all-American town in the '40s, '50s, '60s and into the '70s, in part because there was, you know - there were people of all incomes and a corporate leadership that was invested in the town. Look at the town now and tell us how it compares. ALEXANDER: Man, it - well, it's not the same town by any stretch of the imagination. Although, if you were to look at the town you'd say, well, it looks about the same. The houses, for example, are not quite as well kept up as they used to be. The west side, which has always been sort of the working-class side of town, is even more disheveled than it used to be. People are genuinely struggling. Parents are in jail, so grandparents or aunts or uncles have the kids. I saw just the other day a map of the state of Ohio that showed the percentage of kids who are now part of the social service system and what the percentage is their parents who are opiate users. In Fairfield County, 58 percent of the kids who are in the system - their parents used opiates. The county next door, Hocking County, it's over 70 percent. So now you've got drugs in the community, which are an escape from all this sort of stuff. The economy of the town is struggling, not because there's high unemployment because the employment that there is is all minimum wage or even lower than minimum wage, and so 30-year-old guys are working at Buffalo Wild Wings or Taco Bell making 8. 50 an hour. And they say, there's no place else for me to go from here. This is going to be it. DAVIES: You know, I'm sure you began this project long before Donald Trump was a serious presidential candidate in 2016. Does what happened here connect to the support that he got in places like this in Ohio? ALEXANDER: Absolutely, absolutely (laughter). You know, I was - I'd be sitting in a lot of bars, and I'd have people discussing, you know, the primary season and so on. And somebody would say something about Trump. And they'd say, yeah, you know, I kind of like that Trump, and other people would laugh. But then, as the months went on, it became more and more obvious that there was actually some real support for Trump. And in fact, Fairfield County went heavily for Donald Trump. And it's - I believe - and this is a theory - that it really is this disaffection. You know, on Election Day morning, a woman in Lancaster who I spent some time with for the book called me up. And I said have you been to the polls? She said, yeah, Trump, baby. And I said, really? Why is that? And she said, I just want it to be like it was. And I, you know, even saying it now I almost want to cry. I mean, there is this - she's old enough to remember the way it was. And she wants to put her vote with somebody who says he's going to make it the way it was. DAVIES: And how much do the people affected by what happened here even know of these, you know, distant owners and complex financial transactions? ALEXANDER: Almost nothing. So, you know, some of the executives within the company, you know, sort of middle management and slightly above know a bit about it. But even some of them didn't know all that much about it. There's - a lot of this stuff doesn't come public. One of the only reasons I gained a fair amount of information was because eventually there was a - an IPO, an initial public offering. And so then it became subject to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, and also there were bankruptcy cases. So there's a fair amount of documentation. Otherwise, a lot of this stuff goes unreported because it's tough to look inside. DAVIES: Yeah. Has the town tried to remake itself in any way? ALEXANDER: It's trying constantly to and is meeting with some success. I don't want to paint too dire of a picture of Lancaster. I mean, there are some little smaller businesses that are opening up, some restaurants that are opening up there. They're always trying to attract some new business there. The best thing going for Lancaster is how much people love their town, and they want it to work. But they're up against some very tough, tough situations. You know, just this morning's paper in a nearby town Chillicothe, Ohio, there were seven overdose deaths in seven hours in that town. That was just reported this morning. And it's not - again, it's not just the drugs. It's the whole sort of social decay because there isn't this glue that is holding people together the way it used to. DAVIES: So what's left of Anchor Hocking? Do they still make glass products there? ALEXANDER: They still do make glass in Lancaster, Ohio, at what's called Plant One over on Pierce Avenue. And they also have mainly a bottle-making plant for liquor bottles, for example, in Monaca, Penn. DAVIES: How many people are employed there now? ALEXANDER: Roughly about 900. It's been between 900 and 1,000 people all told. It varies somewhat, according to season. DAVIES: Down from 5,000 years back. Was it racially diverse? ALEXANDER: No. Lancaster people to this day will say that they live in the whitest town in America. It's a highly dubious statement, but it shows you that it's virtually an all-white town, slightly more diverse than it used to be, but not by much. And in the '40s, '50s, '60s, it was very, very sort of Anglo-Saxon, Protestant and Catholic in that town to the point where the Klan in the '20s, for example, the Klan was a force. The sheriff and the mayor were Klan members. DAVIES: Those who voted for Trump in Lancaster, Ohio, what do you think they're going to be looking for? How will they judge his presidency? ALEXANDER: I spoke to somebody day before yesterday, an old high school friend of mine who actually went to Trump's inauguration. That's how much of a supporter she is. I don't know. I don't have a good answer for that question. I believe that they will ultimately be extremely disappointed. But I think partly Trump has already fulfilled at least one expectation, and that is to sort of express this sort of generalized anger and aggressiveness that they wish they could do. And Trump, I think, is sort of their paladin doing it for them. Ultimately, I believe they'll find that to be empty, but I can't be sure. DAVIES: Brian Alexander, thanks so much for speaking with us. ALEXANDER: Thank you, Dave. I appreciate it very much.

Manufacturing employment has been dropping in the U. S. for nearly four decades. And solutions have been scarce. Scott Paul heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing. He's one of 28 business and union leaders appointed to President Trump's new manufacturing jobs initiative. He joins me now in the studio. Thanks so much for coming in. SCOTT PAUL: Rachel, good to be with you. MARTIN: It's going to be your job to help Donald Trump fulfill a key campaign promise, to bring American manufacturing jobs back. How do you do that without compromising these companies, without making it onerous on them? PAUL: It's a bit like walking a tightrope. Our economy now is very much orientated towards the service sector and the financial services sector. And having it reconfigured to focus on manufacturing will require some delicate pushing and pulling of policy levers ranging from education to trade to investments in infrastructure and innovation, and also getting that corporate mindset to focus on the fact that it might be possible to produce products in the United States. MARTIN: So let's talk about automation because many economists will point to automation as the reason a lot of these manufacturing jobs have gone away. And the automation has come because it has made companies more innovative. They have figured out how to do more with less. And sometimes the less has meant robots, not humans. So how do you incentivize them to hire Americans without jeopardizing that innovation and those new efficiencies that they've discovered? PAUL: Automation has always been a part and a feature of manufacturing. We're in a different era now. I'm less worried about automation. I actually think - because a robot costs the same in China, in Japan and in the United States. So what are the other advantages that we can bring to bear on this? And I'm just going to point out that, you know, you have a guy like Elon Musk, who is also serving as part of this jobs initiative, CEO of Tesla, who has built or is building three factories in the United States. And you see a lot of robots in these factories. But you see thousands of human beings as well. So the idea that automation is the enemy of manufacturing job growth I think is very much misplaced. MARTIN: The new jobs you're talking about, would they require higher education? The Obama administration, and Joe Biden in particular, talked a lot about the value of vocational training and the need for the federal government to invest in vocational training. Is that something that the Trump administration would pick up? PAUL: I'm going to urge the Trump administration to do that. We're at the cusp of something new. And we're coming off of an era in manufacturing where we shed more than 50,000 manufacturing facilities and 7 million jobs. And it takes a while to turn around that ship. MARTIN: When you re-evaluate free trade agreements and when you, perhaps in exceptional circumstances, decide to put a tariff on a product that was made overseas, inevitably, the price will go up. Do you think that that should just be expected, that that's the cost of creating American jobs, that consumers might have to pay higher prices? PAUL: Yeah, I don't think a reconfiguration of producing more in the United States and consuming fewer imports is going to dramatically raise prices for consumers. Would the price of a TV go up on some level? It may but not to an extent that a consumer can't absorb. MARTIN: What do you say to the manufacturing worker who's been unemployed for years who voted for Donald Trump because he believes that his job is going to come back? PAUL: I know a lot of those people. And I - one thing that I will say troubled me about Trump's rhetoric on this is that he is imbuing this idea of a 1950s economy. And that's not where we're headed. That's not where we want to head. We need a 21st-century manufacturing economy. I also like to draw a line from \"Field Of Dreams. \" If you build it, they will come. If people think that there will be opportunities in manufacturing, they will want to get the training. They will want to enter that workforce. For an entire generation, almost, that hasn't been the case. I'd like to see that change. MARTIN: Scott Paul is the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. He joined us here in our studios in Washington. Mr. Paul, thank you. PAUL: Rachel, thank you so much. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  When President Trump sat down with business leaders at the White House, he had a pointed message for them; bring back American manufacturing jobs, or risk a tax on imports if you don't. Manufacturing employment has been dropping in the U. S. for nearly four decades. And solutions have been scarce. Scott Paul heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing. He's one of 28 business and union leaders appointed to President Trump's new manufacturing jobs initiative. He joins me now in the studio. Thanks so much for coming in. SCOTT PAUL: Rachel, good to be with you. MARTIN: It's going to be your job to help Donald Trump fulfill a key campaign promise, to bring American manufacturing jobs back. How do you do that without compromising these companies, without making it onerous on them? PAUL: It's a bit like walking a tightrope. Our economy now is very much orientated towards the service sector and the financial services sector. And having it reconfigured to focus on manufacturing will require some delicate pushing and pulling of policy levers ranging from education to trade to investments in infrastructure and innovation, and also getting that corporate mindset to focus on the fact that it might be possible to produce products in the United States. MARTIN: So let's talk about automation because many economists will point to automation as the reason a lot of these manufacturing jobs have gone away. And the automation has come because it has made companies more innovative. They have figured out how to do more with less. And sometimes the less has meant robots, not humans. So how do you incentivize them to hire Americans without jeopardizing that innovation and those new efficiencies that they've discovered? PAUL: Automation has always been a part and a feature of manufacturing. We're in a different era now. I'm less worried about automation. I actually think - because a robot costs the same in China, in Japan and in the United States. So what are the other advantages that we can bring to bear on this? And I'm just going to point out that, you know, you have a guy like Elon Musk, who is also serving as part of this jobs initiative, CEO of Tesla, who has built or is building three factories in the United States. And you see a lot of robots in these factories. But you see thousands of human beings as well. So the idea that automation is the enemy of manufacturing job growth I think is very much misplaced. MARTIN: The new jobs you're talking about, would they require higher education? The Obama administration, and Joe Biden in particular, talked a lot about the value of vocational training and the need for the federal government to invest in vocational training. Is that something that the Trump administration would pick up? PAUL: I'm going to urge the Trump administration to do that. We're at the cusp of something new. And we're coming off of an era in manufacturing where we shed more than 50,000 manufacturing facilities and 7 million jobs. And it takes a while to turn around that ship. MARTIN: When you re-evaluate free trade agreements and when you, perhaps in exceptional circumstances, decide to put a tariff on a product that was made overseas, inevitably, the price will go up. Do you think that that should just be expected, that that's the cost of creating American jobs, that consumers might have to pay higher prices?

Would the price of a TV go up on some level? It may but not to an extent that a consumer can't absorb.

They would levy a 20 percent tax on imports from all countries, a border adjustment tax. Texas Congressman Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is a big supporter.

But Brady and House speaker Paul Ryan have proposed a 20 percent border adjustment tax that they believe is necessary to level the playing field.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been steadily marching toward the 20,000 mark. And weeks ago, it topped that mark for the first time in the Dow's history. Other major stock indices have also been climbing, and businesses and consumers continue to have more confidence in the U. S. economy. The big question is when or how will this post-inaugural honeymoon period end? To offer a little more clarity, we reached David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. He joined us from the Brookings Institution studio, and he began by laying out the state of the financial markets. DAVID WESSEL: The stock market is very happy. There has been a surge in stock prices since the Trump inauguration. It looks like the stock market is looking only at the Trump policies that are friendly to business - tax cuts, more infrastructure spending, less regulation - and ignoring the policies that business and companies definitely don't like, like all this hostility to trade. So that leads a lot of people to think that the markets are cruising for a bruising here, but predicting when the markets are going to turn and which direction is really well beyond me. SINGH: Some worry that we're putting too much confidence in the markets and that this is sort of a bubble that could burst. Just reminding some of our listeners, Andrew Ross Sorkin, you recall, recently wrote in The New York Times DealBook, right? - that a well-respected hedge fund manager was warning his own investors that things could go badly pretty quickly. Do you recall that? WESSEL: Yes, so there are a couple of possibilities here. One is the market is just guessing wrong, and they're going to discover that President Trump and the Republican Congress can't deliver the goodies or that they're going to get more of the baddies (ph). Another possibility - we know that markets kind of get euphoric, so there is a possibility there's a bubble. But that doesn't tell us very much about what's going on with the real economy. That just tells us what's going on in the minds of stock investors and traders. SINGH: I mean, it's just too soon to say. WESSEL: Well, it's always too soon to say about the markets. But look, there is something important here. Whether you like President Trump's policies or not, all the measures of business confidence, not only the stock market, but surveys, measures of consumer confidence have gone up a lot. And that's important because we know that when people feel better about the economy, when they're more optimistic, consumers are more willing to buy, businesses are more willing to invest. And that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. SINGH: What are you most concerned about going forward in this economy and the stock market? What are you looking out for? WESSEL: I'm most worried that we are living a fantasy here, that somehow because President Trump has promised to do a lot of things that people are expecting something that can't happen. So my first fear is that if we have a manic high now, we're going to have a manic low. My second fear is that we are not doing anything to deal with our long-term chronic, problems in the economy. So we're going to squander this opportunity when the economy does seem to be relatively strong and strengthening to deal with long-term problems. SINGH: Give me a couple of examples. WESSEL: Well, even though the unemployment rate is well below 5 percent now, 1 in 7 men between the ages of 25 and 54, mostly too old to be in school and too young to retire, is not working. This is a whole set of people who have been basically chewed up and thrown out by the economy, and some of them may never come back - bad for them, bad for the society. Second thing I'm worried about - the rate of productivity growth - that's how much stuff we make for every hour of work - has been painfully slow lately. Productivity growth is the reason we have more stuff than our grandparents without working more hours. We don't know why it's slowed, and unless we can get that up, we won't have rising wages and living standards for our kids. SINGH: That's David Wessel. He's the director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. David, thank you for your time. WESSEL: You're welcome. LAKSHMI SINGH, HOST:  Investors are watching to see if the stock market rally that picked up momentum after President Trump's election stays the course. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been steadily marching toward the 20,000 mark. And weeks ago, it topped that mark for the first time in the Dow's history. Other major stock indices have also been climbing, and businesses and consumers continue to have more confidence in the U. S. economy. The big question is when or how will this post-inaugural honeymoon period end? To offer a little more clarity, we reached David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. He joined us from the Brookings Institution studio, and he began by laying out the state of the financial markets. DAVID WESSEL: The stock market is very happy. There has been a surge in stock prices since the Trump inauguration. It looks like the stock market is looking only at the Trump policies that are friendly to business - tax cuts, more infrastructure spending, less regulation - and ignoring the policies that business and companies definitely don't like, like all this hostility to trade. So that leads a lot of people to think that the markets are cruising for a bruising here, but predicting when the markets are going to turn and which direction is really well beyond me. SINGH: Some worry that we're putting too much confidence in the markets and that this is sort of a bubble that could burst. Just reminding some of our listeners, Andrew Ross Sorkin, you recall, recently wrote in The New York Times DealBook, right? - that a well-respected hedge fund manager was warning his own investors that things could go badly pretty quickly. Do you recall that? WESSEL: Yes, so there are a couple of possibilities here. One is the market is just guessing wrong, and they're going to discover that President Trump and the Republican Congress can't deliver the goodies or that they're going to get more of the baddies (ph). Another possibility - we know that markets kind of get euphoric, so there is a possibility there's a bubble. But that doesn't tell us very much about what's going on with the real economy. That just tells us what's going on in the minds of stock investors and traders. SINGH: I mean, it's just too soon to say. WESSEL: Well, it's always too soon to say about the markets. But look, there is something important here. Whether you like President Trump's policies or not, all the measures of business confidence, not only the stock market, but surveys, measures of consumer confidence have gone up a lot. And that's important because we know that when people feel better about the economy, when they're more optimistic, consumers are more willing to buy, businesses are more willing to invest. And that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. SINGH: What are you most concerned about going forward in this economy and the stock market? What are you looking out for? WESSEL: I'm most worried that we are living a fantasy here, that somehow because President Trump has promised to do a lot of things that people are expecting something that can't happen. So my first fear is that if we have a manic high now, we're going to have a manic low. My second fear is that we are not doing anything to deal with our long-term chronic, problems in the economy. So we're going to squander this opportunity when the economy does seem to be relatively strong and strengthening to deal with long-term problems. SINGH: Give me a couple of examples.

This week about 3,000 workers at Boeing will decide whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists. The vote also has implications for the future of organized labor nationwide at a time when union membership has dipped to its lowest levels in decades. South Carolina Public Radio's Alexandra Olgin reports. ALEXANDRA OLGIN, BYLINE: You can't drive anywhere in Charleston without being reminded of the upcoming vote at Boeing. The company has billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM union. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: But the IAM doesn't like it when we work together. They want us to sit across from each other and argue. OLGIN: The union is countering the publicity campaign with its own rallies and ads. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Is there a 36 percent difference between you and your counterparts in Washington state? OLGIN: Boeing moved some assembly of its 787 Dreamliner plane from union plants in Everett, Wash. , to South Carolina in 2011. State leaders have long fought efforts to unionize, arguing it damages South Carolina's competitiveness. The National Labor Relations Board alleged the company's move was partially to retaliate against Boeing's Washington workers after they struck for higher pay and a better contract. The charge was eventually dropped. Several workers are grabbing pizza and soda at a union meeting near the plant in North Charleston. Union organizer Mike Evans is comparing salaries at different Boeing sites, 24 of which the IAM represents. MIKE EVANS: I know what my members are getting paid up in Everett and in St. Louis and in Huntsville, Ala. It's just - is this good enough for you guys? Or you guys want a change? OLGIN: The company says pay varies by location. Joan Robinson-Berry leads Boeing's local operation. It is one of the biggest private employers in the Charleston area and is in line with average hourly wages here. JOAN ROBINSON-BERRY: Most communities are paid to market. Whether you're in a union or not, you're paid to market. OLGIN: It is cheaper for Boeing to build planes in South Carolina. Workers tried to organize in 2015, but the union canceled the vote citing confusion among workers. Boeing's Robinson-Berry says the union is bad for business. ROBINSON-BERRY: Our story is always consistent. We think this is a facility where we don't need a union. And our direct relationship with our employees to continue to grow this wonderful campus is our vision. OLGIN: South Carolina has enjoyed a manufacturing renaissance. Politicians don't just market the state as pro-business and nonunion. During the 2015 campaign to unionize at Boeing, the governor at the time, Nikki Haley, was featured on an anti-union radio ad. Lee Adler with the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University says if workers at Boeing organize this year, it would be a big deal. LEE ADLER: It would be as dramatic a private-sector union win as has occurred in the last decade and would be a very, very inspirational moment for organized labor that's having a very tough time right now. OLGIN: Especially in the Southeast where many states have right-to-work laws which don't require workers to join labor unions or pay dues to keep a job. While overall union membership is down, there have been some gains. In the last few years, auto workers at plants in Tennessee and Alabama have organized. For Boeing employee Chris Jones, this vote has been a long time in the making. CHRIS JONES: If we go to a vote, and if we lose, I'm OK with that because at least we got a say on it. It's overwhelmingly obvious that we've never had a voice. OLGIN: Jones has been working towards this week's vote for six years. For NPR News, I'm Alexandra Olgin in Charleston, S. C.

And one trend we're following - people of similar political stripes are in some cases seeking each other out. Northern Idaho, for example, is becoming a beacon for conservative transplants from California. Here's NPR's Kirk Siegler. ADRIEN KOCH: We have dogs. Thank goodness they're in there, and they didn't bark. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Adrien Koch retired last summer from her job with FEMA in the Bay Area. After vacationing in the wooded mountains of north Idaho, she and her husband fell in love, and they moved here a few months later. It reminds cook of the California she knew in the '70s. KOCH: It's kind of like a better time that's gone by, yeah. It's a much slower pace. SIEGLER: Koch is 62 with graying blonde hair. She's sitting on the couch in her Spartan living room. The house she bought in this quiet cul-de-sac is twice as big and half as expensive as the one she had in California, but that's only one reason why she left. KOCH: I did not feel safe. SIEGLER: Why is that? KOCH: Because of the crime. The crime has escalated. And the element that has moved out of San Francisco and moving farther and farther out so the farther out you go, yes, it's less expensive, but it's also more dangerous. SIEGLER: Koch instantly felt at home in small town Idaho. She says there are a lot of like-minded Christians. And as she's gotten older, to her surprise, she's become more conservative. KOCH: I've always been fearful of guns. However, I'm open now to learning. And the gun stores and gun clubs here in Coeur d'Alene are very warm and welcoming. They're very helpful. SIEGLER: Cook was also struck by just how many expat Californians are here. They're everywhere - the gun shop owners, the retirees at the golf resorts. They hold seats on school boards and in local government. KOCH: I immediately tell people, especially if they're not from California, I am not one of those people who want to change Idaho. I love it the way it is. That's why we're here. SIEGLER: But North Idaho, at least, has changed. It wasn't always so staunchly conservative. A lot of people I talked to traced this shift back to the early '90s. That was around the time of the deadly earthquakes in California. There was a lot of racial tension after the Rodney King beating, and out migration to states like Idaho really picked up. North Idaho's population has since doubled. And even as late as 2015, the census shows that more than a quarter of all new residents moving to the state still came from California. In the town of Post Falls, I met C. J. Buck, the owner of Buck Knives. C. J. BUCK: So this is our manufacturing facility. SIEGLER: They make heavy-duty hunting knives, the kind you might gut an elk with. BUCK: We just picked up and moved. We brought about 60 people with us. SIEGLER: They left Southern California a few years back because he says the cost of doing business there got too high. He entertained an enticing tax incentive package from Portland, Ore. , but they settled on Idaho. BUCK: We looked at Idaho as not having a major metropolitan area. That would mean as a state we would stay truer to those rural understandings. SIEGLER: What he's saying is that there's no major city like Portland or Los Angeles that would swing Idaho's politics to the left, especially when it comes to minimum wage increases. BUCK: The beauty of Idaho is you just never lose connection. It's the people who need the jobs are the ones voting on the issues. SIEGLER: Now, that rural vote Buck is talking about played a big role in the surprise election of Donald Trump. And if you think about the Electoral College just for a minute, it's weighed disproportionately to rural red states like Idaho. So conservative folks like Buck, if they move up to Idaho their vote has nearly twice as much impact as it did in California. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Are you ready now? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. Welcome. SIEGLER: One frigid night I ducked into a restaurant next to the resorts that were built recently along the shores of Lake Coeur d'Alene. Here is the monthly meeting of North Idaho's Progressive Diners. The people in this small crowd half joked that I was looking at the only Democrats left in Kootenai County. Eighty-year-old Mary Lou Reed was the last one to represent this area in the state legislature. She was ousted in 1994. MARY LOU REED: Well, the economy changed enormously. The lumber mills are all gone. The mines are shuttered down. We do not have labor unions that are active. SIEGLER: Reid also moved up here from California, but in 1956. And she recalls how North Idaho was once the country's top silver producer, and union Democrats ruled up until the late '80s. Now this county doesn't have a single Democrat in office. Reed says the thing that no one's talking about out in the open with all these changes is white flight out of California. REED: We're very, very white up here. SIEGLER: Kootenai County is 95 percent white, compared to much of Southern California today, say, where whites are now in the minority. REED: People who move here from Southern California will never overtly say that they are racist. They'll just say we left Southern California 'cause the crime was getting to be so awful. SIEGLER: She insists that race plays a part in some people's decisions to move up here. REED: No question. The white flight is to flee from a multi-racial situation into one in which everybody looks the same. It's very dull. SIEGLER: This is definitely an uncomfortable subject. Some of the transplants I met didn't really want to talk about race as a reason why they did or didn't move here. And others told me it just didn't have anything to do with it. Race and politics, it's complicated in North Idaho just like anywhere else. ANNA OROPEZA: We don't got much time left, so. SIEGLER: I met Anna and Luis Oropeza in their modest home in one of the new subdivisions sprouting up in the pine forests on the western edge of Coeur d'Alene. A. OROPEZA: Looking at houses it's the first thing, I'm like, oh, there's another Californian moving to the neighborhood. SIEGLER: The Oropezas relocated last year from California. For Anna it was like coming home. She grew up here. Her parents moved her up from Orange County in the early '90s. When they decided to move they were a little apprehensive at first. Anna is white and Lewis is Hispanic. They're raising two African-American foster kids, and one who is Latina. LUIS OROPEZA: When I first moved up here I heard people were like, oh, you're going to get, you know, the eye or whatever, but it's never happened to me. People are just as nice as can be. SIEGLER: The couple thinks this is a safer place to raise their kids. And they like the politics, too. Luis says Idaho is more live and let live. L. OROPEZA: You know, the laws are just way too strict compared to up here. You know, here you can actually practice your amendments. Down there, you get really restricted. You know, and it's - a lot of people like the freedom. SIEGLER: A gun owner, Luis says that even he was surprised when he first walked into a store here and saw someone openly carrying and it was no big deal. In California, he says, someone would call the cops right away. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

Daniel Tarullo joined the Federal Reserve back in 2009 amid the financial crisis. He became a leading voice in demanding that banks rework their finances to be ready for the next crisis.

DANIEL TARULLO: Over the last eight years, my goal has been to create a safer regulatory system to be able to contain the risks that the financial system of the 21st century poses. INSKEEP: And so when we heard in recent years about banks, for example, being required to keep more capital on hand, more cash on hand should they need it in an emergency, that was you doing part of that. TARULLO: That certainly was the Federal Reserve doing it. And, you know, Steve, if you think back to the situation in 2004, '05 and '06, at that time, the large banks simply didn't have enough capital to protect against the risks that they were taking. And in some cases, they really weren't even aware of the risks they had. You know, I recall when we did the first stress test in the winter of 2009 and we asked banks to aggregate their exposures to individual counterparties, for example, some of them really weren't able to do that. INSKEEP: You're reminding us of the situation where if you asked a bank what is the worst case scenario for you on a given day, they couldn't even tell you. TARULLO: Precisely. INSKEEP: And now they can? TARULLO: Now they are in much better shape. INSKEEP: So is the system strong enough? TARULLO: Strong enough - look, when someone tells you the system is strong enough, that's when you want to get worried. The financial system adapts regularly, continuously. There's always innovation. There are always new instruments being created. People are always looking for new ways to make money. And that means that the regulatory system has to be adaptable as well. INSKEEP: So what have you thought about when banks have sometimes said you are regulating us way too much now? TARULLO: You know, it is the case that for the very largest institutions they do need an extra level of regulation. They need more capital than - relative to their balance sheets - than other banks would need. And that's because of the collateral damage to the economy that would be entailed were they to fail. INSKEEP: People around President Trump have suggested that regulation of banks may be a major reason that the economy is not growing as rapidly as many people would like. We had some weeks ago on the program Anthony Scaramucci. He's a hedge fund manager. He's been an adviser to the president. He briefly was considered for a post in the White House. And this is what he said about the Dodd-Frank regulations that you've helped to implement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: One of the biggest problems that Dodd-Frank has caused is it has restricted the lending to small businesses. If you're restricting that arterial flow, which is what Dodd-Frank has done, well, that's a very big mistake for the economy because what we know about life is that we don't want to make ourselves too, too safe and then we can't get the innovation, the growth and the things that we need to do to populate the economy with terrific entrepreneurs. INSKEEP: Is Scaramucci correct that that's the trade-off that we have made - less economic growth in order to be more safe? TARULLO: Well, I think the aim should be sustainable economic growth. You know, Steve, there was an enormous amount of lending in the 2003, '04, '05 and '06 period, a lot of mortgages written that seemed at the time to be producing more growth and more homeownership, but they weren't built on a solid foundation. And of course people defaulted on those mortgages. Housing prices went down. You know, I agree with much of what Mr. Scaramucci said in your clip. The point where I would disagree is that regulation has been the dominant or primary reason why there hasn't been more lending. Everybody's still pretty cautious even eight years after the financial crisis. INSKEEP: Did you read in The Wall Street Journal that when your departure was announced from the Fed that bank stocks went up? TARULLO: Yeah. Well - yeah, I saw it on the wires. INSKEEP: What did you think of that? TARULLO: To some degree, it's a compliment I guess. One thing you learn as a central banker is to try to look through short-term developments. And I think that the core reforms I have been part of putting in place will have a lot of durability, particularly as they apply to the biggest institutions. So I don't know that my departure is going to make a particular difference as it applies to those kinds of regulations. And I think in general, the run-up in bank and other stock prices has been more a function of expectations for more growth in the economy, which again may or may not be realized. INSKEEP: I think you're telling me that that boost in stock prices may have suggested some people buying bank stocks were excited that banks were about to become more profitable, the regulations were about to change, and you're responding that maybe the regulations aren't going to change so much after all. TARULLO: Well, I think banks are going to continue to become more profitable because they have gotten themselves into a stronger situation. They've made the investments that they need in risk management, and so to the degree people are banking on significant cutbacks in the regulation of the largest institutions, I don't expect that that's going to happen. And I don't think the American people would want it either. I mean, people do remember how we got into this situation and why we put these regulatory reforms in place over the last eight years. All you need to do is think back to 2007, '08 and '09. INSKEEP: Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo, who has announced he is leaving in early April, thanks very much. TARULLO: Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  A leading bank regulator is leaving his job. Daniel Tarullo joined the Federal Reserve back in 2009 amid the financial crisis. He became a leading voice in demanding that banks rework their finances to be ready for the next crisis. He helped to implement new regulations under what's called the Dodd-Frank law. Now, he says he's leaving as of April, which means President Trump can name his replacement. And he talked with us about his legacy. What was your central goal these last several years? DANIEL TARULLO: Over the last eight years, my goal has been to create a safer regulatory system to be able to contain the risks that the financial system of the 21st century poses.

It is isolated and rural. But it's also economically thriving and culturally diverse. Decades ago, Garden City embraced the meatpacking industry, and immigrants flocked there for jobs. The city worked hard to absorb them, but now its blueprint for success is under threat. Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: This is a place with lots of cultures and cultural hubs. One of them is in a metal building in a commercial strip near the outskirts of town. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: African Somali shop is here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). MORRIS: Shelves overflow with bright African clothes and African food. In back, there's a big TV playing African soccer, some folding chairs and tables where guys like Marsal Maleye hang out after work. MARSAL MALEYE: Seven years in Kansas and never see - someone tells me, are you from Africa? Are you from this, this, this? Never. So that's why I prefer Garden City will be my house and rest of my life. MORRIS: Garden City has built a vibrant economy in a difficult environment by welcoming decades of immigrant labor. But that model faces three distinct challenges. And one cropped up earlier this month when immigrants stopped coming. Amy Longa is with the International Rescue Committee, an agency that helps resettle refugees. AMY LONGA: For me - Garden City office in particular - I don't have any scheduled arrival that's going to arrive in the next coming days or weeks. MORRIS: That's a problem because meatpacking, the bedrock industry here, is hard, dirty work with high turnover. Garden City's labor market is tight. Unemployment is way below the national average. And Longa, who came from Uganda a decade ago, says refugees are motivated workers. LONGA: It's almost no plan B. It's a plan A. You become an independent person. And becoming independent is able to pay your rent. MORRIS: Immigrants working, paying rent, paying taxes have turned Garden City and other meatpacking towns into islands of growth amid seas of rural decline. And Garden City by and large welcomes and appreciates its immigrants, as Carol Schieber found out when she was passing through from Guatemala 22 years ago. CAROL SCHIEBER: It was so friendly and helpful that people would greet you at the stores and help you as much as they could everywhere you went. MORRIS: Schieber liked the vibe here so much that she stayed. Garden City is now majority-Hispanic and extremely diverse, a town of 27,000 speaking at least 27 - some say 40 - languages and still finding fresh ways to welcome newcomers. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVING TABLE)MORRIS: Dr. John Birky is moving one of those big, medical-exam tables into a modest apartment with help from a couple of Somali men. JOHN BIRKY: So this is actually going to be a waiting room right here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Yeah. The waiting room, yeah. BIRKY: And then we'll come back here. And so this will be one exam room. You can see we put a sink in there. MORRIS: Birky is setting up a nonprofit clinic handy for recent immigrants. But he's aware of a second, very serious menace to immigrants here. BIRKY: Yeah. Do we want to publicize this beyond local community? Because we're always kind of asking ourselves, you know, what kind of bad actors are going to show up and cause issues? MORRIS: 'Cause Garden City had a close brush with some alleged bad actors last fall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Developing tonight, the FBI has foiled a terrorist bomb plot in Kansas. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: These three men are accused of planning to blow up an apartment complex in Garden City. That complex is home to a mosque. AHMED HASSAN ALI: I've got a little bit flashback. I said, wow. What I was running from still is here. I never thought that, really. MORRIS: Ahmed Hassan Ali, a Somali immigrant sporting a Kansas City Royals baseball cap, is standing outside the low-slung apartment complex targeted by the bomb plot. ALI: There's a lot of families. Kids did nothing wrong. Away from, like, civil wars, problems back home - they were seeking to have a better life in the United States. MORRIS: Three members of an anti-Islamic militia calling themselves the Crusaders allegedly prepared to set off bombs at this complex and then shoot any fleeing survivors. ALI: But thanks to FBI, thanks to law enforcement, that didn't happen. That's how we have a good connection with the law enforcement in Garden City, especially Michael Utz, a great guy. MICHAEL UTZ: I'm Michael Utz. I'm the chief of police here in Garden City. MORRIS: When FBI agents told Utz about the bomb plot, he reached out himself to the Muslim community here. UTZ: To me, it wasn't an attack on the Somalian population or the Burmese population. This was an attack on our community. MORRIS: Finney County Sheriff Kevin Bascue agrees. And Bascue says there's a third problem vexing immigration here. Another Trump administration executive order could force local law enforcement to check the immigration status of otherwise law-abiding citizens. KEVIN BASCUE: Well, I think that the threat to this community is the ending of what we've worked so hard over many, many years to happen here. MORRIS: The relationship between the police and the town's valued immigrant population. BASCUE: I think our community would be a dying community without the immigrants that have come in to fill in the gaps and to grow business. MORRIS: Bascue says law enforcement here will continue to cooperate fully with federal immigration agents but with an eye toward preserving Garden City's winning formula, which starts with immigrants.

S. unemployment rate is 4. 8 percent. It was 9. 3 percent when President Obama took office just over eight years ago. Many news and political analysts have wondered why so many Americans have sounded so angry and despondent when they talk about the economy. The stock market is up, too. Some economists say 4. 8 percent is close to full employment. Nicholas Eberstadt, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, has written an extended essay for the current issue of Commentary magazine that's earned, well, a lot of comment - left and right. It's called \"Our Miserable 21St Century. \" Nicholas Eberstadt, who's also a member of the visiting committee at the Harvard School of Public Health, joins us from his offices in Washington, D. C. Thanks so much for being with us. NICHOLAS EBERSTADT: Hey, thanks for inviting me. SIMON: Well, forgive a baseball analogy, but it seems to me you're saying that looking at something like the unemployment rate - it can be as much a misdirection, if you please, as to looking for signs of economic health as it is to think that whoever gets the most hits wins a baseball game. EBERSTADT: Yeah. I mean, so we all know that - most important thing is to get on base and then see where things go from there. The most important thing is to have a job that pays. And the unemployment rate does a worse and worse job of reflecting true labor market conditions in the United States. I mean, just to pick one statistic - for every guy between the ages of 25 and 54 - the so-called prime working age is that critical group - there were three guys who are neither working nor looking for work. SIMON: And then therefore they don't show up in the unemployment stats. EBERSTADT: Don't show up. They're not even - they're not in the denominator. So what we've seen over the past half-century is a gradual exodus from the work force, first by guys and then, starting around the year 2000, for women, as well. And whatever has happened in the past decade and a half since about the year 2000, it's been powerful enough to cancel and then actually reverse the inflow of women into the work force, which has been maybe one of the most important social trends in the U. S. and in other Western countries in the post-war era. SIMON: What happens to those people that don't show up in the statistics? EBERSTADT: We have time use surveys for guys. And according to these self-reports, the prime age guys who were checked out of the labor force basically don't do civil society. They don't do charitable work. They don't do volunteering. They don't do religious activity and so forth. They don't do an awful lot of help around the house. They don't do an awful lot of child care or help with other people in the home, even though you'd think they have nothing. What they do is they spend an awful lot of their day watching, whether it's TV or internet or handheld devices or whatever. And, now, Alan Krueger, the Princeton professor, former head of the Council of Economic Advisers for the White House - he came out with a study showing that almost half of the unworking men report that they took painkillers the previous day. So you add to that dispiriting tableau the idea that men who were unworking are not just sitting and watching, they're sitting and watching stoned. It's a very, very grim picture of, you know, kind of huge loss of human potential. SIMON: You also talk about the fact that part and parcel of having the largest number of incarcerated people on Earth is the fact that we wind up having the largest number of former felons back in society and not part of the employment market, but also, in many ways, not part of civil society. EBERSTADT: At the end of my work for this book, \"Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis,\" I thought I'd do a due diligence chapter on what the work rates and employment profile of ex-cons looked like. And it turns out that American men and women who have been sentenced in our criminal justice system don't have information collected on them once they're no longer behind bars or out of correctional supervision. And according to some pretty good work by some demographers who've tried to reconstruct these trends 'cause they can't get the information from the U. S. government, about 20 million American men and women - obviously, overwhelmingly men - are adults with a felony in their in their background somewhere. And we don't even collect the information on what their work chances and incomes and all the rest is like, but I kind of tried to reconstruct this from some non-government data. And it looks pretty grim, just the way you'd think. I think it's actually kind of scandalous that we don't bother to collect information on this enormous proportion of our society - maybe one in eight adult men. I mean, the group itself is probably almost twice as large as our unauthorized illegal alien population. SIMON: You can scroll to the end of your article and sort of keep looking for you to say, and therefore, I think we should - but I didn't see that. EBERSTADT: I don't know that I'm smart enough to tell you what the ten-point program is to fix all of this. What I hope to do with this article was to bring some attention to a huge problem that's causing a lot of suffering in our nation. And so people from all different sides of the public square must understand what's happening in our country. If we can see the same facts, then maybe we can develop a consensus to help turn this situation around.

It's a very, very grim picture of, you know, kind of huge loss of human potential. SIMON: You also talk about the fact that part and parcel of having the largest number of incarcerated people on Earth is the fact that we wind up having the largest number of former felons back in society and not part of the employment market, but also, in many ways, not part of civil society. EBERSTADT: At the end of my work for this book, \"Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis,\" I thought I'd do a due diligence chapter on what the work rates and employment profile of ex-cons looked like. And it turns out that American men and women who have been sentenced in our criminal justice system don't have information collected on them once they're no longer behind bars or out of correctional supervision. And according to some pretty good work by some demographers who've tried to reconstruct these trends 'cause they can't get the information from the U. S. government, about 20 million American men and women - obviously, overwhelmingly men - are adults with a felony in their in their background somewhere. And we don't even collect the information on what their work chances and incomes and all the rest is like, but I kind of tried to reconstruct this from some non-government data. And it looks pretty grim, just the way you'd think. I think it's actually kind of scandalous that we don't bother to collect information on this enormous proportion of our society - maybe one in eight adult men. I mean, the group itself is probably almost twice as large as our unauthorized illegal alien population. SIMON: You can scroll to the end of your article and sort of keep looking for you to say, and therefore, I think we should - but I didn't see that. EBERSTADT: I don't know that I'm smart enough to tell you what the ten-point program is to fix all of this. What I hope to do with this article was to bring some attention to a huge problem that's causing a lot of suffering in our nation. And so people from all different sides of the public square must understand what's happening in our country. If we can see the same facts, then maybe we can develop a consensus to help turn this situation around. SIMON: Nicholas Eberstadt - he is the author of \"Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis\" and a new article in the current issue of Commentary magazine, \"Our Miserable 21St Century. \" Thanks so much for being with us.

White House aides say it will be an optimistic speech where he talks about what he has done in the first month in office and what he hopes to accomplish. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has been talking with some people who will be listening closely to this speech. Tam, who are they? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: So these are people who I first interviewed back in 2011 as part of a project called The Road Back To Work. I gave several people in St. Louis who started that year unemployed recording devices and asked them to document their search for work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)RAY MEYER: I just want to work. ANNICA TROTTER: Right now I will take any job. BRIAN BARFIELD: We will do what it takes. It's just I can't find that place yet. JENNIFER BARFIELD: I will take it just to get work. KEITH: Those were Ray Meyer, Annica Trotter and Brian and Jennifer Barfield. And what their experiences demonstrate is that for people who lost their jobs in the wake of the Great Recession, life doesn't just snap back to normal. SHAPIRO: And as you talked with them, did you find that this experience shaped their politics, too? KEITH: Yeah. I just went back and listened to some audio from six years ago. And several of them voiced frustration with the political system. They felt left out of the recovery and didn't have much good to say about Washington. Let's listen to this little clip from Brian Barfield in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)B. BARFIELD: There's no such thing as a politician that knows how to bring jobs back. SHAPIRO: Which brings us to 2017. President Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back jobs, especially blue-collar jobs. You went back to talk with Brian Barfield and the other folks who you reported on in 2011. Let's hear what they told you. J. BARFIELD: Hi. I'm Jennifer Barfield. I'm 53 now. Currently, I'm unemployed, which is ironic because when I first met Tamara, I was also unemployed. But I have worked almost the entire time since. KEITH: Jennifer Barfield really did spend most of the last five years gainfully employed, doing IT work. But at the end of November, a temporary assignment ended, putting her back in the all-too-familiar position of searching for work. Her husband, Brian, has had an even rougher road. B. BARFIELD: I am Brian Barfield. I am 59. I just got disability. KEITH: He traces his employment problems back to 2007 when the Chrysler plant where he was a manager closed up. He's worked since then but never really recovered from it. B. BARFIELD: Never have, and I never will. KEITH: His shoulders and knees are busted from years of physically demanding work. And unable to find a job after years of searching, Barfield finally gave up and got approved for federal disability payments. B. BARFIELD: So I am officially retired. KEITH: President Trump often talks about the forgotten men and women of America. And for Barfield, it's almost as if Trump is channeling his very thoughts. B. BARFIELD: It's about time someone stand up for us. KEITH: Barfield has felt forgotten for years. B. BARFIELD: I have been unemployed so long, they just said, well, you don't count. You know, you don't receive benefits. You don't file anymore. So you're one of the - what? - 9 percent that just don't count anymore. KEITH: The unemployment rate would rise to about 9 and a half percent if those who are marginally attached to the workforce or working part time for economic reasons are added to those still looking for work. Barfield says as soon as candidate Trump started talking about building a wall and protecting American workers, he had his vote. These days, Barfield is elated. B. BARFIELD: He's doing everything I sent him to Washington to do - everything. The fact that the press is against him - and no offense. KEITH: None taken. B. BARFIELD: OK. When the press gets upset with him, I know he's had a good day. KEITH: Barfield's face lights up when he talks about the president. His wife, Jennifer, says she loves Trump, too, would like to shake his hand and thank him. But there are some things that give her pause. J. BARFIELD: He went in high gear. And it was so fast for me. I was saying in my head, slow down. Slow down. Come on. Wait. Let some dust settle here from that last thing you signed before you sign another big thing. KEITH: She voted for President Obama in 2012 but this time was all in for Trump early. Still, she recently signed up for health insurance through Obamacare because she needed coverage, and that was the only way. Trump is pledging to repeal and replace the program. Barfield doesn't know how she feels about that. But on this and other matters, she's willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt. J. BARFIELD: Let's give him a chance. Let's see what he does. He'll work it out. KEITH: What do the Barfields want to hear from President Trump tonight? Brian wants the president to be bold - no need to reach across the aisle. Jennifer wants him to get back to crumpling up the trade deals he talked about so much as a candidate. That's why she voted for him. As much as the Barfields feel like they have a president who finally sees them, Annica Trotter feels invisible. Trotter was the youngest person I profiled in 2011. And she doesn't just have a job six years later. She has a career. TROTTER: I am 31 years old, and I am gainfully employed as a registered nurse. KEITH: But getting to this point wasn't easy. She went to nursing school while still working to support her two kids. In December, Trotter earned her degree and started working overnights at a hospital right away, which is pretty remarkable given that not long ago she was convinced she would never even go to college. TROTTER: That was the bar that I'd set for myself. But then I realized that I can move that bar (laughter). It's not fixed in place. KEITH: Of the four people I went back to St. Louis to visit, Trotter is the only one who didn't vote for Trump in November. TROTTER: He's not my president. KEITH: Trotter finds the flurry of executive orders coming from the Trump White House unnerving. TROTTER: You don't play with people's lives, you know? And I think that before anyone makes decisions so concrete, much more thought needs to be put into it. KEITH: What she hopes - though doesn't expect - to hear from President Trump tonight is some humility and an effort to make her feel like she is part of his America. TROTTER: I feel that if I came across President Trump, he would disregard me. Who am I to him? I'm a poor person. KEITH: Even though she's on the best financial footing of her young life. At 61 years old, Ray Meyer has been working in banking for some 40 years except for the three-year gap where he struggled to find any work at all, which started in January 2009. MEYER: I was terminated. And I sat home and watched the inauguration. KEITH: President Obama's inauguration, that is. At one point, he even sent Obama his resume, hoping the president could help or at least would know what people like him were going through. He didn't get a response. Meyer has been working at his current job for almost two years, not making what he did before. But it's enough. Meyer's marriage, however, did not survive. The extended unemployment, the financial stress - they all took a toll. MEYER: Life goes on. KEITH: Meyer's feelings about President Trump are mixed. He's thrilled about the way the stocks in his retirement account are performing. But when he voted for Trump, he was voting to have someone run the country like a business. And he figured Trump would be more presidential than he's been. MEYER: I just wish that he would kind of get a bit thicker skin and get on with what he's got to do. He's got a job to do. You know, he's got all of us looking up to him with hopeful eyes, thinking that he's going to be not our savior but get us out where we need to be and put us on the right track again. KEITH: What does he want to see tonight - a president who is calm and focused. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Erasing national borders does not make people safer or more prosperous. It undermines democracy and trades away prosperity. We're giving it away. GREENE: Now less clear is what economic program Trump will pursue. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Economic nationalism plays well with many of the president's most ardent supporters. People like James Evert, who attended a Trump rally in Florida earlier this month. JAMES EVERT: A lot of people here are pro-America and looking to just support a president that finally says, I'm for you, the working man. His number one concern is Americans, not for all the other people around the world. HORSLEY: That narrow focus on American workers showed up on one of Trump's first days in office. As the president recalled for a group of conservative activists last week, he and his aides were discussing plans to restart two stalled pipelines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well, Sir, it comes from all over the world, isn't that wonderful? I said nope. It comes from the United States or we're not building it. HORSLEY: Trump directed his commerce secretary to come up with a plan to ensure domestic pipelines use American materials. But the order includes considerable wiggle room, and it may run afoul of international trade rules. Nevertheless, some people welcome the president's push. SCOTT PAUL: I thought it's about time. HORSLEY: Scott Paul heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership between the Steelworkers Union and domestic steel companies. Thousands of steel jobs have been lost in recent years. And Paul says those idle workers would be happy to go back to work making pipe. First, though, their employers will have to be convinced. Trump's agenda has staying power. PAUL: It's kind of the chicken and egg thing. U. S. steel makers aren't going to open up lines to make massive amount of pipes if they don't think pipes are going to be in demand. But once they know there's going to be a market, this is a product that the steel industry is going to be eager to deliver. HORSLEY: Likewise, Trump's been pressing automakers to locate more plants in the U. S. But car-making is increasingly a global business. Many American automakers rely heavily on imported parts, while many foreign companies employ workers here in the U. S. Kelsey Mays is senior editor of the website cars. com, which compiles an annual index of the most American car models. KELSEY MAYS: The number one American-made car was the Toyota Camry. And that may surprise some people because Toyota obviously isn't based here in the United States. But the Camry has 75 percent domestic content. It's built in Georgetown, Ky. and Lafayette, Ind. , and it employs a number of people building it. HORSLEY: The biggest disconnect between Trump's narrow brand of nationalism and the reality of global supply chains showed up when the president visited a Boeing plant earlier this month to celebrate the rollout of a new 787 Dreamliner. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina. Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made here in the USA. HORSLEY: While Boeing is an American company, the Dreamliner is a melting pot. Its fuselage comes from Italy. The wings are from Japan. Passenger doors are built in France. What's more, aviation consultant Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group says 85 percent of the planes are sold overseas. RICHARD ABOULAFIA: You've got a plane that's heavily sourced from abroad and overwhelmingly goes to international customers. This is a poster child for globalization. HORSLEY: Big exporters like Boeing would have a big target on their back if Trump's protectionist policies end up starting a trade war. With its 6,400-mile range, the Dreamliner is built to carry people quickly and easily across oceans and between continents, a flight path that could be bumpy with a new nationalistic president at the controls.

CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: John Buhrmaster is a fourth generation banker. JOHN BUHRMASTER: This was originally my great-grandfather's office. Yeah, that's his picture right there. LANE: Buhrmaster is president at the First National Bank of Scotia in upstate New York. His great-grandfather was a coal and milk merchant who helped form it.

LANE: Scattered around the country in small, often agricultural towns, there are some 3,000 banks with less than $300 million in assets. That's a tiny fraction of the assets of a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, and yet these small banks face many of the same regulatory requirements as the big banks. Buhrmaster says he is drowning in paperwork. BUHRMASTER: Ten years ago, I had a half a person and an Excel spreadsheet. Today I have two full-time people plus and a $22,000-a-year software program that has to handle it. LANE: Community bankers complain that loans now take three times as long to close because of all the documentation required. Quarterly reports to regulators have some 2,400 questions on them. And Buhrmaster and others say that visits by regulators have turned into high-pressure gotcha sessions. BUHRMASTER: I'm here to support this community, to build my community and to help them thrive and prosper. And if I'm spending my time and my customers' and my shareholders' money paying for new software, it is a complete waste of time and money. LANE: There's actually consensus among regulators and lawmakers that some rules should be eased for small banks. Republicans in Congress, however, want to go further. Their plan, the CHOICE Act, has a long list of changes. Some of them would help small banks, but a lot would help big banks. Kim Schoenholtz is a banking scholar at NYU's Stern School of Business. KIM SCHOENHOLTZ: It reduces the necessary oversight over the riskiest large financial institutions in the U. S. financial system. LANE: The CHOICE Act would exempt banks from annual stress tests if they meet certain capital requirements. That means regulators wouldn't know how banks could damage the system in another crisis. SHOENHOLTZ: If we really wanted to ease the regulatory burden on small banks, we could do it, but it wouldn't contain the features that the CHOICE Act has for the large banks. LANE: Shoenholtz says President Trump could simply appoint different regulators that would ease the rules for small banks without scrapping the rules for big banks. Matthew Dykman is a banking lawyer at Goodwin Procter. He says it's true. The CHOICE Act will help big banks. But he says that's not a bad thing. For instance, if a bank isn't selling mortgages to investors, why should they fill out the paperwork as if they were? MATTHEW DYKMAN: I think that there's an unwillingness to even look at what can be improved in Dodd-Frank on the part of the Democrats. And there's - you know, to be fair, there's a unwillingness on the side of the Republican Party in many instances to consider why a particular regulation might be prudent. LANE: Back in Scotia, N. Y. , John Buhrmaster can only watch this battle play out. He has a little love for the large banks that nearly brought down the financial system and then got bailed out. But he remains focused on the parts of the CHOICE Act that help his customers. BUHRMASTER: I have the ultimate faith in both parties that they will do the right thing and not continue to subsidize and grant favors to businesses that already have an unfair advantage. LANE: But he says if the cost of compliance doesn't come down for small banks, it will be small bank customers who suffer. For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane. (SOUNDBITE OF HARMONICA BLUES BAND SONG, \"HIT THE ROAD JACK\") AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Republicans in Congress have their eye on rolling back Dodd-Frank, the legislation Congress passed after the financial crisis. They say doing so would ease regulatory burdens on the small and dwindling number of community banks around the country. But the plan also eases rules on big banks, the ones that caused the crisis of 2008. Charles Lane from member station WSHU reports.

We see ourselves as independent change makers. We invent things. And we can reinvent ourselves. But that innovation, that desire to keep changing has gone away. That's the central argument of Tyler Cowen's new book - America is standing still. And it's not a good thing. The book is called \"The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest For The American Dream. \" Cowen says people have grown more risk averse, reluctant to switch jobs or to move to another state. And he told me that he's worried more and more communities are self-segregating, whether it be by income, education or race. TYLER COWEN: We're making decisions that are rational and even pleasurable from an individual point of view. But when everyone in society behaves this way to cement in their own security, their own mobility, social mobility as a whole goes down. Inequality goes up. Many measures of segregation go up. And ultimately, a bill for this comes due. MARTIN: You spend a few chapters in the book talking about the different levels of segregation and how that has lent itself to the complacency we've seen. A couple things - we don't move across state lines anymore. And if we do, we're moving to neighborhoods where everyone looks like us. Draw the connection there to complacency. COWEN: That's right. So if you live in Arlington, Va. , and if you moved to Ann Arbor, Mich. , or even Santa Monica, Calif. , those places are more alike than ever before. But most importantly, segregation by income has gone up in virtually every part of this country. So wealthier people tend to live together more than before, and so do poorer people. And this is bad for the country as a whole. And we see a version of this in the last election, where so many people are shocked by the candidate who actually won. MARTIN: What happens when we live in communities where we are not challenged or where we're just reaffirming our own biases all the time? COWEN: Well, we become complacent. Many of those biases are true, I might add. But if you ceased being challenged, and you think your way of life is the only way, ultimately that way will become weak. It will be subject to less improvement. You will enter a kind of bubble and continually be surprised by the challenges the outside world keeps on throwing at you. But you're not very well-equipped intellectually to handle them. MARTIN: One stat that jumped out at me when you think about complacency and how our economy has stagnated - wages. We've heard for a long time how wages are stagnant. But the median male wage, you write, was higher in 1969 than it is today. That is remarkable. COWEN: It is truly a shocking fact. Now, you could argue the measurements are not perfect. That's true. But that even the numbers can come out that way. So many of the advances in our economy have come from women working more, working harder, getting more educated. That's great. But when it comes to males, something has very badly gone wrong. I think we have switched to a service sector economy. Most jobs are now service sector. That's bad for some percentage of men. Jobs require more and more that you be skilled in information technology. That's great for the top 1 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent, not so great for the median or the bottom third of males. MARTIN: So this narrative has caught hold after Donald Trump's victory, that men, in particular white men, have not seen the kind of wage increases. And that's led to a severe feeling of disenfranchisement from the system. But you write, as you illustrate with a statistic, this has been happening for a long time. So why is this only now coming home to roost? COWEN: I think what we had done in the previous decade was take on a lot of debt to try to cover up fairly stagnant standards of living. And that can work for a while. We also have improved our country in other ways. We've made it more tolerant. We've made it safer. Those are good things. So life in some critical ways feels better. And those are real feelings. But at the same time, if you let slip the dynamism of your society and your economy, eventually that will come back to pinch or bite you really pretty badly. MARTIN: You write at the end of the book, and you put it in bold, actually twice, this sentiment. And I'm going to quote now from the book. \"The biggest story of the last 15 years, both nationally and globally, is the growing likelihood that a cyclical model of history will hold, rather than a model of ongoing progress. \"So what does that mean? I mean, what's the cycle we're living through, and where are we at in it? COWEN: In the 1990s, pretty much everything seemed to be going in the right direction. More countries were democratic. More countries were becoming free. Lately, we see China, Russia, Turkey moving back in a much more authoritarian direction, significant parts of the Middle East up in flames. The forward march of progress is not the main story today. MARTIN: When you talk about these big historic cycles, these are cycles that include the rise and fall of empires. Is that what we're witnessing? COWEN: I would say the risk of an unraveling of the basic liberal globalized world order has been going up for some number of years now. And only now do we see it with Brexit and the election of Trump. We need to take this risk very seriously. MARTIN: Donald Trump, if anything, was a rejection of the status quo. The people who supported him are the people you're writing about who said, we've been living in this stasis. And so we want to break the system. We want to break the status quo. COWEN: But keep in mind, the rejection of the status quo was not for a bold, bright, optimistic, daring future. So much of the rhetoric of the Trump campaign - the inauguration speech, the convention speech - it's been deeply pessimistic. It's been deeply backward-looking. It's about wanting to go back to an America of the Eisenhower era, attitudes toward race and foreign alliances and foreign trade. I don't think it really is dynamism. I think it's another form of actually a disguised complacency. MARTIN: So how do you sleep at night after writing this book? I mean, this is grim stuff we're talking about right now. COWEN: I'm actually an optimist. And I think some of this has to do with age. So I think of the '80s and '90s as very calm, smooth, optimistic decades. But when you think back to our broader history, you know, the Civil War, the Great Depression, the Vietnam War, Richard Nixon trying to undermine the Constitution. Those are all terrible, deeply unpleasant events. But we did get through them. And I think viewed in a longer run perspective, this country will recapture its dynamism. I think innovations that have been restricted to the tech sector will move through most of our economy. At some point, real wages will go up quite a bit more again. My hope is the current political mood is something we're getting out of our system, rather than a permanent change. So ultimately, I would bet on optimism. But I think those big bumps in the road, they're not distant. Right now, we're just at them. MARTIN: Thanks so much for talking with us. COWEN: My pleasure. Thank you.

After the Dow crossed 20,000 for the first time in January, it kept surging. It's been above 21,000 this week. NPR's Chris Arnold looks at what's going on and what it means for your retirement account. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Rasheed Irani works for a helicopter manufacturing company in Torrance, Calif. And like many Americans, he's been paying more attention to the stock market lately. RASHEED IRANI: I was speaking with my wife. And we were both obviously happy that the market is going up. And she said, I'm so glad that our 401(k) is doing much better now that Trump is the president. She thought that it was because of Trump. But I think I was able to convince her that it is not (laughter). ARNOLD: Actually, many investors do seem to be enthusiastic about Trump's pledges to cut taxes and regulations and build infrastructure. But beyond the debate over why the market is up, other people are wondering, do they own enough stocks? Or maybe they own too many stocks. And what happens next? To get some answers, we called up Burt Malkiel. He's an economist and an author of a classic book on investing called \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street. \" He's also the head of investments for the robo-adviser Wealthfront. Malkiel says he's getting. . . BURT MALKIEL: A lot of questions about the market. And what I tell people is nobody - and I mean nobody - is able to tell you whether the market is too high or too low. ARNOLD: Well, that doesn't sound very helpful. But Malkiel says you don't need to know where the market's headed next. MALKIEL: Let me tell you the one thing that I am absolutely a hundred percent sure of, and that is the lower the fee I pay to the purveyor of an investment service, the more there is going to be for me. ARNOLD: Pay the lowest fees possible. Malkiel says that's crucial. He says you also want to have the right mix of stocks and bonds and real-estate funds. Robo-advisers like his can set that up for you at a very low cost, but he says you do not want to play the game of paying brokers or mutual fund managers a lot more than that to try to pick a bunch of stocks that'll be winners. MALKIEL: This was something Warren Buffett stressed in his annual letter to shareholders. ARNOLD: That came out just this past weekend. And Buffett wrote about a $1 million bet he made with a hedge fund manager nine years ago. Buffett bet that a simple, low-fee index fund that just blindly owned 500 major U. S. companies - that over a decade, that would beat any group of hedge funds that the person betting against him would choose. The hedge fund manager who took the bet is losing big time. Buffett's simple index fund has gained nearly four times as much value as the group of hedge funds. That just seemed like a colossally huge difference. MALKIEL: That's absolutely right, and the fees border on the obscene. ARNOLD: So there are good ways to invest online at very low costs, but some people still want a human being to talk to about investing and financial planning. And that can get risky. KEVIN KELLER: Just because a person calls himself or herself a financial adviser, they may be nothing more than a sales person. ARNOLD: That's Kevin Keller, the head of the CFP Board, which represents certified financial planners. He says many advisors get commissions to steer you into bad investments with big fees. KELLER: That's why it's so important to select an adviser that's going to work in your best interest. ARNOLD: The Obama administration had put a rule in place that would require just that. But the Trump administration has now moved to delay it and might kill it. So for now, Keller says what you should do is ask your adviser if he or she is acting in your best interest at all times and get it in writing. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

JOE NOCERA: Thanks for having me, Scott. SIMON: So why is the stock market rising to these unprecedented levels? NOCERA: Well, people in business - people of business - have high hopes that the moves the Trump administration makes will, you know, as they say, unshackle the animal spirits - unshackle business. As the president himself noted on early Thursday morning on Twitter, the market has added $3. 2 trillion in value since November 8. So, you know, the hopes are exceedingly high. The core question right now being asked by investors is - is this run-up justified by what's going to happen over the course of the next year or two? SIMON: So they anticipate deregulation. NOCERA: They anticipate deregulation. SIMON: Yeah. NOCERA: They certainly anticipate massive tax cuts, especially corporate taxes, so that's a second really important thing. And they - you know, they expect things like other massive infrastructure. Trump has promised a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. So there's a series of things like that have corporate America and investors' hopes very, very high. There are three problems, as I see it. The first is that his erratic nature has the potential to do something - for something to happen - that could cause the stock market to really crash - some argument with China or some fight with India or, you know, something along those lines. There are also two business things that he has in mind that could be very harmful and that I think could wreck the whole idea that the stock market is going to go up, and the economy's going to go up. One is if there's truly a deportation plan that causes hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants to be kicked out of the country. They make up 5 percent of the American workforce, and there are certain sectors of the economy, like farming, that are completely dependent on undocumented immigrants. The second is if there's a border tax or tariff, which could also lead to a trade war. And the two of those combined, I think - my view is - would overwhelm anything like corporate tax relief on the upside. SIMON: Is it possible to undertake massive infrastructure projects without immigrant labor? NOCERA: I don't really think it is. That's mainly because the labor market right now is very tight. There really isn't a lot of unemployment right now. And so if you undertake an infrastructure project, you need laborers. And even if you're paying the kind of wages that attract natural-born citizens, you're still going to need undocumented immigrants to get the job done. SIMON: And these are not - infrastructure jobs and construction are usually not the kind of jobs that, let's say - that 55-year-old people who've lost their jobs and fallen off the unemployment grid can fill. NOCERA: That's exactly right. And what's more - immigrants - undocumented and legal immigrants combined - are one part of that 20-to-50-year-old population that's growing and that are going to be the workers of the future. SIMON: Joe Nocera, columnist with Bloomberg View - good to talk to you again, Joe. NOCERA: Thank you, Scott. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The Dow Industrial Average hit 21,000 for the first time ever this week. The stock market has soared since Donald Trump's election. Why? What does this mean? Will it continue? To know the unknowable, we turn now to Joe Nocera, columnist for Bloomberg View and a returning veteran to our program. Joe, thanks so much for being back with us. JOE NOCERA: Thanks for having me, Scott. SIMON: So why is the stock market rising to these unprecedented levels?

Modernization of mills, economic changes and huge declines in logging led to a long downturn in the industry. During the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump promised to bring back timber in Oregon, but a lot of people aren't waiting for help. They're finding new ways to make timber relevant today. As part of our Kitchen Table series, NPR's Tom Goldman has the story. TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: There's a street corner in downtown Portland where you can stand today and envision a dramatically different scene next year. THOMAS ROBINSON: What you'll be seeing is a revolutionary 12-story mass timber structure, really a timber high-rise building. GOLDMAN: Portland architect Thomas Robinson says when completed, the 148-foot structure will be the tallest timber building in North America. Now, you may be thinking that's a 148-foot match waiting to light, but Robinson and his designers studied how wood burns for four years. That knowledge helped them design a mass timber structure that meets the same fire standards as concrete and steel buildings. It's designed to outperform its rivals in withstanding an earthquake. And there's this bonus, says Robinson, collaboration in a divided state. ROBINSON: That's been a great way to connect urban Portland to rural Oregon. GOLDMAN: The D. R. Johnson Lumber Company is 200 miles south of Portland in the small town of Riddle, Ore. This is where they make the key material for the Portland high-rise, cross-laminated timber or CLT. On this day, workers are making CLT by first dropping into place 32-foot boards. JOHN REDFIELD: Once we get a full layer of boards down. . . GOLDMAN: John Redfield is D. R. Johnson's chief operating officer. REDFIELD: We actually pass it through a glue extruder to bond that panel together. We then apply the cross pieces and so on and so forth. GOLDMAN: These criss-crossing layers glued together create a CLT panel Redfield says is both strong and flexible. The panels are used for easy-to-assemble construction. CLT has been made outside the U. S. and used around the world, including for refugee housing in Europe. When D. R. Johnson started producing panels three years ago, it was the first to do so in the U. S. Valerie Johnson co-owns the company. VALERIE JOHNSON: We did, I think - all of us feel kind of a surge of excitement about the potential upside to it. GOLDMAN: In 2013, Johnson went to a wood innovations meeting in Oregon. She says in such a tenuous industry, it's important to keep looking for ways to grow. At the meeting, she heard a presentation on CLT. The talk was compelling. The product was similar to some of the others her company made. So Johnson decided to give it a go carefully. D. R. Johnson started in 1951, and like many lumber companies in the state, it was hit by the timber downturn in the 1980s and '90s. The company shut three of its saw mills. Its workforce shrank by more than 350 people statewide from 1980 to 2010. Three hundred mills closed putting 30,000 people out of work. So D. R. Johnson is going step by step first making a small CLT panel for testing and then finally making panels to sell. Valerie Johnson says within the next six to 12 months, CLT production at her company should create 20 new jobs. JOHNSON: I think the CLT market stands a really strong chance of being very successful here. I think - I hope I keep very healthy for a long time because I want to see these beautiful tall buildings built with wood. GOLDMAN: Another company in Oregon is making big, plywood panels for buildings, and there's more innovation to come, says Geoff Huntington. He's from the College of Forestry at Oregon State University. GEOFF HUNTINGTON: I am comfortable that there are other manufacturers in Oregon that are looking closely at this, and I'm sure that you'll see others following soon. GOLDMAN: The market for wood products is changing. Huntington calls it a new frontier. HUNTINGTON: We've got a building industry - both architects and developers - that are looking at wood in a new way and in different ways than they have before. GOLDMAN: Architects like Thomas Robinson, who we met earlier, liked the look of wood. The rural-urban connection Robinson mentioned with the Portland high-rise - that's also part of the new allure. Huntington says it's the same idea as the farm-to-table concept of embracing locally produced ingredients for food. With wood, call it forest to framing. For all that's positive, Huntington knows the growing markets for these new products aren't going to cure all that ails timber in Oregon. Trade issues and decades-long battles over logging still exist, even for Valerie Johnson whose company is an emerging success story. JOHNSON: We scrape for the logs for this old mill here every month, and our guys have to hustle to find them. GOLDMAN: Some environmental groups say that's how it should be. Environmental lawsuits continue to block timber sales mostly on federal land. Recent Congressional bills aiming for a balance between increased timber harvest and conservation have largely been stalled. The quest for innovation continues. Groundbreaking is expected this summer in Portland on the nation's tallest timber high-rise. Tom Goldman, NPR News.

Trump has blamed Mexico for job losses in the United States because of NAFTA, the trade agreement, and for allowing drugs and immigrants to flood across the border, as he's put it. I traveled to McAllen, Texas, earlier this month to see how the national discussion on those issues is being received by the communities that live in this area. JIM DARLING: It doesn't help us economically. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Jim Darling, the mayor of McAllen, Texas. DARLING: We've been kind of probably hurt by the rhetoric going on in Washington more than any other community. We're the No. 1 sales tax collector - or No. 1 or 2 - in the state of Texas. And 40 percent of that comes from Mexican citizens shopping here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mexican citizens who are no longer making the trek. In December, the governor of one of the wealthiest states in Mexico called on residents to boycott shopping in McAllen. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We shop for many reasons. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As part of the outreach to Mexico, McAllen has started an ad campaign running in Mexican movie theaters. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And we shop because it's fun. Find your reason. Live the McAllen experience. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tax receipts in McAllen, Darling says, are down 4 to 5 percent. Part of that is also due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso, which has been hard hit recently. It plunged to an historic low against the dollar when Trump's victory was announced on November 9. Darling is worried that things aren't going to get better anytime soon. DARLING: When people go away, it's harder to get them to come back. It could be a long - longer-term problem for us than we'd want, too. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jesus Gonzalez is seeing that firsthand. JESUS GONZALEZ: We own, with my wife, a high-end furniture store that caters to the high-end clientele, mostly from Mexico. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There is even a VIP section that sells a heavy selection of gold, acrylic and velvet sofas that could charitably be described as looking at a home in a Vegas penthouse. It's Saturday midday, and his store is empty. GONZALEZ: So at the beginning, I thought it was only going to be temporary. But it's been pretty much the last three months that they've been boycotting, so they're serious. And I've talked to customers all the time, the few that still come, and they confirm that. They feel that the community there are thinking the same way. Let's spend our money here. Let's not send dollars to United States. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Gonzalez, like the majority of people in this part of Texas, is of Mexican descent. He says he's been trying to tell his clients in Mexico that they are targeting the wrong region, but he says people in Mexico are angry. GONZALEZ: I think our president's mouth, it's a bigger wall against our country than the physical wall. He is making our clients, customers not like us anymore. He is separating us from them. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You blame him personally? GONZALEZ: Of course, of course. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And another thing that could have an impact on the local economy is NAFTA. The Trump administration is pressing forward on NAFTA. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he hopes to launch formal negotiations within three months. Othal Brand would welcome that. OTHAL BRAND: I don't think it needs to exist like it is. It needs to be modified. GARCIA-NAVARRO: He's running for mayor of McAllen against Jim Darling. We meet him on his family's land by the Rio Grande River. He's a businessman, and he says companies aren't staying in the United States because it takes too much time, money and red tape to get things done. He says what NAFTA has done is encourage companies to move to Mexico. BRAND: When I was growing up, we had tariffs, we had duties, and they were seasonal in the produce industry. When they did NAFTA and they took away all our tariffs and all our duties, the ones who got hurt the most was the worker. It wasn't the companies. They just picked up and moved. There's got to be a balance. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That balance, though, is delicate in this area. You just have to go to the Starr-Camargo International Bridge to see how much trade there is between the two countries. SAM VALE: You'll notice that here - this truck you see coming in front of us, that is recycled cardboard, and it's going to Mexico. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sam Vale is a wealthy businessman whose father built this bridge. He now owns it and leases it to the federal government. He took us on a tour. His bridge is painted gold on the U. S. side and blue on the Mexico side. VALE: There's no rhyme or reason to the color schemes. It's just that we got some good gold marine paint that was at a good price and they had some blue (laughter). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was just down in this part of Texas, and he met with Vale. VALE: And we talked this - a total of three hours. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It was a long talk that addressed a lot of issues. Vale has a nuanced view. He's not against renegotiation of certain portions of NAFTA or of tariffs on Mexican goods, but he says he gets frustrated with people discussing NAFTA and tariffs without really thinking about the impact. He says 40 to 60 percent of what's used in Mexican factories comes from the United States. VALE: So that creates a huge job development activity. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Here on the border and beyond. VALE: You wouldn't have the Midwestern comforts and everything they do there if you didn't have a border. You know how much of the Midwestern stuff crosses here to go to Mexico for them to be able to sell their corn? GARCIA-NAVARRO: The answer is a lot. American farmers are the biggest exporters of corn to Mexico. But now there could be trouble ahead with that. A Mexican senator has introduced a bill to mandate that Mexico no longer buy its corn from the U. S. but from Brazil or Argentina. The people here in the Rio Grande Valley say they feel caught in the middle and are bracing for what comes next.

JIM DARLING: It doesn't help us economically. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Jim Darling, the mayor of McAllen, Texas. DARLING: We've been kind of probably hurt by the rhetoric going on in Washington more than any other community. We're the No. 1 sales tax collector - or No. 1 or 2 - in the state of Texas. And 40 percent of that comes from Mexican citizens shopping here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mexican citizens who are no longer making the trek. In December, the governor of one of the wealthiest states in Mexico called on residents to boycott shopping in McAllen. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We shop for many reasons. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As part of the outreach to Mexico, McAllen has started an ad campaign running in Mexican movie theaters. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And we shop because it's fun. Find your reason. Live the McAllen experience. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tax receipts in McAllen, Darling says, are down 4 to 5 percent. Part of that is also due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso, which has been hard hit recently. It plunged to an historic low against the dollar when Trump's victory was announced on November 9. Darling is worried that things aren't going to get better anytime soon. DARLING: When people go away, it's harder to get them to come back. It could be a long - longer-term problem for us than we'd want, too. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jesus Gonzalez is seeing that firsthand. JESUS GONZALEZ: We own, with my wife, a high-end furniture store that caters to the high-end clientele, mostly from Mexico. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There is even a VIP section that sells a heavy selection of gold, acrylic and velvet sofas that could charitably be described as looking at a home in a Vegas penthouse. It's Saturday midday, and his store is empty. GONZALEZ: So at the beginning, I thought it was only going to be temporary. But it's been pretty much the last three months that they've been boycotting, so they're serious. And I've talked to customers all the time, the few that still come, and they confirm that. They feel that the community there are thinking the same way. Let's spend our money here. Let's not send dollars to United States. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Gonzalez, like the majority of people in this part of Texas, is of Mexican descent. He says he's been trying to tell his clients in Mexico that they are targeting the wrong region, but he says people in Mexico are angry. GONZALEZ: I think our president's mouth, it's a bigger wall against our country than the physical wall. He is making our clients, customers not like us anymore. He is separating us from them. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You blame him personally? GONZALEZ: Of course, of course. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And another thing that could have an impact on the local economy is NAFTA. The Trump administration is pressing forward on NAFTA. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he hopes to launch formal negotiations within three months. Othal Brand would welcome that. OTHAL BRAND: I don't think it needs to exist like it is. It needs to be modified. GARCIA-NAVARRO: He's running for mayor of McAllen against Jim Darling. We meet him on his family's land by the Rio Grande River. He's a businessman, and he says companies aren't staying in the United States because it takes too much time, money and red tape to get things done. He says what NAFTA has done is encourage companies to move to Mexico. BRAND: When I was growing up, we had tariffs, we had duties, and they were seasonal in the produce industry. When they did NAFTA and they took away all our tariffs and all our duties, the ones who got hurt the most was the worker. It wasn't the companies. They just picked up and moved. There's got to be a balance. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That balance, though, is delicate in this area. You just have to go to the Starr-Camargo International Bridge to see how much trade there is between the two countries. SAM VALE: You'll notice that here - this truck you see coming in front of us, that is recycled cardboard, and it's going to Mexico. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sam Vale is a wealthy businessman whose father built this bridge. He now owns it and leases it to the federal government. He took us on a tour. His bridge is painted gold on the U. S. side and blue on the Mexico side. VALE: There's no rhyme or reason to the color schemes. It's just that we got some good gold marine paint that was at a good price and they had some blue (laughter). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was just down in this part of Texas, and he met with Vale. VALE: And we talked this - a total of three hours. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It was a long talk that addressed a lot of issues. Vale has a nuanced view. He's not against renegotiation of certain portions of NAFTA or of tariffs on Mexican goods, but he says he gets frustrated with people discussing NAFTA and tariffs without really thinking about the impact. He says 40 to 60 percent of what's used in Mexican factories comes from the United States. VALE: So that creates a huge job development activity. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Here on the border and beyond. VALE: You wouldn't have the Midwestern comforts and everything they do there if you didn't have a border. You know how much of the Midwestern stuff crosses here to go to Mexico for them to be able to sell their corn? GARCIA-NAVARRO: The answer is a lot. American farmers are the biggest exporters of corn to Mexico. But now there could be trouble ahead with that. A Mexican senator has introduced a bill to mandate that Mexico no longer buy its corn from the U. S. but from Brazil or Argentina. The people here in the Rio Grande Valley say they feel caught in the middle and are bracing for what comes next.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Hard power, like the military, is in. Here's Mick Mulvaney, the president's budget director. (SOUNDBTE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICK MULVANEY: He wants more money for defense, more money for border enforcement, more money for law enforcement, generally, more money for the vets, more money for school choice and then to offset that money with savings elsewhere so that all of that is done without an additional dollar added to the deficit. INSKEEP: Let's hear two views. Jared Bernstein is former chief economist to Vice President Biden. Good morning, sir. JARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning. INSKEEP: And we're also joined by Peter Morici, a conservative economist at the University of Maryland. Thanks to you for coming by as well. PETER MORICI: Good morning. INSKEEP: And he's got the tie untied, as he often does. He's ready for battle. Does this approach make sense, Peter? MORICI: Well, it's a very broad approach. I mean, that - we can note the things that are very unacceptable and the proposed cuts. But there are also some things that probably need to be done. Look at it this way. It's Mr. Trump's how to make a big deal, right in front of you - \"The Art Of The Deal. \" He always makes a huge, outrageous first - first request. And then he figures he's going to settle someplace in the middle. And that middle will be higher if he asks for the moon. But in the end, he's probably going to have to settle for a couple of rocks because they're going to have to deal with the realities within his own party and the Democrats. INSKEEP: The reality's that a lot of the programs he proposes cutting are quite popular. Jared Bernstein. BERNSTEIN: Yeah, no - I think that's right. Like many presidents' first budget, he's not going to get everything he wants. But interestingly, he's got a Republican Congress. And they're pushing back, really quite hard, already on this budget. The priorities - you mentioned that word, Steve - are extremely misguided in this budget in my view, the cuts to programs like job training, student aid, help with college, economic development, housing assistance, you know, help to elderly people to pay for heating costs. Meals on Wheels, which is actually a very - Mick Mulvaney got this wrong yesterday. He said there's no evidence that that program's helpful. That's actually extremely helpful in helping seniors stay at home. And so it's just, I think - just an example of Trump's really misguided priorities here, plussing up defense and really decimating programs that help people. INSKEEP: Peter? MORICI: I think there are things that they proposed cutting that are worth cutting, like the aid to some of these regional development commissions. Heck, we've been pouring money into Appalachia since the Roosevelt administration. At what point do we say, we've done what we can? INSKEEP: Can I stop you for a second and say that there's been a lot of economic development in Appalachia over the years? MORICI: I understand. But we can't attribute it just to the fact that the federal government is pouring money in. And if there's been a lot, maybe it's time to say, they don't need special treatment anymore. But there's also areas that they really haven't looked at. There are places where federal agencies could be more efficient, like I used to work for the International Trade Commission. We do investigations very differently than the Canadians do, and we - for the same kinds of investigations. And we do it much more expensively. The Defense Department - heck, there's plenty of money to save inside the Defense Department to find $54 billion, for example, their pension system and their 20 year retirement. You know, we're all living a lot longer and working a lot longer, except for people in the military. INSKEEP: I think you're saying that the Defense Department should be told to spend money more efficiently, rather than be given tens of billions of dollars. MORICI: Well, I don't - I am not saying they don't need any more money, but certainly some of the 54 can be found that way. BERNSTEIN: So look, you could always find areas in the government to be more efficient. Peter's right about that. And that is very much the case in defense, as elsewhere. But actually, if you go down the list - and you mentioned the Appalachian development programs - not only have those programs been found to be helpful in economic development in areas that really need that sort of help, but those are precisely the people that Trump said he was going to help through his expenditures in his budgets. And he's really leaving them behind. And in many ways, this budget is kind of a very close cousin of the Health Reform Act that, in that case, really it takes a bunch of money out of Medicaid - so health insurance for low income people - and gives tax cuts to wealthy people. Now, the tax cuts aren't in this budget. But they're coming. And so again, you see the priority. It's like Trump is looking out at America and seeing that, you know, poor people have too much and rich people don't have enough. And that's just an extremely upside-down way to understand America right now. INSKEEP: Isn't that actually true, Peter? This does actually shift money from poorer people to better-off people. MORICI: Well, we just - we've had eight years of Barack Obama declaring class warfare on people who are successful. So it's only natural that we'd look at some of the disincentives to creating wealth and investing. Just because programs have been useful in the past doesn't mean they need to be continued indefinitely. The purpose of regional development is to develop the region so it doesn't need the aid. But there are areas where significant cuts can be made, where significant efficiencies can be found. But I'll say this. Bannon and company really are politically tone deaf. They've gone after his own constituents. INSKEEP: Steve Bannon. BERNSTEIN: So, you know, Peter plays the class warfare card here. So Warren Buffett said something that resonated. He said, yeah, we've been having class warfare in this country for a long time. And our side is winning. That's Warren Buffett saying his side is winning. That's very - very much the case. You know, if you actually look at what's gone on in terms of how the benefits of growth have been distributed, it's widely understood that they've largely flowed to the top. And I'm talking pretax, just market outcomes. So when you pile on with budgets like this or a health care plan like this and you take these unequal market outcomes and you amp them up even further, I think it's just really bad economics. INSKEEP: Very briefly, does it make sense for Republicans, having complained for years about the size of the federal debt, the size of the federal deficit, to have the president then propose a budget that has the same deficit? Because you're not touching Social Security. You're not touching Medicare. And you're actually increasing defense, and that's where the money is. MORICI: Well, the president has promised not to touch entitlements. And discretionary spending and defense spending are about the same size. So it's dollar-for-dollar. The real problem here is we're not growing. I mean, Jared can talk about, you know, the distributional consequences of the Obama policies. But the reality is the economy is only growing at 2 percent. And 2 percent may be good enough for milk, but it's not good enough for growth. INSKEEP: Jared Bernstein, you get the last word. BERNSTEIN: OK, so first of all, the president is touching entitlements. And that's Medicaid. So he's already proposing a - well, the Republicans are proposing a significant cut Medicaid that he's endorsing. I'm not particularly worried about the budget deficit right now. I just don't think it's - it's really the problem that many people make it out to be. And actually, here I partially agree with Peter that one of the best ways, at a time like this, to reduce the deficit is to have faster economic growth. You're not going to get that, though, if you start gutting a bunch of programs that provide opportunity to less - less well-off people. INSKEEP: You actually wrapped up early, so Peter gets the last last word - a few seconds, here. MORICI: Well, some of the tax cuts that he's proposing would help growth. For example, the corporate tax cuts I think would be very, very useful for encouraging investments. Some of the regulatory rationalization would be helpful. INSKEEP: Last, last, last word. BERNSTEIN: I wish that - I wish that were the case. But the supply-side tax cuts leading to growth never happens, economic fairy dust. INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK. The last, last, last, last, last word goes to me because I want to say that Jared Bernstein is a former chief economist for Vice President Biden. Thanks for coming by. BERNSTEIN: My pleasure. INSKEEP: And Peter Morici is a conservative economist at the University of Maryland. Glad you've joined us as well. MORICI: Thank you for having us.

A Gallup survey showed his approval rating at 37 percent. Even if that's a bit off, it's very low for a new president. One public concern involves the president's business conflicts of interest, but those conflicts do not trouble some of his core supporters who spoke with NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Fifty-one-year-old Chris Kinney thinks the United States has to get more serious about fixing some of the problems it faces such as the deficit. CHRIS KINNEY: I think this country really needs to be run more of a - more like a business at this point. ZARROLI: And Kinney who was sitting in a reception area in the St. Paul Skyway in Minnesota last week says he likes the fact that President Trump promises to bring a businessman sensibility to government. As for all those people who want Trump to sell off his properties. . . KINNEY: Probably a bunch of people that have never been in business, so they probably wouldn't understand he's not going to just hand everything over. ZARROLI: Trump's business interests have been generating attention ever since his election. But those concerns haven't really registered with the president's supporters. Most polls show he has an approval rating of more than 80 percent among Republicans. Democratic political strategist Stanley Greenberg recently interviewed a group of Trump voters in Michigan. STANLEY GREENBERG: They trust him. They know he's a businessman. They think he'll know how to get deals that are, you know, good for the country, but that he'll fight for American jobs. ZARROLI: Greenberg says when he talked to Trump's supporters about what was on their minds, issues such as Trump's refusal to release his tax returns hardly ever came up. None of that surprises Susan Welch, professor of political science at Penn State, who has studied voter attitudes toward corruption. Welch says certain kinds of corruption cases such as sex scandals get a lot of attention, and they can hurt politicians. Voters tend to overlook lesser offenses. SUSAN WELCH: They tended to not punish candidates who were charged with campaign violations or conflict of interest charges. ZARROLI: Welch says most members of Congress who were embroiled in corruption scandals actually get re-elected. She says partisanship plays a big part in this. People are more likely to shrug off wrongdoing by politicians from their own party. She points out that President Trump's supporters knew he was a businessman and voted for him anyway. WELCH: They probably knew he wasn't going to do much about it given his resistance to revealing his income tax return, and they just didn't care that much because they thought he would bring about the kind of change they wanted. ZARROLI: Former Republican congressman Mickey Edwards agrees. Edwards says Democrats can talk all day long about Trump's conflicts of interest. His supporters don't care. MICKEY EDWARDS: They don't care, you know, who's staying in this hotel. They already know he's a zillionaire. Fine. OK. So let him make more zillions. ZARROLI: Edwards who is a critic of Trump says the only thing that's going to diminish Trump's popularity is a lack of progress on the issues that are most important to his supporters. EDWARDS: The thing that could undermine him would be that in year two or year three the jobs have not come back and the things that he promised he was going to do he didn't get done. ZARROLI: If Trump can't make real progress fixing the economy, Edwards says, then his support will diminish. And the fact that Trump might have profited off the White House will suddenly seem a lot more relevant. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

MICKEY EDWARDS: They don't care, you know, who's staying in this hotel. They already know he's a zillionaire. Fine. OK. So let him make more zillions. ZARROLI: Edwards who is a critic of Trump says the only thing that's going to diminish Trump's popularity is a lack of progress on the issues that are most important to his supporters. EDWARDS: The thing that could undermine him would be that in year two or year three the jobs have not come back and the things that he promised he was going to do he didn't get done. ZARROLI: If Trump can't make real progress fixing the economy, Edwards says, then his support will diminish. And the fact that Trump might have profited off the White House will suddenly seem a lot more relevant. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.", "section": "Politics", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

New research shows that can be harder when you're older. NPR's Ina Jaffe covers aging, and she joins us now from our studios at NPR West. Hi, Ina. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: OK. New research - what does it say about older people looking for jobs? JAFFE: It says that age discrimination is a real problem. The researchers sent out 40,000 fake resumes for thousands of real jobs. The resumes were identical, except for age. This is a lead author of the study, David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine. DAVID NEUMARK: The callback rate - which means the rate by which employers contact us and say we'd like to interview you - drops from young applicants to middle-aged applicants and drops further for middle-aged applicants to older applicants. MARTIN: OK. So Ina, is this legal? JAFFE: Well, you can't come right out and say people over 40 need not apply. There is a law against that. It's called the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and it's been around for 50 years. MARTIN: Well, doesn't that protect older people who are looking for jobs? JAFFE: Well, some think it does, but employers sometimes screen for age without calling it that. For example, one company said that ideal candidates for regional sales jobs would be just two to three years out of college and that applicants with eight to 10 years of experience should be avoided. These were confidential guidelines that tobacco company R. J. Reynolds gave to job recruiters. So out of about a thousand people hired for these positions, only 19 were over the age of 40. You won't be surprised to learn that that resulted in a lawsuit. MARTIN: So usually if you don't get a job, you don't really ever get to know why. How was this information revealed? JAFFE: One of the job recruiters turned whistleblower and gave the guidelines to attorneys who specialize in employment law. And they contacted the rejected job seekers. One of them was a Georgia man named Billy Carter. He told me he had no idea why he didn't get the Reynolds job until he got that letter from the lawyers. BILLY CARTER: It just made mad because it wasn't only me. You know, as far as them are concerned, and then seeing all these other people - and I know that I could have been an asset to that company. It was very upsetting. JAFFE: Rachel, I should mention that Billy Carter isn't a plaintiff in the lawsuit yet. He's one of a dozen people who've asked the court to join the suit. Right now the only plaintiff is a man named Richard Villarreal. MARTIN: Any response from R. J. Reynolds? What are they saying? JAFFE: The company declined to comment because of the pending litigation. But in court documents, they don't deal with the charge of discrimination. Their argument is that Villarreal doesn't even have a right to sue, that he waited too long to take action and that the relevant part of the age discrimination law protects people who have jobs, but not people looking for jobs. MARTIN: How does that make sense legally? What have the courts said on this? JAFFE: Oh, the courts have said a lot of different things. The case has been through one trial and two appeals. Reynolds won the latest round, but even the judges who sided with the company didn't agree on the law and filed three separate opinions. So Richard Villarreal is waiting to see if the Supreme Court will hear the case. MARTIN: So this age discrimination law has been around for over 50 years. And there's still disagreement over who's protected and who's not? JAFFE: There is. I mean, that's one of the reasons the AARP has filed a friend of the court brief supporting plaintiff Villarreal. So has a bunch of labor economists, including researcher David Neumark, whom we heard from earlier. Also, there's a bipartisan group of senators who have introduced a bill to clarify the law. But Rachel, you know, whatever happens in Congress or in the courts, discrimination against older workers is going to remain a big issue because people are living longer now. And they want and need to work longer, too. MARTIN: NPR's Ina Jaffe. Thanks so much, Ina. JAFFE: Oh, you're welcome.

They struggle to find and keep jobs. There are a handful of initiatives aimed at changing that narrative through college education and professional training. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports on one program aimed at one of the most challenged populations in the workforce. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: I'm running late for a post-war U. S. history class. Getting past the maximum security prison patrol, two checkpoints and four rolling steel cage doors is an ordeal. When I arrive, professor Delia Mellis is discussing the history of sexual identity with 18 men dressed in green jumpsuits. DELIA MELLIS: We didn't have a history. We didn't have history. Does that mean - is he saying by implication that history didn't exist? UNIDENTIFIED MEN: No. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I don't think he's saying that. I think he's making a distinction between you know, gay acts, homosexual acts and there being a gay identity. NOGUCHI: This is part of the Bard Prison Initiative, or BPI, a privately funded program that provides college education to more than 300 students in New York state's prison system. BPI is highly selective. It accepts 10 to 25 percent of applicants. The syllabus, requirements and professors here at Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch, N. Y. , are no different than at Bard College's main campus 30 miles away. BPI social studies major Glenn Rodriguez says cultural anthropology changed his perspective. GLENN RODRIGUEZ: And we kind of dealt with the notion of ethnocentrism and cultural relativism. And it shows you how we have a tendency to kind of see people as other. NOGUCHI: At 16, Rodriguez was convicted of murder before finishing high school. Now 43, his release is in May, at which point he plans to finish his senior credits and get his master's in social work. When he isn't in class, he says he's hitting the books. RODRIGUEZ: The weekends and Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm, like, locked in a cell, reading and studying. And it's like it never ends. It seems like it never ends. NOGUCHI: The Bard Prison Initiative is exceptional both in the sense that it is rare and in its academic rigor. It was born at a time when politics favored punishing instead of rehabilitating criminals. A 1994 crime law made prisoners ineligible for education grants, effectively eliminating access to college behind bars. Since then, at least two dozen college baccalaureate programs have returned in 28 states. Max Kenner was a Bard undergraduate when he founded BPI. Last year, BPI started a pilot program offering graduates year-long professional internships with employers. Kenner says the cardinal error many people make is setting limits on what's possible for prisoners. MAX KENNER: If we're going to provide higher education in unusual circumstances, why assume less of people? If we came in and offered something that aspired to less, attrition would be higher, and the impact would be lower. NOGUCHI: A 2013 Rand Corporation study found college cut prison costs by increasing the odds of employment and reducing recidivism. BPI's recidivism rate, for example, is 4 percent, far lower than averages of 60 percent or higher in the first few years after release. Experts say college in prison helps counteract challenges such as low literacy or lack of technology access. It might persuade employers who remain reluctant to hire people with violent crime records, including many BPI students. Professor Robert Tynes, who teaches African politics at Eastern Correctional, says his inmate students are highly motivated. ROBERT TYNES: The close reading, the questions they have are so fine and well thought out that the class just takes off by itself. And it's great. It's one of the best teaching experiences I've ever had. NOGUCHI: Two years ago, a team of BPI inmate students beat Harvard in a debate. DyJuan Tatro was on that team. Tatro is a math major with an A, A-minus grade point average who wants to become a cancer researcher. The 31-year-old has served 11 years for drug crimes and gang shootings, half of it at Eastern Correctional, which has become a desired destination among prisoners because of Bard. Tatro has nothing of a hardened criminal look. His youthful face is framed by a manicured goatee. Inside the bare walls of prison where sounds echo everywhere, you have to lean in to hear his soft-spoken voice. DYJUAN TATRO: You know, I wake up in the morning, and I don't say to myself, you know, I'm in prison. I try to think of it like I'm in college. You can't entirely separate the two out, but it's healthier to think about it that way. It gives you meaning, and gives you purpose. NOGUCHI: There's a photo of Tatro bowing and embracing teammates after winning the debate. I ask him how that moment felt. TATRO: It was just like, there's good things in the world - right? - that the possibilities are out there. It allows you to dream in a different way. NOGUCHI: Lavar Gibson is in the first class of former BPI students interning at the Ford Foundation in New York City. He hopes to pursue a career in finance, but he says there are many family and friends who struggle to accept he is a changed and learned man. LAVAR GIBSON: It's easy to want to keep somebody at a certain place. People do it with their children every day. And their children change, and they grow, and they become. And if you can't appreciate that change, you really can't appreciate life. That's life. NOGUCHI: The Trump administration has called for a tougher stance against crime, but conservative scholars like Gerard Robinson at the American Enterprise Institute hope that won't come at the expense of prisoner education. GERARD ROBINSON: The right thing to do is not only give them a second chance but to also admit the fact that many of them didn't receive a first chance at school. NOGUCHI: Not all employers may be ready to extend that second chance to the workplace, but BPI is hoping to change that as well. It says it is expanding its internship program to include more employers next year. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  People leaving prison read on average at a sixth-grade level.

Cairo, Ill. , is a town on life support. It's at the very bottom of the state, which by many reckonings makes it the southernmost city of the North. It was strategically important around the time of the Civil War. In more recent times, it's become the kind of hollowed-out town that was highlighted during President Trump's election campaign. It lies within one of the most rapidly depopulating counties in the United States. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: At the very southernmost tip of Illinois, the pancake-flat cornfields give way to the rolling, forested hills of the Delta. Here at the windy confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers is the old river port and factory town of Cairo, once made famous in Mark Twain's \"Huck Finn\" (ph). Twain might not recognize Cairo today. PHILLIP MATTHEWS: So like I said, you come down the main highway, you know, people come through Cairo and say wow. SIEGLER: They say wow because there is a lot of blight here. This is Phillip Matthews, a community activist and pastor. In the last three decades, his hometown has lost half its population, also moving from majority white to majority black today. The infrastructure here is starting to crumble. Whole city blocks are condemned. MATTHEWS: This is Burkhart building right here. This is one of the main factories that used to employ many people in the city of Cairo. SIEGLER: Trade and globalization. That foam mattress factory left more than a decade ago. More recently, the paper mill just across the river in Kentucky closed. More people moved out. Then the old grocery store closed. Next came the gas station. MATTHEWS: This was the last standing gas station in the city of Cairo. And as you see, they no longer have pumps, anything. SIEGLER: And the roofs of some old partly burned down mansions are caving in. MATTHEWS: You know, right in front of you is a perfect example, you know, demolition funds, we could have finished cleaning this property up that's sitting right here that's got weeds and bricks and stuff in here. SIEGLER: Those demolition funds that Matthews is talking about were promised by the state. And he says they dried up about halfway through the job. Illinois hasn't had a budget for almost two years now. And people here feel slighted. A few years back, then-Governor Pat Quinn came down and made this big splash, designating Cairo as a port authority so it could take advantage of all the barge traffic on the rivers. TYRONE COLEMAN: It's six bucks a piece, isn't it? SIEGLER: Over at the small City Hall, Mayor Tyrone Coleman rolls his eyes when recounting that story. The governor left town, so did the promise of funds. COLEMAN: Strategically, geographically, this is one of the most untapped resource areas in the country. SIEGLER: Coleman says the town is working to attract new business. And lately, some state lawmakers have made renewed commitments. In a statement, Governor Bruce Rauner's office says the governor is working to make Cairo and other Illinois small towns more competitive. But in Cairo especially, that's a hard task when so much of the town looks abandoned. Now, folks I met here, the mayor included, told me there's plenty of blame to go around. And locals aren't off the hook by any means. Corruption has been a big problem here. There's also been a lot of racial tension. There were violent race riots in the 1960s. The federal government intervened in the '80s to get more minority representation at City Hall. But a lot of people here say the town never fully recovered after the riots. JEROME CARR: No, I ain't that good. SIEGLER: Most weeknights after he finishes work at the highway department, Jerome Carr likes to shoot pool with friends at his house and talk politics. (SOUNDBITE OF POOL BALLS BREAKING)SIEGLER: Carr is cynical about all the promises made over the years to bring new life into this town. CARR: Cairo's kind of like the microcosm of what's going on in our society or in our country on a larger scale - dysfunction and politics. SIEGLER: He's so frustrated that for the first time he's entering politics himself, running for a seat on the school board. CARR: Your shot. SIEGLER: Carr sees his town at a critical juncture. It's close to getting a supermarket to come back. The city is studying how to get a port authority up and running on its own. But then there are the housing projects. Federal officials recently took them over with plans to turn things around. Jerome Carr worries they'll just bring in the bulldozers. CARR: It's a known fact if they lose the projects, it's a wrap. SIEGLER: He says everything here is connected. You lose the grocery store and maybe the housing developments, and then it's the school. Two schools in town recently closed. Now, the junior high has merged with the high school. And no one is sure about this school's future. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: How you doing? Thanks for this morning. ANDREA EVERS: Did he - he got picked up? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Yes, ma'am, he did. Thank you much. EVERS: I'm sorry about that. And it won't happen again. They have. . . SIEGLER: Since Superintendent Andrea Evers took over five years ago, 120 students have left. EVERS: Anyone who spends much time in rural America sees that when when a high school leaves or an elementary school leaves, then families move. SIEGLER: There isn't much property tax revenue in Cairo, so most funding is based on enrollment. EVERS: We're hoping for brighter days ahead. I mean, we're very, very optimistic that the grocery store will come back and that the paper mill in Wickliffe, Ky. , will return and that we will get that stability back. So we're hoping to weather through it. SIEGLER: This school is the center of the community. It's open till 11 most nights for kids to use the gym and library. There are town forums here, weddings. And it even houses Cairo's only food bank. In a converted classroom, volunteers from a church are stuffing bags full of canned soup and pasta. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: So we have a lot of noodles. So just take what you want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Beans, we have a lot of those. SIEGLER: Down the hall, an ethnic studies class is wrapping up for the day. Sophomore Nigel Williams, who wants to be a high school principal someday, says it's been tough watching his friends move away. He says there's a lot of talent and potential here. NIGEL: A lot of people discriminate Cairo for what they see. But they don't actually come in and get to know. It's the difference between seeing and actually knowing. SIEGLER: This is something you hear a lot here. In much of rural America, people's identity is tightly wrapped up in their town. And there's a sense that places like this have been forgotten. For the first time in years, Alexander County voted Republican in the last presidential election, though most of Cairo itself went blue. MATTHEWS: And I just wanted you to see. For the most part, you can see the things that just need to be repaired up in here. SIEGLER: Phillip Matthews, the community organizer, stops his sedan in front of one of the housing projects. The roofs are damaged, leaking. Some of the worn brick buildings have faulty heat. There's no playgrounds, so some kids have made due by fastening a basketball hoop out of some old milk crates. MATTHEWS: If you can find billions of dollars to build a wall in Mexico, you can't find the money to fix this? SIEGLER: Matthews says people here see government failing them at all levels. And they're tired of listening to the promises and talking about the problems - they want them solved. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Cairo, Ill.

It's at the very bottom of the state, which by many reckonings makes it the southernmost city of the North. It was strategically important around the time of the Civil War. In more recent times, it's become the kind of hollowed-out town that was highlighted during President Trump's election campaign. It lies within one of the most rapidly depopulating counties in the United States. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: At the very southernmost tip of Illinois, the pancake-flat cornfields give way to the rolling, forested hills of the Delta. Here at the windy confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers is the old river port and factory town of Cairo, once made famous in Mark Twain's \"Huck Finn\" (ph). Twain might not recognize Cairo today. PHILLIP MATTHEWS: So like I said, you come down the main highway, you know, people come through Cairo and say wow. SIEGLER: They say wow because there is a lot of blight here. This is Phillip Matthews, a community activist and pastor. In the last three decades, his hometown has lost half its population, also moving from majority white to majority black today. The infrastructure here is starting to crumble. Whole city blocks are condemned. MATTHEWS: This is Burkhart building right here. This is one of the main factories that used to employ many people in the city of Cairo. SIEGLER: Trade and globalization. That foam mattress factory left more than a decade ago. More recently, the paper mill just across the river in Kentucky closed. More people moved out. Then the old grocery store closed. Next came the gas station. MATTHEWS: This was the last standing gas station in the city of Cairo. And as you see, they no longer have pumps, anything. SIEGLER: And the roofs of some old partly burned down mansions are caving in. MATTHEWS: You know, right in front of you is a perfect example, you know, demolition funds, we could have finished cleaning this property up that's sitting right here that's got weeds and bricks and stuff in here. SIEGLER: Those demolition funds that Matthews is talking about were promised by the state. And he says they dried up about halfway through the job. Illinois hasn't had a budget for almost two years now. And people here feel slighted. A few years back, then-Governor Pat Quinn came down and made this big splash, designating Cairo as a port authority so it could take advantage of all the barge traffic on the rivers. TYRONE COLEMAN: It's six bucks a piece, isn't it? SIEGLER: Over at the small City Hall, Mayor Tyrone Coleman rolls his eyes when recounting that story. The governor left town, so did the promise of funds. COLEMAN: Strategically, geographically, this is one of the most untapped resource areas in the country. SIEGLER: Coleman says the town is working to attract new business. And lately, some state lawmakers have made renewed commitments. In a statement, Governor Bruce Rauner's office says the governor is working to make Cairo and other Illinois small towns more competitive. But in Cairo especially, that's a hard task when so much of the town looks abandoned. Now, folks I met here, the mayor included, told me there's plenty of blame to go around. And locals aren't off the hook by any means. Corruption has been a big problem here. There's also been a lot of racial tension. There were violent race riots in the 1960s. The federal government intervened in the '80s to get more minority representation at City Hall. But a lot of people here say the town never fully recovered after the riots. JEROME CARR: No, I ain't that good. SIEGLER: Most weeknights after he finishes work at the highway department, Jerome Carr likes to shoot pool with friends at his house and talk politics. (SOUNDBITE OF POOL BALLS BREAKING) SIEGLER: Carr is cynical about all the promises made over the years to bring new life into this town. CARR: Cairo's kind of like the microcosm of what's going on in our society or in our country on a larger scale - dysfunction and politics. SIEGLER: He's so frustrated that for the first time he's entering politics himself, running for a seat on the school board. CARR: Your shot. SIEGLER: Carr sees his town at a critical juncture. It's close to getting a supermarket to come back. The city is studying how to get a port authority up and running on its own. But then there are the housing projects. Federal officials recently took them over with plans to turn things around. Jerome Carr worries they'll just bring in the bulldozers. CARR: It's a known fact if they lose the projects, it's a wrap. SIEGLER: He says everything here is connected. You lose the grocery store and maybe the housing developments, and then it's the school. Two schools in town recently closed. Now, the junior high has merged with the high school. And no one is sure about this school's future. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: How you doing? Thanks for this morning. ANDREA EVERS: Did he - he got picked up? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Yes, ma'am, he did. Thank you much. EVERS: I'm sorry about that. And it won't happen again. They have. . . SIEGLER: Since Superintendent Andrea Evers took over five years ago, 120 students have left. EVERS: Anyone who spends much time in rural America sees that when when a high school leaves or an elementary school leaves, then families move. SIEGLER: There isn't much property tax revenue in Cairo, so most funding is based on enrollment. EVERS: We're hoping for brighter days ahead. I mean, we're very, very optimistic that the grocery store will come back and that the paper mill in Wickliffe, Ky. , will return and that we will get that stability back. So we're hoping to weather through it. SIEGLER: This school is the center of the community. It's open till 11 most nights for kids to use the gym and library. There are town forums here, weddings. And it even houses Cairo's only food bank. In a converted classroom, volunteers from a church are stuffing bags full of canned soup and pasta. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: So we have a lot of noodles. So just take what you want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Beans, we have a lot of those. SIEGLER: Down the hall, an ethnic studies class is wrapping up for the day. Sophomore Nigel Williams, who wants to be a high school principal someday, says it's been tough watching his friends move away. He says there's a lot of talent and potential here. NIGEL: A lot of people discriminate Cairo for what they see. But they don't actually come in and get to know. It's the difference between seeing and actually knowing. SIEGLER: This is something you hear a lot here. In much of rural America, people's identity is tightly wrapped up in their town. And there's a sense that places like this have been forgotten. For the first time in years, Alexander County voted Republican in the last presidential election, though most of Cairo itself went blue. MATTHEWS: And I just wanted you to see. For the most part, you can see the things that just need to be repaired up in here. SIEGLER: Phillip Matthews, the community organizer, stops his sedan in front of one of the housing projects. The roofs are damaged, leaking. Some of the worn brick buildings have faulty heat. There's no playgrounds, so some kids have made due by fastening a basketball hoop out of some old milk crates. MATTHEWS: If you can find billions of dollars to build a wall in Mexico, you can't find the money to fix this? SIEGLER: Matthews says people here see government failing them at all levels. And they're tired of listening to the promises and talking about the problems - they want them solved. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Cairo, Ill.

It's not that tourists will stay away - they're expected to come - the trouble is that workers may not. Many resorts rely on workers from abroad. And the reinstatement of a cap on visas for temporary workers has some in the hospitality industry expecting catastrophe. Here's Fred Bever of Maine Public Radio. FRED BEVER, BYLINE: It's pretty quiet right now in Ogunquit, Maine. But Sarah Diment, owner of The Beachmere Inn, says come summer, a surge of tourists transforms it into a bustling New England ocean resort colony. And they are accompanied by an influx of foreign workers. SARAH DIMENT: Most of the women that have worked for us have come from Jamaica. And they come, they work, they buy. It's insane amount of goods that they ship home. And then they go home every year. BEVER: But prospects are dim for their return. A cap was just reached on the number of short-term work visas provided under the H2B program. Those visas bring in low-skilled labor for non-agricultural jobs that American employers say they can't fill closer to home - mostly landscaping, seafood processing, housekeeping and other hospitality services. The program provides roughly 66,000 of the visas. And some years, including last, Congress has allowed more - but not this year. Southern tier states such as Florida have already secured workers. But many resorts with later seasons won't make it into the queue. Diment says she's likely to close up whole sections of The Beachmere, cancel reservations booked long ago and possibly lay off local staff. DIMENT: If I have to take out 20 rooms out of inventory, then do I really need five people in our maintenance department? Do I really need eight people at the front desk? Not only would it impact my guests, but it would potentially impact what we do here as a hotel to stay open with everyone else. BEVER: Those concerns have caught the attention of a bipartisan coalition of legislators who wants an audit of the H2B program to ensure all available visas are issued. Among them, Maine Senator Susan Collins, a Republican. SUSAN COLLINS: I think it's important to realize that even in this environment, where immigration issues have become so controversial, that these are essentially guest workers. BEVER: Collins also wants more visas allotted for returning workers. But efforts to expand the program are likely to be caught in the larger immigration debate and divide Republicans. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for instance, condemned the program last year when he was Alabama's senator. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF SESSIONS: Our focus needs to be on getting Americans back to work, not on seeing how many foreign workers we can bring to the United States. BEVER: Progressive groups also oppose the program. They point to evidence of abuses, unenforced payscale requirements, for instance, which can hurt wages for American jobseekers. And because the visas commit workers to a single employer, opponents say there's a power imbalance that puts workers at risk of deportation if they try to protest any mistreatment. Congressional supporters of the visa program still may try to attach expansions to a coming budget measure. One major wildcard - President Trump. Buy American and hire American has been his mantra. But he's also hired dozens of H2B workers for his properties, including Mar-a-Lago, which he's dubbed the winter White House. For NPR News, I'm Fred Bever in Portland, Maine.

MELISSA BLOCK, BYLINE: We are heading south from Nogales, Ariz. , to Nogales, Mexico. JESSIE GUNN: So this is the wall, ladies and gents. BLOCK: A hulking, rusted steel barrier snakes over the hillsides. It separates the two cities that share a name. We're driving with Jessie Gunn, spokeswoman for Wholesum Harvest. It's an organic, certified Fair Trade produce company. And we're heading to one of their farms about 30 miles south of the border. GUN: These are all produce trucks, every single one of them. BLOCK: We're passing dozens of 18-wheelers lined up at the border. They're all heading in to Arizona. GUN: Agrofresa, CFI - very common transporter - Si Senor, Agrofresa again. BLOCK: Nogales is the No. 1 port of entry for Mexican produce coming into the U. S. Here alone, more than 6 billion pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables were imported from Mexico last year. Tomatoes and watermelons topped the list. Going back the other way - lots of U. S. corn and soybeans. So imagine if President Trump were to impose a tariff on Mexican goods. Jessie Gunn has no doubt that would ignite a full-on trade war, tax for tax. GUN: It is the law of the universe - equal and opposite force. BLOCK: We reach the tiny town of Los Janos, pull into Wholesum Harvest's organic farm, and we head to one of the steamy greenhouses to see what's growing - wow. We are standing in a tomato jungle. We've got about two football fields worth of tomato plants. And what's incredible is that the tomato vines are twisting in a labyrinth 80-feet long, and then the tomato plants themselves shoot up about 10 feet into the air. We move on to the packing plant, where cucumbers and tomatoes are being wrapped and boxed. FRANCISCO LANDELL: We have the beefsteak tomato first, then the cucumber and then tomatoes on the vine. BLOCK: Francisco Landell is the general manager of this farm. He's thought a lot about what it would mean if NAFTA were to disappear. LANDELL: I think we will lose a lot of jobs, and I think it will be disastrous. BLOCK: Landell wonders, is it all just tough talk from Donald Trump, or is he serious about pulling out of NAFTA and imposing a border tax? LANDELL: We are concerned. Right now we're not making, like, any investment plans or any expansion plans. BLOCK: Really? LANDELL: Yeah because you don't know what will happen next year. BLOCK: So everything's on hold. LANDELL: Yes, everything's on hold. BLOCK: By U. S. standards, the workers at Wholesum Harvest don't make much. Their pay is about $10 a day. But they also get free housing, free medical, dental and child care. And Landell says he hears this from some workers. With those benefits and that stability, they're not as tempted to illegally cross the border. LANDELL: If they can make a decent living and put food on the table of their child, like, working in Mexico, they will stay in Mexico. BLOCK: Stay in Mexico and, Landell hopes, propel the next generation to better things. LANDELL: My dream is to go into a bank, ask for a loan for the company, and they say, like, Francisco, do you really don't recognize me? I used to live there by the farm. My dad used to pick tomatoes. BLOCK: So Landell's dream is that tomato picker's kid will be the banker lending him money. We leave the farm and head north, back toward Arizona alongside a fleet of produce trucks. Mexico provides 70 percent of the fresh vegetables we import, more than 40 percent of our fresh fruit imports. Wholesum Harvest's Jessie Gunn says our American diet depends on them.

His name is Gary Cohn and he's head of the president's National Economic Council. Trump will be getting advice from Cohn and that group today as he turns from health care reform to the next big item on his domestic agenda, a big overhaul of the tax code. Gary Cohn is a just-retired president of Goldman Sachs. Those Wall Street roots, and also his moderate stances on social issues and trade, put him at odds with others in the president's inner circle. NPR's Chris Arnold brings us this profile. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Gary Cohn took an unusual path to Goldman Sachs and the White House. Cohn's dyslexic, and teachers told his parents not to expect much. As a kid, he helped out at his family's electrical contracting business in Cleveland. He went on to business school. Then he was floundering around, and he decided what he really wanted to do was to work on Wall Street. So one day on a trip to New York, he went down to a commodities trading floor, and he just stood around outside the security checkpoint. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GARY COHN: And I hear a gentleman say, I got to run. I'm going to the airport. ARNOLD: That's Cohn telling the story during a commencement speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COHN: I jump in the elevator with him and say, I overheard you're going to the airport. Do you mind if I share a taxi with you? ARNOLD: The guy worked for a financial firm, and he agreed. And on the ride, Cohn tried to get the guy to give him a job, even if that meant bending the truth a bit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COHN: He says, what do you know about options? I told him, I know everything. He said, great. I want you to come back Monday. I want you to interview. I'm trading options. It's a brand-new market that's opening, and I don't know how to trade it. And I said, no problem. I'm your guy. (LAUGHTER)COHN: Literally got home Friday night. The first stop on the way in from the airport was the bookstore. I bought the. . . (LAUGHTER)COHN: I bought the McMillan \"Options As A Strategic Investment\" book and read it four times - as I said, dyslexic guy - read it four times over the course of the weekend, came back in and interviewed and was offered a job. And that's how I started in my financial services industry. ARNOLD: Now, despite his working-class roots, in some ways, Gary Cohn represents everything that many Trump voters hate. He's a registered Democrat. He's reportedly been a voice for gay rights in the White House. He's also now a super rich former Wall Street executive who supports free trade and globalization. Those are things that, during the campaign, Trump basically blamed for ruining America. But after seeing the more extreme and fringy advisers surrounding the president, more centrist watchers of the economy were relieved to see Trump pick Cohn as his top economic adviser. MICHAEL DRISCOLL: Cohn is going to be perceived as the adult in the room. ARNOLD: Michael Driscoll worked on Wall Street for 25 years and is now a finance professor at Adelphi University. The populist rhetoric from Trump has made many economists nervous that he might start a damaging trade war. But. . . DRISCOLL: One thing about Wall Street executives is they're going to be pragmatists, all right? You know, Cohn and some of the other people that come from the world of finance are going to be much more aware of what the implications are for the U. S. and the global economy and for the markets. ARNOLD: So Driscoll says he's happy to see that Cohn's in the president's inner circle. But critics say, while all that may be true, Cohn is also putting Wall Street ahead of Main Street. Cohn stood by the president's side as he signed an executive order that in effect suspends a rule from the Obama administration, a rule that says financial advisers need to act in their client's best interest. Here's Cohn on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SQUAWK ON THE STREET\")COHN: The rule was completely misintended. They were trying to protect investors in their retirement accounts, but by protecting investors, they highly limited their choices. ARNOLD: But that limiting-choice language is telling, say supporters of the rule, which include the AARP and scores of other retiree and consumer groups. They say that argument is just a bogus industry excuse. Phil Angelides is the former head of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. PHIL ANGELIDES: This is the big lie they tell. They want to tell Americans their choices are being limited. The rule does nothing of the sort. ARNOLD: Cohn and the Trump administration have also said they want to attack the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and other regulations. Angelides says to him it looks like they want to go back to the way things worked before the financial crisis. ANGELIDES: Gary Cohn is walking out of Goldman Sachs into the government with a payout that's going to be close to $300 million. And so he looks at the system that existed before the financial crisis. He thinks it worked just fine. ARNOLD: Angelides says, for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs, it didn't, and he hopes that Cohn and the administration won't be able to gut the reforms that were passed after the worst economic collapse in generations.

I'm trading options. It's a brand-new market that's opening, and I don't know how to trade it. And I said, no problem. I'm your guy. (LAUGHTER) COHN: Literally got home Friday night. The first stop on the way in from the airport was the bookstore. I bought the. . . (LAUGHTER) COHN: I bought the McMillan \"Options As A Strategic Investment\" book and read it four times - as I said, dyslexic guy - read it four times over the course of the weekend, came back in and interviewed and was offered a job. And that's how I started in my financial services industry. ARNOLD: Now, despite his working-class roots, in some ways, Gary Cohn represents everything that many Trump voters hate. He's a registered Democrat. He's reportedly been a voice for gay rights in the White House. He's also now a super rich former Wall Street executive who supports free trade and globalization. Those are things that, during the campaign, Trump basically blamed for ruining America. But after seeing the more extreme and fringy advisers surrounding the president, more centrist watchers of the economy were relieved to see Trump pick Cohn as his top economic adviser. MICHAEL DRISCOLL: Cohn is going to be perceived as the adult in the room. ARNOLD: Michael Driscoll worked on Wall Street for 25 years and is now a finance professor at Adelphi University. The populist rhetoric from Trump has made many economists nervous that he might start a damaging trade war. But. . . DRISCOLL: One thing about Wall Street executives is they're going to be pragmatists, all right? You know, Cohn and some of the other people that come from the world of finance are going to be much more aware of what the implications are for the U. S. and the global economy and for the markets. ARNOLD: So Driscoll says he's happy to see that Cohn's in the president's inner circle. But critics say, while all that may be true, Cohn is also putting Wall Street ahead of Main Street. Cohn stood by the president's side as he signed an executive order that in effect suspends a rule from the Obama administration, a rule that says financial advisers need to act in their client's best interest. Here's Cohn on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SQUAWK ON THE STREET\") COHN: The rule was completely misintended. They were trying to protect investors in their retirement accounts, but by protecting investors, they highly limited their choices. ARNOLD: But that limiting-choice language is telling, say supporters of the rule, which include the AARP and scores of other retiree and consumer groups. They say that argument is just a bogus industry excuse. Phil Angelides is the former head of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. PHIL ANGELIDES: This is the big lie they tell. They want to tell Americans their choices are being limited. The rule does nothing of the sort. ARNOLD: Cohn and the Trump administration have also said they want to attack the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and other regulations. Angelides says to him it looks like they want to go back to the way things worked before the financial crisis. ANGELIDES: Gary Cohn is walking out of Goldman Sachs into the government with a payout that's going to be close to $300 million. And so he looks at the system that existed before the financial crisis. He thinks it worked just fine. ARNOLD: Angelides says, for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs, it didn't, and he hopes that Cohn and the administration won't be able to gut the reforms that were passed after the worst economic collapse in generations.

And some people are reaping the benefit, and others are being left out. But what actually happens to the people when an industry collapses or a new technology takes off? Over the next few weeks, we're going to hear stories from around the country about how people are coping with this new world, learning new skills and new jobs, rethinking who they want to be. It's a series we're calling Brave New Workers. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Do I still see myself as a cowboy? Yeah, I do, and I hope I always do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Free porn has completely killed the industry as we know it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I was a underground coal miner. Now I'm in paramedic school. MARTIN: Our first story for this series comes from San Francisco, Calif. Medical marijuana has been legal there since the mid-1990s. Starting next year, registered businesses will be able to sell recreational marijuana. But what about people who have criminal convictions for their past involvement in the very industry that's now been legalized? Can they get in on the green rush? That's the dilemma facing Malcolm Mirage. And, no, that's not his real name. He asked that we not use it, so he can speak freely. He's 34 years old now, and he's been growing and selling marijuana on the black market since he was a teenager. He realized that legal cannabis was on the horizon, so he decided to scale up his operation in an effort, he says, to raise capital to create a legal enterprise. And he was almost there when things took a turn for the worse. MALCOLM MIRAGE: I absolutely needed to come up with half a million dollars in cash to open up a cannabis dispensary. I needed it for everything that a regular normal business would need half a million dollars for, except I could just never go to a bank. People still can't go to a bank to get a loan for selling cannabis. In 2012, a pound of marijuana here grown in the state of California could be bought wholesale from anywhere between 1,500 to $3,000 depending on the quality. Outside of California, it can go anywhere from 4,000 to $7,000. And so in order for me to gather up the largest sum of capital I possibly could in the shortest amount of time, I had to go out and get clients. Unfortunately, on one of those trips, I got pulled over about 40 miles outside of Amarillo, Texas, on the 40. There was 135 pounds of marijuana in the back of the vehicle, and I ended up in jail for cannabis distribution in Texas. I still wasn't deterred though. I was very determined I wasn't going to let an arrest in Texas stop me from opening up Mirage Medicinal. By October 2014 Halloween, I was in the Tombs in Manhattan which is what they call central booking. I'd been arrested in the Lower East Side making a transaction with somebody who informed on me. In the Tombs, the judge read what I was on probation for. And when she said and he's on probation for 130 pounds of marijuana in Texas, like you hear this audible like (gasping) in the courtroom. It was kind of - looking back on it, it's funny. But at the moment, it was dread. It was like, oh, my God. And they said you're a kingpin by state law. You are going to have half a million dollars in bail. The jig was up at that point. And that was when I called my sister on the phone. My pitch to my sister was, sis, I have a legal California cannabis cooperative that's already registered. NINA PARKS: I got this website. We got hoodies. We got T-shirts. We got bags. We got everything. MIRAGE: It's all turn-key. PARKS: The only thing that it's missing is the weed to go inside the bags, and then someone to be able to roll out the customer service. MIRAGE: Do you want to do it, sis? PARKS: I was like, all right. But I got to be CEO, right? And he was like fine. I was like, OK, cool, yeah. I'll take it. MIRAGE: You're the best. PARKS: Thanks. So when I took over Mirage Medicinal, my brother's full dream of being able to have a brick and mortar was far from a tangible reality financially. The only thing that we could really roll out was the delivery service, and that's where we are now. MIRAGE: This is the space that we use from Mirage Medicinal. We do all of our storage. We have a shipping container inside of a garage inside of a warehouse inside of a building (laughter). PARKS: This is orange creamsicle. And so with that one, you can totally smell the citrine - right? - which is also found in orange peels. It's also really creamy on the back end, and then it has that gas (laughter) - that weed gas to it, you know? MIRAGE: When I compare my colleagues in the black market with my colleagues in the current cannabis market here in California, the black market is filled with people of color just like the prison that I was in. And the people in the above ground market who are distributors, manufacturers and investors are all white majority, I'd have to say. Being involved in this business and possibly being prohibited from it because of my involvement in the selling of growing marijuana previously and having an arrest record for it is very unsettling. I may never be able to own a business selling, growing, manufacturing cannabis because of my record of growing, selling and manufacturing cannabis. And to me, it's a huge hypocrisy. The only reason there's a pie to be cut up is because people like myself going back decades created this pie.

I'm Terry Gross. It's tax time in two ways. While those of us who are last-minute folks are either trying to make sense of the often incomprehensible tax forms or paying someone else to do it for us, the Trump administration is trying to move forward on the president's promise to overhaul the tax system. So the timing is perfect for my guest T. R. Reid's new book, \"A Fine Mess. \" The mess he refers to is our bizarrely complicated tax code. The book compares our system with those of other countries in an attempt to figure out what a simpler, fairer and more efficient system might look like. Reid is a former Washington Post foreign correspondent and has lived with his family on three other continents. He has two previous books about subjects that remain urgent - the quest for better, cheaper and fairer health care and the future of the European Union. T. R. Reid, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So congratulations on writing a book about taxes that I can understand, unlike tax forms. . . T R REID: (Laughter) Thank you. GROSS: . . . Which I cannot understand. To get in the mood. . . REID: Yeah. GROSS: . . . For this conversation, I'd like you to quote one or two of your favorite incomprehensible tax instructions from the tax forms. REID: You know, I - I'm now doing my own taxes because I wrote a book about how hard it is. GROSS: Yeah? REID: Here's a gem - enter 6 percent of the smaller of line 40 or the value of your Archer MSAs on December 31, 2015, including 2015 contributions made in 2016. Include this amount on Form 1040, line 58A or Form 1040NR, line 56B. Pretty simple. GROSS: (Laughter) So this is why. . . REID: And it doesn't have to be that way. That's what's really galling. GROSS: You talk about countries where everybody does their taxes in, like, 15 minutes because it's that simple. REID: You know, I was in the Netherlands on March 31 - their tax day is April 1 - talking to a - you know, a manager. He makes about 200,000 a year. He has a whole panoply of investments, two kids in private schools, two mortgages. He'd have to fill out 12 forms in the United States. And I said, Michael, how do you do your taxes? They're due tomorrow. He says, well, I pop a beer. I go online and see if the government's got the numbers right. And if they do, I hit a button. Takes five minutes. He says, but you know, sometimes I start checking the numbers. You - he says, you know, you start checking the numbers, it could take almost half an hour just to pay your taxes. He was outraged. GROSS: Wow. So you have your new book on tax overhaul of the Republicans - are trying to figure out what their plan is going to be because there's different points of view within the party. But you think the time is really right for a true tax overhaul. You write that, like, every 30 or 32 years, the system is totally revised. That's not, like, part of the plan. It's just the way it's worked out. REID: That's right. It's history repeating itself. So we created the federal income tax in 1913 - very popular tax because the only people who paid it were the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts. And then it started - grew, the rates went way up to pay for World War I. In 1922, they wrote a pretty complete income tax code. By 1954, it was a mess. It had so many clauses and exclusions and exemptions that President Eisenhower said get rid of it. They rewrote the whole thing. That was the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. By 1986, same thing. It was a total mess. Nobody could handle it. Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, a conservative and a liberal, agreed to change it. They threw it out. That's the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If you look at the pattern there, that's every 32 years. And sure enough, we're now 31 years down the line and the thing is a total monster. It's a mess. Everybody knows we have to fix it, and the time has come. GROSS: So let's talk about some of the tax issues that directly affect individuals and families. We'll look at corporations a little later. President Trump - it's my understanding that he wants to lower personal income tax. What's his proposal for that? REID: Well, he wants to cut rates for all earners and particularly for people who run their own business. If you run your own business, at a certain point you're paying 39. 6 percent in income tax. His proposal would cut that to 15 percent. That's a huge boon for people who own their own company. How he's going to pay for it, he has never made clear. But there is a way to pay for this. I want to point this out, Terry. Other countries have found ways to cut the rates sharply and bring in the same revenue. And the way you do it is you get rid of all the loopholes and giveaways and escape clauses that have found their way into the tax code. GROSS: So getting back to how Trump wants to cut personal income taxes - like, if you're not the owner of your own business, has he proposed lower rates for individuals and families? REID: Well, I'll tell you the Donald Trump tax plan for individuals. I'll quote it to you - my tax plan will be so great it'll make your head spin. GROSS: (Laughter) And what percentage is that. . . REID: We don't know the numbers. GROSS: What are the percentages. . . REID: They - they're said to be working on a plan, but we don't know the numbers. There's a plan floating around the House that would make three rates - 5 percent, 10 percent and 20 percent. That would be a significant cut for most taxpayers. But, again, they don't say how they're going to pay for it, and you can't really cut those rates sharply without a huge loss of revenue unless you change other parts of the code. GROSS: So that's - that would be a progressive tax, but would the rich benefit more from that cut? REID: Yeah. If you're paying now at a 12-percent rate and they cut it to 10, that's a saving. But rich people are paying 39. 6 percent. If that gets cut to 20, their tax rate goes down by half. GROSS: So you say if we cut a lot of the deductions and the loopholes and the exclusions, we could afford to cut taxes and still be ahead of the game. So one of the things that's often on the table when people talk about ending deductions is the mortgage deduction, which sounds very upsetting because for everybody who owns a home, you can deduct - is it you deduct your mortgage or just the interest from the mortgage? REID: You deduct the interest, but you only do that if you take the itemized deduction. And only one-third of taxpayers take that. So for two-thirds of American taxpayers, even though it's there, they don't get it. And among homeowners, only 20 percent take the mortgage interest deduction. And, of course, they're the richest 20 percent. Terry, this deduction costs $103 billion a year. We offer it as a subsidy to the richest homeowners in America. And the argument is, well, we need this to enhance homeownership. No. No, as a matter of fact - Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, et cetera, they took away the mortgage interest deduction, and guess what? Higher rates of homeownership than we have. There's no indication at all that this thing does its purported purpose which is to enhance homeownership. And it's only people buying the most expensive homes who get this break. The net result, as I said, $103 billion a year we don't get that could reduce the deficit. GROSS: And do you challenge whether it's fair to give a break to homeowners and not to people who rent? REID: Well, that's another issue. Renters - they pay the mortgage of the landlord, but only the landlord gets the tax break. So, yeah, that's not fair either. And that's why, you know, it used to be every country had this deduction. And as I said, almost all the rich countries have gotten rid of it and no drop in homeownership rates. GROSS: So let's look at charitable deductions. That's something that you and many people question. Is it worth it? Is it worth it to the individuals who have the charitable deduction? Is it worth it to us as a culture who need taxes to fund the things we need done? So explain how charitable deductions work. REID: OK. To lead into that, could I just tell you some of the things - many things you get a write-off for in our tax code? You get a write-off for taking a night-school course, paying your property tax, growing sugar cane, moving to a new city, replanting a forest, destroying old farm equipment, employing Native Americans or buying a plug-in hybrid sports car like a Tesla. And we just are full of these things. And one of the biggest ones is the charitable contribution deduction. It costs the Treasury about $73 billion a year. Again, money that you could use for helping veterans or building a border. And it doesn't serve its purpose. There's no evidence anywhere that the charitable interest deduction enhances charitable contributions. For one thing, the most common form of contribution in the United States is when people put five bucks in the plate at church or 10 bucks in the collection box at the soccer club's dinner. And those are cash contributions. You can't write them off. They're not deductible. Many countries have gotten rid of the charitable deduction. And there's a pattern. For about one year or two years, there's a small blip - a drop in contributions. And after about three years, contributions keep going up at the rate of personal income going up. In other words, Terry, people give money to charities because they want to help others. To me, to give them a tax break for it, it just cheapens the charitable impulse. And also - here's one more thing. It is so subject to abuse. One of the biggest forms of charitable deduction is giving art to a museum. So you give an old picture to a museum. You hire an appraiser, and she knows that you and the Museum both want the highest possible number. And then you write off this huge number. So the IRS has had to create its own department of art appraisal to judge these appraisals. And guess what? They happen to disagree with the taxpayer 85 percent of the time because people exaggerate this. Here's another one I really like. You can do fractional giving. You can give a painting to a museum for three months, you know, while you're in your summer home in the south of France. And then you come home, you put it back on your dining room wall. And you get a deduction for that. So the thing is really grossly misused, and it doesn't serve its purpose. It doesn't enhance charitable contributions. So. . . GROSS: Can I do a yes, but here? REID: Yeah, do. GROSS: I think for corporations and for wealthy families, they often create foundations or funds that give generously to nonprofit arts and other organizations. And those donations really help keep those organizations going. And mathematically, part of the reason for that is the tax deduction. REID: Yeah. So here's my answer to your yes, but - they would give the money to charities that they like whether they got the deduction or not. I mean, what are they going to do? How many Bentleys can you buy? They have all this money. . . GROSS: Oh, things don't work that way (laughter). REID: They want to help somebody. GROSS: No, people want profits for their shareholders. But truly, don't you think, like, for corporations and for very wealthy families that the tax deduction really is an incentive for charitable giving? REID: Well, I think not. I think corporations want to help their community. And that's why they match, you know - they match gifts because they want to steer their giving to where their employees want to help. I think they do it out of eleemosynary impulse. They want to help others. And the reason I think I'm right is because in my book, you can look at all these countries that got rid of the charitable deduction, and charitable contributions kept going up at about the same rate that income went up. GROSS: I just want to clarify. I'm not saying that wealthy families and profitable, you know, corporations wouldn't give to charity. I just think there definitely is an incentive to do it. And it helps incentivize giving on that scale. REID: Well, I have to say the Council on Foundations and all charitable development officers would agree with you. But looking around the world, I would tell you, I think that's wrong, that people give money because they want to help. If you take away the tax deduction for a year or two, they may not, and then they do again. GROSS: So let's look at what the Trump administration is likely to be proposing, which includes lowering corporate taxes. So what do you know so far about what President Trump would like to see done? REID: Our current corporate tax is progressive. But most companies pay at the top rate - 35 percent. That's just about the highest rate in the world. American companies are being taxed higher than their competitors overseas. Nobody really pays the 35 percent. But even if you take the effective rate - that is, what people really pay - it's higher for American corporations than elsewhere. This is not working. Corporations spend tens of millions of dollars to find ways to move their profits somewhere else so they don't pay the tax. And the result is, even with this high rate of tax, the corporate income tax is now a pretty minor portion of government revenues. In the 1960s, one-third of all revenue came from the corporate income tax. Now it's about 8 percent because they've gotten so good at ducking it. So it's just not working. It's an unfair, competitive disadvantage. We really ought to cut it. And there are various proposals. The Democrats have proposed 35 percent down to 25 percent. The major House plan says 20 percent and Donald Trump, of course - 15 percent. GROSS: So would there be ways of insuring corporations actually paid it if you lowered the taxes? REID: Well, one theory is. . . GROSS: Because you're saying there's so many ways to duck out of paying the money. There's so many, like, exemptions. You can offshore the money. You could set up, you know, basically fake companies to get around paying taxes. REID: They all do. I mean, they're very good at it. I think any chief financial officer whoever paid the 35-percent tax rate would be fired the next morning. None of them does that. Yeah. Just like with the individual income tax, the corporate income tax is studded with loopholes and giveaways and exemptions and credits. There are laws passed by Congress because if you give enough money to your Congress person, she will put in the bill. And it's so obscure that most other people don't fight it. They want to - maybe want to do a favor for one of their constituents down the road. There are hundreds of them in there. And we could dump them. And if we dumped them, then we could lower the corporate income tax rate. You know, if you have to pay tax at 35 percent or even the effective rate about 26 percent, well then it's worth it to hire a lawyer or a consultant and spend millions to cut your tax bill. If we got a lower rate and got rid of all those giveaways, then companies would probably pay the tax because it would be cheaper than finding a way to avoid it. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is T. R. Reid, author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax. \" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is T. R. Reid author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax. \" It examines our tax codes and those of other countries to see if there are ways to overhaul our tax system to make it simpler, fairer and more efficient. So one of the things you found that a lot of countries have which we don't in America is the VAT, the value-added tax. Would you explain what the value-added tax is? REID: Yeah. This is the most important innovation in taxation in the last 60 years. This is a tax that's like a sales tax on steroids. It's a tax - our sales tax is called a retail sales tax. The tax is only collected when the retailer sells you the book. But on a value-added tax, a tax is collected when the paper mill sells the paper to the publisher and when a publisher buys ink from an ink company and then the publisher sells it to a wholesaler and a wholesaler sells it to a distributor, distributor to the bookstore and the bookstore to you. That tax is collected at every level, and every time you pay the tax to the other guy, you report it to the government to get a credit for the tax you paid which means every penny of tax that's paid is reported to the government. So the VAT turns out to be a very easy tax for government to collect and a very hard tax for taxpayers to avoid. And so if you put in a value-added tax, they're very steady collections, and it's hard to cheat on. And you could use that money to reduce the rate of the corporate or the personal income tax. So 176 countries have adopted this innovation. It's a great idea. The only countries that don't have it are a bunch of countries so poor they have no taxes and the United States of America. So I say in my book in taxation, Americans are still banging out letters on a typewriter and dropping them in a mailbox, and everybody else is texting and using Instagram. GROSS: One of the objections to the VAT in the U. S. is that it raises the price of goods because every stop along the way when the goods change hands in the production process and then the sales, there's a tax that's added so that - those taxes really mount up by the time you're purchasing the product. REID: That's a fair criticism. It does add to the price of things and creates some inflation, particularly when you first put it in. But as I said, you use those revenues to offset the income tax, so people pay less on April 15, so they have less withheld from their paycheck. And they come out fine. For the government, it's easier to collect so you need less bureaucracy collecting the tax. And here's the other thing. This is a tax that doesn't tax savings. It doesn't tax work, doesn't tax investment. It taxes spending, and economists like that. So that's why so many countries have it. I went to New Zealand, and they got around to it about 1994. And the finance minister said to me, you know, I knew we needed a VAT, but I couldn't call it a VAT. And the reason is every Kiwi who goes to Britain on vacation has to pay the value-added tax, and they hate the VAT. So he produced the same tax, but he called it the GST - the goods and services tax. And I said really? You tax services? He says, yeah, lawyers, interior designers, lawnmowers, you know, we tax all the services. GROSS: So one more thing about the VAT. It's not a progressive tax. Everybody pays it. So, you know, people who are poor are paying the same amount on goods and services as people who are rich. REID: Yeah. That's a real problem. It could be a problem. It's a regressive tax. There are two ways to deal with that. One is you exempt stuff that people need - food, medicine, textbooks, diapers, stuff like that - that makes the tax more complicated, but it's less regressive for lower-income people. I think the better way to deal with that is you charge the same tax for everything and then on the income tax, you give people credit at a certain income level for the VAT they paid. That would work and helps people out. But this is a reason why liberals don't like the VAT. They think it's regressive. As a matter of fact, in most countries, it doesn't work that way. Conservatives don't like the VAT because they call it - are you ready? - they call it the money machine. You can raise so much money with it that it bodes higher taxes. But, in fact, when you raise the money with the VAT, then you should use that revenue to lower the income tax rate. GROSS: My guest is journalist T. R. Reid, author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax System. \" After a break, we'll talk about the current politics of taxes as President Trump tries to move forward on his promise to overhaul the tax system. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with journalist T. R. Reid. His new book \"A Fine Mess\" is about America's complicated tax code and what other countries can teach us about how to make it simpler, fairer and more efficient. He's also been following President Trump's tax proposals and the reactions of Democrats and Republicans. From what you've heard so far, what stands out in what Republicans are discussing to propose in the tax plan? REID: Well, I think they're definitely going to cut the corporate tax rate. Now, everybody wants to do that, and it ought to be done. It makes sense. The question is whether they will pay for it - pay for the lost revenue by eliminating exemptions or with the border tax or something. You know, if you look at the history of what Congress does generally, they don't pay for it. They give tax breaks. They cut revenues and just add to the deficit. GROSS: So there's constantly calls in the world of tax overhaul to decrease capital gains tax. Could you explain how capital gains tax work? REID: Yeah. Let's say you're an executive at an auto company, and you're paid a salary. And, you know, if you're paid pretty well, you're going to pay up to the top rate of 39. 6 percent. That's labor income, and it's taxed at that rate. But if you make your money trading stock in auto companies, well, no matter how much you make, those people pay tax at a lower rate. For most people, the capital gains tax - top tax is 20 percent, about half the rate of a rich person on labor income. And the argument for it is what we - it's risky. It's risky to invest in a company, so we got to give people a tax break to encourage them to do it. And what I found around the world is some countries have a lower rate for capital gains. A few countries have no tax on capital gains, but most countries have leveled it off so that the tax on labor and the tax on capital income are the same. And guess what? There is no significant drop in investment or stock prices when you tax the same. GROSS: You refer to the BBLR - the broad based low rate approach to taxes. Explain what that means. REID: Well, I went to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and said to them what makes a good tax code? Who's got one? And they said we know, we know fairly simple formula - BBLR. That means broaden the base so you can lower the rates. Broaden the base means you make everything taxable. You got a paycheck. That's taxable. Your employer pays your health insurance premium. Well, that's income to you. We're going to tax that. Your employer gives you free parking. Well, that would cost 20 bucks a month. That's taxable. And then no deductions - you want to give money to charity? Boy, that's great. We're all for it, but we're not going to give you a tax break. You have a mortgage interest? Fine, but we're not going to give a tax break. And if you do that, that broadens the base, and then you can lower the rates way down. And several countries have done this, and there's a tradeoff. So people lose their cherished deduction. Oh my, God, don't broaden my base. I want my deduction. And the carrot is we're going to give you a lower rate. So in America, a family at the median income - if you take their income tax, their Social Security tax, their Medicaid tax and their health insurance - is paying about 35 percent. In New Zealand, income tax, social security, health care and education - 17. 5 percent for that same family. And the reason is they broadened the definition of income. They took away all the giveaways. And if you do that, you can get the rates way down. And it makes your tax return much easier. You don't have to fill in 50 lines on all the stuff you want for an exemption. GROSS: So who's tried that? REID: New Zealand did it. Australia did it. Britain did it in a pretty serious way. The Germans did it to a degree. Many countries are - South Korea - are moving in this direction because of two things. First, you get the lower rate, and if you have lower rates, people - compliance is better. People are more likely to pay a tax bill if it's 12 percent than if it's 40 percent. And second, it's much simpler. So that's the tradeoff. You get rid of cherished deductions, you get a lower rate. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist T. R. Reid. His new book is called \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax System. \" We're going to take a short break, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is T. R. Reid, author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax System. \" It examines our tax code and those of other countries to see if there are ways to overhaul our tax code to make it simpler, fairer and more efficient. So the people who write the tax codes, they're politicians. And there are competing political philosophies of what taxes should do, how high they should be, how big government which is supported by taxes should be. Can you describe some of the opposing philosophies of taxation that we're seeing played out now as a tax overhaul proposal is about to be presented? REID: Yes. Well, we saw part of that philosophical disagreement in the argument over the health bill. The question is how much role should government have in health care? How much role should government have in cleaning up the environment? How much role should government have in regulating businesses? And, you know, a lot of Americans really don't like the idea of big government. Get it out of my life. And if you cut the size of government, then theoretically you can cut the taxes that pay for government. GROSS: What are some of the opposing philosophies within the Republican Party right now? REID: Well, some Republicans want to sharply cut rates on individuals. Some say the thing to do is sharply cut rates on corporations. And in order to pay for that cut, we'd have to keep a fairly steady flow of income from individuals. Many Republicans think we should sharply cut or eliminate taxes on investment and capital gains because that generates the investment we need to grow the economy. Republicans are all over the map and guess what? So are Democrats. There's really not much consensus, but there was a time in the United States when we had consensus - 1986. GROSS: So what happened in 1986? REID: A Republican - conservative Republican president Ronald Reagan and a very liberal House of Representatives led by Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts agreed on a major change in U. S. taxes. And here's what they did. They took away all sorts of exemptions and deductions and that broadened the base, and then they were able to lower the rates. In the 1980s, the top marginal rate in income tax went from 70 percent to 28 percent, brought in the same revenue because they got rid of all the other stuff. In other words, the pain of losing the deductions was offset by the gain of the lower rates. And that's how you do tax reform. A guy in New Zealand told me when they rewrote their tax code, he said the most important thing was don't do it piece by piece. You got to do a big. You've got to do the whole thing. And then for everything somebody doesn't like in the change, there's something else they do. And you can pass it, and that's how the U. S. could do it. GROSS: You quote something that Donald Trump said before he became president which is that the U. S. is the highest taxed country in the world. Is that true? REID: That's an alternative fact, Terry. As a matter of fact, if you take the standard measure of tax burden - it's called overall tax burden - the United States is one of the lowest taxed of all the rich countries in the world. Overall tax burden - the International Monetary Fund computes this - you take all the federal, state and local taxes paid in the whole country, add them all up and take them as a percentage of GDP of overall wealth, by that measure of the 35 richest countries, the U. S. ranks 32nd. We pay much lower taxes. We pay lower gas taxes, tobacco taxes, income taxes, Social Security taxes, sales taxes than people in other countries. GROSS: And we don't have a value-added tax. REID: We don't have a VAT. If we did, our sales tax would presumably be higher. No, we're a low-tax and a low-effort - they describe it as low effort. If you don't collect much of the wealth in your country and tax, that's called low effort. I don't know if that makes anybody feel better as they're struggling with Form 1040, but you're paying less than a German would. You're paying less than a Brit would, even though it's harder to pay here. The places we're higher are the corporate income tax where we have almost the highest rate in the world, and the estate tax. This is a tax that's paid by rich people when they die, and their heirs have to pay the tax. If you remember critics have called this the death tax. But I think that's wrong because it's the living heir who pays. It's the lucky rich kid who did nothing and inherited 50 million bucks. GROSS: How much does your estate have to be worth before it you pay the estate tax? REID: If you're single - $5. 5 million dollars. If you're married and leave half of it to the spouse - $11 million. One in 70,000 Americans has to pay the estate tax. So I think it's a good tax. It doesn't tax labor. It doesn't tax investment. It only taxes lucky people who can afford to pay it. But interestingly, several countries that we would consider pretty lefty have eliminated the estate tax recently. Sweden has no estate tax. Canada got rid of the estate tax, and the slogan in Canada to dump the estate tax - I really like this - was no taxation without respiration. GROSS: So Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, is going to try to get through, you know, a tax overhaul in Congress. How would you describe his philosophy of taxation and how that's combined with his philosophy of government? REID: Yeah. Well, Paul Ryan, like many Republicans, wants a smaller government. There are a lot of things government does like providing health care that he thinks the private sector could probably do better. So he wants government to get out of the way, and he wants government to get out of our personal income and not tax it so much. And so he has a plan that would cut rates for all corporations and would cut rates for all individuals. So far, we have not seen in Paul Ryan's better-way plan how he would make up for the lost revenue. At the moment, it just seems to add to the deficit. But that's also contrary to Republican principles, so they need to come up with a way to broaden the base if they're going to lower the rates so they can bring in the same revenue. At the moment, that doesn't exist. And, you know, it's kind of the same pattern we saw on the health care reform, Terry. They had a plan, but the numbers never added up because they never really filled in all the blanks. And so far, that's the case with the Republican tax plan, too. GROSS: There are two impulses that seem to be in direct contradiction to impulses within the Republican Party and conservatives. One is cut taxes, and the other is cut the deficit that if you have less money coming in, the deficit is going to grow unless you cut a lot of government which is usually on the table, too. So I think it's fair to say that the Republican proposal will have cutting taxes, cutting the deficit and also cutting a lot of services and agencies in government. What do you think the biggest conflicts are going to be over? REID: Well, so far their plans don't cut the deficit because all the money they're saving on civilian agencies, they're putting into a bigger military. They're going to build a whole new aircraft carrier task force, et cetera. So far from what we've seen, they don't cut the deficit. President Trump released this budget outline, and it didn't say anything about revenues. It just said what they were going to spend. So we don't know. But so far, we don't see any plan to cut the deficit. Basically if you want to cut taxes for everybody, you can't cut the deficit. If you want to cut the deficit, you've got to keep your tax revenues the same. If you want to spend more on the military, it's very hard to cut the deficit. So, you know, Terry, we always get these plans on paper. I'm going to cut this. I'm going to cut that. The classic term is waste and fraud. We're going to cut waste and fraud, and that's going to magically balance the budget. I hate to say it, but it's never worked. GROSS: So Ted Cruz when he was running for president wanted to eliminate the IRS. Is that a popular proposal? Does that have any support? REID: When people say I'm going to eliminate the IRS, crowds cheer. I mean, it's ridiculous. Somebody is going to collect that tax. I mean, Ted Cruz wants to be paid for being a member of the Senate. Ted Cruz wants a strong military. We've got to pay for that some way. Taxes is how we pay for it, and somebody has to collect the tax. You could change the name - the People Service Bureau instead of the Internal Revenue Service, but somebody is going to be there whether you call it the IRS or not. GROSS: Has the IRS shrunken in recent years? REID: Yeah. I think this is really dumb. According to the IRS figures, they spend 35 cents for every $100 they bring in. In other words, it's the only federal agency that brings in more than it costs. You would think as a business proposition, you wouldn't cut your biggest profit center, right? Wouldn't you make it bigger and take in more? But to punish the IRS because Americans don't like taxes and Republicans particularly don't like taxes, they've been cutting the budget. The result is many fewer audits, fewer answers to taxpayer questions and much lower collections then we would have with a bigger staff. So I just don't see shrinking the IRS - you can't shrink the IRS and expect to bring in enough money to cut the deficit. Those two don't go together. GROSS: Are you concerned that in fixing the tax code we might fix it in a direction that will favor the rich more than they're favored now and will add to the debt? REID: That's how things seem to work in the United States because our Supreme Court - no other court in the world has said this - our Supreme Court has said that giving money is the same thing as free speech, and, therefore, it's hard to limit. And sure enough, rich people invest in politicians to get the things they want. But, you know, if you go back to 1986, although rich people got a much lower rate, they lost a lot of the goodies they used to have because Congress stood up to them and said the only way we can make our tax code work is to make it apply equally to everybody. So if we could get that mindset in the U. S. Congress and the White House, yeah, we could, but - I hate to say it - but generally in the U. S. Congress, rich people get what they want. GROSS: So if you were designing the tax code from scratch, what would it look like? REID: Our tax code would have virtually no exemptions, deductions, credits, giveaways, and therefore it would have very low rates, rates, say, from 5 to 12 or 15 percent for individuals, maybe 5 to 18 percent for corporations. We'd raise the same revenue because the base would be broader. And it would be much simpler to pay. I would have the IRS fill in the form for almost all taxpayers, so all you had to do is check the numbers and say, yeah. And then April 15 would be just another sunny spring day. And I think we definitely have to pick up this great new innovation - the value-added tax. It taxes consumption, not labor. It's easy to collect. It's hard to evade, and it lets you cut the rates of all the other taxes. GROSS: Well, I wish you good luck on filing your taxes. REID: (Laughter). GROSS: I wish that to our listeners as well. Thank you so much for talking with us. REID: Great to be on your air again. Thanks, Terry. GROSS: T. R. Reid is the author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer, And More Efficient Tax System. \" This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. It's tax time in two ways. While those of us who are last-minute folks are either trying to make sense of the often incomprehensible tax forms or paying someone else to do it for us, the Trump administration is trying to move forward on the president's promise to overhaul the tax system. So the timing is perfect for my guest T. R. Reid's new book, \"A Fine Mess. \" The mess he refers to is our bizarrely complicated tax code. The book compares our system with those of other countries in an attempt to figure out what a simpler, fairer and more efficient system might look like. Reid is a former Washington Post foreign correspondent and has lived with his family on three other continents. He has two previous books about subjects that remain urgent - the quest for better, cheaper and fairer health care and the future of the European Union. T. R. Reid, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So congratulations on writing a book about taxes that I can understand, unlike tax forms. . . T R REID: (Laughter) Thank you. GROSS: . . . Which I cannot understand. To get in the mood. . . REID: Yeah. GROSS: . . . For this conversation, I'd like you to quote one or two of your favorite incomprehensible tax instructions from the tax forms. REID: You know, I - I'm now doing my own taxes because I wrote a book about how hard it is. GROSS: Yeah? REID: Here's a gem - enter 6 percent of the smaller of line 40 or the value of your Archer MSAs on December 31, 2015, including 2015 contributions made in 2016. Include this amount on Form 1040, line 58A or Form 1040NR, line 56B. Pretty simple. GROSS: (Laughter) So this is why. . . REID: And it doesn't have to be that way. That's what's really galling. GROSS: You talk about countries where everybody does their taxes in, like, 15 minutes because it's that simple. REID: You know, I was in the Netherlands on March 31 - their tax day is April 1 - talking to a - you know, a manager. He makes about 200,000 a year. He has a whole panoply of investments, two kids in private schools, two mortgages. He'd have to fill out 12 forms in the United States. And I said, Michael, how do you do your taxes? They're due tomorrow. He says, well, I pop a beer. I go online and see if the government's got the numbers right. And if they do, I hit a button. Takes five minutes. He says, but you know, sometimes I start checking the numbers. You - he says, you know, you start checking the numbers, it could take almost half an hour just to pay your taxes. He was outraged. GROSS: Wow. So you have your new book on tax overhaul of the Republicans - are trying to figure out what their plan is going to be because there's different points of view within the party. But you think the time is really right for a true tax overhaul. You write that, like, every 30 or 32 years, the system is totally revised. That's not, like, part of the plan. It's just the way it's worked out. REID: That's right. It's history repeating itself. So we created the federal income tax in 1913 - very popular tax because the only people who paid it were the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts. And then it started - grew, the rates went way up to pay for World War I. In 1922, they wrote a pretty complete income tax code. By 1954, it was a mess. It had so many clauses and exclusions and exemptions that President Eisenhower said get rid of it. They rewrote the whole thing. That was the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. By 1986, same thing. It was a total mess. Nobody could handle it. Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, a conservative and a liberal, agreed to change it. They threw it out. That's the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If you look at the pattern there, that's every 32 years. And sure enough, we're now 31 years down the line and the thing is a total monster. It's a mess. Everybody knows we have to fix it, and the time has come. GROSS: So let's talk about some of the tax issues that directly affect individuals and families. We'll look at corporations a little later. President Trump - it's my understanding that he wants to lower personal income tax. What's his proposal for that? REID: Well, he wants to cut rates for all earners and particularly for people who run their own business. If you run your own business, at a certain point you're paying 39. 6 percent in income tax. His proposal would cut that to 15 percent. That's a huge boon for people who own their own company. How he's going to pay for it, he has never made clear. But there is a way to pay for this. I want to point this out, Terry. Other countries have found ways to cut the rates sharply and bring in the same revenue. And the way you do it is you get rid of all the loopholes and giveaways and escape clauses that have found their way into the tax code. GROSS: So getting back to how Trump wants to cut personal income taxes - like, if you're not the owner of your own business, has he proposed lower rates for individuals and families? REID: Well, I'll tell you the Donald Trump tax plan for individuals. I'll quote it to you - my tax plan will be so great it'll make your head spin. GROSS: (Laughter) And what percentage is that. . . REID: We don't know the numbers. GROSS: What are the percentages. . . REID: They - they're said to be working on a plan, but we don't know the numbers. There's a plan floating around the House that would make three rates - 5 percent, 10 percent and 20 percent. That would be a significant cut for most taxpayers. But, again, they don't say how they're going to pay for it, and you can't really cut those rates sharply without a huge loss of revenue unless you change other parts of the code. GROSS: So that's - that would be a progressive tax, but would the rich benefit more from that cut? REID: Yeah. If you're paying now at a 12-percent rate and they cut it to 10, that's a saving. But rich people are paying 39. 6 percent. If that gets cut to 20, their tax rate goes down by half. GROSS: So you say if we cut a lot of the deductions and the loopholes and the exclusions, we could afford to cut taxes and still be ahead of the game. So one of the things that's often on the table when people talk about ending deductions is the mortgage deduction, which sounds very upsetting because for everybody who owns a home, you can deduct - is it you deduct your mortgage or just the interest from the mortgage? REID: You deduct the interest, but you only do that if you take the itemized deduction. And only one-third of taxpayers take that. So for two-thirds of American taxpayers, even though it's there, they don't get it. And among homeowners, only 20 percent take the mortgage interest deduction. And, of course, they're the richest 20 percent. Terry, this deduction costs $103 billion a year. We offer it as a subsidy to the richest homeowners in America. And the argument is, well, we need this to enhance homeownership. No. No, as a matter of fact - Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, et cetera, they took away the mortgage interest deduction, and guess what? Higher rates of homeownership than we have. There's no indication at all that this thing does its purported purpose which is to enhance homeownership. And it's only people buying the most expensive homes who get this break. The net result, as I said, $103 billion a year we don't get that could reduce the deficit. GROSS: And do you challenge whether it's fair to give a break to homeowners and not to people who rent? REID: Well, that's another issue. Renters - they pay the mortgage of the landlord, but only the landlord gets the tax break. So, yeah, that's not fair either. And that's why, you know, it used to be every country had this deduction. And as I said, almost all the rich countries have gotten rid of it and no drop in homeownership rates. GROSS: So let's look at charitable deductions. That's something that you and many people question. Is it worth it? Is it worth it to the individuals who have the charitable deduction? Is it worth it to us as a culture who need taxes to fund the things we need done? So explain how charitable deductions work. REID: OK. To lead into that, could I just tell you some of the things - many things you get a write-off for in our tax code? You get a write-off for taking a night-school course, paying your property tax, growing sugar cane, moving to a new city, replanting a forest, destroying old farm equipment, employing Native Americans or buying a plug-in hybrid sports car like a Tesla. And we just are full of these things. And one of the biggest ones is the charitable contribution deduction. It costs the Treasury about $73 billion a year. Again, money that you could use for helping veterans or building a border. And it doesn't serve its purpose. There's no evidence anywhere that the charitable interest deduction enhances charitable contributions. For one thing, the most common form of contribution in the United States is when people put five bucks in the plate at church or 10 bucks in the collection box at the soccer club's dinner. And those are cash contributions. You can't write them off. They're not deductible. Many countries have gotten rid of the charitable deduction. And there's a pattern. For about one year or two years, there's a small blip - a drop in contributions. And after about three years, contributions keep going up at the rate of personal income going up. In other words, Terry, people give money to charities because they want to help others. To me, to give them a tax break for it, it just cheapens the charitable impulse. And also - here's one more thing. It is so subject to abuse. One of the biggest forms of charitable deduction is giving art to a museum. So you give an old picture to a museum. You hire an appraiser, and she knows that you and the Museum both want the highest possible number. And then you write off this huge number. So the IRS has had to create its own department of art appraisal to judge these appraisals. And guess what? They happen to disagree with the taxpayer 85 percent of the time because people exaggerate this. Here's another one I really like. You can do fractional giving. You can give a painting to a museum for three months, you know, while you're in your summer home in the south of France. And then you come home, you put it back on your dining room wall. And you get a deduction for that. So the thing is really grossly misused, and it doesn't serve its purpose. It doesn't enhance charitable contributions. So. . . GROSS: Can I do a yes, but here? REID: Yeah, do. GROSS: I think for corporations and for wealthy families, they often create foundations or funds that give generously to nonprofit arts and other organizations. And those donations really help keep those organizations going. And mathematically, part of the reason for that is the tax deduction. REID: Yeah. So here's my answer to your yes, but - they would give the money to charities that they like whether they got the deduction or not. I mean, what are they going to do? How many Bentleys can you buy? They have all this money. . . GROSS: Oh, things don't work that way (laughter). REID: They want to help somebody. GROSS: No, people want profits for their shareholders. But truly, don't you think, like, for corporations and for very wealthy families that the tax deduction really is an incentive for charitable giving? REID: Well, I think not. I think corporations want to help their community. And that's why they match, you know - they match gifts because they want to steer their giving to where their employees want to help. I think they do it out of eleemosynary impulse. They want to help others. And the reason I think I'm right is because in my book, you can look at all these countries that got rid of the charitable deduction, and charitable contributions kept going up at about the same rate that income went up. GROSS: I just want to clarify. I'm not saying that wealthy families and profitable, you know, corporations wouldn't give to charity. I just think there definitely is an incentive to do it. And it helps incentivize giving on that scale. REID: Well, I have to say the Council on Foundations and all charitable development officers would agree with you. But looking around the world, I would tell you, I think that's wrong, that people give money because they want to help. If you take away the tax deduction for a year or two, they may not, and then they do again. GROSS: So let's look at what the Trump administration is likely to be proposing, which includes lowering corporate taxes. So what do you know so far about what President Trump would like to see done? REID: Our current corporate tax is progressive. But most companies pay at the top rate - 35 percent. That's just about the highest rate in the world. American companies are being taxed higher than their competitors overseas. Nobody really pays the 35 percent. But even if you take the effective rate - that is, what people really pay - it's higher for American corporations than elsewhere. This is not working. Corporations spend tens of millions of dollars to find ways to move their profits somewhere else so they don't pay the tax. And the result is, even with this high rate of tax, the corporate income tax is now a pretty minor portion of government revenues. In the 1960s, one-third of all revenue came from the corporate income tax. Now it's about 8 percent because they've gotten so good at ducking it. So it's just not working. It's an unfair, competitive disadvantage. We really ought to cut it. And there are various proposals. The Democrats have proposed 35 percent down to 25 percent. The major House plan says 20 percent and Donald Trump, of course - 15 percent. GROSS: So would there be ways of insuring corporations actually paid it if you lowered the taxes? REID: Well, one theory is. . . GROSS: Because you're saying there's so many ways to duck out of paying the money. There's so many, like, exemptions. You can offshore the money. You could set up, you know, basically fake companies to get around paying taxes. REID: They all do. I mean, they're very good at it. I think any chief financial officer whoever paid the 35-percent tax rate would be fired the next morning. None of them does that. Yeah. Just like with the individual income tax, the corporate income tax is studded with loopholes and giveaways and exemptions and credits. There are laws passed by Congress because if you give enough money to your Congress person, she will put in the bill. And it's so obscure that most other people don't fight it. They want to - maybe want to do a favor for one of their constituents down the road. There are hundreds of them in there. And we could dump them. And if we dumped them, then we could lower the corporate income tax rate. You know, if you have to pay tax at 35 percent or even the effective rate about 26 percent, well then it's worth it to hire a lawyer or a consultant and spend millions to cut your tax bill. If we got a lower rate and got rid of all those giveaways, then companies would probably pay the tax because it would be cheaper than finding a way to avoid it. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is T. R. Reid, author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax. \" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is T. R. Reid author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax. \" It examines our tax codes and those of other countries to see if there are ways to overhaul our tax system to make it simpler, fairer and more efficient. So one of the things you found that a lot of countries have which we don't in America is the VAT, the value-added tax. Would you explain what the value-added tax is? REID: Yeah. This is the most important innovation in taxation in the last 60 years. This is a tax that's like a sales tax on steroids. It's a tax - our sales tax is called a retail sales tax. The tax is only collected when the retailer sells you the book. But on a value-added tax, a tax is collected when the paper mill sells the paper to the publisher and when a publisher buys ink from an ink company and then the publisher sells it to a wholesaler and a wholesaler sells it to a distributor, distributor to the bookstore and the bookstore to you. That tax is collected at every level, and every time you pay the tax to the other guy, you report it to the government to get a credit for the tax you paid which means every penny of tax that's paid is reported to the government. So the VAT turns out to be a very easy tax for government to collect and a very hard tax for taxpayers to avoid. And so if you put in a value-added tax, they're very steady collections, and it's hard to cheat on. And you could use that money to reduce the rate of the corporate or the personal income tax. So 176 countries have adopted this innovation. It's a great idea. The only countries that don't have it are a bunch of countries so poor they have no taxes and the United States of America. So I say in my book in taxation, Americans are still banging out letters on a typewriter and dropping them in a mailbox, and everybody else is texting and using Instagram. GROSS: One of the objections to the VAT in the U. S. is that it raises the price of goods because every stop along the way when the goods change hands in the production process and then the sales, there's a tax that's added so that - those taxes really mount up by the time you're purchasing the product. REID: That's a fair criticism. It does add to the price of things and creates some inflation, particularly when you first put it in. But as I said, you use those revenues to offset the income tax, so people pay less on April 15, so they have less withheld from their paycheck. And they come out fine. For the government, it's easier to collect so you need less bureaucracy collecting the tax. And here's the other thing. This is a tax that doesn't tax savings. It doesn't tax work, doesn't tax investment. It taxes spending, and economists like that. So that's why so many countries have it. I went to New Zealand, and they got around to it about 1994. And the finance minister said to me, you know, I knew we needed a VAT, but I couldn't call it a VAT. And the reason is every Kiwi who goes to Britain on vacation has to pay the value-added tax, and they hate the VAT. So he produced the same tax, but he called it the GST - the goods and services tax. And I said really? You tax services? He says, yeah, lawyers, interior designers, lawnmowers, you know, we tax all the services. GROSS: So one more thing about the VAT. It's not a progressive tax. Everybody pays it. So, you know, people who are poor are paying the same amount on goods and services as people who are rich. REID: Yeah. That's a real problem. It could be a problem. It's a regressive tax. There are two ways to deal with that. One is you exempt stuff that people need - food, medicine, textbooks, diapers, stuff like that - that makes the tax more complicated, but it's less regressive for lower-income people. I think the better way to deal with that is you charge the same tax for everything and then on the income tax, you give people credit at a certain income level for the VAT they paid. That would work and helps people out. But this is a reason why liberals don't like the VAT. They think it's regressive. As a matter of fact, in most countries, it doesn't work that way. Conservatives don't like the VAT because they call it - are you ready? - they call it the money machine. You can raise so much money with it that it bodes higher taxes. But, in fact, when you raise the money with the VAT, then you should use that revenue to lower the income tax rate. GROSS: My guest is journalist T. R. Reid, author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax System. \" After a break, we'll talk about the current politics of taxes as President Trump tries to move forward on his promise to overhaul the tax system. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with journalist T. R. Reid. His new book \"A Fine Mess\" is about America's complicated tax code and what other countries can teach us about how to make it simpler, fairer and more efficient. He's also been following President Trump's tax proposals and the reactions of Democrats and Republicans. From what you've heard so far, what stands out in what Republicans are discussing to propose in the tax plan? REID: Well, I think they're definitely going to cut the corporate tax rate. Now, everybody wants to do that, and it ought to be done. It makes sense. The question is whether they will pay for it - pay for the lost revenue by eliminating exemptions or with the border tax or something. You know, if you look at the history of what Congress does generally, they don't pay for it. They give tax breaks. They cut revenues and just add to the deficit. GROSS: So there's constantly calls in the world of tax overhaul to decrease capital gains tax. Could you explain how capital gains tax work? REID: Yeah. Let's say you're an executive at an auto company, and you're paid a salary. And, you know, if you're paid pretty well, you're going to pay up to the top rate of 39. 6 percent. That's labor income, and it's taxed at that rate. But if you make your money trading stock in auto companies, well, no matter how much you make, those people pay tax at a lower rate. For most people, the capital gains tax - top tax is 20 percent, about half the rate of a rich person on labor income. And the argument for it is what we - it's risky. It's risky to invest in a company, so we got to give people a tax break to encourage them to do it. And what I found around the world is some countries have a lower rate for capital gains. A few countries have no tax on capital gains, but most countries have leveled it off so that the tax on labor and the tax on capital income are the same. And guess what? There is no significant drop in investment or stock prices when you tax the same. GROSS: You refer to the BBLR - the broad based low rate approach to taxes. Explain what that means. REID: Well, I went to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and said to them what makes a good tax code? Who's got one? And they said we know, we know fairly simple formula - BBLR. That means broaden the base so you can lower the rates. Broaden the base means you make everything taxable. You got a paycheck. That's taxable. Your employer pays your health insurance premium. Well, that's income to you. We're going to tax that. Your employer gives you free parking. Well, that would cost 20 bucks a month. That's taxable. And then no deductions - you want to give money to charity? Boy, that's great. We're all for it, but we're not going to give you a tax break. You have a mortgage interest? Fine, but we're not going to give a tax break. And if you do that, that broadens the base, and then you can lower the rates way down. And several countries have done this, and there's a tradeoff. So people lose their cherished deduction. Oh my, God, don't broaden my base. I want my deduction. And the carrot is we're going to give you a lower rate. So in America, a family at the median income - if you take their income tax, their Social Security tax, their Medicaid tax and their health insurance - is paying about 35 percent. In New Zealand, income tax, social security, health care and education - 17. 5 percent for that same family. And the reason is they broadened the definition of income. They took away all the giveaways. And if you do that, you can get the rates way down. And it makes your tax return much easier. You don't have to fill in 50 lines on all the stuff you want for an exemption. GROSS: So who's tried that? REID: New Zealand did it. Australia did it. Britain did it in a pretty serious way. The Germans did it to a degree. Many countries are - South Korea - are moving in this direction because of two things. First, you get the lower rate, and if you have lower rates, people - compliance is better. People are more likely to pay a tax bill if it's 12 percent than if it's 40 percent. And second, it's much simpler. So that's the tradeoff. You get rid of cherished deductions, you get a lower rate. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist T. R. Reid. His new book is called \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax System. \" We're going to take a short break, and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is T. R. Reid, author of the new book \"A Fine Mess: A Global Quest For A Simpler, Fairer And More Efficient Tax System. \" It examines our tax code and those of other countries to see if there are ways to overhaul our tax code to make it simpler, fairer and more efficient. So the people who write the tax codes, they're politicians. And there are competing political philosophies of what taxes should do, how high they should be, how big government which is supported by taxes should be. Can you describe some of the opposing philosophies of taxation that we're seeing played out now as a tax overhaul proposal is about to be presented? REID: Yes. Well, we saw part of that philosophical disagreement in the argument over the health bill. The question is how much role should government have in health care? How much role should government have in cleaning up the environment? How much role should government have in regulating businesses? And, you know, a lot of Americans really don't like the idea of big government. Get it out of my life. And if you cut the size of government, then theoretically you can cut the taxes that pay for government. GROSS: What are some of the opposing philosophies within the Republican Party right now? REID: Well, some Republicans want to sharply cut rates on individuals. Some say the thing to do is sharply cut rates on corporations. And in order to pay for that cut, we'd have to keep a fairly steady flow of income from individuals. Many Republicans think we should sharply cut or eliminate taxes on investment and capital gains because that generates the investment we need to grow the economy. Republicans are all over the map and guess what? So are Democrats. There's really not much consensus, but there was a time in the United States when we had consensus - 1986. GROSS: So what happened in 1986? REID: A Republican - conservative Republican president Ronald Reagan and a very liberal House of Representatives led by Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts agreed on a major change in U. S. taxes. And here's what they did. They took away all sorts of exemptions and deductions and that broadened the base, and then they were able to lower the rates. In the 1980s, the top marginal rate in income tax went from 70 percent to 28 percent, brought in the same revenue because they got rid of all the other stuff. In other words, the pain of losing the deductions was offset by the gain of the lower rates. And that's how you do tax reform. A guy in New Zealand told me when they rewrote their tax code, he said the most important thing was don't do it piece by piece. You got to do a big. You've got to do the whole thing. And then for everything somebody doesn't like in the change, there's something else they do. And you can pass it, and that's how the U. S. could do it. GROSS: You quote something that Donald Trump said before he became president which is that the U. S. is the highest taxed country in the world. Is that true? REID: That's an alternative fact, Terry. As a matter of fact, if you take the standard measure of tax burden - it's called overall tax burden - the United States is one of the lowest taxed of all the rich countries in the world. Overall tax burden - the International Monetary Fund computes this - you take all the federal, state and local taxes paid in the whole country, add them all up and take them as a percentage of GDP of overall wealth, by that measure of the 35 richest countries, the U. S. ranks 32nd. We pay much lower taxes. We pay lower gas taxes, tobacco taxes, income taxes, Social Security taxes, sales taxes than people in other countries. GROSS: And we don't have a value-added tax. REID: We don't have a VAT. If we did, our sales tax would presumably be higher. No, we're a low-tax and a low-effort - they describe it as low effort. If you don't collect much of the wealth in your country and tax, that's called low effort. I don't know if that makes anybody feel better as they're struggling with Form 1040, but you're paying less than a German would. You're paying less than a Brit would, even though it's harder to pay here. The places we're higher are the corporate income tax where we have almost the highest rate in the world, and the estate tax. This is a tax that's paid by rich people when they die, and their heirs have to pay the tax. If you remember critics have called this the death tax. But I think that's wrong because it's the living heir who pays. It's the lucky rich kid who did nothing and inherited 50 million bucks. GROSS: How much does your estate have to be worth before it you pay the estate tax? REID: If you're single - $5. 5 million dollars. If you're married and leave half of it to the spouse - $11 million. One in 70,000 Americans has to pay the estate tax. So I think it's a good tax. It doesn't tax labor. It doesn't tax investment. It only taxes lucky people who can afford to pay it. But interestingly, several countries that we would consider pretty lefty have eliminated the estate tax recently. Sweden has no estate tax. Canada got rid of the estate tax, and the slogan in Canada to dump the estate tax - I really like this - was no taxation without respiration. GROSS: So Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, is going to try to get through, you know, a tax overhaul in Congress. How would you describe his philosophy of taxation and how that's combined with his philosophy of government? REID: Yeah. Well, Paul Ryan, like many Republicans, wants a smaller government. There are a lot of things government does like providing health care that he thinks the private sector could probably do better. So he wants government to get out of the way, and he wants government to get out of our personal income and not tax it so much. And so he has a plan that would cut rates for all corporations and would cut rates for all individuals. So far, we have not seen in Paul Ryan's better-way plan how he would make up for the lost revenue. At the moment, it just seems to add to the deficit. But that's also contrary to Republican principles, so they need to come up with a way to broaden the base if they're going to lower the rates so they can bring in the same revenue. At the moment, that doesn't exist. And, you know, it's kind of the same pattern we saw on the health care reform, Terry. They had a plan, but the numbers never added up because they never really filled in all the blanks. And so far, that's the case with the Republican tax plan, too. GROSS: There are two impulses that seem to be in direct contradiction to impulses within the Republican Party and conservatives. One is cut taxes, and the other is cut the deficit that if you have less money coming in, the deficit is going to grow unless you cut a lot of government which is usually on the table, too. So I think it's fair to say that the Republican proposal will have cutting taxes, cutting the deficit and also cutting a lot of services and agencies in government. What do you think the biggest conflicts are going to be over? REID: Well, so far their plans don't cut the deficit because all the money they're saving on civilian agencies, they're putting into a bigger military. They're going to build a whole new aircraft carrier task force, et cetera. So far from what we've seen, they don't cut the deficit. President Trump released this budget outline, and it didn't say anything about revenues. It just said what they were going to spend. So we don't know. But so far, we don't see any plan to cut the deficit. Basically if you want to cut taxes for everybody, you can't cut the deficit. If you want to cut the deficit, you've got to keep your tax revenues the same. If you want to spend more on the military, it's very hard to cut the deficit. So, you know, Terry, we always get these plans on paper. I'm going to cut this. I'm going to cut that. The classic term is waste and fraud. We're going to cut waste and fraud, and that's going to magically balance the budget. I hate to say it, but it's never worked. GROSS: So Ted Cruz when he was running for president wanted to eliminate the IRS. Is that a popular proposal? Does that have any support? REID: When people say I'm going to eliminate the IRS, crowds cheer. I mean, it's ridiculous. Somebody is going to collect that tax. I mean, Ted Cruz wants to be paid for being a member of the Senate. Ted Cruz wants a strong military. We've got to pay for that some way. Taxes is how we pay for it, and somebody has to collect the tax. You could change the name - the People Service Bureau instead of the Internal Revenue Service, but somebody is going to be there whether you call it the IRS or not. GROSS: Has the IRS shrunken in recent years? REID: Yeah. I think this is really dumb. According to the IRS figures, they spend 35 cents for every $100 they bring in. In other words, it's the only federal agency that brings in more than it costs. You would think as a business proposition, you wouldn't cut your biggest profit center, right? Wouldn't you make it bigger and take in more? But to punish the IRS because Americans don't like taxes and Republicans particularly don't like taxes, they've been cutting the budget. The result is many fewer audits, fewer answers to taxpayer questions and much lower collections then we would have with a bigger staff. So I just don't see shrinking the IRS - you can't shrink the IRS and expect to bring in enough money to cut the deficit. Those two don't go together. GROSS: Are you concerned that in fixing the tax code we might fix it in a direction that will favor the rich more than they're favored now and will add to the debt? REID: That's how things seem to work in the United States because our Supreme Court - no other court in the world has said this - our Supreme Court has said that giving money is the same thing as free speech, and, therefore, it's hard to limit. And sure enough, rich people invest in politicians to get the things they want. But, you know, if you go back to 1986, although rich people got a much lower rate, they lost a lot of the goodies they used to have because Congress stood up to them and said the only way we can make our tax code work is to make it apply equally to everybody. So if we could get that mindset in the U. S. Congress and the White House, yeah, we could, but - I hate to say it - but generally in the U. S. Congress, rich people get what they want. GROSS: So if you were designing the tax code from scratch, what would it look like? REID: Our tax code would have virtually no exemptions, deductions, credits, giveaways, and therefore it would have very low rates, rates, say, from 5 to 12 or 15 percent for individuals, maybe 5 to 18 percent for corporations. We'd raise the same revenue because the base would be broader. And it would be much simpler to pay. I would have the IRS fill in the form for almost all taxpayers, so all you had to do is check the numbers and say, yeah. And then April 15 would be just another sunny spring day. And I think we definitely have to pick up this great new innovation - the value-added tax. It taxes consumption, not labor. It's easy to collect. It's hard to evade, and it lets you cut the rates of all the other taxes. GROSS: Well, I wish you good luck on filing your taxes. REID: (Laughter). GROSS: I wish that to our listeners as well. Thank you so much for talking with us. REID: Great to be on your air again. Thanks, Terry. GROSS: T. R.

It turns out the culprit was a high-ranking Fed official, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank. Lacker acknowledged the breach today and resigned. NPR's John Ydstie joins us now to talk about this scandal that has dogged the Fed for nearly five years, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Right. SIEGEL: This has been a long-running mystery with multiple investigations. Bring us up to date on it. YDSTIE: Well, it all began at the regular Fed meeting back in September of 2012. There was a discussion back then about whether the Fed should expand its bond buying program to stimulate the economy. At the meeting, the Fed decided to buy another $40 billion worth of bonds. And it discussed buying even more at the next meeting in December. Now, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, was present during both those meetings. Now, after the September meeting, a newsletter published by the Wall Street firm Medley Global Advisors said there was a strong possibility the Fed would buy a similar amount of bonds at the December meeting. And that's just exactly what happened. SIEGEL: And today we learned that between the two Fed meetings, Lacker had a phone conversation with an analyst from Medley Global Advisors. YDSTIE: Right. And in his letter of resignation today, Lacker says that during that conversation he may have inadvertently confirmed that the Fed was going to add billions more to its stimulus program in December. SIEGEL: John, I assume that one concern here is that Medley subscribers would have gotten an unfair advantage and could have traded on and profited from that confidential information. YDSTIE: Right, Robert. And, in fact, regulators have a separate investigation into that possibility. But the Fed was also concerned about its reputation as an institution of high ethical standards. After all, it has all kinds of confidential information that can move markets and impact financial institutions, so it needs to be viewed as trustworthy and above reproach. SIEGEL: Well, is there any evidence that Mr. Lacker might have been trying to profit from this or affect policy by doing this? YDSTIE: No. But it is interesting that in his letter, Lacker admits when he was questioned back in 2012 during an internal Fed investigation he failed to disclose these compromising details of the conversation he had with the analysts from Medley Global Advisors. But more recently in 2015, he did decide to disclose those details in a conversation with investigators from the FBI. SIEGEL: What do you make of the fact that his story evidently changed between 2012 and 2015? YDSTIE: Well, the way Lacker describes the situation suggests he really agonized about this. In his letter, Lacker says the Medley analyst introduced into their conversation this confidential information that the Fed was going to buy more bonds in December, you know, the way journalists sometimes fish for confirmation or a denial. Lacker said at that point he should have just said no comment and hung up the phone. Instead, he allowed the conversation to go on. And the analyst apparently took it as a confirmation. Lacker says he deeply regrets what happened and that he never intended to reveal the confidential information. SIEGEL: Is he now subject to prosecution? YDSTIE: Well, not according to his lawyer, who issued a statement today saying we've been informed that the investigation of Dr. Lacker is complete and no charges will be brought against him. SIEGEL: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Robert.

Lacker says he deeply regrets what happened and that he never intended to reveal the confidential information. SIEGEL: Is he now subject to prosecution? YDSTIE: Well, not according to his lawyer, who issued a statement today saying we've been informed that the investigation of Dr. Lacker is complete and no charges will be brought against him. SIEGEL: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Robert. (SOUNDBITE OF ANTIBALAS SONG, \"SI, SE PUEDE\")", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF RALLY)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they're doing. It's the greatest theft in the history of the world. MARTIN: So today, President Trump has a chance to express that sentiment directly to China's president, Xi Jinping, if he so chooses. Trump is hosting him at Mar-a-Lago. Here's what the president tweeted about the talks. The meeting, he said, will be very difficult because America can no longer have, quote, \"massive trade deficits and job losses. \" Trump also signed an executive order commissioning a review of the causes and effects of trade deficits. Charles Freeman was a trade negotiator under President George W. Bush, and I asked him if there are still unsettled questions about the costs and benefits of trade deficits. CHARLES FREEMAN: I think any serious economist that has followed the trade debates over the years doesn't have questions about why we have trade deficits and what's wrong with them, what's good about them. But certainly the American public has a lot of questions about trade deficits. The American public probably doesn't really understand, you know, if we're running a $300 billion trade deficit with China, how are we not losing to China? MARTIN: What's the answer to that? It is a lot of money. FREEMAN: It's a lot of money but remember, I mean, we're getting something back for that money. And the Chinese are largely plowing the profits from that trade deficit back into the U. S. economy. So it actually does kind balance out. And there are a lot of nuances. But, by and large, the notion that a bilateral trade deficit, you know, what I sell to you and - that I don't buy anything back, that's not a real good indicator of a relative economic success or failure between countries. It just isn't. MARTIN: Yet then-candidate Trump tried to tie those together at every turn, talking about how China is manipulating its currency and that that is in some way responsible for the trade deficit that the U. S. is running against China. He promised to label China a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency. He hasn't done that yet. Why not, do you think? FREEMAN: Probably because China isn't manipulating its currency right now in the sense of trying to gain an unfair trade advantage by reducing the value of its currency. Since 2014, actually, China has been intervening massively to try to keep the value of the renminbi - the Chinese currency - up relative to the U. S. dollar. MARTIN: What would be the implications if Donald Trump did attempt to label China a currency manipulator? What does that even mean in practical terms? FREEMAN: In practical terms frankly, not much. Ultimately, it's - there's no action that one can take. MARTIN: Trade between the U. S. and China is something that has evolved through governing processes, international trade agreements. So Donald Trump comes in. He's a disrupter. That's part of his brand. But how much power does the executive branch really have to irrevocably change America's trade relationship with China? FREEMAN: Well, it can - the executive branch can really do a lot of damage by, you know, canceling trade agreements, bringing back some of the trade laws that we had, trade rules that we had back in the past before China joined the WTO, before we joined the WTO. So there are things that can be done. They wouldn't be WTO legal, but that doesn't seem to bother the president that much if it's perceived to be putting America first. MARTIN: It could violate the World Trade Organization, but. . . FREEMAN: Of course, yeah, very clearly, but. . . MARTIN: . . . Then what does that mean? What are the implications of that? FREEMAN: Well, that means that other countries can retaliate against us, and we end up with a trade war. And that's not good for anybody. MARTIN: Where do you think President Trump could and should pressure China on trade? FREEMAN: Well, the big challenge that we have with China right now is China's gone down the road in the last few years of being a very serious employer of industrial policies, trying to boost their domestic industries at the expense of foreign competition. And that's really where we have the biggest challenge. And that, frankly, is in places like higher technology, semiconductors. And then the really competitive parts of the U. S. economy, China's now trying to go head-to-head with us and doing it in ways that really are not consistent with, quote, \"market principles. \"MARTIN: Because they can give a company a subsidy. There are no real market effects to a corporation that fails. FREEMAN: Correct. There's very - there's, I mean, it's a rigged economy. MARTIN: Which makes it difficult for the U. S. and China to ever play by the same ground rules because we're not. FREEMAN: Correct. Correct. MARTIN: You negotiated with the Chinese under President Bush, as we've noted. What is your advice as a negotiator to Donald Trump in this moment? FREEMAN: The impossible - listen. Just don't speak first, let the other side put its issues on the table and see what you like and what you don't like. But listen, don't speak. American negotiators, Americans generally, we like to fill up the silence with our ideas. And, frankly, that lets the other side cherry pick what you like and what you don't like. So it may be difficult for this president to practice silence. But that's probably the best advice I can give him or anybody else in dealing with the Chinese. MARTIN: Charles Freeman was a U. S. trade negotiator from 2002 to 2005 in the George W. Bush administration. He is now managing director at BowerGroupAsia, a consulting firm. Thanks so much for your time today.

That's where we hear from people who are charting new paths in a changing economy. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I was a underground coal miner. Now I'm in paramedic school. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Free porn has completely killed the industry as we know it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The black market is filled with people of color just like the prison that I was in. MARTIN: This week's story comes from Lubbock, Texas. Ever since he was a little kid growing up in West Texas, Lanny Copeland knew that he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps as a cowboy and ranch manager. He says it was never about the money. LANNY COPELAND: Cowboys historically don't make much money. I remember my first ranch job. I was making probably eleven or $1,200 a month. Of course, that comes with a house, and, you know, all the beef you can eat. But it's not a whole bunch of money coming into your checking account every month. MARTIN: Just like his father, Lanny Copeland spent much of his career wrangling cattle for other owners until finally in the mid-'90s, Copeland and his dad were given the opportunity to fulfill their lifelong dream of buying out their bosses and running an operation all their own. COPELAND: To have something of our own, I think, was, man, the greatest feeling in the world to me. And I think to daddy as well because he developed this herd of cattle, and he had managed this land for so long. And then to have an opportunity to go in there and take that same country and cattle and make a run at it, I think was one of the greatest, most exciting times in my life. To be honest, the odds are stacked against you pretty big, so I was scared to death. Daddy probably was, too, but he didn't let me see if he was. And we did learn, you know, that even with the best herd you can raise, man, if the weather didn't cooperate, it may not matter. Ten, 11 years in, we went through a pretty serious drought where it just never hardly rained. I think one of the hardest things of watching a ranch go through a drought is watching your cattle lose weight. Everyone suffers, you know, from the cattle to the cowboys to the owners - everything suffers some. I remember a lot of days just, you know, hoping to see a thunderhead pop up in the Southwest. And I don't know how many times those storms would pop up in those hot early summer days. And you could see it raining 10 miles away, and it looked like it was moving toward you, and, man, it would hit your fence line and all of a sudden just dissipate. And, man, it would break your heart. The writing on the wall - I remember very well I didn't want to face it because, man, this was my dream, you know? And this is my dad's dream, but we started selling off everything that we could sell off. I found myself at 44 years old really wondering what in the world am I going to do now? Because this was pretty much all I've ever done. Sometime in late winter of '08 - came across an ad that was talking about a job fair for wind energy. I though, well, I'm just going to go check that out. You know, I might be one of five or six people there, and this could be a good thing. So I showed up, and there were about 140 guys all packed into a little room, all interested in wind energy, and I felt pretty old in that room because there were a lot of 25-year-old guys with applications in their hand. And I started thinking about, well, I'm not sure about this. I remembered in my interview a guy saying what do you think about climbing these towers? You know, I mean, you think you're going to be able to do that? And I remember telling him I'll try, and I'll do everything I can, but I'm going to tell you straight up I have no idea if I can do it. Didn't like heights much anyway, and I said, yeah, we'll see. So I remember going out, and they handed us all a harness, and we put it on and went to a turbine and that was the longest ladder I'd ever seen in my life. First thing they did when we got to the top of the turbine was open that hatch up, you know, stepping up onto the main shaft, immediately, I mean, the first thing that struck me was, man, you can see for miles up here. And we happened to be climbing the turbine that was situated in a pasture on some ranch land. So to me it was like, man, that - I've never seen, you know, ranch country from this perspective before. And you can see, you know, turbines for miles. You can see farmland for miles. You can see people driving down county roads and highways miles away, the wind kind of blowing. I remember thinking that not very many people have ever done this. This is the future. I mean, wind energy is the future. I had a really strong feeling once that climb test was done that this was really something that I could do. MARTIN: Lanny Copeland did pass that wind turbine climb test. Now he oversees two wind farms and 27 wind technicians in West Texas. Earlier this year, wind turbine technician was named the fastest growing job in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Lanny Copeland spoke to us for our series Brave New Workers about people adapting to a changing economy. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now it's time for another installment in our series Brave New Workers.

But this week's fiasco for United highlights a problem that airlines face every day, it's how to entice people to give up their seats voluntarily. NPR's Chris Arnold has been talking to people who study what is called game theory. And they think the industry could be doing a much better job. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: You've got a hundred seats on an airplane but you've sold 105 tickets and everybody actually showed up to fly on the plane. It's a problem. But it's actually also a game if you look at it that way. JOSHUA GANS: Yeah, this is exactly a game theory-type problem. ARNOLD: Joshua Gans is a professor of strategic management at the University of Toronto. GANS: The airline wants some people off the plane. Every single person on the plane wants to stay on. ARNOLD: I guess it's fair to say that United Airlines, in this most recent case, did not play this game very well. GANS: Yes, absolutely. I mean, it just - everything should be designed so that that just never happens. ARNOLD: We should say that airlines overall are getting better at this. Fewer travelers are involuntarily bumped from their flights by the airlines, though last year it was still about 41,000 people. And game theory experts say that there are several things the airlines could do to play the overbooked flight game much better. Number one, don't let passengers board the plane and then try to take their seats away. KEVIN ZOLLMAN: You tend to value something more once you have it. ARNOLD: Kevin Zollman is a philosophy professor at Carnegie Mellon who studies game theory. And he says this is called the endowment effect. And there are studies that show that if I ask you how much you'd pay for, say, a coffee mug, you might say five bucks. But if I give you the coffee mug and then I say hey, I want that coffee mug, how much will you sell it to me for, you're probably going to say something more like 10 bucks - same thing with airplane seats. ZOLLMAN: Once the people got on the plane and sat down, now that's my seat. I'm sitting in it. And so then to ask me to give up my seat would require more. ARNOLD: So when airlines offer passengers, say, $800 to give up their seat, that's going to work a lot better in the airport terminal. And if passengers are sitting on the plane, the airline should know that it needs to offer a lot more money. OK. Number two, Zollman says don't make the offer in such a public way. He says most airlines. . . ZOLLMAN: They make this big announcement where they say would anybody be willing to give up your seat for $400? The problem there is humans are really sensitive to being suckers. ARNOLD: And Zollman says there are some people who would be willing to give up their seat for a $400 ticket voucher, but. . . ZOLLMAN: Everyone looks around and everyone sees, well, nobody else is doing it, so I must be a sucker if I do it. So I'm not going to do it, either. ARNOLD: Analysts say Delta is one airline that's starting to ask passengers when they check in whether they'd give up their seat, sometimes asking them how much they would want in exchange. Zollman says that's a much better approach. And technology could help. Everybody has a cellphone. We get text messages telling us if our flight's delayed. ZOLLMAN: Text message would be a really good way to do this. ARNOLD: Actually, an analyst we talked to said at least one airline is trying this with text messages. And Zollman says airlines could get a lot more passengers in on the game and willing to play if they started with a high number and worked their way down from there. He says if an airline texted him and offered him $2,000 to give up his seat, if he didn't really need to get to where he was going on time, he'd say yes. ZOLLMAN: So now I'm engaged in the process. Hopefully I'm going to win it at $2,000. Too many people took the deal, so now they're bumping it down to 1,500. Well, that's still pretty good. I'll still take that. And so by getting people engaged in the process and active from the beginning, I think that would go a long way to making people feel like now it's a competition or a game. ARNOLD: And that would give the airlines a key piece of information. People who won't even consider a lot of money, they might really need to get to where they're going - a job interview or their best friend's wedding or to be with a sick parent in the hospital. Even if the person doesn't scream and get dragged off bleeding, those are probably people you don't want to bump if you can help it. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

And there are studies that show that if I ask you how much you'd pay for, say, a coffee mug, you might say five bucks. But if I give you the coffee mug and then I say hey, I want that coffee mug, how much will you sell it to me for, you're probably going to say something more like 10 bucks - same thing with airplane seats. ZOLLMAN: Once the people got on the plane and sat down, now that's my seat. I'm sitting in it. And so then to ask me to give up my seat would require more. ARNOLD: So when airlines offer passengers, say, $800 to give up their seat, that's going to work a lot better in the airport terminal. And if passengers are sitting on the plane, the airline should know that it needs to offer a lot more money. OK. Number two, Zollman says don't make the offer in such a public way. He says most airlines. . . ZOLLMAN: They make this big announcement where they say would anybody be willing to give up your seat for $400? The problem there is humans are really sensitive to being suckers. ARNOLD: And Zollman says there are some people who would be willing to give up their seat for a $400 ticket voucher, but. . . ZOLLMAN: Everyone looks around and everyone sees, well, nobody else is doing it, so I must be a sucker if I do it. So I'm not going to do it, either. ARNOLD: Analysts say Delta is one airline that's starting to ask passengers when they check in whether they'd give up their seat, sometimes asking them how much they would want in exchange. Zollman says that's a much better approach. And technology could help. Everybody has a cellphone. We get text messages telling us if our flight's delayed. ZOLLMAN: Text message would be a really good way to do this. ARNOLD: Actually, an analyst we talked to said at least one airline is trying this with text messages. And Zollman says airlines could get a lot more passengers in on the game and willing to play if they started with a high number and worked their way down from there. He says if an airline texted him and offered him $2,000 to give up his seat, if he didn't really need to get to where he was going on time, he'd say yes. ZOLLMAN: So now I'm engaged in the process. Hopefully I'm going to win it at $2,000. Too many people took the deal, so now they're bumping it down to 1,500. Well, that's still pretty good. I'll still take that. And so by getting people engaged in the process and active from the beginning, I think that would go a long way to making people feel like now it's a competition or a game. ARNOLD: And that would give the airlines a key piece of information. People who won't even consider a lot of money, they might really need to get to where they're going - a job interview or their best friend's wedding or to be with a sick parent in the hospital. Even if the person doesn't scream and get dragged off bleeding, those are probably people you don't want to bump if you can help it. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

He has darkened his view of Russia and said NATO is no longer obsolete. And then there are his changes on economic policy, which we're going to talk about next. Candidate Trump said he would designate China a currency manipulator on day one. This week, the president said his administration will not do that after all. He has also changed his view of the Export-Import Bank and also now perhaps on who should head the Federal Reserve. What's happening here? Here's NPR's John Ydstie. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Over and over during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump pilloried China for manipulating its currency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to instruct my treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, the greatest in the world. YDSTIE: But this week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said about China, quote, \"they're not currency manipulators. \" Trump's new view of China aligned him with the mainstream conclusion that China stopped manipulating its currency to boost exports several years ago, well before Trump's statements to the contrary during the campaign. But Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, says Trump's opposing characterizations of China are both justified. DEREK SCISSORS: So it's legitimate as a candidate to run against the history of Chinese action because that affects the American people. But as president, you have to deal with what's going on now. And with what's going on now, China is not a currency manipulator right now. YDSTIE: The timing of Trump's change in views was likely related to an annual report on trade manipulators due from the Treasury Department this weekend says Dean Baker of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. DEAN BAKER: I don't have any, you know, advanced knowledge of the report but I'm assuming it will not be labeling China as a manipulator. And he had to lay the groundwork for that 'cause during the campaign he made that his commitment. As soon as I get in office, we're going to label China a manipulator and take action against them. YDSTIE: Baker says he's a little disappointed that Trump seems to be dropping the currency issue. Baker believes China still manages its currency in a way that perpetuates huge trade imbalances with the U. S. and hurts U. S. manufacturing. BAKER: We can't reverse history. We can't get back to where we were 20 years ago and bring back all the jobs that were lost in Michigan, Ohio and these other states. But we could make a difference if we had something closer to balanced trade. YDSTIE: Also this week, Trump reversed his view of the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that provides loan guarantees to finance U. S. exports. During the campaign, he complained the bank wasn't supporting free enterprise because it was unfairly subsidizing exports from big companies like Boeing, G. E. and Caterpillar. But on Wednesday, Trump told the Journal he no longer wants to eliminate the Ex-Im Bank. Baker says Trump is no doubt getting an earful on this matter from the CEOs he's been inviting to the White House. BAKER: These large firms are all politically powerful. And when you're actually sitting there at the White House, they're talking to you. YDSTIE: Derek Scissors believes Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs who is Trump's top White House economic adviser, has probably helped move Trump to a more mainstream business view on the bank. SCISSORS: They want the government involved in certain financial deals. And the free market types - which includes me, by the way - don't want the government involved because the Export-Import Bank doesn't spread the money evenly. It chooses certain companies to support. YDSTIE: As for Trump's suggestion that he could still reappoint Janet Yellen to another term as Federal Reserve chair, something he said before he wouldn't do, well, after accusing Yellen of keeping rates low to help President Obama, Trump said he'd like to see interest rates kept low for him, too.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I was a underground coal miner. Now I'm in paramedic school. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Free porn has completely killed the industry as we know it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I still see myself as a cowboy. Yeah, I do, and I hope always do. SUAREZ: This week's story comes to us from Alex Perry in Seattle, Wash. When Perry's first career took a nosedive, he had to find another job, but no one from his old life knows quite what to make of his new career. ALEX PERRY: They'll call me and say, Alex, I heard this weird rumor about you. And I go, well, what's that? They said I heard you're a cat groomer. And I go, yeah, that's what I do. SUAREZ: That's right. You can groom a cat, and we'll hear what that entails in a few minutes. But first, let's talk about his old life. Perry used to make his living in construction, and until 2008, business was booming. PERRY: Well, just about anybody could get a loan - I think we all remember - and everybody was remodeling. It was a good time to be in construction. It wasn't all great. There are a lot of times when I was crawling through crawl spaces over, you know, rat feces and crawling through insulation. And I mean the old school insulation that when it gets on you, it just starts itching, and it gets down your pants - yeah. But the money was good, and I was young so it didn't bother me. I think my favorite part of the whole thing was just kind of hanging out with the guys. You made a lot of friends. We were going out to dinner a lot, dirt bike riding. Everybody had a nice truck. It was good times. I started to get a feeling in about 2008. I was seeing that this whole housing bubble couldn't last forever, and this was the beginnings of things kind of starting to take a turn. It was definitely much harder to get jobs. I felt like I was working to make about $12 an hour for work that I used to get, you know, 50 to $60 an hour to do. It was very demoralizing (laughter). I think in 2011, I had talked to my business partner, and we both said this wasn't worth it anymore. And we couldn't sell the company, so we just kind of sold off the assets. I just kind of quit everything, and for the first two weeks, it was absolutely wonderful. No more headaches, no more phone calls. But you know sitting home and watching TV in your underwear is only fun for so long. I would say about week four I really kind of start to feel like a loser. And then I really started thinking hard about what I was going to do next. So I used to have this cat named Gizmo. She was beautiful. She's one of those cats that got by on her looks. She was a silver Himalayan. One day, my neighbor was changing his motor oil, and she decided to go take a nap in the used motor oil pan. She was a mess. So I quickly had to find myself a cat groomer so I found one, took her in there. They got her all scrubbed up, and I watched the process. And I was just - I was fascinated by it, and I started to think, hey, maybe I could do this for a living. With cats, you always got to watch for nipples. Some cats have really tall nipples, even though - even the boys, so you got to be careful about what angle you go so you don't nick the nipples. My very first day, I was working on a big Maine Coon. I was watching him in the tub. Maine Coons are usually very nice. It's very rare that I get a mean Maine Coon, but this one decided to just bite me right in the gut. And I made the mistake of pulling away, and I got the big tear right in my belly. I really think the owner thought I would quit, but I didn't. Then I stuck with it for the full week. At the end of the week, the owner said, well, what do you think? And I said I love it. So that's just the rough shave. We aren't going for perfection here. We're just trying to get the majority of the hair off before we go in the bath. The base price is $85, and that's for a bath and a groom. The bath and a groom - I clean the ears, cut the nails, express the anal glands, your cat gets a double shampooing, a complete brushing out. And when I say brushing out, it's not like anything anybody does at home. It looks like it's snowing cat hair in my grooming room. When I'm done, a comb will go through your cat like a hot knife through butter. It just glides through. All the hairs are separated. People ask, you know, well, how do you bathe a cat? The short answer is quickly. The oatmeal's going to gently scrub the skin to get a lot of that dander off. It's hard work. I'd put it right up there with construction as far as the difficulty of the work. I'm just about done. I promise. Some people have a gentle touch, and some people don't. I just feel very relaxed around cats. I like to wrap them in microfiber cloth, and we roll them in the beach towel. And we make a little purr-ito (ph). You know, I always hear people talk about follow your passion, do something that really brings joy to your life for a living, and I feel lucky because I am now finally one of those people that I do what I enjoy for a living. And I'm able to maintain a decent lifestyle doing it. SUAREZ: Alex Perry is a professional cat groomer in Seattle, Wash.

I think of myself first and foremost as a businessperson, and the newer role of activist is still taking shape for me. WESTERVELT: But last fall, the 45-year-old was outraged by Donald Trump's comments about women - you know, the one where he said you can do anything when you're a star, grab them by the genitals. It was picked up by a hot mic on \"Access Hollywood. \" Back then, Coulter tweeted a screenshot of a handful of companies that sell Trump family products. The boycott was born. Today, #GrabYourWallet's simple spreadsheet on a website of the same name gets more than 2 million unique views a month - not bad for an organization with no budget, no employees and no permanent office. Coulter met me in a rent-by-the-day office in downtown San Francisco. There are now more than 50 companies she encourages people to boycott because they sell Trump products or because a member of the company's board has backed Trump's campaign. COULTER: If you're going to give money to the campaign of a guy who makes fun of disabled people, who questions the nationality of our country's first black president, who likes to grab women by the genitals, you are going to raise the ire of consumers.

It's not clear what, if any, economic impact the boycott is having. Studies show these consumer protests often have a limited effect on a company's bottom line and long-term corporate policies. But a brand's reputation can take a hit. Coulter's success metric for this isn't a company's stock price or quarterly sales. It's how many companies have been taken off the boycott list. So far, it's about two dozen, including Nordstrom, Kmart and Neiman Marcus. COULTER: Some have made public statements and some haven't. For our purposes, it doesn't really matter why a company has dropped Trump products, only that they have. WESTERVELT: More than 50 companies remain boycott targets, including Amazon, MillerCoors, Wal-Mart and L. L. Bean. We reached out to more than a dozen companies. All declined to comment, except for MillerCoors. Pete Coors, a board member of the parent company, has actively supported Trump. In a statement, the company said, boycotting our brands only harms our hardworking employees and their families. Coulter says one sure sign of the boycott's broader impact is the speed with which dozens of companies quickly stopped advertising on Bill O'Reilly's Fox News show in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against the host. COULTER: There's just a lot of appetite right now to understand how we, as consumers, can use our spending power to promote inclusivity and respect in our society. WESTERVELT: Coulter is now talking with a wide range of people about how to morph this movement into a wider, nonprofit vehicle for taking on Trump and advocating for broader corporate social responsibility. COULTER: It feels like this movement wants to be something more than it is today. There's a lot of momentum behind this. There's a lot of activity around it still, and I want to leverage that into something larger.

There's a lot of activity around it still, and I want to leverage that into something larger. WESTERVELT: For now, Coulter will continue to encourage Trump opponents to see daily shopping as a deeply political act. Eric Westervelt, NPR News, San Francisco.

I asked if it was nuclear power, and the driver laughed. He said no, any power other than coal would not be well-received in Kentucky, which is a coal-producing state. That was a long time ago, and times change. Today, some big employers in Kentucky want power from renewable energy. They want renewable energy even as the Trump administration pushes to promote coal. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports on a coal state that is thinking about solar. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Kevin Butt's job is to find cleaner ways to power Toyota. This sprawling plant in central Kentucky is one of the hardest places to do that, but he's trying. KEVIN BUTT: This is a new engine assembly line. And this has a tremendous amount of energy efficiency involved. LUDDEN: Butt points out enormous fans overhead, LED lights, a more efficient motor that slowly moves a circular conveyor belt. He says all these changes save millions. BUTT: I mean, what company doesn't want to reduce their energy bill? LUDDEN: That's the business case for going green. And in a lot of places around the country, solar and wind are now the cheapest energy option. But by 2050, Toyota wants all of its operations all around the world to be zero-carbon. Is that realistic? BUTT: I think it is. LUDDEN: Toyota's not alone in Kentucky. GM, Ford, Wal-Mart, L'Oreal and others have big goals to reduce emissions. Even the state's beloved bourbon makers are looking at renewables, which are scarce. BUTT: There's not enough renewable energy being manufactured right now for all of us to do what we say we want to do. I mean, it's just not there. You don't have that amount of power. LUDDEN: It's especially not there here in Kentucky, where nearly 90 percent of energy still comes from coal - where people like to say coal isn't just the economy, it's the culture. CHARLES SNAVELY: We're a coal state. We're proud to be a coal state. We're sentimental about our attachment to coal. LUDDEN: Charles Snavely is secretary of Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet. Before this job, he spent 35 years in the coal industry. Snavely's working with companies - he calls them customers - to help develop renewable energy. But he says he struggles. SNAVELY: Does the growth of renewables come at the expense of coal? Is it a bigger pie, or is someone taking a slice of our pie? LUDDEN: Coal built this state's economy, he says, creating some of the cheapest power in the country. SNAVELY: We have industries in Kentucky that would not be here if we didn't have such low electricity rates. LUDDEN: But now more and more businesses want solar or wind, even if they're still not quite as cheap as the state's coal. JIM GARDNER: The future is renewables and the large corporations that want renewables. LUDDEN: Jim Gardner used to help regulate Kentucky's power companies. Two years ago, he was struck when someone at Facebook told him businesses are even deciding where to expand based on where they can get renewable energy. GARDNER: He made it seem like there was literally a list with a lot of states with big X's marked in so that Facebook and others were not looking because they were not going to be open to renewables. LUDDEN: The Public Service Commission, where Gardner worked, worried the state was missing out. It quietly issued an official statement. GARDNER: It just sent a clear signal to people outside of the state. LUDDEN: It said - hey, if a big customer wants renewable energy, Kentucky's utilities can cut a special deal to provide it. That meant utilities had permission to offer renewable energy, but they still had to find a way to produce it. DAVID CREWS: This tract is about 60 acres. LUDDEN: David Crews is showing me a gently rolling field with a duck pond. This field will soon be full of 32,000 solar panels. CREWS: It'll butt right up against the golf course. LUDDEN: East Kentucky Power Cooperative is doing this by popular demand from businesses. The utility has no plans to build another coal plant. Crews says just because the new president does not want to limit carbon emissions doesn't mean the next one won't. CREWS: The seesawing of regulations, when we're trying to make a 50-year investment, it will drive you crazy. And that wouldn't be good for our customer base. LUDDEN: So the utility is marketing its new solar panels. And if demand is strong enough, Crews says, they'll add more. Toyota isn't waiting for the next solar farm. Kevin Butt is getting creative about finding renewable energy now. He takes me down a rutted dirt road, through towering brown hills. It's a landfill. And here and there, things stick up. BUTT: The black tube coming up, it's a methane capture well. LUDDEN: The methane is released as the trash here rots. Now, when it goes into the air, methane's a dirty greenhouse gas. But last year, Toyota set up a generator to turn it into clean electricity. The power is sent through an underground line. BUTT: Right up over that hill and then it follows the road, sort of, almost all the way to the plant. LUDDEN: Straight to the Toyota plant six miles away, bypassing the local utility altogether. Butt says until Kentucky's utilities offer more renewable energy, Toyota will keep finding other ways to get it. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.

And among them are several million people in this country illegally. But as NPR's Richard Gonzales reports, tax preparers are seeing signs that fewer immigrants may be filing this year than in years past. RICHARD GONZALES, BYLINE: There's a common belief that immigrants in this country without authorization don't file or pay taxes. But the IRS says that in 2015, nearly 4 and a half million people across the country who don't have Social Security numbers filed federal tax returns. And many are in this country illegally. CLARISSA JOHNSON: Unity Council, how can I help you? GONZALES: The Unity Council is an East Oakland community-based organization offering free tax preparation for low-income people. On a recent afternoon, about a dozen clients and IRS-certified volunteer tax preparers are hunched over rows of aging computers. Clarissa Johnson directs this clinic. JOHNSON: We'll help everyone. We don't ask them about their immigration status. That is between them and the tax preparer. GONZALES: Many of these people use individual taxpayer identification numbers, or ITINs. Some ITIN holders are foreign investors or students. But it's generally understood that most tax filers using an ITIN are in this country illegally, like 36-year-old Axel, who asked that we not use his last name because of his immigration status. He came to the United States from Guatemala several years ago. And he says he has no hesitation about filing his tax returns. AXEL: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"First, because it's my responsibility,\" he says, \"and I want to do things the correct way. \"Axel says a few years ago, a shady tax preparer made mistakes on his return, and he wound up getting fined several thousand dollars. AXEL: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"I don't like to create problems for myself,\" he says. There's an obvious incentive to file - a chance to get a refund. The Unity Council's Clarissa Johnson says another reason is, if a person winds up in immigration court, a record of having filed taxes is considered evidence of good moral character. JOHNSON: And especially if they're working toward their citizenship, it's something that can show that they are here for the long haul. GONZALES: According to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an office of the IRS, ITIN filers last year paid almost $24 billion in federal taxes. Yet as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigration, there's some anecdotal evidence that fewer immigrants using ITINs are choosing to file their taxes this year. Max Moy-Borgen runs the tax program at the Mission Economic Development Agency in San Francisco. It's one of the largest free tax preparation programs in the country. MAX MOY-BORGEN: Many of our clients are telling us that in years past, they felt more hope and more of ability to have a pathway towards citizenship. And lately, there's a lot less hope. GONZALES: Overall, tax service providers in the San Francisco Bay Area say there's about a 20 percent decline in the number of people filing with ITINs. There are similar reports from service providers in other areas of the country, says Francine Lipman. She teaches tax law at the University of Nevada. FRANCINE LIPMAN: Sending in a tax return with your current address and information is very unnerving to a population that wants to comply with the law and is actually leaving significant refunds on the table by not filing tax returns. GONZALES: Still, the IRS is barred from sharing its information with other government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, except under limited circumstances. But Lipman says, many ITIN filers have to decide whether to trust that firewall. Richard Gonzales, NPR News, San Francisco.

The returns will say how much he earned and the name of the partnership paying him, but not the identities of the partners. They also won't say who invested in real estate projects he owns directly. Sheppard says that as a real estate developer, Trump probably has a lot of what is called non-recourse debt, loans backed not by him personally, but by the real estate project being built.

Almost two thirds of American households actually pay less in federal income tax than they do in payroll tax. Payroll taxes are typically withheld by employers, and they go towards funding Social Security and Medicare. To talk more about this, we're joined by Eugene Steuerle. He's a co-founder of The Tax Policy Center. That's part of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution here in Washington, D. C. Welcome to the program once again. EUGENE STEUERLE: Glad to join you, Robert. SIEGEL: Who pays payroll tax? STEUERLE: Well, workers pay payroll tax. It's a tax on earnings, mainly wages, but it includes some income from partnerships as well. And you pay it from the very first dollar of earnings that you make. SIEGEL: And the rate of tax that you pay on that money? STEUERLE: The rate of tax is 15. 3 percent, of which 2. 9 percent goes to help support Medicare and the rest goes to support what people think of as Social Security or the benefits for Old-Age and disability insurance. SIEGEL: Now, half of that is paid by the employer. So for the employee, it would be 6. 2 percent. STEUERLE: That's right. But most economists believe that the employee pays the employer portion of the tax in the form of lower wages. SIEGEL: But that rate doesn't change the more money you make. You just hit a cutoff point, and you stop paying any more. STEUERLE: That's correct. It's a flat rate of tax. SIEGEL: So to compare the payroll tax to the income tax, I mean, when it comes to income taxes, more than 40 percent of households don't pay federal income tax, usually because they don't earn enough. And people who make over a quarter of a million dollars a year pay for most of the revenue that comes from the income tax. That's very progressive. Why is - why is it the same rate for everybody when it comes to the payroll tax? STEUERLE: Well, the income tax supports most of the programs of government from defense to highways to actually a substantial portion of health care. The Social Security tax was deliberately designed to provide us with a pension in old age, and it follows at least approximately the design of private pension plans in the sense that you contribute money to the system and the money you get out of the system is at least related to the money you put in. So it's almost like a mandated pension plan. We have to participate if we work so that we can have some benefits when we go into old age. SIEGEL: So for most Americans, today isn't tax day. Every Friday is tax day. STEUERLE: (Laughter) That's exactly right. So it's interesting because the very process of filing is one of the reasons the income tax, I think, is less popular than the Social Security tax. SIEGEL: As opposed to just having it taken out of your paycheck every week that there's less. . . STEUERLE: That's right. And you owe nothing at the end of the year usually. SIEGEL: And you owe nothing at the end of the year. You've paid more (laughter) - you've paid more, but you didn't experience that one - one day of pain. STEUERLE: Right, right. And you didn't reconcile the numbers. You didn't actually make the calculation and see how much you paid. So I doubt that most people realize how much they pay in Social Security tax. SIEGEL: This hybrid system of the income tax and payroll taxes, also state taxes - you were at the Treasury Department in the past - does this make sense? I mean, is it a useful way of raising money to pay for government at various levels? STEUERLE: Now you're asking my personal opinion. I think it's moderately useful. Both systems could use a lot of fix-up and reform. But having - having these two major sources of revenue, I think, makes sense. SIEGEL: Well Eugene Steuerle of the Tax Policy Center, thanks for talking with us on tax day about the bigger tax than the federal income tax. STEUERLE: I'm glad to have been here. And congratulations to all you taxpayers. SIEGEL: (Laughter).

You just hit a cutoff point, and you stop paying any more. STEUERLE: That's correct. It's a flat rate of tax. SIEGEL: So to compare the payroll tax to the income tax, I mean, when it comes to income taxes, more than 40 percent of households don't pay federal income tax, usually because they don't earn enough. And people who make over a quarter of a million dollars a year pay for most of the revenue that comes from the income tax. That's very progressive. Why is - why is it the same rate for everybody when it comes to the payroll tax? STEUERLE: Well, the income tax supports most of the programs of government from defense to highways to actually a substantial portion of health care. The Social Security tax was deliberately designed to provide us with a pension in old age, and it follows at least approximately the design of private pension plans in the sense that you contribute money to the system and the money you get out of the system is at least related to the money you put in. So it's almost like a mandated pension plan. We have to participate if we work so that we can have some benefits when we go into old age. SIEGEL: So for most Americans, today isn't tax day. Every Friday is tax day. STEUERLE: (Laughter) That's exactly right. So it's interesting because the very process of filing is one of the reasons the income tax, I think, is less popular than the Social Security tax. SIEGEL: As opposed to just having it taken out of your paycheck every week that there's less. . . STEUERLE: That's right. And you owe nothing at the end of the year usually. SIEGEL: And you owe nothing at the end of the year. You've paid more (laughter) - you've paid more, but you didn't experience that one - one day of pain. STEUERLE: Right, right. And you didn't reconcile the numbers. You didn't actually make the calculation and see how much you paid. So I doubt that most people realize how much they pay in Social Security tax. SIEGEL: This hybrid system of the income tax and payroll taxes, also state taxes - you were at the Treasury Department in the past - does this make sense? I mean, is it a useful way of raising money to pay for government at various levels? STEUERLE: Now you're asking my personal opinion. I think it's moderately useful. Both systems could use a lot of fix-up and reform. But having - having these two major sources of revenue, I think, makes sense. SIEGEL: Well Eugene Steuerle of the Tax Policy Center, thanks for talking with us on tax day about the bigger tax than the federal income tax. STEUERLE: I'm glad to have been here. And congratulations to all you taxpayers. SIEGEL: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF J-WALK'S \"FRENCH LETTER\")", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Say the name Sears these days and retail giant may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Despite its deep financial troubles though, Sears is still a top retailer. Nancy Koehn with the Harvard Business School says in its early days, Sears was like Amazon today, a retailer of great disruption.

NANCY KOEHN: It wasn't the Internet but it was the same idea that no matter where you are, you can touch and feel and imagine what these different products could mean in your life by virtue of an outreach - a distribution channel that an imaginative and gutsy retailer, in this case Sears, had created and then invested in and then enlarged.

S. It also has one of the country's lowest birthrates. Demographers say that adds up to a looming crisis for Maine. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has this story about one Maine community that is relying on newcomers to keep its economy alive. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Here in the eastern edges of the U. S. along the shores of Washington County, many make a living from the waters of Down East Maine. (LAUGHTER)WANG: Crew members of Lobster Trap dump a vat of salted herring on a dock of a glassy bay ringed by evergreens and a scattering of wood-shingled houses. They're filling pungent containers of lobster bait. Annie Sokoloski helps manage this facility, and she says working in seafood goes back generations in her family. ANNIE SOKOLOSKI: My grandmother forced me to go into the fish factory and pack sardines. And she told me, anytime that I thought about not having an education, I needed to remember that day. WANG: And she says she still remembers other lessons from growing up in rural Down East Maine. SOKOLOSKI: They instilled into our generation you need to get away from here to make anything for yourself, you know, and I think to a certain degree I do it with my own daughter. WANG: Sokoloski's 23-year-old daughter, Natasha Davis, was also raised in Washington County. NATASHA DAVIS: There seems to be more job opportunity out of Maine. WANG: You'd have to leave for that. DAVIS: Yes, travel, go somewhere different. WANG: Davis wants to be a veterinary technician and has California in her sights. It's young people like her that have been leaving Maine in droves since the 1980s. And local officials say they're worried about harder times ahead for Washington County, including Charles Rudelitch of the Sunrise County Economic Council. A recent Pew Research Center report projects that new immigrants will be the main drivers of growth in the U. S. workforce through 2035. Rudelitch says immigrants will also be key in sustaining Washington County's economy. CHARLES RUDELITCH: We are making the argument that over time there will be a much bigger economy for all of us to have a share of if we welcome people who choose to move here. WANG: Newcomers have been moving to the county, specifically to the small town of Milbridge, population just over 1,300. About 6 percent is Latino, many of them families drawn by jobs in lobster processing, blueberry picking and wreath making. Maria Paniagua Albor works in the office of a lobster processing plant. MARIA PANIAGUA ALBOR: Most of us are either from Puerto Rico or Mexico. WANG: Her father was one of the first workers from Mexico who puts their roots down in Milbridge. She says he worked seasonal jobs in the area for years before he decided to move his family after they received their green cards. Paniagua Albor is a U. S. citizen now. She lives in her own mobile home in Milbridge with her husband and 2-year-old son. Maine, she says, is just like what the welcome signs say along the highways here - the way life should be. ALBOR: It really is. I mean, I don't want to be stuck in traffic like in New York (laughter). So I guess I like it. It's calm, and that's good to raise kids. MANNY FLORES: I'm going to be the dragon. VICTOR FLORES: Where's the other dragon? There's the other dragon in here. WANG: Victor Flores is raising his 5-year-old son, Manny, and three daughters in Milbridge with his fiance. They met when he was working at a sea cucumber processing plant. FLORES: At that place, she was the bookkeeper. That's how I met her. WANG: Flores' fiance is white and has lived in the area for almost three decades. He was born in Mexico and moved here from Florida almost two decades ago. Flores says he's felt some of the backlash against newcomers in town, including once outside the local supermarket when he parked next to a white man's car. FLORES: He thought I was too close to him, so he started getting mad. And the first thing he's like, go back to Mexico. Go back to where you came from. You don't belong here. WANG: But at that point, you had been living here for more than a decade. FLORES: Yes. WANG: For Annie Sokoloski of Lobster Trap, though, newcomers have been a welcome addition to her town, especially at job fairs and other recruiting events. SOKOLOSKI: We start at $11 an hour with a weekly bonus. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Do you work Sundays? SOKOLOSKI: Seven days a week. WANG: Still, Sokoloski says she's concerned about the future of Down East, Maine's, economy. SOKOLOSKI: It's going to be more of a retirement-type area. There's nothing to really sustain a long-term growth of a younger generation. WANG: And she's not sure how long she'll live here year-round once her daughter leaves. After retirement, Sokolowski says, she'll probably move away. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News, Milbridge, Maine.

They've put off voting on a promised tax overhaul until after they try again to replace the Affordable Care Act. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Steve Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign, is worried. STEPHEN MOORE: You know, you get a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut. YDSTIE: But here we are in mid-April, Moore says. President Trump has no legislative victories. And his treasury secretary says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win - now. MOORE: Get a tax cut done right now. Do something that's achievable. You ran on a corporate and business tax cut, get that done. This is taking too long. And it's getting harder to do as each week goes by. YDSTIE: Moore does have some skin in this game. He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Donald Trump ran on during the election. But nearly a hundred days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill is already having negative effects. MOORE: When I talk to investors in business and I say what's going on, why is the growth rate slowing, and why do we see less jobs, they say part of the explanation is we're getting nervous about whether this tax cut is going to happen at all. YDSTIE: Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax writing Ways and Means Committee, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. JON TRAUB: We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace. YDSTIE: The biggest question is whether Trump will embrace the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan to overhaul the tax code supported by House Republican leaders. The proposed tax is attractive because it raises a huge amount of revenue by putting a 20 percent tax on all imports. Meanwhile, it eliminates taxes on American exports. That's divided the U. S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart who import products they sell hate it while companies like Boeing who export love it. Again, Jon Traub. TRAUB: The president has given mixed signals on that issue. And I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate. YDSTIE: If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax, says Traub. TRAUB: It shows how desperate they are to find a large source of revenue other than the border adjustable tax as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates. YDSTIE: But Steve Moore says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to federal deficits. And Moore says for now, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. MOORE: One of the lessons hopefully Republicans learned from the health care debate is keep it simple, stupid. The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress. YDSTIE: And what would that look like? Well, cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, an even lower tax rate on money U. S. companies bring back from overseas and requiring that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U. S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing this idea say even some Democrats might support that. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about the digital industrial revolution and whether we should be worried or excited. MARCO ANNUNZIATA: I am definitely an optimist. RAZ: This is Marco Annunziata. Marco's the chief economist at General Electric. ANNUNZIATA: I am aware as an economist being optimistic is kind of out of character, but I feel there are too many gloomy people out there, so I'm happpy to do my bit. RAZ: One of Marco's main jobs is to predict what our jobs will look like in the future. And he says, not surprisingly, that in the next five to 10 to 20 years, almost everything about the workplace is going to change. ANNUNZIATA: There will be a new and different form of interaction between humans and machines, both physical machines like robots and virtual machines like artificial intelligence. RAZ: So - I don't know - if you can take us on a tour of that future, what does a normal person's day going to kind of be like at work? What are they going to experience? How are they going experience that? ANNUNZIATA: So I think they will experience it in the following way. They will come on to a factory floor. Onto the factory floor, they will find an environment which is a lot more intelligent than today. Everything around the worker, whether it's the equipment the worker interacts with, the different items on the factory floor, will be equipped with sensors constantly sending data to artificial intelligence machines that will be analyzing the data and everything that is going on. There will be robots helping the worker perform whatever functions are involved in the specific job description in a much more efficient and a much safer way. These are applications that make work better. RAZ: This collaboration between humans and machines is all part of what Marco calls the industrial Internet. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANNUNZIATA: So what is this industrial Internet? RAZ: He explained the idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANNUNZIATA: It brings together intelligent machines, advanced analytics and the creativity of people that work. Industrial machines are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see, hear, feel a lot more than ever before, generating prodigious amounts of data. Increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data, providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways a lot more efficiently. And not just individual machines but fleets of locomotives, airplanes, entire systems like power grids, hospitals. Let's start with aviation. Today, 10 percent of all flights, cancellations and delays are due to unscheduled maintenance events. These results in $8 billion in costs for the airline industry globally every year, not to mention the impact on all of us - stress, inconvenience, missed meetings - as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal. So how can the industrial Internet help here? We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft. It's self-learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss. The aircraft, while in flight, will communicate with technicians on the ground. By the time it lands, they will already know if anything needs to be serviced. Just in the U. S. , a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year, helping 7 million passengers get to their destinations on time. So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent. They are brilliant. It's jet engines, locomotives, medical devices, communicating seamlessly with each other and with us. It's the marriage of minds and machines. And our lives will never be the same. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Yeah. I mean, it's a complete break from the way humans have lived and functioned since, you know, the beginning of time. ANNUNZIATA: Absolutely, yes. And I think we are at the beginning of a massive historical transition, which will lead to a new economic system, a new industrial system, a new way of life, which will be really qualitatively different from what we are experiencing now. I mean, the impact is going to be enormous. RAZ: So, I mean, how would you describe where we are today? Are we right at the precipice of this massive change, or are we already in it? ANNUNZIATA: We are already in it, Guy, but we are at the very beginning of it. So for me, a plausible horizon for these new technologies to really spread and transform the industrial system and the economy as we know it, you're thinking of a horizon of 20 to 25 years, but that's for the complete transformation. Within the next five to 10 years, you will already see very substantial changes. And I'm saying this because some of these changes are already taking place. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANNUNZIATA: Let's look at the big picture. There are people who argue that today's innovation is all about social media and silly games with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution. They see that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us. And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill and saying to each other, yeah, this wheel thing - cool toy, sure. But compared to fire, it will have no impact. The big discoveries are all behind us. (LAUGHTER)ANNUNZIATA: This technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational is anything we have ever seen. Human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward. They've created jobs. They've raised living standards. They've made our lives healthier and more rewarding. And the new wave of innovation, which is beginning to sweep through industry, is no different. I know that many of you will be concerned about the impact that innovation might have on jobs, and innovation is disruptive. But let me stress two things here. First, innovation is fundamentally about growth. It makes products more affordable. It creates new demand, new jobs. Second, there is a concern that in the future there will only be room for engineers, data scientists and other highly specialized workers. And believe me, as an economist, I'm also scared. But think about it. Just as a child can easily figure out how to operate an iPad, soon a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels. It's not going to be easy, but it is going to be worth it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, all of these technologies that are coming online and that will come online and that will, you know, make many parts of our lives more efficient and make our, you know, economies more productive, I mean, there are going to be winners and losers, surely. ANNUNZIATA: They're always sad, and one thing to keep in mind is sometimes technological innovations have unintended consequences that you need to watch for. So one key example - there's been a lot of attention and focus on the problem of unemployment and the risks coming from automation and artificial intelligence. RAZ: Yeah. ANNUNZIATA: Now, to me, that is something that needs to be taken very seriously. Now, I don't buy into the argument you hear that says that in the future, 50 percent of all jobs will disappear. And that is simply not true, and I think, in the end, the we will have more jobs. We will have better jobs, but some jobs will be automated away. The transition will be difficult. It will require people to acquire different skills. So how can we get from where we sit today to this brilliant future I'm envisioning where we will all have better jobs, more jobs? How do we get there in a way that creates the least disruption and for the smallest number of people because there will be disruption? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ANNUNZIATA: Provided that we manage this transition in the right way, it will definitely be a better future because I work with scientists and engineers and I see what innovation is doing, and that makes me optimistic.

MAURICE CONTI: So we're going to be, you know, Iron Man plus Spock plus, you know, name your series of superheroes. RAZ: This is Maurice Conti. CONTI: Yeah, so my name is Maurice Conti. I currently head up Applied Research and Innovation at a software company called Autodesk. RAZ: And Maurice is talking about how maybe someday we could all be these sort of superhumans working together with machines in an era he calls the augmented age. CONTI: I mean, you know, we've had this partnership with our own technology that has been allowing us to achieve greater things, which, I guess by definition, is augmentation. I think the difference this time is the speed with which these technologies are coming online And the speed with which we are going to adopt them, which, I think, will result in something that feels more like augmentation rather than improvement. It's like a superpower. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK. So what does it actually mean, I mean, in practical terms? Because right now - right now we have access to infinite knowledge, right? We can just pull out our phones and find out really pretty much whatever we want to find out. CONTI: Yes, sort of. In fact, you know, I argue that we are already augmented because all of us probably listening have access to a smartphone, which is, in turn, connected to the Internet, which, in turn, holds vast amounts of information. I wouldn't necessarily say it's knowledge. In fact, that's maybe the next step. The part that's missing is, yes, I have access to a great body of information, but I still need to turn that into knowledge with my own point of view, my own ability to think synthetically and connect dots. RAZ: Yeah. CONTI: And I think, you know, that's what advanced computation is going to help us with. It's really processing that information, gleaning insight from it, making intuitive leaps and so forth. RAZ: And Maurice says that soon, a lot of our machines won't just answer questions. They'll actually start thinking for themselves, coming up with their own ideas and even feeling the world around them. Here's how Maurice explained it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CONTI: Tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative. Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms to synthesize geometry to come up with new designs all by themselves. All it needs are your goals and your constraints. I'll give you an example. In the case of this aerial drone chassis, all you would need to do is tell it something like it has four propellers, you want it to be as lightweight as possible and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient. And then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space, every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria, millions of them. But it comes back to us with designs that we by ourselves never could have imagined. And the computer is coming up with this stuff all by itself. No one ever drew anything, and it started completely from scratch. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK. If the future is going to be a future of artificial intelligence, do you think that we're going to figure out a way to work together or, I mean (laughter), or not? CONTI: Well, you know, part of me says that has to be true. The AI was built and is operating in service of some goal that I was trying to achieve, and if I'm achieving that goal, then I think, by definition, I mean, I'm in partnership with that AI. RAZ: So, I mean. . . CONTI: Feel free to call [expletive] on that. RAZ: No, no, no, I just - I just - and I was saying this to Erik Brynjolfsson earlier in the show - right? - that I cannot imagine any single profession, including professions that we think require a whole lot of brain power like psychiatry, OK, I mean, I cannot think of a single profession that won't be - that couldn't be displaced by a machine-learning machine that just becomes smarter and smarter and smarter. CONTI: Yeah. Certainly, it's easy to imagine how just about every profession can be affected by these technologies. You know, where it gets interesting is if we start to debate, will these professionals be displaced? And certainly, in some cases they will. But I think in many cases, they won't. Part of the reason is there's this graph that I like to draw, and it has two curves on it. The first curve is an upward exponential curve that represents our capabilities as a species based on the development of technology. So perhaps at some point, when we reach a very high point on that curve, we'll be done. There'll be nothing else to do. What I think a lot of people overlook is there's another curve right next to it that happens to be in lockstep, and that is the curve of opportunity. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONTI: And it's actually easy to see, you know, whenever some company comes out with the latest smartphone, the next day people are like, great. What's next? I want more. And I think it's the fact that we have this other curve, which is our capacity to imagine and desire better things, better lives, better relationships, that, you know, will keep the demands on us increasing. And if that's true, then the AIs that would displace us are actually just what we need in order to keep up. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CONTI: So as computers are going to augment our ability to imagine and design new stuff, robotic systems are going to help us build and make things that we've never been able to make before. But what about our ability to sense and control these things? What about a nervous system for the things that we make? Our nervous system, the human nervous system, tells us everything that's going on around us. But the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best. For instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway and Morrison. A building doesn't tell its designers whether or not the people inside like being there. And if the designers had known what was really happening in the real world with their designs, they could've used that knowledge to create an experience that was better for the user. Now, what's missing is a nervous system connecting us to all of the things that we design, make and use. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, a nervous system, a human nervous system, is such a complex thing that it's hard for me to get my head around the idea that there could be a comparable digital system. CONTI: I think when a lot of people think about AI and, you know, things like Skynet, one of the things they assume is that the AI is aware. And I think awareness is a prerequisite of powerful, useful AIs. And so giving AIs a nervous system, the ability to perceive their environments in order for them to carry out their jobs, is critical. And that's already happening. This isn't science fiction at all. It's just a question of getting sensor data from the real world into the AI. It's happening in your car every day. If you have a car that has any kind of autopilot or fancy cruise control, it's looking around it. It's perceiving its environment and then making decisions based on that. And so, really, it's just a continuation of that, more sensors, more real-time data coming in, that allow the systems to make relevant decisions that are helpful to us. RAZ: So I mean - and, I mean, we've heard stories about this on the show already about how, you know, when humans and robots work together, everybody wins, you know. Like, I mean, is this idea of the human-AI collaboration, you know, is infinitely superior to everything else out there? I mean, is that always going to be the case, or is that just wishful thinking? CONTI: No. I think human technology, you know, human-AI, human-robot collaboration is better than either one working on their own. I actually think that's a tautology. You know, humans are very good at some things. Synthetic systems are really good at others. All else being equal, I cannot imagine the argument where the combination of these two skill sets is not better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONTI: And that's where it gets interesting because the AI is currently not that great at intuition but really good at that sort of brute force computation on tons and tons of data. And it's a little bit like a dance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONTI: The human might lead, but the computer can do lots of fancy moves that together combine into something. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CONTI: . . . That is greater than the sum of its parts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Maurice Conti - he's the director of Applied Research and Innovation at the 3D design and engineering software company Autodesk. You can see his full talk at ted. com.

If you have a car that has any kind of autopilot or fancy cruise control, it's looking around it. It's perceiving its environment and then making decisions based on that. And so, really, it's just a continuation of that, more sensors, more real-time data coming in, that allow the systems to make relevant decisions that are helpful to us. RAZ: So I mean - and, I mean, we've heard stories about this on the show already about how, you know, when humans and robots work together, everybody wins, you know. Like, I mean, is this idea of the human-AI collaboration, you know, is infinitely superior to everything else out there? I mean, is that always going to be the case, or is that just wishful thinking? CONTI: No. I think human technology, you know, human-AI, human-robot collaboration is better than either one working on their own. I actually think that's a tautology. You know, humans are very good at some things. Synthetic systems are really good at others. All else being equal, I cannot imagine the argument where the combination of these two skill sets is not better. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONTI: And that's where it gets interesting because the AI is currently not that great at intuition but really good at that sort of brute force computation on tons and tons of data. And it's a little bit like a dance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONTI: The human might lead, but the computer can do lots of fancy moves that together combine into something. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CONTI: . . . That is greater than the sum of its parts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Maurice Conti - he's the director of Applied Research and Innovation at the 3D design and engineering software company Autodesk. You can see his full talk at ted. com.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about a new industrial revolution. JEREMY HOWARD: I mean, it's not just a new phase of the Industrial Revolution. It's a - it's an entirely new revolution. RAZ: This is data scientist Jeremy Howard. HOWARD: So we went through the process of replacing hunting and gathering with domestication. We went through the process of replacing animal energy with mechanical energy. We're now going through the process of replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So for the past 25 years, Jeremy has been working on a technology called deep learning, and it's based on the way the human brain and nervous system work. HOWARD: Deep learning relies on a particular kind of function called a neural network. It is heavily inspired by neuroscience and can actually compute anything. RAZ: Anything because these machines can learn and perceive. They can see, hear, read, write. They can make decisions all while being able to process billions of data points. HOWARD: It's creepy. RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: And it's possibly about to get creepier. RAZ: (Laughter) Oh, no. But before we get to the creepy part, we should point out we're already using these neural networks for a lot of pretty cool things. HOWARD: So today, we have a thousand-layer neural networks doing things like Skype translation. I don't know if you've tried that. RAZ: Yeah. We just actually tried it. (SOUNDBITE OF SKYPE LOADING)CASEY HERMAN, BYLINE: Hey, you can hear me? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (Speaking French). MATHILDE: (Speaking French). COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Yes. Hello. We hear you very well. RAZ: OK. Let me explain what's going on here. Our producer, Casey, is speaking into Skype. . . HERMAN: OK, great. So you're recording. RAZ: . . . Obviously in English. And Skype is translating that in real time into French. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (Speaking French). RAZ: And on the other end is Mathilde (ph). . . MATHILDE: (Speaking French). RAZ: . . . Except she's speaking in French, and Skype turns that into English. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: Yes, we are recording. RAZ: And how does this work? HOWARD: The basic approach is that you download lots of sentences that are written both in English and French. You basically write three or four lines of code, and you then tell that neural network where to find the input and output data, leave it overnight and come back in the morning and see if it works. So a sentence could be please enter your username here. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (Speaking French). HOWARD: It learns to map at a very deep and subtle way such that the next day I can then put in a different sentence. What is the world's largest country? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (Speaking French). RAZ: And Jeremy says that's all it takes. You start with simple sentences. MATHILDE: (Speaking French). COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: What is the distance between the Earth and the sun? RAZ: As you keep going, the program keeps learning on its own. . . MATHILDE: (Speaking French). COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: What is the population of the city of Paris? RAZ: . . . To the point where you can have entire conversations translated. . . HERMAN: Hey, good morning, how are you doing? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (Speaking French). RAZ: . . . In real time. . . . MATHILDE: (Speaking French). RAZ: . . . By a machine. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: I'm fine, thank you. HERMAN: How is your family? Have you talked to them? COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #1: (Speaking French). RAZ: I mean, this concept is absolutely incredible - right? - because with this technology, once you hit go, it's unstoppable. I mean, it just continues to get better and better and better, right? HOWARD: Right. So you set up your problem, and you run it overnight, and you come back the next day, and hopefully, it solved it. Now, it's pretty hard to describe exactly what it's done, and often - very, very often - I don't really understand at all how my programs work. A few years ago, I built a system for diagnosing lung cancer which could beat a panel of four of the world's best radiologists. But I know nothing whatsoever about what lung cancer looks like or doesn't look like and could tell you nothing about how it worked because I have no background in medicine. So that's the nature of setting up these things. You fire them off and they come back with a model. RAZ: And Jeremy says diagnosing lung cancer is just the beginning. HOWARD: And so you can imagine the power that this provides for good. Every time a piece of medical imaging is done, automatically and instantly an alert appears saying this person has an aneurism or this person has a malignant nodule in their left lung. You know, that would be saving millions of lives and billions of dollars. RAZ: Here's how Jeremy explained it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HOWARD: This kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem, which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world. The World Economic Forum says that there's between a 10x and a 20x shortage of physicians in the developing world. And it would take about 300 years to train enough people to fix that problem. So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches. So I'm very excited about the opportunities. I'm also concerned about the problems. The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over 80 percent of employment. What are services? RAZ: OK. So at this point in his talk, Jeremy pulls out a large world map, and he explains that in most of the developed world, and even in a lot of developing countries, their economies depend mainly on service jobs, people who prep food and drive cars and file documents, do legal research, even diagnose disease. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HOWARD: These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do. So 80 percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do. What does that mean? Well, it'll be fine. It'll be replaced by other jobs. For example, there'll be more jobs for data scientists. Well, not really. It doesn't take data scientists very long to build these things. For example, these four algorithms were all built by the same guy. So if you think, oh, it's all happened before. You know, we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along, and they get replaced by new jobs. What are these new jobs going to be? It's very hard for us to estimate this because human performance grows at this gradual rate. But we now have a system, deep learning, that we know actually grows in capability exponentially. So currently, we see the things around us and we say oh, computers are still pretty dumb, right? But in five years time, computers will be off this chart. The better computers get at intellectual activities, the more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities. So this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before. So your previous understanding of what's possible is different. RAZ: I mean, the fact is is that machines are getting better and better as we speak, second by second, in being able to process billions and billions of pieces of data, and they're just going to get better and better next month and in a year and in five years and 20 years. And they are going to be able to make decisions in ways that will be confounding to us. HOWARD: I mean, so I did my TED talk two and a half years ago, I guess, and at this point, computers are better at recognizing what is in a photo than humans are. They are better at understanding Chinese and English speech than Chinese and English native speakers. We now have deep learning algorithms that are better at building the neural networks that create deep learning algorithms. . . RAZ: (Laughter). HOWARD: . . . Than humans are. RAZ: God. HOWARD: So two and a half years since I got up and said, hey, there's this new technology called deep learning which is about to surpass human capabilities in these fundamentally human areas. Between then and now, it happened. RAZ: Do you think we can even articulate or imagine what this technology will do to change our world, our lives, our species? HOWARD: Not only is it impossible for us to imagine, there is a great many things which are stopping us from being able to imagine it. RAZ: Like what? HOWARD: So people often talk about exponential technologies, but the fact is, every technology that's come so far is actually an S-shaped technology. Before electricity, nearly everything that required an input of energy was done with human energy or horse energy or something like that. Then we learnt how to electrify nearly every energy-requiring process until eventually, we did them all. And so there was initially exponential growth as the newly electrified processes allowed us to improve other processes, but then it flattened off again. Now, on the other hand, think about replacing intellectual power, all right? There's no S-curve here. There's no drop-off. There's no point where you go, OK, we've now used all of the intellectual power that could be used. So our ability to actually understand the outcome of a truly exponential technology cannot be based on anything that has been observed in history because there's never been a technology like this before. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, it never stops. It doesn't reach a point where we say, you know, right, OK, next, you know, we've reached that milestone, and now we can just move on to the next thing. HOWARD: Right. Well, that's the thing, right? This is kind of the last human input is kind of perception. . . RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: . . . And intelligence. So a lot of people then say, oh, yeah, so there'll be new jobs. But then you say, like what? RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: And that's where people come up short. Like, you could tell, even in the industrial revolution, you could say OK, electricity can't do all of these things - look at things or listen to things or react to things. That's not where we are anymore. We're now in the process of saying, OK, this is the last bastion of stuff that only humans can do. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, I've been asking everyone on the show this question, and, you know, they seem pretty convinced that, you know, we humans will continue to have jobs. Like, you and I will continue to do what we do and will continue to be necessary as a species, but I'm not really so sure. HOWARD: Yeah. There's no question that the vast majority of things that humans are doing today are going to be replaced. And it's also important to remember, though, that the vast majority of people have jobs that kind of suck, right? RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: There's far more people who are chopping celery for a living than there are people running TED Radio Hour for a living. So given that we both agree that the jobs that we have today are going to disappear probably quicker than anybody expects, that means that we need to have ways of supporting people. . . RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: . . . Economically because you can't just say, you're not adding value, so therefore, you're not worthwhile to society. You actually have to say OK, we think everybody deserves to live in dignity, so let's have a basic guaranteed income which is enough to ensure that every human can have a life of dignity. RAZ: I mean, do you think we're, like, designing our replacement? Because you could imagine a point when, you know, we won't be the most intelligent species on the planet. Like, we would still live on it. We would still reproduce, but. . . HOWARD: Right. RAZ: . . . But, I mean, intelligent machines will create a new economic model and a system of governments for us on our behalf. We're going to be, like, zoo animals. HOWARD: Yeah, I don't think that's too hard to imagine. You know, if we continue down this path where more and more of the economy looks like the inside of a Amazon logistics warehouse - where every human being, every move they're making, is being supervised by and rewarded or penalized by machines until we're all at the beck and call of the machinery and we could well look at each other and go, none of us signed up for this. RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: None of us designed this. RAZ: It's just hard for me to wrap my head around this idea that, you know, we have consciousness. I mean, even though we're not sure what exactly animates us - right? But I just have trouble believing that, you know, one day, we're going to develop machines that think and feel and act like we do. HOWARD: The more I use this technology, the less my own consciousness seems surprising or inexplicable. RAZ: Really? HOWARD: Oh, very much so. RAZ: Wow. HOWARD: Once you've used these kinds of tools for long enough, you just keep seeing them behave in certain ways. It just looks very familiar. RAZ: But you're basically saying that the ones and zeros in a machine are very similar to the ones and zeros in your brain. HOWARD: Well, clearly. I mean, it has to be true. The alternative is if you believe that there's a God. . . RAZ: Yeah? HOWARD: . . . And there's a soul and it's this ineffable thing we can't see or touch. . . RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: . . . OK, that's fine. I can't, and I'm not going to argue with that because it's based on faith, not science. Unless you believe those things, you have to believe that the chemical and electrical signals and connectivity in our brain is us. You know, the idea that these kinds of massively parallel, massively connected functions inside huge computer systems can display intelligent behavior - well, we're already there. We just keep redefining intelligent behavior so that, you know, we're always outside it. RAZ: But, I mean, as a human, I can emote. I can feel things. You know, like, I understand my mortality. I love. I feel grief (laughter). I mean, how are those things replicated by - you know, in a machine by ones and zeros? HOWARD: Very, very easily. All of the things you are describing are rational, evolutionary responses to a fitness function that attempts to keep your genes alive. The reason you love is because your genes want you to have sex and have more of those genes. The reason that you grieve is because your genes want you to avoid doing things that cause people with similar genes to yours to die. All of the things that you emote are, at some level, evolutionary responses to this fitness function of keeping your genes going for longer. So as our complex, computer-based functions get better at figuring out what causes their fitness functions to be successful, they will have all of these very complex interactions. RAZ: I'm not walking away from this conversation optimistic. I'm troubled. HOWARD: Good. RAZ: Yeah, I'm troubled. HOWARD: Good. Be troubled. RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: You know, being troubled is the correct response - but also excited. Be both. Because all of these people who say don't worry, everything's fine - there will always be jobs. Just feed the robots; feed the machines. Don't worry - to me, they're just the same as climate-change deniers. You know, they're ignoring the basic science that says this is something different. This is something we can't control. This is something we don't know where it's going. And this is something which can definitely have terrible societal outcomes. On the other hand, anybody who says the government should step in and regulate and control and stop all of this from happening - people shouldn't be doing this kind of research - they're just as bad. You know, they're saying the billions of people that don't have access to modern medicine should never be given it even though we have the technology today to provide it. So we need to be both. We need to be aware of the opportunities and aware of the threats. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Jeremy Howard - he's a data scientist and the founding researcher at fast. ai.

OK, that's fine. I can't, and I'm not going to argue with that because it's based on faith, not science. Unless you believe those things, you have to believe that the chemical and electrical signals and connectivity in our brain is us. You know, the idea that these kinds of massively parallel, massively connected functions inside huge computer systems can display intelligent behavior - well, we're already there. We just keep redefining intelligent behavior so that, you know, we're always outside it. RAZ: But, I mean, as a human, I can emote. I can feel things. You know, like, I understand my mortality. I love. I feel grief (laughter). I mean, how are those things replicated by - you know, in a machine by ones and zeros? HOWARD: Very, very easily. All of the things you are describing are rational, evolutionary responses to a fitness function that attempts to keep your genes alive. The reason you love is because your genes want you to have sex and have more of those genes. The reason that you grieve is because your genes want you to avoid doing things that cause people with similar genes to yours to die. All of the things that you emote are, at some level, evolutionary responses to this fitness function of keeping your genes going for longer. So as our complex, computer-based functions get better at figuring out what causes their fitness functions to be successful, they will have all of these very complex interactions. RAZ: I'm not walking away from this conversation optimistic. I'm troubled. HOWARD: Good. RAZ: Yeah, I'm troubled. HOWARD: Good. Be troubled. RAZ: Yeah. HOWARD: You know, being troubled is the correct response - but also excited. Be both. Because all of these people who say don't worry, everything's fine - there will always be jobs. Just feed the robots; feed the machines. Don't worry - to me, they're just the same as climate-change deniers. You know, they're ignoring the basic science that says this is something different. This is something we can't control. This is something we don't know where it's going. And this is something which can definitely have terrible societal outcomes. On the other hand, anybody who says the government should step in and regulate and control and stop all of this from happening - people shouldn't be doing this kind of research - they're just as bad. You know, they're saying the billions of people that don't have access to modern medicine should never be given it even though we have the technology today to provide it. So we need to be both. We need to be aware of the opportunities and aware of the threats. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: Jeremy Howard - he's a data scientist and the founding researcher at fast. ai.

I'm Guy Raz. So robots and machines - they've made our lives a lot better. But one day maybe sooner than we think, they could also be the end of us, the last thing we humans invent. But before we go there, let's just reflect on how far we've actually come. Because if you look back at the course of human history, for most of that time the way the average person lived didn't really change all that much. ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: Until the late 1700s when Watt developed a much better steam engine. RAZ: This is Erik - is it Brynjolfsson? Is that right? BRYNJOLFSSON: Yeah. A lot of consonants all next to each other. In Iceland, they find it very easy. RAZ: Erik's is a professor at MIT and the Watt he was referring to - he's talking about James Watt, the inventor of the Watt steam engine which was basically a really efficient steam engine. BRYNJOLFSSON: And that ignited what we call the first industrial revolution. RAZ: After that, the second industrial revolution and with it electricity and the birth of a world wide economy which then led to the first machine age and eventually the information age. BRYNJOLFSSON: And before that, living standards basically were flat. Since then, they've been growing 2 percent a year were about 30 times richer. So technology, machines is really, you know, arguably the most important thing that's happened to humanity in terms of our living standards. You could look to the introduction of digital computers in the 1950s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: The electronic central computer. . . BRYNJOLFSSON: The personal computer in the 1980s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. BRYNJOLFSSON: When machines could first beat humans at games like chess in 1997. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: In an absolutely stunning, stunning 19-mover and Kasparov has just simply stormed away. BRYNJOLFSSON: I think those were all milestones of increasing import, an increasingly large effect on the economy and our lives. RAZ: Important because they prove that maybe one day they can be smarter than us? BRYNJOLFSSON: No doubt about it. I mean, let's face it. They already are much smarter than us at so many things. I mean, try to multiply two 10-digit numbers with each other or, you know, sift through a thousand documents. So there's lots of things that machines are better at including in mental task than us. There's many more that they're not as good at, but the direction is pretty obvious and the progress is clear. RAZ: On the show today, the Digital Industrial Revolution, ideas about the economic future we're creating, how we can shape it and if we'll find a place among the machines because if we can eventually create robots to do everything and to do it better, where does that leave us? A future of blissful human robot collaboration possible, yeah, or maybe something a little darker. Erik Brynjolfsson says right now we're at the beginning of a new machine age where technology is developing at such a rapid pace that it's kind of hard to keep up with. BRYNJOLFSSON: It starts with a small, exponential trend. And, as you know, exponential trends double and double and double. And each time you can barely detect them when they're small and they start becoming overwhelming. This is the biggest challenge of our society over the next 10 years is going to be can we adapt fast enough? RAZ: Here's Erik Brynjolfsson on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRYNJOLFSSON: Computers get better, faster than anything else ever. A child's PlayStation today is more powerful than a military supercomputer from 1996. But our brains are wired for a linear world. As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise. I used to teach my students that there are some things, you know, computers just aren't good at like driving a car through traffic. But, perhaps, the most important invention, the most important invention is machine learning. Consider one project - IBM's Watson. At first Watson wasn't very good, but it improved at a rate faster than any human could, and Watson beat the world Jeopardy champion. At age 7, Watson is still kind of in its childhood. Recently, its teachers let it surf the internet unsupervised. The next day, it started answering questions with profanities. (LAUGHTER)BRYNJOLFSSON: Damn. But, you know, Watson is growing up fast. It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them. It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs and getting some of them. Like the first two industrial revolutions, the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out, but they are staggering. RAZ: How do you imagine the economy of the industrialized world changing over the next 20 to 25 years? Will it be noticeable? BRYNJOLFSSON: It will it be huge. The economy in the next 20 to 25 years is going to change more than they did in the last 20, 25 years. And that's because these exponential trends are affecting a bigger and bigger share of the economy. So we have some huge disruptions in store, and I can't predict exactly what the innovations are going to be. If I did, I would have already invented them. But I think they'll be comparable to the innovations we saw in the past 20, 25 years if not greater. RAZ: So like something as significant as is the internet presumably? BRYNJOLFSSON: I'm sure that you know the Internet of Things sort of doesn't take a lot of creativity to see that coming down the pipeline where they'll be literally trillions of objects all connected in this digital infrastructures like the Earth growing a skin and a nervous system where all the objects can communicate with each other, and that's just one small part of this new world. RAZ: I mean, we could have a future in the not too distant future in which truck drivers are out of work because trucks are automated and driverless. And not just truck drivers. . . BRYNJOLFSSON: I think that's likely. No, I think that's likely. RAZ: . . . But university professors because every case study. . . BRYNJOLFSSON: Whoa, wait a minute (laughter). RAZ: . . . And every book will will be processed by a machine. Every case study of a business problem will be studied by a machine which will then be able to be a better consultant than a human consultant, better journalists than me because they will be able to analyze every interview ever done. And that machine could maybe do a better job. I mean, that's not out of the realm of possibility. BRYNJOLFSSON: It's not out of the realm of possibility, although you've got to think about the timelines. It's most useful to think about not jobs but tasks. And within any given job, there are lots of different tasks. If you're a radiologist maybe reading the images machines can be able to do that better, maybe making the broader diagnosis and communicating it to the patients. For a long time, the humans are going to be better at that than the machines and so different parts of the job will be leveraged. In a way that's happened for centuries, and we've adapted. And it's made the people who had parts of their jobs automated more valuable and more productive to the extent that they are essential for the other components of their jobs. RAZ: But, I mean, do you believe it's possible down the line that we could create an artificial thing of metal and ones and zeroes that is more empathetic and exercises better judgement than us and is just all around smarter than we are? BRYNJOLFSSON: Well, I'm certain of it. There's no question that it's possible. I mean, you know, in between your ears is a proof that there's a physical object that can do all those things. And I don't think there's some ghost in there. I think it's made of atoms and obeys the laws of physics. So we know that it's feasible, according the laws of physics. Are we able to figure it out well enough? I think that's going to be a matter of time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRYNJOLFSSON: The new machine age can be dated to a day 15 years ago when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion played Deep Blue, a supercomputer. The machine won that day, and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster. It got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer, Hein Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied I'd bring a hammer. (LAUGHTER)BRYNJOLFSSON: But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion, neither is a human because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament where teams of humans and computers could work together. And the winning team had no grandmaster and it had no supercomputer. What they had was better teamwork, and they showed that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer or any human working alone. Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine. Technology is not destiny. We shape our destiny. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, it makes total sense that we are going to be working with machines in ways that we can't even imagine. BRYNJOLFSSON: Yeah. And I think we'll be working very closely with machines in a couple of different ways. I mean, one is a little bit like the way we're doing it now where we interact with them, where we ask machines to do some data analysis. And there'll be more and more of a division of labor where we ask the questions, and the machines provide the answers. Pablo Picasso once berated computers saying, well, they're not very interesting. All they do is provide answers. And, you know, he had a point, that the really interesting and important part of work is asking the right questions and that's - for a long time that's still going to be the domain of humans. Going a little further into the future, we'll start literally connecting to machines. Some of my colleagues at MIT here - some of them are working on a neural mesh that connects directly to your brain, and they've already done it with some disabled people and allowed them to move objects just by thinking. So right now, the bandwidth is pretty slow. You can type maybe I think it's about 10 words per minute with these brain meshes, but you can see where the future is going with that as well. RAZ: I mean, I hate to sound pessimistic because by nature I try to be optimistic, but I ask myself this question a lot which is, you know, is this the future we want? Have we gotten to a place where the train has left the station where we don't really have much of a choice about where that future is headed? BRYNJOLFSSON: Well, let me try and cheer you up a little bit. Let's just step back and look at the fundamental. RAZ: Yeah, please. BRYNJOLFSSON: What are you and I talking about? We're talking about a world with vastly more wealth, vastly more power to solve all sorts of problems, vastly less need for us to work. Most routine drudgery could be eliminated. Shame on us. Shame on us if we mess that up and turn that into a bad thing. I mean, wouldn't that be the weirdest irony in the world that we take more wealth and less work and say, oh, what a terrible thing? I think we could essentially eliminate poverty from planet Earth. We could cure most diseases. In the global millennium goals, we're on track to beat them and eliminate severe poverty. So there are lots of positive trends. I think the world in 25 years could be a much better version of the world we have today. But the role of humans would still be fundamentally at the center of that. RAZ: Erik Brynjolfsson He's a professor and director of the MIT Initiative on the digital economy. You can see his full talk at ted. com. On the show today, ideas about the digital industrial revolution. In a moment why this is all very, very good and very, very bad.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Do I still see myself as a cowboy? Yeah, I do, and I hope I always do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Free porn has completely killed the industry as we know it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The black market is filled with people of color just like the prison that I was in. SUAREZ: This week's story takes us to West Virginia in the heart of Appalachian coal country. That's where we met emergency medical technician David Wiley, a 30-year-old former coal miner and father of three. Wiley spent the better part of his 20s jumping from job to job in the mines as the coal market fluctuated, until one day the jobs finally went dry. And Wiley was forced to find a new way forward. Now Wiley works for STAT Emergency Medical Services, a private ambulance company that serves communities across the region. We met up with Wiley as he waited in a parking lot for a dialysis patient. DAVID WILEY: We are at Bluefield, W. V. , dialysis center. We're waiting on a patient to come off of dialysis treatment, pick him up, take him back to the nursing home. We do this every Saturday - me and Rocky does. SUAREZ: We step inside the ambulance with David Wiley and his co-worker Rocky Lusk and ask David to describe his last job working in the coal mines. WILEY: Rocky used to be in the mines. Ask him. Rocky. ROCKY LUSK: Yo. WILEY: Paint these people a picture of when you first go underground. LUSK: Very dark. WILEY: (Laughter). SUAREZ: Growing up, the son of a lifelong coal miner, David Wiley saw the dangers of the work up close. His dad was injured in the mines losing several fingers, damaging his knees and back. WILEY: I really didn't want to get into coal mining. SUAREZ: Wiley says growing up in West Virginia, job prospects were slim, and he needed to find a way to help support his family. WILEY: I've always wanted to go to school, get me an education. But, you know, I had bills and stuff, and I had to find a job. So I just figured, well, I'll just try my hand at it, and sure enough I got a job underground. At the same time, I was excited. I really was because I was ready to make $22 an hour. That's really good money for anybody. You know, a young kid like me, I've never made that kind of money. My first day of work underground was awful. I was considered what they call a red hat, and all that is you're the low man on the totem pole. And they're going to work you as hard as they can work you to see if you break. It was horrible. You'd go in at night. You work from 11 to 7. You go home and sleep all day, then you just get up and go again. It's - I mean, you really didn't have no life. It starts playing the toll on you. You start getting back problems. You start having knee problems. You start getting hurt. I had a rock fall on me and crush my foot. You can tell when the coal market's up, then you can tell when the bottom drops 'cause they'll start laying people off. One mine might work good for a year then it might shut down. Then you go somewhere else, and it could work for two years, then it might shut down. I worked at one mine - we had over 500 men there at one time, and they shut the doors. Five hundred people lost their job. The last time I got laid off, started applying everywhere - I mean, Dollar Store, Wal-Mart. I mean, I was willing to take anything and everything. I was just surfing through the web and the job description was a CPR driver, and you would basically just drive an ambulance. I remember talking to Eddie. He is the HR manager for STAT, basically crying because my unemployment was getting ready to run out, and I had two babies at the time. And I couldn't figure out how I was going to feed them, and he gave me a shot. I went from making $30 an hour to 8. 75. But the advantage that this has over Lowe's or Wal-Mart or something is you get plenty of overtime. I've come in at like 3 in the morning and not get off till 3 in the morning. I remember my first cardiac arrest. I was working with the EMT doing chest compressions on this guy, pouring my heart out trying to keep this guy alive. Normally when someone calls for an ambulance, it's one of the worst days of their life. You pick up somebody they're on the verge of death, and you drop them off. And they're shaking your hands saying, you know, you mean a lot to me. It makes you feel like you're somebody then. That's enough payment. SUAREZ: David Wiley is an emergency medical technician in Pineville, W. V. He's currently studying to be certified as a paramedic, and he spoke to us for our series Brave New Workers on people adapting to a changing economy. RAY SUAREZ, HOST:  It's time for another installment in our series Brave New Workers, stories from people adapting to a changing economy. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Do I still see myself as a cowboy? Yeah, I do, and I hope I always do. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Free porn has completely killed the industry as we know it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The black market is filled with people of color just like the prison that I was in. SUAREZ: This week's story takes us to West Virginia in the heart of Appalachian coal country. That's where we met emergency medical technician David Wiley, a 30-year-old former coal miner and father of three. Wiley spent the better part of his 20s jumping from job to job in the mines as the coal market fluctuated, until one day the jobs finally went dry. And Wiley was forced to find a new way forward. Now Wiley works for STAT Emergency Medical Services, a private ambulance company that serves communities across the region. We met up with Wiley as he waited in a parking lot for a dialysis patient. DAVID WILEY: We are at Bluefield, W. V. , dialysis center. We're waiting on a patient to come off of dialysis treatment, pick him up, take him back to the nursing home. We do this every Saturday - me and Rocky does. SUAREZ: We step inside the ambulance with David Wiley and his co-worker Rocky Lusk and ask David to describe his last job working in the coal mines. WILEY: Rocky used to be in the mines. Ask him. Rocky. ROCKY LUSK: Yo. WILEY: Paint these people a picture of when you first go underground. LUSK: Very dark. WILEY: (Laughter). SUAREZ: Growing up, the son of a lifelong coal miner, David Wiley saw the dangers of the work up close. His dad was injured in the mines losing several fingers, damaging his knees and back. WILEY: I really didn't want to get into coal mining. SUAREZ: Wiley says growing up in West Virginia, job prospects were slim, and he needed to find a way to help support his family. WILEY: I've always wanted to go to school, get me an education. But, you know, I had bills and stuff, and I had to find a job. So I just figured, well, I'll just try my hand at it, and sure enough I got a job underground. At the same time, I was excited. I really was because I was ready to make $22 an hour. That's really good money for anybody. You know, a young kid like me, I've never made that kind of money. My first day of work underground was awful. I was considered what they call a red hat, and all that is you're the low man on the totem pole. And they're going to work you as hard as they can work you to see if you break. It was horrible. You'd go in at night. You work from 11 to 7. You go home and sleep all day, then you just get up and go again. It's - I mean, you really didn't have no life. It starts playing the toll on you. You start getting back problems. You start having knee problems. You start getting hurt. I had a rock fall on me and crush my foot. You can tell when the coal market's up, then you can tell when the bottom drops 'cause they'll start laying people off. One mine might work good for a year then it might shut down. Then you go somewhere else, and it could work for two years, then it might shut down. I worked at one mine - we had over 500 men there at one time, and they shut the doors.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. Americans have long expressed their political views with their wallets. In recent months, this has ramped up with boycotts and with buycotts. That's where people express support by buying a company's products. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: For months now, Nordstrom has been on a list of Trump-affiliated companies to boycott. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: This is just - it's a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully - I'm going to just give it - I'm going to give it free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I believe Uber recently due to what happened at JFK Airport when it appeared that Uber was essentially trying to break the strike. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fueled the outrage and led to some people to call for a boycott of the airline. NEERU PAHARIA: It seems like people are a little fed up and disillusioned with sort of conventional political channels where they would normally sort of express their political views. And so in the absence of that legitimacy, there's been sort of a rise in political consumerism. VEDANTAM: Neeru Paharia is a marketing professor at Georgetown University. She studies how consumer behavior often serves psychological needs, rather than economic needs. When we think about the way we spend money, we may think about the comfort of a nice pair of shoes while the pleasure of a great meal. But money also serves a deeper purpose. We use money to express our feelings, to project our status, to defend our values. The products we buy tell stories, stories that we tell others, stories that we tell ourselves. PAHARIA: For a small coffee shop, people don't really think much of the political situation. But as soon as you put a large competitor in next door - say, you put a Starbucks in next door, all of a sudden it becomes this fight between the little guy and the big guy. VEDANTAM: How Money Can Talk, this week on Hidden Brain. Neeru Paharia says she first became interested in the psychological power of consumer products because of the diamond industry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The diamond engagement ring - how else could two months salary last forever? PAHARIA: I studied economics as an undergraduate, and one thing they tell you as an economics major is that people are rational. VEDANTAM: But as far as Neeru could tell, there was nothing particularly rational about buying a diamond. Now, you can argue that diamonds are beautiful, but there are cheaper stones that are just as pretty. PAHARIA: So then the question is why are people spending so much money on these shiny rocks that have no intrinsic value? You know, there's effectively a perfect substitute, and then it seemed like it was all this kind of psychological stuff that people wanted to express their status. People wanted to kind of fit in with sort of the normative practices in terms of marriage. And it's just sort of dawned on me that products have all this psychological value and that's worth real money. I mean, a whole industry is based on just sort of pure kind of signaling and psychological value. And I found that to be really interesting and sort of at odds with this notion that people are rational. VEDANTAM: This idea made Neeru think about the other ways we use money as a signaling device to express our beliefs and our values. PAHARIA: We enact our political will usually by voting or supporting different kinds of legislations and things like that. So it's kind of interesting when people start taking that civic actions - these kind of civic actions into the market and then start by calling or boycotting a certain brand or a certain company in order to express their view. And you can kind of think about it in terms of what ends up being more tangible? So if we think about voting, it's sort of an abstract process. It's not very public, whereas when you buy a product or avoid buying a product it's very tangible. VEDANTAM: If you are someone who doesn't buy flashy jewelry, you may say, OK, I'm not one of those people who uses money to talk - maybe. Or maybe you just don't use diamonds to talk, you use coffee. PAHARIA: I've studied the situations between small coffee shops and large coffee shops. And so I have a paper where we show that for a small coffee shop, if it's just sitting there by itself, people, you know - people don't really think much of the political situation. They just think more about the coffee sort of about the more rational economic features and attributes of the product. But as soon as you put a large competitor in next door - say, you put a Starbucks in next door - all of a sudden it becomes this fight between the little guy and the big guy. And then buying your cup of coffee is really meaningful. All of a sudden, it's a symbol of what you believe in. It's a symbol of you supporting the little guy, of you supporting the underdog and trying to stick it to the man. And it's so tangible. And I just find it so fascinating that that's sort of how we kind of express our political views on a daily basis, and we feel, you know, powerful in a sense that we actually sort of have a say in the situation. VEDANTAM: Companies, of course, pay attention to what consumers want. They understand that people don't just want to buy a cup of coffee or a computer, they want the right story to go with that cup of coffee or computer. This is why so many Silicon Valley companies that are worth billions of dollars spend so much time telling us about their origin stories, how two kids dropped out of college to explore a dream in someone's garage. PAHARIA: So this is what we call - we have another paper around underdog brand biographies and this sort of idea of kind of starting in a garage from humble beginnings, but overcoming obstacles to kind of fulfill your dream, that's a really compelling narrative especially to Americans I think because of the whole kind of pull yourself up from your bootstraps and this whole notion of the American dream. And so companies that take advantage of that narrative, and if they use it effectively even as they grow, can kind of remind consumers that, you know, this was a small company, and they might, you know, identify with it more and less, you know, like penalize them less for being a large company. There tends to be sort of a - kind of an aversion or a disdain for large companies. People tend to kind of identify a lot more with smaller companies. VEDANTAM: And you tell the story of Nantucket Nectars which also has the same sort of start-up story. PAHARIA: A lot of companies, they talk about how Nantucket Nectars in particular talks about how they started with a blender and a dream. And Clif Bar talks about how, you know, they started in their garage with - he was living with his dog and his skis and, you know, was cooking. And is, you know, it's a sort of underdog narrative that makes use of this sort of external disadvantages, but really, you know, trying hard - and I think people really find that story resonating because I think we all on some level feel like underdogs. And so it sort of is - can be motivating to us. VEDANTAM: Companies are also extremely skilled at selling us things that are tied to a certain sense of identity. I remember this set of ads that Apple was running some years ago where they basically suggested that people who bought Macs were hipper and cooler than people who bought PCs. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Hello. I'm a Mac. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: And I'm a PC. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: I'm afraid to ask. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Well, I was sitting on my desk. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Someone walked by, carelessly tripped over my power cord, yanked me straight down to the ground. Bam. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Yikes. Macbooks come with this power cord that connects magnetically So when it gets pulled, it just pops right off, and everything's just kind of thought out. You know, like the tiny built-in eyesight camera. . . UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: My life is flashing before my eyes. I see a sunset in a field of beautiful wheat. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Isn't that your screen saver? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Yeah. VEDANTAM: They were basically saying if you buy this kind of computer, it sends a signal of the kind of person you are. It's not so much about your status, but how cool you are. PAHARIA: Yeah. And I think being cool is also a form of status. You know? You want to - and there's actually recent research on this by Warren and Campbell. And they talk about how coolness is essentially another way of kind of signaling your status which can be very compelling to certain groups of consumers who want to signal their autonomy, that they're not just drones and just kind of following the masses, but they - that they're autonomous, that they have kind of control and are kind of independently minded. VEDANTAM: There is some irony here in an advertising campaign by a major company trying to convince people that if you buy products made by that company, you're actually acting independently and autonomously when in fact the advertising is actually making you do what the company wants you to do. PAHARIA: Yeah, it is interesting. I mean, I remember in high school that there was a whole group of kids who would wear Metallica shirts, and they were trying to show how different they were. But yet they were all wearing Metallica shirts, and so they were sort of - it sort of defeated the purpose on some level. But it wasn't a - it wasn't immediately apparent to them. VEDANTAM: One thing that Neeru has found is that consumers are attracted not just to high-end brands, but to powerful brands. Wal-Mart can be a status symbol. PAHARIA: Yeah. It's kind of interesting. So there's this relationship between status and power and so status is a way - is sort of what we get when we have power. And so when we think about power, we can think about Wal-Mart as being a really powerful brand. It has a lot of strength in the marketplace and so that strength, that kind of access to power having a lot of resources as a brand in itself even though it's kind of a low-end brand, if you compare it to other low-end brands that can be kind of attractive to people who care about status. VEDANTAM: When we come back, I'm going to speak to Neeru about how we use money not just to express our values but to ignore them. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Many of us understand the economic choices we make can have real ethical consequences. The products we buy can adversely affect the environment or take advantage of poor people in distant countries. We can buy stuff from stores that treat their employees well or we can buy things sometimes at a cheaper price from stores that treat their employees poorly. Often after a big news story about conditions in sweatshops or the use of child labor, there's public outrage. But as Neeru Paharia has explored, our actions don't always match our rhetoric. She once wrote a paper on the subject titled \"Sweatshop Labor Is Wrong Unless The Shoes Are Cute. \"PAHARIA: The idea there is that you kind of decide how much you like something and so you really like a pair of shoes. And so then kind of the moral reasoning starts from there. It doesn't start from kind of a neutral place where you're like - you say, oh, sweatshop labor is wrong. You know, under any circumstances, I don't want to subject people to these unfortunate working conditions. It actually starts at a place where you're like, well, the products are really nice. And the shoes look really good on me. And then you start reasoning about it, and that's called motivated reasoning. So rather than think about morality in terms of this kind of objective thing, we kind of think about it more like a lawyer. So we decide what we want and then we kind of come up with the reasons to support it. So we may say, oh, if we see a pair of shoes that we don't like, we may say, oh, sweatshop labor is wrong. I don't like sweatshop labor. I don't approve. But if the shoes are cute, you might say something like, oh, it's OK because people need jobs or companies need to make money. So you'll be more likely to agree with these things because you're motivated in a sense the shoes are really cute. You really want them and so you want to find a way to kind of reconcile your kind of distaste for this situation and the kind of the reality of it. VEDANTAM: And you've actually conducted experiments which showed that people are more likely to reach for these kinds of rationalizations when they actually like a product. PAHARIA: Yes. Exactly. So if they like a product if you show them sort of an attractive pair of shoes, they'll be more likely to agree with these economic justifications. If you show them an unattractive pair of shoes, all of a sudden they become these kind of moral animals who say, oh, no, it's wrong. And so the idea is that we just decide what is moral based on how much we want something. VEDANTAM: One thing you've looked at is that we're often willing to go along with products that are ethically problematic, so long as we can come up with a way to distance ourselves from the unethical behavior that produced it. The more distance we can put between ourselves and the unethical behavior or the unethical action, the easier it becomes to perform. So this goes to the idea that if I went to the grocery store and asked for a chicken, and they went out and killed a chicken for me, I would feel worse about that than if I was just picking up the chicken from, you know - from a tray. And, of course, in both cases, a chicken had to be killed, but in one case I feel like I have actually asked for the chicken to be killed. In the other case, the dirty work has already been done. PAHARIA: Yeah. So there's a number of things that sort of enable us to not feel so close to the harm. I mean, essentially you're buying a product from a company, but what you're doing is you're hiring them to do kind of this dirty work for you. So, say, any clothing company - they're the ones who hire, you know, a child and maybe, you know, under some unfortunate conditions. You're not directly actually hiring that person, but I think the second thing that happens is this idea of the order of how kind of supply and demand happens. So we live in an economy where most items are produced first, and so they're already produced. They're already in the store. And so when you go to the store, the damage has been done so to speak. So it's already been done. It's already happened. But imagine that you went into that same store, and you had to order your chicken or your clothes on demand. So if you order it on demand, you know, they - then they will put a child, you know, have them work under these unfortunate conditions and then you start feeling responsible and guilty for this situation, where when it's already happened, you feel like, oh, well, it's already happened. And I'm not responsible for it. And I think people don't really kind of see this broader role that consumers have in creating demand for these kinds of products. They don't see that A causes B because it sort of happens backwards, that they actually make the product first and then you decide if you want it. But if we lived in an economy that was all on demand, then it would happen the other way. You would decide you want it, and then they would make it. And then there would be a stronger connection kind of a stronger cause-and-effect connection that I think people would then feel a bit more responsible and a bit more guilty for these kinds of situations. VEDANTAM: I can imagine that people would feel horrible if they said I want a shirt, and they have to send some poor 9-year-old kid into the basement to make the shirt for the next six hours. I mean, people would feel awful about that. PAHARIA: Yeah. And I think people wouldn't do it. And so then it kind of gets to this question of does the economic structure and the structure of how goods are made - does the kind of logistical structure impact how we think about ethics and how we think about our own role in enabling these kinds of harms? VEDANTAM: The companies who make stuff for us are run by people, and those people have minds that work like our minds. So it should come as no surprise that just as consumers would rather have companies do the dirty work for them to distance themselves from the ethical consequences of their economic actions, companies often choose to do exactly the same thing. Rather than run a factory that makes clothing under awful working conditions, why not outsource the dirty work to someone else? If a reporter unearths details of poor working conditions, you can now plausibly say I didn't know about it. PAHARIA: In many cases, companies actually do outsource the harm, so rather than own the factory that makes the clothing under, you know, these terrible conditions, we outsource them to other firms that are owned by other entities. So a lot of these companies do try and claim that they had no knowledge of this. This did not happen within the boundaries of my firm. VEDANTAM: It turns out that both individuals and companies often prefer to be kept in the dark about unethical practices that are further up the supply chain. PAHARIA: So there was an really. Really interesting paper by Julie Irwin and some other colleagues who wrote a paper on this idea of willful ignorance. And the idea was that you had a product and you had access to a whole bunch of different pieces of information. And one of them was the labor conditions or the environmental conditions. And the question was do people actually ask for this information? And you can look at it if you want, but you could decide not to look at it. And it turns out people didn't want to look at that information because they didn't really want to be confronted with this kind of conflict between their beliefs and, you know, what they really wanted. And they found this effect was stronger for people who cared more about labor issues, who cared more about environmental issues. They were more likely to avoid, you know - avoid this information in order to kind of avoid this conflict. VEDANTAM: Think of the deep irony of what Neeru just said. The folks who care the most about ethics might be most willing to turn a blind eye to unethical business practices because they know if they found out about those practices, they would feel obliged to do something about it. We've talked about the many ways in which consumers and companies play games with one another using products to speak on their behalf while using products behind which they can hide. But there's one dimension of economic activity we haven't explored, and that's time I asked Neeru how some of us use our calendars to broadcast our social status. It used to be that people once broadcast their social status by being idle, but that idea has been turned on its head in the United States. PAHARIA: It turns out nowadays that people who are busier actually seem to have more social status. So rather than somebody who is very wealthy who could waste their time, take fancy vacations, you know, invest in learning these kind of archaic mannerisms, it turns out the person who works really hard, who's really busy, who's very effortful is the one who seemed to have more social status. And I think in part that is because we live in a society that values social mobility. So we actually conducted the study in the U. S. , and we conducted the same study in Italy. And we found that for Italian people they thought the person who was living a life of leisure had more status. Of course, they have so much money. They can just relax all the time. Whereas in the U. S. , they thought the person who was working all the time actually had more status. And I think what was going on was that in the U. S. people sort of value this sense of earned status, so status can be earned in the U. S. where I think in Italy it's more of a society where status is inherited. So, for example, my co-author is Italian, and she's always talking about how people come from good families or not. And so there's very much this idea that your status isn't necessarily something that you earn, but you inherit. And so in that sense, working hard really wouldn't get you anywhere, whereas in America, you have this sense that you can actually climb the ladder. VEDANTAM: And so celebrities, for example, might say - instead of saying, you know, I make one movie every year and I get to hang out on the beach for the other 10 months of the year, they actually are suggesting, oh, my God, I'm so overworked. PAHARIA: Yeah. So we actually looked at tweets of celebrities who were tagged with this hashtag #humblebrag, this idea of bragging but sort of disguising it as a complaint. And a lot of the ones - a lot of the tweets we found had to do with being busy. So, you know, I have to be in the recording studio this morning, and then I have a book meeting in the afternoon. And then they have to travel to New York in the evening and #Ihavenolife. You know? These kinds of tweets - you're trying to say something about yourself. You're busy. You're really important. You don't have time to do other things, and so you see that on social media that's kind of an acceptable and effective way to show your status by telling people how busy you are. VEDANTAM: You - I want to ask about your own life, which is why I understand that growing up, you came from a family that in some ways prized not demonstrating its commitment to status that actually prized not buying the expensive things as a way to show off my. PAHARIA: So I'm of East Indian origin, and my parents immigrated to this country. And it turns out in East Indian communities, showing your social status is a very, very important thing. So people are really, really motivated to show their status. And when I was growing up, that was happening through buying, you know, really expensive cars. So a lot of my parents' friends - they had Jaguars, and they had Mercedes. And I remember we went to a friend's house one time, and they had a Jaguar. She was also Indian, and I asked her - she was complaining about her mom kind of being frugal about different things. And I said, oh, that's so strange because, you know, she's frugal, and yet you have a Jaguar. And she said, oh, well, that's just to show off. And I just - the candidness of that moment really, really, you know, sparked something in my mind. Like, wow, people are just trying to show off. And my my mom also would often complain about how all her friends would buy these expensive cars and the only reason they were doing it was to show off. And so I just - I kind of got really fascinated with the idea of showing your social status. And I think kind of an evidence of how things are shifting now towards - maybe towards something like busyness, now all her friends are retired. And they all brag about how busy they are. And now my mom complains about how everyone talks about how busy they are all the time. So I think, you know, it's sort of an evolving - kind of an evolving mechanism.

PAHARIA: I studied economics as an undergraduate, and one thing they tell you as an economics major is that people are rational. VEDANTAM: But as far as Neeru could tell, there was nothing particularly rational about buying a diamond. Now, you can argue that diamonds are beautiful, but there are cheaper stones that are just as pretty. PAHARIA: So then the question is why are people spending so much money on these shiny rocks that have no intrinsic value? You know, there's effectively a perfect substitute, and then it seemed like it was all this kind of psychological stuff that people wanted to express their status. People wanted to kind of fit in with sort of the normative practices in terms of marriage. And it's just sort of dawned on me that products have all this psychological value and that's worth real money. I mean, a whole industry is based on just sort of pure kind of signaling and psychological value. And I found that to be really interesting and sort of at odds with this notion that people are rational. VEDANTAM: This idea made Neeru think about the other ways we use money as a signaling device to express our beliefs and our values. PAHARIA: We enact our political will usually by voting or supporting different kinds of legislations and things like that. So it's kind of interesting when people start taking that civic actions - these kind of civic actions into the market and then start by calling or boycotting a certain brand or a certain company in order to express their view. And you can kind of think about it in terms of what ends up being more tangible? So if we think about voting, it's sort of an abstract process. It's not very public, whereas when you buy a product or avoid buying a product it's very tangible. VEDANTAM: If you are someone who doesn't buy flashy jewelry, you may say, OK, I'm not one of those people who uses money to talk - maybe. Or maybe you just don't use diamonds to talk, you use coffee. PAHARIA: I've studied the situations between small coffee shops and large coffee shops. And so I have a paper where we show that for a small coffee shop, if it's just sitting there by itself, people, you know - people don't really think much of the political situation. They just think more about the coffee sort of about the more rational economic features and attributes of the product. But as soon as you put a large competitor in next door - say, you put a Starbucks in next door - all of a sudden it becomes this fight between the little guy and the big guy. And then buying your cup of coffee is really meaningful. All of a sudden, it's a symbol of what you believe in. It's a symbol of you supporting the little guy, of you supporting the underdog and trying to stick it to the man. And it's so tangible. And I just find it so fascinating that that's sort of how we kind of express our political views on a daily basis, and we feel, you know, powerful in a sense that we actually sort of have a say in the situation. VEDANTAM: Companies, of course, pay attention to what consumers want. They understand that people don't just want to buy a cup of coffee or a computer, they want the right story to go with that cup of coffee or computer. This is why so many Silicon Valley companies that are worth billions of dollars spend so much time telling us about their origin stories, how two kids dropped out of college to explore a dream in someone's garage. PAHARIA: So this is what we call - we have another paper around underdog brand biographies and this sort of idea of kind of starting in a garage from humble beginnings, but overcoming obstacles to kind of fulfill your dream, that's a really compelling narrative especially to Americans I think because of the whole kind of pull yourself up from your bootstraps and this whole notion of the American dream. And so companies that take advantage of that narrative, and if they use it effectively even as they grow, can kind of remind consumers that, you know, this was a small company, and they might, you know, identify with it more and less, you know, like penalize them less for being a large company. There tends to be sort of a - kind of an aversion or a disdain for large companies. People tend to kind of identify a lot more with smaller companies. VEDANTAM: And you tell the story of Nantucket Nectars which also has the same sort of start-up story. PAHARIA: A lot of companies, they talk about how Nantucket Nectars in particular talks about how they started with a blender and a dream. And Clif Bar talks about how, you know, they started in their garage with - he was living with his dog and his skis and, you know, was cooking. And is, you know, it's a sort of underdog narrative that makes use of this sort of external disadvantages, but really, you know, trying hard - and I think people really find that story resonating because I think we all on some level feel like underdogs. And so it sort of is - can be motivating to us. VEDANTAM: Companies are also extremely skilled at selling us things that are tied to a certain sense of identity. I remember this set of ads that Apple was running some years ago where they basically suggested that people who bought Macs were hipper and cooler than people who bought PCs. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Hello. I'm a Mac. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: And I'm a PC. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: I'm afraid to ask. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Well, I was sitting on my desk. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Someone walked by, carelessly tripped over my power cord, yanked me straight down to the ground. Bam. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Yikes. Macbooks come with this power cord that connects magnetically So when it gets pulled, it just pops right off, and everything's just kind of thought out. You know, like the tiny built-in eyesight camera. . . UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: My life is flashing before my eyes. I see a sunset in a field of beautiful wheat. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: Isn't that your screen saver? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: Yeah. VEDANTAM: They were basically saying if you buy this kind of computer, it sends a signal of the kind of person you are. It's not so much about your status, but how cool you are. PAHARIA: Yeah. And I think being cool is also a form of status. You know? You want to - and there's actually recent research on this by Warren and Campbell. And they talk about how coolness is essentially another way of kind of signaling your status which can be very compelling to certain groups of consumers who want to signal their autonomy, that they're not just drones and just kind of following the masses, but they - that they're autonomous, that they have kind of control and are kind of independently minded. VEDANTAM: There is some irony here in an advertising campaign by a major company trying to convince people that if you buy products made by that company, you're actually acting independently and autonomously when in fact the advertising is actually making you do what the company wants you to do. PAHARIA: Yeah, it is interesting. I mean, I remember in high school that there was a whole group of kids who would wear Metallica shirts, and they were trying to show how different they were. But yet they were all wearing Metallica shirts, and so they were sort of - it sort of defeated the purpose on some level. But it wasn't a - it wasn't immediately apparent to them. VEDANTAM: One thing that Neeru has found is that consumers are attracted not just to high-end brands, but to powerful brands. Wal-Mart can be a status symbol. PAHARIA: Yeah. It's kind of interesting. So there's this relationship between status and power and so status is a way - is sort of what we get when we have power. And so when we think about power, we can think about Wal-Mart as being a really powerful brand. It has a lot of strength in the marketplace and so that strength, that kind of access to power having a lot of resources as a brand in itself even though it's kind of a low-end brand, if you compare it to other low-end brands that can be kind of attractive to people who care about status. VEDANTAM: When we come back, I'm going to speak to Neeru about how we use money not just to express our values but to ignore them. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. Many of us understand the economic choices we make can have real ethical consequences. The products we buy can adversely affect the environment or take advantage of poor people in distant countries. We can buy stuff from stores that treat their employees well or we can buy things sometimes at a cheaper price from stores that treat their employees poorly. Often after a big news story about conditions in sweatshops or the use of child labor, there's public outrage. But as Neeru Paharia has explored, our actions don't always match our rhetoric. She once wrote a paper on the subject titled \"Sweatshop Labor Is Wrong Unless The Shoes Are Cute. \" PAHARIA: The idea there is that you kind of decide how much you like something and so you really like a pair of shoes. And so then kind of the moral reasoning starts from there. It doesn't start from kind of a neutral place where you're like - you say, oh, sweatshop labor is wrong. You know, under any circumstances, I don't want to subject people to these unfortunate working conditions. It actually starts at a place where you're like, well, the products are really nice. And the shoes look really good on me. And then you start reasoning about it, and that's called motivated reasoning. So rather than think about morality in terms of this kind of objective thing, we kind of think about it more like a lawyer. So we decide what we want and then we kind of come up with the reasons to support it. So we may say, oh, if we see a pair of shoes that we don't like, we may say, oh, sweatshop labor is wrong. I don't like sweatshop labor. I don't approve. But if the shoes are cute, you might say something like, oh, it's OK because people need jobs or companies need to make money. So you'll be more likely to agree with these things because you're motivated in a sense the shoes are really cute. You really want them and so you want to find a way to kind of reconcile your kind of distaste for this situation and the kind of the reality of it. VEDANTAM: And you've actually conducted experiments which showed that people are more likely to reach for these kinds of rationalizations when they actually like a product. PAHARIA: Yes. Exactly. So if they like a product if you show them sort of an attractive pair of shoes, they'll be more likely to agree with these economic justifications. If you show them an unattractive pair of shoes, all of a sudden they become these kind of moral animals who say, oh, no, it's wrong. And so the idea is that we just decide what is moral based on how much we want something. VEDANTAM: One thing you've looked at is that we're often willing to go along with products that are ethically problematic, so long as we can come up with a way to distance ourselves from the unethical behavior that produced it. The more distance we can put between ourselves and the unethical behavior or the unethical action, the easier it becomes to perform. So this goes to the idea that if I went to the grocery store and asked for a chicken, and they went out and killed a chicken for me, I would feel worse about that than if I was just picking up the chicken from, you know - from a tray. And, of course, in both cases, a chicken had to be killed, but in one case I feel like I have actually asked for the chicken to be killed. In the other case, the dirty work has already been done. PAHARIA: Yeah. So there's a number of things that sort of enable us to not feel so close to the harm. I mean, essentially you're buying a product from a company, but what you're doing is you're hiring them to do kind of this dirty work for you. So, say, any clothing company - they're the ones who hire, you know, a child and maybe, you know, under some unfortunate conditions. You're not directly actually hiring that person, but I think the second thing that happens is this idea of the order of how kind of supply and demand happens. So we live in an economy where most items are produced first, and so they're already produced. They're already in the store. And so when you go to the store, the damage has been done so to speak. So it's already been done. It's already happened. But imagine that you went into that same store, and you had to order your chicken or your clothes on demand. So if you order it on demand, you know, they - then they will put a child, you know, have them work under these unfortunate conditions and then you start feeling responsible and guilty for this situation, where when it's already happened, you feel like, oh, well, it's already happened. And I'm not responsible for it. And I think people don't really kind of see this broader role that consumers have in creating demand for these kinds of products. They don't see that A causes B because it sort of happens backwards, that they actually make the product first and then you decide if you want it. But if we lived in an economy that was all on demand, then it would happen the other way. You would decide you want it, and then they would make it. And then there would be a stronger connection kind of a stronger cause-and-effect connection that I think people would then feel a bit more responsible and a bit more guilty for these kinds of situations. VEDANTAM: I can imagine that people would feel horrible if they said I want a shirt, and they have to send some poor 9-year-old kid into the basement to make the shirt for the next six hours. I mean, people would feel awful about that. PAHARIA: Yeah. And I think people wouldn't do it. And so then it kind of gets to this question of does the economic structure and the structure of how goods are made - does the kind of logistical structure impact how we think about ethics and how we think about our own role in enabling these kinds of harms? VEDANTAM: The companies who make stuff for us are run by people, and those people have minds that work like our minds. So it should come as no surprise that just as consumers would rather have companies do the dirty work for them to distance themselves from the ethical consequences of their economic actions, companies often choose to do exactly the same thing. Rather than run a factory that makes clothing under awful working conditions, why not outsource the dirty work to someone else? If a reporter unearths details of poor working conditions, you can now plausibly say I didn't know about it. PAHARIA: In many cases, companies actually do outsource the harm, so rather than own the factory that makes the clothing under, you know, these terrible conditions, we outsource them to other firms that are owned by other entities. So a lot of these companies do try and claim that they had no knowledge of this. This did not happen within the boundaries of my firm. VEDANTAM: It turns out that both individuals and companies often prefer to be kept in the dark about unethical practices that are further up the supply chain. PAHARIA: So there was an really. Really interesting paper by Julie Irwin and some other colleagues who wrote a paper on this idea of willful ignorance. And the idea was that you had a product and you had access to a whole bunch of different pieces of information. And one of them was the labor conditions or the environmental conditions. And the question was do people actually ask for this information? And you can look at it if you want, but you could decide not to look at it. And it turns out people didn't want to look at that information because they didn't really want to be confronted with this kind of conflict between their beliefs and, you know, what they really wanted. And they found this effect was stronger for people who cared more about labor issues, who cared more about environmental issues. They were more likely to avoid, you know - avoid this information in order to kind of avoid this conflict. VEDANTAM: Think of the deep irony of what Neeru just said. The folks who care the most about ethics might be most willing to turn a blind eye to unethical business practices because they know if they found out about those practices, they would feel obliged to do something about it. We've talked about the many ways in which consumers and companies play games with one another using products to speak on their behalf while using products behind which they can hide. But there's one dimension of economic activity we haven't explored, and that's time I asked Neeru how some of us use our calendars to broadcast our social status. It used to be that people once broadcast their social status by being idle, but that idea has been turned on its head in the United States. PAHARIA: It turns out nowadays that people who are busier actually seem to have more social status. So rather than somebody who is very wealthy who could waste their time, take fancy vacations, you know, invest in learning these kind of archaic mannerisms, it turns out the person who works really hard, who's really busy, who's very effortful is the one who seemed to have more social status. And I think in part that is because we live in a society that values social mobility. So we actually conducted the study in the U. S. , and we conducted the same study in Italy. And we found that for Italian people they thought the person who was living a life of leisure had more status. Of course, they have so much money. They can just relax all the time. Whereas in the U. S. , they thought the person who was working all the time actually had more status. And I think what was going on was that in the U. S. people sort of value this sense of earned status, so status can be earned in the U. S. where I think in Italy it's more of a society where status is inherited. So, for example, my co-author is Italian, and she's always talking about how people come from good families or not. And so there's very much this idea that your status isn't necessarily something that you earn, but you inherit. And so in that sense, working hard really wouldn't get you anywhere, whereas in America, you have this sense that you can actually climb the ladder. VEDANTAM: And so celebrities, for example, might say - instead of saying, you know, I make one movie every year and I get to hang out on the beach for the other 10 months of the year, they actually are suggesting, oh, my God, I'm so overworked. PAHARIA: Yeah. So we actually looked at tweets of celebrities who were tagged with this hashtag #humblebrag, this idea of bragging but sort of disguising it as a complaint. And a lot of the ones - a lot of the tweets we found had to do with being busy. So, you know, I have to be in the recording studio this morning, and then I have a book meeting in the afternoon. And then they have to travel to New York in the evening and #Ihavenolife. You know? These kinds of tweets - you're trying to say something about yourself. You're busy. You're really important. You don't have time to do other things, and so you see that on social media that's kind of an acceptable and effective way to show your status by telling people how busy you are. VEDANTAM: You - I want to ask about your own life, which is why I understand that growing up, you came from a family that in some ways prized not demonstrating its commitment to status that actually prized not buying the expensive things as a way to show off my. PAHARIA: So I'm of East Indian origin, and my parents immigrated to this country. And it turns out in East Indian communities, showing your social status is a very, very important thing. So people are really, really motivated to show their status. And when I was growing up, that was happening through buying, you know, really expensive cars. So a lot of my parents' friends - they had Jaguars, and they had Mercedes. And I remember we went to a friend's house one time, and they had a Jaguar. She was also Indian, and I asked her - she was complaining about her mom kind of being frugal about different things. And I said, oh, that's so strange because, you know, she's frugal, and yet you have a Jaguar. And she said, oh, well, that's just to show off. And I just - the candidness of that moment really, really, you know, sparked something in my mind. Like, wow, people are just trying to show off. And my my mom also would often complain about how all her friends would buy these expensive cars and the only reason they were doing it was to show off. And so I just - I kind of got really fascinated with the idea of showing your social status. And I think kind of an evidence of how things are shifting now towards - maybe towards something like busyness, now all her friends are retired. And they all brag about how busy they are. And now my mom complains about how everyone talks about how busy they are all the time. So I think, you know, it's sort of an evolving - kind of an evolving mechanism.

It did mention fewer tax brackets, fewer deductions and a lower business tax. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promoted these ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)STEVEN MNUCHIN: The overall economic plan consists of massive tax cuts and tax reform, regulatory relief and renegotiating trade deals. And with that, we will unlock the economic growth that's been held back for too long in this country. INSKEEP: We have two more views of that document. Peter Morici is a conservative economist at the University of Maryland. Good morning to you, sir. PETER MORICI: Good morning. INSKEEP: Joined once again by Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Biden. Thanks to you for coming by. JARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK. Is this plan - this one page - serious? BERNSTEIN: I would say no. I mean, first of all, it's not really a plan. It looks sort of like a shopping list for rich people who want to avoid taxes. It's going - the big problems are at least two-fold. One is it's going to increase the budget deficit probably by around $5 trillion over 10 years. Now, there are times when you want your budget deficit to go up, say, to offset economic weakness. This is not one of them, so it squanders needed revenues, revenues we're going to need in the future, to give a bunch of wasteful tax cuts to rich people. It's also highly disequalizing, which is something we also don't need. INSKEEP: That's Jared Bernstein. Peter Morici, what do you think? MORICI: Well, it adheres to certain conservative principles. That is simplifying the tax system, eliminating deductions, compressing the rates and so forth. For many upper-income people, it'll mean higher taxes. For example, in New York, by eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes, it'd make their taxes higher. I do find it amusing, the notion that we can't afford a tax cut now when six months ago - and when Jared's team had the White House - they thought that spending more money and increasing the budget deficit would be just fine. So it seems as though Democratic deficits by the government spending money are fine, but people getting to keep more of their own money to spend it. . . INSKEEP: Jared raises a finger here. Go ahead. BERNSTEIN: Completely inconsistent and not representative. In fact, not only did Barack Obama try to increase taxes, he actually did. And if you recall in his second term, he ran on that program. So that's false. Also - excuse me - his budget deficit was 10 percent, came down to about 2 or 3 percent by the time he left. INSKEEP: Let's just talk about the present day here for the moment. . . BERNSTEIN: Yeah. So here's the thing. . . INSKEEP: . . . Because this does seem to be - whoa, whoa, whoa. BERNSTEIN: Let me just correct. . . (CROSSTALK)BERNSTEIN: No, no. I got to correct one thing Peter said. INSKEEP: Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. OK, so let's just deal with the fact that there are proposed tax cuts here. There are not specific deductions, very many of them, that are named. It does appear to raise the deficit. Is that OK with you, Peter Morici? MORICI: Oh, I think it raises the deficit, and it's not OK with me. My feeling is is that we really - if we want to cut taxes overall, then we need to cut spending to do it. I'm very disappointed that the proposal doesn't have details. These guys have had the White House in focus since November. By now, they should have a plan. It really shows that the White House lacks expertise. Mnuchin and Cohn have excellent business backgrounds. INSKEEP: Gary Cohn, that's another one of the top economic advisers. MORICI: Right, his - basically an aluminum siding salesman, silver trader who managed his way up in Goldman Sachs largely as an administrator and Mnuchin, who basically turned around a bank. But that doesn't give them expertise on tax policy or trade policy or what have you. This is nothing but the - basically, it's Newt Gingrich's Christmas list at 12. INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK. Jared Bernstein, granted that you clearly don't like this plan, is there anything in here for Democrats? BERNSTEIN: Not really. I mean, first of all, I do just want to correct something 'cause it is a - it's really a key point here. INSKEEP: Oh, and you're still boiling on this thing from earlier. BERNSTEIN: And that's that - it's that - look. The taxes on the upper-income folks, say the top 1 percent, are definitely going down under this plan. That's not at all. . . INSKEEP: It lowers the top bracket. BERNSTEIN: It lowers the - but I'm just saying. And as far as middle and lower-income people, it does increase the standard deduction, so that'll help a little bit folks in the middle. And then there's a bit of an increase in a child care tax credit. But those are just tiny little de minimis parts of this tax - when you get rid of the alternative minimum tax, get rid of the estate tax, when you take the corporate rate down to 15 percent, when you have pass-through rate that's - these are huge tax cuts for those at the top. INSKEEP: Although there is a line here and this one page - eliminate targeted tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. MORICI: That's right. I think that folks, for example, in New York who are on wage income, say, a physician who works for a hospital, will likely see higher taxes because - not terribly higher but because, simply, the reduction in the rate doesn't compensate for the loss of those deductions and exemptions, in particular, the state and local taxes. The question is, how far do they go with that? How many deductions and exemptions do they get rid of? INSKEEP: And can I just mention also it specifically says we're going to protect the home ownership and charitable gift tax deduction. So we're going to get rid of deductions except not the popular ones. MORICI: Those won't help the wealthy very much because. . . BERNSTEIN: Those are those are two big deductions. Look. Let me - Peter brought up an interesting point. Take the high-paid physician in New York or any other place. INSKEEP: OK. BERNSTEIN: That person under this plan, she now has an incentive to incorporate her business because she can go from paying 35 percent - the top rate on this plan - if she just pays. . . INSKEEP: As an individual. BERNSTEIN: . . . The tax - the individual rate. Under this plan, the pass-through rate is 15 percent. So she goes to her boss tomorrow and says, I am no longer a physician working for Hospital X. I am now an LLC or self - a self - what do you call it? An S-corp. INSKEEP: Limited liability. BERNSTEIN: You know, one of the - limited liability. And then she's paying 15 percent, so that's a huge tax cut. And that's a loophole in this plan. MORICI: It is not so easy to go from becoming an employee to a consultant in that manner. The IRS is very, very aggressive about reclassifying people if they try to turn themselves from an employee to a consultant. Where the real issue is is when people have LLCs because they do have speaking income or they work independently, how much of that they report as wage income. INSKEEP: Just got about 30 seconds. Is Congress going to do anything with this proposal anyway? BERNSTEIN: I think this is going to be a heavy lift for Congress. There are even Republicans who are grumbling now already about the deficit implication. INSKEEP: And Peter Morici, you get the last word here. MORICI: I would agree with that. I have a lot of problems, and I think that my moderate friends on the Hill share them. Increasing the deficit - 15 percent corporate rate, not liftable (ph). INSKEEP: OK. All right. Peter Morici is a conservative economist at the University of Maryland and Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist for Vice President Biden. Gentlemen, you can take off the gloves now and towel off. Thank you very much for taking the time. BERNSTEIN: Take care. (SOUNDBITE OF KAMASI WASHINGTON'S \"FINAL THOUGHT\") STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   When President Trump released a tax proposal yesterday, it wasn't hard to read - one page, mostly double spaced, bullet points, lots of white space. It did mention fewer tax brackets, fewer deductions and a lower business tax. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promoted these ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) STEVEN MNUCHIN: The overall economic plan consists of massive tax cuts and tax reform, regulatory relief and renegotiating trade deals. And with that, we will unlock the economic growth that's been held back for too long in this country. INSKEEP: We have two more views of that document. Peter Morici is a conservative economist at the University of Maryland. Good morning to you, sir. PETER MORICI: Good morning. INSKEEP: Joined once again by Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Biden. Thanks to you for coming by. JARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK. Is this plan - this one page - serious? BERNSTEIN: I would say no. I mean, first of all, it's not really a plan. It looks sort of like a shopping list for rich people who want to avoid taxes. It's going - the big problems are at least two-fold. One is it's going to increase the budget deficit probably by around $5 trillion over 10 years. Now, there are times when you want your budget deficit to go up, say, to offset economic weakness. This is not one of them, so it squanders needed revenues, revenues we're going to need in the future, to give a bunch of wasteful tax cuts to rich people. It's also highly disequalizing, which is something we also don't need. INSKEEP: That's Jared Bernstein. Peter Morici, what do you think? MORICI: Well, it adheres to certain conservative principles. That is simplifying the tax system, eliminating deductions, compressing the rates and so forth. For many upper-income people, it'll mean higher taxes. For example, in New York, by eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes, it'd make their taxes higher. I do find it amusing, the notion that we can't afford a tax cut now when six months ago - and when Jared's team had the White House - they thought that spending more money and increasing the budget deficit would be just fine. So it seems as though Democratic deficits by the government spending money are fine, but people getting to keep more of their own money to spend it. . . INSKEEP: Jared raises a finger here. Go ahead. BERNSTEIN: Completely inconsistent and not representative. In fact, not only did Barack Obama try to increase taxes, he actually did. And if you recall in his second term, he ran on that program. So that's false. Also - excuse me - his budget deficit was 10 percent, came down to about 2 or 3 percent by the time he left. INSKEEP: Let's just talk about the present day here for the moment. . . BERNSTEIN: Yeah. So here's the thing. . . INSKEEP: . . . Because this does seem to be - whoa, whoa, whoa. BERNSTEIN: Let me just correct. . . (CROSSTALK) BERNSTEIN: No, no.

S. economy got off to a rocky start this year. That's according to the latest numbers from the Commerce Department. The economy grew at just 0. 7 percent in the first quarter, the weakest rate in three years. Growth barely above zero is nobody's idea of boom time, but as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, it may not be as bad as it looks. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: President Trump says his policies are going to dramatically boost economic growth. But this report seems to show that that is not happening yet. BETSEY STEVENSON: I think that there's probably a lot of disappointment in the White House today. ARNOLD: Betsey Stevenson was an economic adviser to President Obama, so she knows what it's like for a White House to get a weak report on the economy. STEVENSON: They were hoping to see a big Trump bump in the Q1 GDP estimate. And obviously the only way to see that bump is to squint. ARNOLD: But actually, Stevenson says if you do squint at this report and ignore the worst-in-three-years headline, there are actually some good signs for the economy. For one thing, she says in recent years, businesses have been too cautious to spend on better equipment and new technology. And she says that slowed down innovation and so-called productivity gains. Those are really important for a healthy economy. In this report, though, businesses were spending a lot more money in the first quarter. STEVENSON: That is really exciting, and that suggests that we're moving into the right trajectory, that that will lead us to the higher productivity gains and the higher economic growth that investments and physical capital can generate. ARNOLD: On the downside, though, consumer spending was very weak, the worst quarterly numbers since 2009. But in any one quarterly report, analysts say you don't want to make too much of the good or the bad. Randall Kroszner is a University of Chicago economist and a former governor of the Federal Reserve. RANDALL KROSZNER: The U. S. economy is an enormous, massive thing, and to try to get all the numbers together really quickly is pretty tough. ARNOLD: For some reason, the first quarter of every year has been particularly tough. That GDP growth number has come in low repeatedly, and then growth has bounced back in the second and third quarters. Kroszner expects to see that this year, too. Diane Swonk of DS Economics agrees. She's predicting a pretty good economy in the spring and summer. DIANE SWONK: The underlying fundamentals were already there. The economy was improving as we moved into 2017. ARNOLD: But Swonk says with the Trump administration, there are still some very big unknowns. Will those big tax cuts get through? Will infrastructure spending happen? What about NAFTA - not to mention the geopolitical risk, such as tough talk on North Korea. SWONK: I think what's very important is uncertainty. I talk to a lot of CEOs, and there's sort of a deer-in-the-headlights kind of look right now about what the policy environment looks like coming out of Washington. And that's something we are concerned about going forward. ARNOLD: But at least for now, job growth remains solid. Wages are rising. And most analysts think that the economy's on the right track.

Some say it's the Trump bump, the belief that big tax cuts and deregulation in the future will boost company profits. But some are skeptical that Trump can deliver and think the market is overvalued. Here's Charles Lane of member station WSHU. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: The stock market is overvalued by conventional measures. On average, what investors have to pay for a company's stock compared to what that company is expected to earn in profit, that metric has only been higher twice before - before the Great Depression and before the tech bubble burst in 1999. So these aren't exactly uncharted waters per se. REBECCA PATTERSON: What's another good water analogy - choppy waters, deep waters, boiling waters. LANE: Rebecca Patterson is chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an advisory firm for wealthy families. She looks at the inflated price of the market and sees the rally coming to an end, especially if Trump and Congress don't cut regulations or reform the tax code like promised. PATTERSON: If the reality, the actual policy that goes through, disappoints expectations, equity markets will be vulnerable, especially given the current valuations. LANE: A problem with using historical metrics to judge current value is that they don't account for the near record low interest rates we have. Jonathan Golub is with the investment bank RBC Capital Markets. He says an overvalued S&P is justified because the chance for recession right now is slim to none. JONATHAN GOLUB: Are we creating jobs every month - yes. Are we selling more houses every month - yes. Is inflation picking up - yes. LANE: Also, banks are loaning more money. Manufacturers see more sales. CFOs are planning big capital projects. Golub says policymakers and the media are causing temporary swings in parts of the market. But in the end, it's just noise. GOLUB: As a matter of fact, if you took a basket or a list of the companies that would benefit the most from Trump's tax policy or the most from Trump's America First policy and then you look at how they're doing compared to the overall stock market at large, they're basically exactly the same. LANE: Barring something out of the blue, Golub says stock prices should go higher once policy details are clear. Citigroup's Tobias Levkovich agrees. He recently surveyed institutional investors and found most are not buying on policy promises yet. And he says 45 percent don't expect major GOP accomplishments until 2018. TOBIAS LEVKOVICH: Less than 30 percent thought it would happen in the second half of '17. Nobody's expecting it to happen tomorrow. LANE: What's surprising about these current market highs is that since January, most stocks have not risen in value. According to a recent study by Fundstrat Global Advisors, it's only the top 40 companies that have rallied. The other 460 companies in the S&P 500 are essentially flat for the year. Eric Marshall is portfolio manager for Hodges Capital Management. ERIC MARSHALL: As a whole, we see this is as very much a bifurcated market in which some areas of the market are relatively expensive while others are not. LANE: He says at the end of the day, what investors care about are the earnings and cash flow of the businesses they own stock in. He does expect those to improve but not for another couple of years.

His words could move global markets. He hasn't had to be quite as circumspect since leaving the Federal Reserve chairmanship three years ago, and it suits him. BEN BERNANKE: It's been good. It's nice not to have those responsibilities anymore and to have more flexibility, more time. I blog, and I give speeches. MARTIN: Bernanke has been writing and speaking about the economy of course but also about how political partisans view it and who is left behind by economic change. Bernanke came into our studios late last week. So you're three years out from working as the chair of the Fed. How are we doing when you look at the economy big-picture right now? BERNANKE: Well, from the Fed's perspective, things are going pretty well. On the employment side - unemployment, you know, is down to 4. 5 percent, which is quite low. On the inflation side, the Fed is pretty close to its 2 percent target. And so in many dimensions, the economy has recovered pretty well from the Great Recession. And indeed now, relative to Europe, Japan, other advanced industrial economies - the U. S. is looking pretty good. MARTIN: So why were there so many people who thought otherwise? I mean, when we consider the campaign and the part of the country that saw in Donald Trump someone who recognized how hard their lives were, how the economy wasn't working for them - how do you account for that disconnect? BERNANKE: Well, it's an absolutely fair question. I think there's kind of two broad reasons. One is that while the economy in the near term has done pretty well in terms of its improvement, recovery from the recession, there are some long-term trends which have been difficult for a lot of people, including reduced social mobility. Inequality's increased. Wages have not improved for many people for a long time. They're just not the kinds of things that the Fed, in its short-term focus, pays a lot of attention to, at least in terms of its policymaking. But they are nevertheless real, and they've caused a lot of pain and disruption. I think in addition to these legitimate, serious problems, there's an awful lot of partisanship in the United States today so that people tend to look at the economy through a very partisan lens. It's quite striking that the day of the election - when Mr. Trump won the election, that Republicans' views of the current economy greatly improved. And Democrats' views of the current economy greatly worsened. And so to some extent, it's kind of like a. . . MARTIN: Which was a flip. BERNANKE: It was a flip. But the economy, of course, is what it is. And to give candidate Trump credit, he tapped into some real unhappiness about the way the economy's performed over the long term. MARTIN: The president unveiled the broad outlines of a tax policy recently, slashing corporate tax rates to about 15 percent. His treasury secretary says they'll pay for themselves in economic growth. What do you make of this plan, the broad outlines of this? BERNANKE: Well, it should first be said that we don't really know that much about the plan. There's only been a few numbers. There's not really any details at all. In terms of paying for itself, I don't think any outside arbiter, including those from the conservative side, would argue that's realistic. So I think we have to accept that if you do cut rates the way that the proposal suggests, there would be a big increase in the deficit. Today, my own personal priority would be two things. One would be to invest in public infrastructure to make our economy more productive. MARTIN: Which is something President Trump has said he wants to do. BERNANKE: Which he said he's done - but it appears to be not the top priority at this point. And the other thing is that there has been discussion about tax reform, as opposed to tax cuts, to improve, simplify, clean up the tax code to make it more supportive of growth. MARTIN: You have written a new afterword to a book that you published a few months ago about the economic crisis. And in this, you've pointed to some criticisms of Donald Trump's campaign promises about the economy, his statements about the unemployment rate or tax rates which you call, quote, \"seriously inaccurate or at least distorted. \" What do you think has been the effect of those misstatements on the economy? BERNANKE: Well, I think it's important that we can disagree on policies, but we have to get the facts right. By the way, I mean, one of the things that I am concerned about as an economist is that Congress may cut the budgets of organizations like the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the unemployment rate. It's really important that we have good numbers so that we understand what's actually going on in the economy. Otherwise, our policies are not going to be very effective. MARTIN: You were quoted in the Times that when you think about the economy and global markets that people have been left out and that doing well - and I'm quoting here - \"doing well on the whole doesn't mean doing well for everybody. \" Is that just a reality of living in a globalized world, that some people will be left out? And if it is, what is the collective responsibility to those people? BERNANKE: I think that economists bear some blame here. And for a long time, economists have focused on the benefits of trade and globalization, the benefits of technological change and progress, how that does increase the overall income and level of output in the economy. All that is true. But change can be very disruptive. It can be very costly, at least to some people. And I think if we want to promote change and allow change, we've got to bring everybody along as much as possible, which means we need to pay serious attention to those communities and those individuals who are disrupted by change. So I. . . MARTIN: Attention or money? Do you have to put money in that - retraining programs. . . BERNANKE: Well, often, money is involved. I mean - for example, if you want to have a job training program, that costs something. I don't think that we just want to rely on welfare or even tax refunds, things of that sort. I think instead it's important for us to use our creativity. And a lot of this is going to happen not at the federal level; a lot of this is going to happen at the state and local level. MARTIN: You were thrust into the worst economic recession this country has seen in generations and were forced to make very difficult decisions in dramatic fashion to prop up the economy during the recession. When you look back now and when you look forward, are you confident that we won't see the likes of that in the near term or medium term? BERNANKE: Well, we had to stabilize that situation. And then we had to take strong action to help the economy recover. We - and I say - now, I'm talking about policymakers in general and the whole economy - have been successful in recovering and bringing the economy back to a more normal situation. Now, I do have some concern about this in that we did a lot of work following the crisis to improve our oversight of the financial system to make sure that banks have more capital. And I'm a bit concerned that some of the proposals in Congress today would roll back a lot of those important regulations. I don't mean to say that all regulations are effective. I'm not saying that you can't make changes. But the key elements of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reforms that were done, including higher capital levels, tougher oversight and in particular the tools we needed to unwind a failing financial giant so it didn't bring down the whole economy. Those things were put in place, and I'd be very, very concerned about the future if those things were taken away. MARTIN: Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke. He's now a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution here in Washington. His updated book, \"The Courage To Act,\" is out this week in paperback. Mr. Bernanke, thanks so much for your time. BERNANKE: Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Ben Bernanke had to guard his public comments closely during the eight years he served as the world's most powerful central banker. His words could move global markets. He hasn't had to be quite as circumspect since leaving the Federal Reserve chairmanship three years ago, and it suits him. BEN BERNANKE: It's been good. It's nice not to have those responsibilities anymore and to have more flexibility, more time. I blog, and I give speeches. MARTIN: Bernanke has been writing and speaking about the economy of course but also about how political partisans view it and who is left behind by economic change. Bernanke came into our studios late last week. So you're three years out from working as the chair of the Fed. How are we doing when you look at the economy big-picture right now? BERNANKE: Well, from the Fed's perspective, things are going pretty well. On the employment side - unemployment, you know, is down to 4. 5 percent, which is quite low. On the inflation side, the Fed is pretty close to its 2 percent target. And so in many dimensions, the economy has recovered pretty well from the Great Recession. And indeed now, relative to Europe, Japan, other advanced industrial economies - the U. S. is looking pretty good. MARTIN: So why were there so many people who thought otherwise? I mean, when we consider the campaign and the part of the country that saw in Donald Trump someone who recognized how hard their lives were, how the economy wasn't working for them - how do you account for that disconnect? BERNANKE: Well, it's an absolutely fair question. I think there's kind of two broad reasons. One is that while the economy in the near term has done pretty well in terms of its improvement, recovery from the recession, there are some long-term trends which have been difficult for a lot of people, including reduced social mobility. Inequality's increased. Wages have not improved for many people for a long time. They're just not the kinds of things that the Fed, in its short-term focus, pays a lot of attention to, at least in terms of its policymaking. But they are nevertheless real, and they've caused a lot of pain and disruption. I think in addition to these legitimate, serious problems, there's an awful lot of partisanship in the United States today so that people tend to look at the economy through a very partisan lens. It's quite striking that the day of the election - when Mr. Trump won the election, that Republicans' views of the current economy greatly improved. And Democrats' views of the current economy greatly worsened. And so to some extent, it's kind of like a. . . MARTIN: Which was a flip. BERNANKE: It was a flip. But the economy, of course, is what it is. And to give candidate Trump credit, he tapped into some real unhappiness about the way the economy's performed over the long term. MARTIN: The president unveiled the broad outlines of a tax policy recently, slashing corporate tax rates to about 15 percent. His treasury secretary says they'll pay for themselves in economic growth. What do you make of this plan, the broad outlines of this? BERNANKE: Well, it should first be said that we don't really know that much about the plan. There's only been a few numbers. There's not really any details at all. In terms of paying for itself, I don't think any outside arbiter, including those from the conservative side, would argue that's realistic. So I think we have to accept that if you do cut rates the way that the proposal suggests, there would be a big increase in the deficit. Today, my own personal priority would be two things. One would be to invest in public infrastructure to make our economy more productive. MARTIN: Which is something President Trump has said he wants to do. BERNANKE: Which he said he's done - but it appears to be not the top priority at this point. And the other thing is that there has been discussion about tax reform, as opposed to tax cuts, to improve, simplify, clean up the tax code to make it more supportive of growth.

So far this year, nine U. S. chains have filed for bankruptcy, and over the last five months, 89,000 workers have lost their jobs. And the surprising thing is that this is going on at a time when the overall economy is doing pretty well. NPR's Yuki Noguchi begins our coverage. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Retailers typically reassess their businesses after the holiday shopping numbers come in and adjust by closing or reallocating resources. For some big national chains, this year, that process is turning out to be a bloodbath. The Limited stores, electronics store hhgregg and clothing chain BCBG all filed for bankruptcy. So far, 3,100 store locations have closed, more than all of last year combined. JCPenney said it would close another 138 stores this year, Sears and Kmart 150, Macy's 100. Mark Cohen was CEO of Sears Canada until 2004. He now directs retail studies at Columbia Business School. MARK COHEN: I think the disruption is just unfolding. I think the number of store closings will continue at an accelerated pace right through this year into next year. NOGUCHI: There are about 1,200 malls in the U. S. , the highest ever according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Cohen says there's simply too much real estate devoted to retail, and that must shrink. He says all but the best-performing malls which make up about a third of the existing ones will eventually have to close or find a new identity. And in fact, many are being redeveloped to include office space, apartments, gyms or smaller retail space. MARK COHEN: It's not clear what we're going to look like on the other side when this is all over if it in fact is ever all over. NOGUCHI: Matthew Shay is CEO of The National Retail Federation. MATTHEW SHAY: The velocity of change is unlike anything we've ever seen, you know? Before, things happened over a generation. Now they're happening overnight. NOGUCHI: He says it's not that people aren't shopping. Consumer spending is in fact up. But that growth is largely online, and online retail requires very different skills. In January, the Retail Federation and 30 retailers announced they would launch a retraining program called RISE Up, offering certification in classrooms and online. SHAY: They'll be in operations. They'll be in warehousing. They'll be in store management. They'll be in digital. NOGUCHI: The program hopes to enroll 5,000 people by year's end. Marshal Cohen - no relation to Professor Mark Cohen - is chief retail analyst for The NPD Group. He says the outlook for retail workers who lose their jobs is grim, and he's skeptical about industry's efforts to re-educate its workforce for the demands of the future. MARSHAL COHEN: The retail business rarely retrains people to be able to move into another job within that organization. NOGUCHI: Even as retail shrinks, real estate developers are looking to add more services such as restaurants, establishments that could in theory absorb some of retail's castoff workers. But are they? Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, says no. STUART APPELBAUM: That has not been our experience. That's not what we've seen. NOGUCHI: The retail jobs of the future might be in a distribution center. But Appelbaum says those jobs are typically far away from metropolitan areas where most stores are located, and those jobs require different types of skills than, say, a cashier. APPELBAUM: There is a lot of stress in being a retail worker today. You worry about e-commerce. You worry about automation. You worry about what's happening with all the retail jobs that are being lost as stores close. NOGUCHI: Politicians talk about how to manage job dislocation in coal mining and manufacturing.

ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN: A red-hot labor market. MCEVERS: That's Andrew Chamberlain. He's chief economist for Glassdoor. That's the jobs and recruiting website. And that is his assessment after today's new report from the Labor Department. It shows that 211,000 jobs were added in April and that the unemployment rate has dipped to 4. 4 percent. And Andrew, that rate hasn't been that low in a while. But what does it actually mean? CHAMBERLAIN: May 2007 was the last time we had a 4. 4 percent unemployment rate. That was a long time ago. So that was before the first iPhone was released. And my company, Glassdoor, wasn't even around back then. MCEVERS: Oh, wow. CHAMBERLAIN: So I. . . MCEVERS: I love you're measuring it in iPhone years (laughter). CHAMBERLAIN: Yeah. And this is a continuation of this strong, slow, growing labor market. We're 94 months now into this economic expansion. So you know, that's eight years, and there's a lot of young millennials today who in their entire young working careers have never seen a really weak labor market. MCEVERS: So it's expanding - the economy - but where exactly is it expanding? I mean from what you're seeing, what jobs are most in demand? CHAMBERLAIN: Well, the big job generator so far in the last few years has been health care. That is really the 800-pound gorilla of the labor market. It's generating tons of jobs. About 20 percent of job openings in America are in health care. And we're also seeing pay growing pretty fast for roles like registered nurse and emergency medical technician. So without question, health care is a big contributor. But today we're also seeing gains in some surprising jobs like warehouse associates. These are, like, the frontline employees fueling the supply chain for Amazon and Wal-Mart, and we're seeing jobs and pay pick up for those roles also. MCEVERS: And you wrote today that Glassdoor, your company, has seen an increase in manufacturing job postings during President Trump's first hundred days. Do you think that's tied to his policies and promises about these jobs? CHAMBERLAIN: We have to be careful about crediting too much to the administration because not much policy has changed. Job openings are forward-looking, and they can reflect optimism by companies. MCEVERS: Yeah. CHAMBERLAIN: But they don't necessarily translate into real hirings. We're going to have to wait and see there. In today's jobs report, we didn't see big manufacturing hiring gains. So to some extent, it could just be, you know, people's optimism sometimes is more about signaling their - what political tribe they view themselves as part of rather than their real expectations about the economy. MCEVERS: I want to ask about what people are actually getting paid, and today's jobs report shows that while more people might have jobs, the wages they're making in many of those jobs are actually going down. Just talk about that a little bit. What's happening there? CHAMBERLAIN: Well, they've - wage growth has been sluggish for years. And although there's some evidence that it's finally starting to pick up, it's not as high as most economists would expect. But what we see is a really diverse picture in wage gains. So if you live in Los Angeles or Seattle, you're seeing your median pay for full-time workers growing at 3 or 4 percent year over year. But if you live in Houston or Philadelphia, it's only growing about 1 to 1-and-a-half percent. So it's not just what you do for a living that affects pay growth, but it's where you do it. MCEVERS: It's where you live. CHAMBERLAIN: It's where you live, absolutely. Labor markets really are a place for a particular occupation at a point in time. And you know, we've got a 160 million-person labor market. It's a pretty diverse picture inside there. MCEVERS: Yeah, I mean what is it about places like Philadelphia that mean it's not working for people? Is it just that there's not as diverse of industry there? CHAMBERLAIN: Philadelphia is a city that is trying to reinvent itself for a new economy, and it's sort of struggled to find its way. And so for a variety of reasons, we're just not seeing the strong pay growth there that we see in places like Boston or New York or D. C. In places like Houston, of course they've been hit hard by low energy prices, and that's part of the reason we're seeing low pay gains there.

The loss of those jobs has stung as the coal industry has declined. Renewable power, especially solar power, is now where jobs are. So we wondered how they compare. We sent The Alleghany Front's Reid Frazier to find out. REID FRAZIER, BYLINE: At Consol Energy's Harvey mine, south of Pittsburgh, I meet Craig Williams in a crowded break room. He's in his work gear - dusty jacket, hard hat with a headlamp and safety glasses. He's kept his job through tough times in the coal industry. CRAIG WILLIAMS: Pittsburgh used to be a big - big on steel. That's mostly gone now. We're one of the last industries around and hope to keep it that way. FRAZIER: A father of two, he says, like generations before him, coal is the best way he's able to support his family. He wouldn't say what he's making, but, nationwide, coal miners make around $80,000 a year. WILLIAMS: If you had to take another job in this area especially, you're going to take anywhere from a 50 to 70 percent pay cut to what the next best thing is that's out there. FRAZIER: But coal has shed jobs - 40 percent since 2011. And renewable energy is growing. Now, it's hard to compare these two industries. Solar power accounts for just under 1. 5 percent of electricity in the U. S. And yet, according to the Department of Energy, solar jobs outnumbered those in coal by more than 2 to 1. So can laid-off coal miners find jobs in solar? ROB GODBY: Well, certainly, it's a possibility, but there are a couple of major challenges. FRAZIER: Rob Godby is an energy economist at the University of Wyoming. He says one of those challenges is simple - location. GODBY: When you are thinking about coal mining in Appalachia, I mean, oftentimes there are generations of families in those regions, and it's just very difficult to pick up and move. FRAZIER: And then there's pay. Coal miners make on average around $35 an hour, Godby says, in part because the job can be dangerous. In renewables, it's more like 20 or $25 an hour. GODBY: That doesn't mean you couldn't raise a family on that. But you're a lot closer to the average income in a lot of states in the solar industry than you are in mining industries. FRAZIER: On a rooftop at a community center near Pittsburgh, seven workers in neon green T-shirts bolt down solar panels. Brian Krenzelak was a roofer before joining this company, Energy Independent Solutions, seven and a half years ago. Now he installs solar and helps train others. BRIAN KRENZELAK: Have that prepped. Have these out. FRAZIER: He believes in the mission of solar, and it's a good living. His wife also works. And the couple have three kids, one in college and another about to enter. KRENZELAK: You know, I do well with this company - very well. It covers what we need to cover. I mean, I'm not becoming a millionaire overnight. But steadily, I've been building the nest egg for sure. FRAZIER: Experts say solar's surge is being helped by incentives that are scheduled to run out in a few years. And they don't know how long the boom will last. But they say solar is here to stay, and it'll be hard for machines to replace these jobs. Krenzelak's company is busy. It's looking to basically double its workforce of 22. KRENZELAK: We had to slow the salesmen down at a certain point. We we're selling so much solar, we had to actually slowed them down a little bit until we caught up. FRAZIER: He says it feels good to be in an industry with a future.

S. commonwealth are bracing for more spending cuts. And many of them are already hurting when it comes to getting health care and other basic services across the board. Danica Coto, a reporter with the Associated Press, has been closely monitoring the direct impact on Puerto Rico's residents. She joins us now from San Juan, Puerto Rico, by Skype. Danica, welcome. DANICA COTO: Thank you for having me. SINGH: How bad are things now across Puerto Rico? COTO: Well, I think most people would agree that it's the worst it's ever been. The island has been mired in a decade-long recession. People here have been hit with an increase in taxes, higher utility rates, an unemployment rate that is twice that of the U. S. mainland. And now the island is getting ready to restructure a portion of its $73 billion public debt. The situation has worsened to the point where nearly half a million people have left for the U. S. mainland since 2005. SINGH: Talk to us a little bit about what you're hearing on the ground from people who are especially worried about the impact on health care services. COTO: That's still a very big concern among Puerto Ricans here. The health situation is such, here, that in the past decade, the number of doctors has dropped from 14,000 to 9,000. They can wait up to a year to receive medical care for special conditions. And those who have money and can afford it, go to the U. S. mainland to get treated. Now, Puerto Rico pays the same amount in Medicaid taxes as U. S. states. The only problem is it receives less funding in return. So the island expects to exhaust about $6. 4 billion worth of supplemental Medicaid funding by the end of this year. And both the governor and the federal control board that is overseeing the island's finances have warned that if they do not receive additional money for that purpose that hundreds of thousands of Medicaid recipients will be dropped from the plan. And officials note that nearly half of Puerto Rico's population is on Medicaid, and they say that a total $900 million is needed to keep the health system alive. SINGH: Could you just explain - if I were living in Puerto Rico and I wanted to go to the hospital or just to the doctor's office, what am I likely to encounter? COTO: Well, it's all different types of scenario depending on where you live. If you live outside of the capital San Juan, I mean, many people travel to the capital, as it is, because they can't find those services - basic services that they need. I think the most acute problem lies with specialists. The island of 3. 5 million people at this point has only about two pediatric urologists, one orthopedists, specializing in ankle and feet, and one pediatric cardiologist and about a handful of geneticists and endocrinologists. SINGH: Danica, when we spoke with the governor, he talked about a lot of reforms that he planned to pursue. He expressed a great sense of optimism that even though there are going to be austerity measures adopted, spending cuts will have to happen. But he expressed optimism that the reforms that were going to take place were going to be really helpful in the coming years. Do you sense Puerto Ricans feeling the same way? COTO: I think people are very, very upset. More than 30 or 40,000 people marched against, you know, the federal control board, who's overseeing the island's finances, that recently approved a fiscal plan that outlines, you know, these measures that the governor has been touting. Everybody or most everybody understands that there's a need for change. But the anger here is toward previous administrations that have built this debt up over decades and decades. And now many feel that they are paying for this. And obviously, they don't like it. There's been marches. There's more marches planned. And I think Puerto Ricans here have hit their limit for changes. SINGH: That's Danica Coto speaking with us via Skype. She's a Caribbean-based reporter with the Associated Press.

The U. S. commonwealth owes creditors and pension funds more than $120 billion. And last week, the island officially began the process of seeking a special form of protection from creditors called Title 3 which is similar to declaring bankruptcy. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a federal government spending bill that included $295 million in Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico's struggling health care system. To talk more about how Puerto Rico's leaders are getting their fiscal house in order, we spoke with Governor Ricardo Rossello Nevares earlier this week. And, Governor Rossello is a Democrat who took office in January. And I began by asking him about an announcement on Friday to close some 180 public schools affecting about 27,000 students. RICARDO ROSSELLO NEVARES: I made no secret when I ran for office that we needed to reduce the size of government. We needed to be more effective. And, frankly, just talking about the schools that are closing, that was part of our proposal a couple of months back. It has nothing to do really with Title 3, and some of the strategies that will ensue we've already stated that they're going to happen. You know, we need to reduce our expenditures in health care, although we don't want to reduce the access to it. We really need to reduce the expenditures in education and what we're doing is we're tackling the bureaucracy as opposed to education itself. And we want to invest on education. So those are decisions that we have to deal with it and - with strong leadership and a great team. I'm sure we're going to push past both for Puerto Rico. SINGH: Now, governor, let's put this in context. We have a little over 46 percent of those living in Puerto Rico already struggling financially. They live below the poverty line. Critical sectors across the board have been hit hard. What are Puerto Ricans on the island likely to encounter on a basic level in the coming years as a result of this economic relief Puerto Rico's seeking? ROSSELLO: Yes. So let me answer. I mean, that is the status quo, right? I've just recently arrived to be a governor, but we're changing that. Let me give you the example of tourism. Tourism took a big blow last year because of sort of overstated Zika problem in Puerto Rico. We've externalized the promotion of Puerto Rico from government so that we can have a - sort of group packages so that people can come to Puerto Rico and that it's more enticing. So we're being very aggressive on the tourist front. On the health care front, we've identified, you know, some of the problems - long waits, people are not able to choose their providers, some of the insurers don't pay the doctors and the doctors leave. So what we've proposed is a new model whereby we're going to give more access to people, the long waits are not going to be happening, people will be able to choose both their providers and their health care coverage and this will enable us to actually reduce the cost of health care in Puerto Rico anywhere from 350 million to $500 million. SINGH: Your administration recruited Avenue Strategies - right? - to help sort of attract new investment, new dollars, new business. And Avenue Strategies, for those who haven't heard of it, was co-founded by Corey Lewandowski who was on the Trump campaign. And at the same time as this is happening, you still had President Trump tweeting recently Democrats want to prop up, you know, Puerto Rico, and they want to do that - bailout Puerto Rico with taxpayer dollars. I mean, I'm paraphrasing here. That's not a direct quote. Did the strategy of getting Avenue Strategies on board not work? ROSSELLO: Judgment is still out. We will evaluate all of our people based on results. But certainly that, as you stated, that wasn't the most flattering of tweets. And I responded stating a few things. Number one - it was Trump's government in different levels has stipulated the need for Puerto Rico to have that funding for the Medicaid. It is not a bailout. It is actually just a path forward with the amount that we previously had which was significantly lower than any other state. But that without it, it puts Puerto Rico in a significant bind. Now, mind you, this is all happening while we're reducing about $300 billion locally on health care. So it is sort of an added burden. The second component, I would say, is that health care and civil rights are not political issues. They should be essential rights for American citizens, and Puerto Ricans every side of the island are American citizens. Lastly, the repercussions of allowing a health care system in Puerto Rico to collapse because it doesn't have its fair share of funding is that a lot of the U. S. citizens in Puerto Rico will move to the states now. You know this has been happening for a while, and let me tell you a little bit about the impact on health care alone. For every dollar that (unintelligible) spend on Puerto Rico for health care, that same citizen - the federal government and the state government will have to spend $4. So we feel that this needs to be stressed more to the administration stating that it is not a bailout, and it is just our fair share of money for health care. SINGH: Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello. Governor, thank you so much for speaking with us. ROSSELLO: Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day.

In many places, they're welcome for the jobs and the tax revenue they bring. But in one community near Charleston, S. C. , there's also concern about Google's impact on the local water supply. NPR's Sarah McCammon has more. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Clay Duffie remembers a time when the water in his area was soft. You'd come out of the shower and still feel dirty and salty. CLAY DUFFIE: It'd kill your azaleas if you irrigated with it. Your grits would come out in a big clump instead of creamy like they should. MCCAMMON: And he says the sweet tea was cloudy. Duffie cares a lot about this. He's the head of Mount Pleasant Waterworks, which provides water for more than 80,000 people outside Charleston. His concern now is Google's request for permission from South Carolina regulators to pump water from underground. DUFFIE: We've invested a lot in making sure that the ground water quality that we treat and send to the customers are high quality. We also want to protect the quantity side of that. MCCAMMON: Google already has the right to pump up to half a million gallons a day at no charge. Now, the company is asking to triple that to one and a half million. That's close to half of the groundwater that Mount Pleasant Waterworks pumps from the same aquifer. PATRICK LINEHAN: They run really hot. It takes a lot of energy to run a data center. So we use water to cool them down. MCCAMMON: It's the servers that generate all that heat, says Google spokesman Patrick Linehan. He says Google is taking steps to conserve water and energy while preparing for the needs of the future. LINEHAN: The Internet is constantly expanding and data centers allow the Internet to continue to do that. And we're very long-term thinkers in terms of capacity, so we're always preparing for more growth. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: In 600 feet, turn right onto U. S. 50 East. MCCAMMON: So I have basically driven out to where I am told this data center is. And there isn't much to see here. I see a sign that says Google. And there's a guard shack and a fence, and that's about it. Google wouldn't let me inside of its South Carolina data center, which opened up nearly a decade ago in Berkeley County. But it's in a suburban area surrounded by woods and office buildings. Emily Cedzo of the Coastal Conservation League says she worries about its impact on the underground aquifer that the community relies on. EMILY CEDZO: It's great to have Google in this region. Folks are proud to say that Google calls Charleston home. So by no means are we going after Google. Our concern, primarily, is the source of that water. MCCAMMON: Google, with its six data centers nationwide, is just one of several major tech companies operating centers in relatively dry parts of the country, like eBay in Salt Lake City and Microsoft in San Antonio. Alfonso Ortega is a professor of energy technology at Villanova University. Speaking via Skype, he says the tech industry as a whole has been a leader in adopting environmentally sustainable practices like reusing water. But there are tradeoffs. ALFONSO ORTEGA: The consumption of their water competes with every other need for that water. And one would hope that community leaders would be able to balance the benefits of having that data center in the community compared to the water that they're going to consume. MCCAMMON: In places with enough water to go around, he says the jobs and tax revenues brought by data companies might just be worth the water and other resources required to run them. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, Mount Pleasant, S. C. (SOUNDBITE OF TIN HAT'S \"NEW WEST\") ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Google and other tech companies are building more data centers to facilitate the millions of searches performed around the world every minute. In many places, they're welcome for the jobs and the tax revenue they bring. But in one community near Charleston, S. C. , there's also concern about Google's impact on the local water supply. NPR's Sarah McCammon has more. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Clay Duffie remembers a time when the water in his area was soft. You'd come out of the shower and still feel dirty and salty. CLAY DUFFIE: It'd kill your azaleas if you irrigated with it. Your grits would come out in a big clump instead of creamy like they should. MCCAMMON: And he says the sweet tea was cloudy. Duffie cares a lot about this. He's the head of Mount Pleasant Waterworks, which provides water for more than 80,000 people outside Charleston. His concern now is Google's request for permission from South Carolina regulators to pump water from underground. DUFFIE: We've invested a lot in making sure that the ground water quality that we treat and send to the customers are high quality. We also want to protect the quantity side of that. MCCAMMON: Google already has the right to pump up to half a million gallons a day at no charge. Now, the company is asking to triple that to one and a half million. That's close to half of the groundwater that Mount Pleasant Waterworks pumps from the same aquifer. PATRICK LINEHAN: They run really hot. It takes a lot of energy to run a data center. So we use water to cool them down. MCCAMMON: It's the servers that generate all that heat, says Google spokesman Patrick Linehan. He says Google is taking steps to conserve water and energy while preparing for the needs of the future. LINEHAN: The Internet is constantly expanding and data centers allow the Internet to continue to do that. And we're very long-term thinkers in terms of capacity, so we're always preparing for more growth. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: In 600 feet, turn right onto U. S. 50 East. MCCAMMON: So I have basically driven out to where I am told this data center is. And there isn't much to see here. I see a sign that says Google. And there's a guard shack and a fence, and that's about it. Google wouldn't let me inside of its South Carolina data center, which opened up nearly a decade ago in Berkeley County. But it's in a suburban area surrounded by woods and office buildings. Emily Cedzo of the Coastal Conservation League says she worries about its impact on the underground aquifer that the community relies on. EMILY CEDZO: It's great to have Google in this region. Folks are proud to say that Google calls Charleston home. So by no means are we going after Google. Our concern, primarily, is the source of that water. MCCAMMON: Google, with its six data centers nationwide, is just one of several major tech companies operating centers in relatively dry parts of the country, like eBay in Salt Lake City and Microsoft in San Antonio. Alfonso Ortega is a professor of energy technology at Villanova University. Speaking via Skype, he says the tech industry as a whole has been a leader in adopting environmentally sustainable practices like reusing water. But there are tradeoffs. ALFONSO ORTEGA: The consumption of their water competes with every other need for that water. And one would hope that community leaders would be able to balance the benefits of having that data center in the community compared to the water that they're going to consume. MCCAMMON: In places with enough water to go around, he says the jobs and tax revenues brought by data companies might just be worth the water and other resources required to run them.

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program costs about $8 billion a year. And our teams found that it's not only serving fewer people in need. It is costing more money to make fewer units of housing. And it's all happening with little oversight from the government. NPR correspondent Laura Sullivan reports. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Nena Eldridge lives in a small, wooden house just south of Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)SULLIVAN: Are you Nina? NENA ELDRIDGE: Yes. SULLIVAN: I'm Laura Sullivan. This is your spot, huh? ELDRIDGE: Yes, Ma'am. SULLIVAN: She lives here alone, paying $550 a month in rent. That may not sound like a lot, but her total income is $780 a month. She gets a disability check from when she was injured at her job cleaning hospital rooms. This house was the cheapest she could find, and yet with so little money left, choosing which bills to pay is difficult. On the kitchen floor is a stack of water bottles. Why do you have all these water bottles? Eldridge pauses, and it's suddenly clear. She doesn't have running water. She got behind on her payments, and the water company shut it off. So where are you getting your water? ELDRIDGE: Actually from a lady down the street. SULLIVAN: She uses buckets of water for dishes and showering. ELDRIDGE: And this how I do my commode. SULLIVAN: She pours one of the buckets into the toilet. ELDRIDGE: But I take this, and I do it like this. SULLIVAN: That's what you do when you have to flush the toilet. ELDRIDGE: Yeah, to make it not be stinky in here, yes. SULLIVAN: She sets the bucket down on the sink, and her eyes fill with tears. ELDRIDGE: Now, I'm tired. I am tired. I been crying; I'm tired. But I don't have nowhere to go, and I don't have enough money to do it. So I get water to keep my house from being stinky. It's bad, but I pray every day God make a way 'cause I know he ain't want me live like this. SULLIVAN: Eldridge wants to find a decent place where the rent is lower so she can afford food, electricity and water. And 30 years ago, that's exactly what Congress had in mind when it came up with a new way to provide housing for the poor. It's called the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Basically it gives private developers and investors billions in tax breaks to build nice apartments with low rent. One of these buildings is just two and a half miles from Eldridge's house, a place where she might pay as little as $200 or $300 a month based on her income. But she can't get in. Like so many other tax credit projects nationwide, there's no room for her, and the waiting list is up to four years long. She tries to stay hopeful. ELDRIDGE: I didn't know what way to go, but I've been praying for something new. And I know if I stay praying, I won't lose. SULLIVAN: The tax credit program is often described as a win-win. Developers and investors, usually the nation's biggest banks, make hundreds of millions of dollars, and taxpayers and the poor get decent affordable housing. That's how it was set up. But NPR and \"Frontline\" spent almost a year investigating the program and found it's no longer clear just how much the poor are actually winning. Banks, brokers and developers are still making millions, but an analysis of government data shows the program is producing significantly less housing than it used to while costing taxpayers more all at a time when more Americans than ever are living a step away from homelessness. MARY TINGERTHAL: It is a program that has now a 30-year proven track record. SULLIVAN: Mary Tingerthal is on the board of the National Council of State Housing Agencies which represents the state agencies running the program. She says it's an incentive program that's been good for taxpayers. TINGERTHAL: It's been a very enduring public-private partnership that has produced good housing that's very well-run. SULLIVAN: To understand it, though, you have to start at the beginning, the 1970s. Congress and the public had had enough of the large, concrete public housing projects like Chicago's Cabrini-Green or St. Louis' Pruitt-Igoe and began demolishing buildings like them across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Five, four, three, two, one. . . (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSIONS, CHEERING)SULLIVAN: In 1986, Congress turned to the private sector to see if they could do it better. The plan was for private developers and investors to build more attractive buildings, manage them and get large tax incentives in exchange. Last fall in Chicago at an annual tax credit conference, developers and investors said that plan is working better than ever. The wine was flowing next to the roast beef carving station as they gathered to talk housing credits and make deals. An entire industry has evolved over the past three decades to help the government dole out $8 billion a year to house the poor. Here's how it works. Every year, the IRS hands out billions to the states based on their population. Then the states pass out the money to developers. The money comes in the form of a tax credit. So if you're a developer and you get $20 million in tax credits, that's 20 million in taxes you do not have to pay. Or if you want, you can sell the credits to banks and investors for cash. That's what most developers do. Then you use the cash to build an apartment building. Because taxpayers essentially paid for the building, the rents can be much lower than in normal developments. And as a developer, you usually get to keep a couple million in fees. Here in Chicago, developers, brokers and bankers like John Gilmore, Amish Mehta, and Charles Werhane said business is good. How's business right now? JOHN GILMORE: Very strong. Demand is off the charts because. . . AMISH MEHTA: Oh, it's definitely a good business. I mean as long as. . . CHARLES WERHANE: So we consistently have good profits on the capital side. STACIE NEKUS: Very robust. We've had so much capital pouring into the market, you know? SULLIVAN: That's Stacie Nekus. She heads investor relations for Alliant Capital. They're one of the largest brokers. They're called syndicators. They put together deals between banks and developers. So I asked her, if everything's going so well, how much housing are we getting? NEKUS: I mean we house millions of people. It gets the most amount of units built. SULLIVAN: Yeah. NEKUS: This works. SULLIVAN: Do you think that it provides the most housing we can get for the dollar? Is this the most efficient program that we could do? NEKUS: I do think 100 percent it is the most efficient program. I think that a lot. . . SULLIVAN: Efficient or not, what is clear is that the program is not doing what it used to. NPR and frontline spent months analyzing 20 years' worth of data. The number of units is dropping from more than 70,000 to less than 59,000 a year. But the program is costing taxpayers 66 percent more in credits. That's after inflation. Why is it costing so much more to do less? We looked at the estimated rise in construction costs, but that only accounts for about half of it. So what about the rest? We asked the IRS, but they did not respond to our request for an interview. We also reached out to more than 20 industry officials, executives at the top investor and syndicator firms. None would agree to an interview. In written responses, industry officials said they believe several factors were causing the drop in units. Other kinds of government grants are declining, so the tax credit dollars have to do more. And they say states are requiring them to target really poor renters, which means there's less rent to cover any debt. We found these factors have increased costs, but the rise is so great, we kept looking and found a troubling story in Miami, Fla. MICHAEL COX: Hey, Mike, how are you? Come on out. Good to see you. MIKE FLENEURY: Good to see you. COX: Yeah, this is Laura. SULLIVAN: Hi, I'm Laura Sullivan with NPR. On a downtown street in Miami, I went with developer Michael Cox to a tax credit property called Labre Place. Cox and several other developers built the $25 million project with tax credits. It houses 90 people, mostly formerly homeless, and has a two- to three-year waiting list. Mike Fleneury manages it. FLENEURY: Sure, I'll show you around. You want to see the building? SULLIVAN: Yeah, I'd love that. FLENEURY: Yes, come on in. SULLIVAN: Fleneury takes us through the brightly colored lobby past tidy apartments and the computer room to his office. FLENEURY: OK. SULLIVAN: Inside, he proudly display state inspections the building has passed. FLENEURY: They'll come in with a list, and they go through it. And they be in there for hours and hours and hours, going through it. SULLIVAN: Standing off to the side, though, the developer, Michael Cox, is staring at the floor. State inspectors have kept an eye on whether this building is up to code, whether it's really poor people who live in it. But what Cox knows better than most is that there was one thing no one was checking - how much money he and his partners were making. COX: It's a construction kickback scheme. SULLIVAN: Or in this case, stealing. COX: The scam was to submit grossly inflated construction numbers to the state in order to get more money and then to have an agreement with the contractor to get it back. SULLIVAN: Cox worked at a string of nonprofits advocating for the poor until 2006 when he created his own company and partnered up with a tax credit developer. Even before the theft, they were all making a lot of money. COX: So I went from working with this very small nonprofit to the state's largest affordable housing developer. So it became millions of dollars. SULLIVAN: You went from making $50,000 a year to making millions of dollars. COX: Right. SULLIVAN: Just like that. COX: Almost overnight. SULLIVAN: But then Cox's partners Lloyd Boggio and Matt Greer started the kickback scheme. Cox eventually went along with it, and they made even more money. Their scheme stole $34 million from 14 projects. Almost $2 million alone was from Labre. COX: I convinced myself that this was OK and that I was doing such good works, and I was building amazing projects in the community. I went from fighting monsters to becoming a monster. SULLIVAN: Boggio and Greer went to prison last year for the scheme. Cox avoided prison and got probation because he cooperated with prosecutors. He never spends any of the money he stole, and he returned all of it. He's since gone back to his roots, working for nonprofits. But the impact of the theft is lasting. COX: When costs are inflated, the number of housing units actually produced decreases. At Labre, if the cost had been stated in a correct way, we could have built 10 more housing units. So that's 10 more people every year that that project could have served. Those are 10 lives, and so it's those people that really take it on the chin when the costs are inflated. SULLIVAN: Just a couple miles away from Labre in a government office building is the man who was able to unravel their theft. MICHAEL SHERWIN: My name is Michael Sherwin. I'm an assistant United States attorney here in Miami, Fla. SULLIVAN: Sherwin spent five years investigating the tax credit program in Florida for the Department of Justice. SHERWIN: This program has been described as a subterranean ATM, and only the developers know the pin. SULLIVAN: He flips through reams of paper showing how Boggio and Greer devised a way to steal millions with inflated construction costs. But he says he does not believe the Florida Housing Agency which gave them the money was equipped to spot it. SHERWIN: These are IRS tax credits. They rely upon the states to ensure that they set up an architecture to oversee the program. SULLIVAN: So the IRS is relying on the housing authorities to ferret out problems and corruption. SHERWIN: Correct, correct. These housing agencies don't have a lot of funding. Looking at Florida housing, they have good people that work there, but they're a limited resource. It's a small office with a limited staff that is in charge of managing hundreds of millions of dollars in state, local and federal money. So it's really a program of trust. So. . . SULLIVAN: Did you just call an $8 billion tax program a program of trust? SHERWIN: Yes, it is a program of trust. It is. SULLIVAN: Do you think that's a problem? SHERWIN: I think we have a lot to learn from this case and how this program should be managed. There's a lot of holes that developers have been exploiting that we're trying to correct. SULLIVAN: I went to talk with the man who runs Florida's housing agency, the Florida Housing Finance Authority. Steve Auger says program money is well spent. The $34 million theft was a one-time thing. STEVE AUGER: This kind of fraud has not been rampant in the tax credit program both here in Florida or nationally. SULLIVAN: Auger says Florida has added some additional audits to make sure developer theft won't happen again. AUGER: It's probably the most efficient tax housing program that's ever existed. That's why you've got this asset class that's performed so well with such few scandalous incidents. SULLIVAN: A week after our interview, Steve Auger was forced to resign after a state audit revealed he spent more than $50,000 on a steak and lobster dinner for affordable housing lenders and gave his own staff almost half a million in bonuses. And a couple months after that, the Assistant U. S. Attorney Michael Sherwin charged another company, a shell company called DAXC that belongs to the owners of another of the largest affordable housing developers in the country, Pinnacle Housing Group. He charged DAXC with the theft of $4 million from four tax credit developments in Florida. In a statement, Pinnacle says the owners did not violate state housing rules. But in a federal court filing, DAXC acknowledged that it, quote, \"inflated costs for its owners' personal benefit. \" Sherwin says he's not done investigating the program. SHERWIN: I know that this fraud doesn't just reside in South Florida. There's too much money involved. And based upon information we've looked at, this fraud exists in other jurisdictions. SULLIVAN: Sherwin says his investigation is expanding to other developers with projects in other states, and he's now turning his attention to the banks, lenders and syndicators. To be sure, developers all over the country are using the money as taxpayers intended, using tax breaks to build homes with cheap rent. And there are millions to be made on these deals. Just like the developers, the contractors and syndicators also get fees. Industry officials said syndicator fees were more than $300 million last year. And usually the more a project costs, the bigger the fees everyone gets. Industry officials say the business is less profitable than it used to be, but they did not provide specific profit figures to compare. Mary Tingerthal with the state agencies says the fees are reasonable, and in return, taxpayers have gotten quality developments. TINGERTHAL: If we didn't have developers and investors at the table, this housing wouldn't be produced at all. SULLIVAN: That may be true, but what's not clear is whether the developers and investors could have produced more of it. I ask Tingerthal how she knows this is the most housing taxpayers should expect. And here's what she said. TINGERTHAL: This is a market-driven program, and our barometer is really that rate of return. How much is the investor willing to pay for those tax credits and for those units of housing? We're working all the time to drive towards more cost efficiency. SULLIVAN: Industry officials also said this. The program is efficient because banks and investors get into bidding wars over the tax credits. But efficient for whom, banks and investors fighting over tax credits or poor people in need of more housing? Take a look at the thousands of tax credit properties across the country. You'll find attractive, well-designed buildings. Taxpayers spent billions on their construction, but taxpayers don't own them. The banks do. Usually that's part of the deal. NPR traced dozens of properties, following them from the developers to the syndicators to the investors. Mostly they are the nation's biggest banks - Wells Fargo, Bank of America, PNC, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase. Syndicators and some banks bundle the properties taxpayers built for the poor into hundreds of private equity funds worth billions of dollars. It's another incentive to get banks to invest. And yet taxpayers know little about these funds, how they operate or if they may be impacting the program. It's hard to know. The government does not audit the funds or how much the banks make off of them. CHARLES GRASSLEY: If you aren't following the money, how do you know that the low-income housing tax credit is working? SULLIVAN: Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is one of the few lawmakers to look into the program. He recently asked government auditors to find out how much the syndicators and banks are making and whether that is influencing developments. And he says in addition to profits, the IRS needs to start reviewing the 58 housing agencies who oversee them. The vast majority of housing agencies have never been audited even once. GRASSLEY: There's only been seven audits in 29 years. It may not be serving all the people it should serve. There may be people in the middle getting more than they should. My suspicion is that there's a lot of things wrong with the program. SULLIVAN: Longtime civil rights lawyer Mike Daniel says you don't have to look far. If you want to see how money influences the program, he says you only have to look at where projects are built. Daniel brought a landmark lawsuit against the program to the Supreme Court after discovering 90 percent of projects in Dallas were built in high-poverty areas with high crime and terrible schools. MIKE DANIEL: Well, they were being put there because it's easier to do. There was no opposition from those communities to it. You don't have everybody mad at you. You get your deals done. SULLIVAN: And getting deals done appears to have mattered. New research from the University of Kansas found nationwide, only 17 percent of projects have been built in neighborhoods with opportunity, the kind of places that studies show can actually get families out of poverty so maybe they won't need low-income housing in the first place. Industry leaders say their projects have improved poverty-stricken neighborhoods, but Daniel says for developers, investors and banks, how many units their projects are producing or where they are putting them has always mattered less than closing the deal. DANIEL: They don't make these deals in good places. They make these deals in the same places they won't lend. SULLIVAN: Still, he says, you won't find many housing advocates publicly criticizing the program. DANIEL: People protect it because it is all that there is. And if they take it away, what do you have? And not only do you take it away from poor people, but you also take it away from all the intermediaries who lose the money. It's difficult to get anybody to look at it from the taxpayers' point of view or even the families that should be benefiting from it. It's all we got. SULLIVAN: On a recent afternoon in South Dallas, I stood outside Nena Eldridge's wooden house where she can't afford to pay for water. ELDRIDGE: It's a pretty day out here, ain't it? SULLIVAN: Just up the road to the left is the tax credit property that has no room for her. And just down the road to the right is where she gets her water. ELDRIDGE: I don't take them out at daytime. I go down there early in the morning when it's dark; I go at night. They don't see me toting water. It's embarrassing. It is. I don't want them to know. SULLIVAN: But for her, it's a simple choice - housing instead of water. ELDRIDGE: I'm not homeless. I'm not living on the streets. And I look at other peoples be under bridges and sleeping. And I'm like, you know, that what make my pray every day, like, God, I'm not homeless. SULLIVAN: After billions of dollars a year and 30 years of effort, there's still no place Nena Eldridge can afford to live. Laura Sullivan, NPR News.

CHARLES WERHANE: So we consistently have good profits on the capital side. STACIE NEKUS: Very robust. We've had so much capital pouring into the market, you know? SULLIVAN: That's Stacie Nekus. She heads investor relations for Alliant Capital. They're one of the largest brokers. They're called syndicators. They put together deals between banks and developers. So I asked her, if everything's going so well, how much housing are we getting? NEKUS: I mean we house millions of people. It gets the most amount of units built. SULLIVAN: Yeah. NEKUS: This works. SULLIVAN: Do you think that it provides the most housing we can get for the dollar? Is this the most efficient program that we could do? NEKUS: I do think 100 percent it is the most efficient program. I think that a lot. . . SULLIVAN: Efficient or not, what is clear is that the program is not doing what it used to. NPR and frontline spent months analyzing 20 years' worth of data. The number of units is dropping from more than 70,000 to less than 59,000 a year. But the program is costing taxpayers 66 percent more in credits. That's after inflation. Why is it costing so much more to do less? We looked at the estimated rise in construction costs, but that only accounts for about half of it. So what about the rest? We asked the IRS, but they did not respond to our request for an interview. We also reached out to more than 20 industry officials, executives at the top investor and syndicator firms. None would agree to an interview. In written responses, industry officials said they believe several factors were causing the drop in units. Other kinds of government grants are declining, so the tax credit dollars have to do more. And they say states are requiring them to target really poor renters, which means there's less rent to cover any debt. We found these factors have increased costs, but the rise is so great, we kept looking and found a troubling story in Miami, Fla. MICHAEL COX: Hey, Mike, how are you? Come on out. Good to see you. MIKE FLENEURY: Good to see you. COX: Yeah, this is Laura. SULLIVAN: Hi, I'm Laura Sullivan with NPR. On a downtown street in Miami, I went with developer Michael Cox to a tax credit property called Labre Place. Cox and several other developers built the $25 million project with tax credits. It houses 90 people, mostly formerly homeless, and has a two- to three-year waiting list. Mike Fleneury manages it. FLENEURY: Sure, I'll show you around. You want to see the building? SULLIVAN: Yeah, I'd love that. FLENEURY: Yes, come on in. SULLIVAN: Fleneury takes us through the brightly colored lobby past tidy apartments and the computer room to his office. FLENEURY: OK. SULLIVAN: Inside, he proudly display state inspections the building has passed. FLENEURY: They'll come in with a list, and they go through it. And they be in there for hours and hours and hours, going through it. SULLIVAN: Standing off to the side, though, the developer, Michael Cox, is staring at the floor. State inspectors have kept an eye on whether this building is up to code, whether it's really poor people who live in it. But what Cox knows better than most is that there was one thing no one was checking - how much money he and his partners were making. COX: It's a construction kickback scheme. SULLIVAN: Or in this case, stealing. COX: The scam was to submit grossly inflated construction numbers to the state in order to get more money and then to have an agreement with the contractor to get it back. SULLIVAN: Cox worked at a string of nonprofits advocating for the poor until 2006 when he created his own company and partnered up with a tax credit developer. Even before the theft, they were all making a lot of money. COX: So I went from working with this very small nonprofit to the state's largest affordable housing developer. So it became millions of dollars. SULLIVAN: You went from making $50,000 a year to making millions of dollars. COX: Right. SULLIVAN: Just like that. COX: Almost overnight. SULLIVAN: But then Cox's partners Lloyd Boggio and Matt Greer started the kickback scheme. Cox eventually went along with it, and they made even more money. Their scheme stole $34 million from 14 projects. Almost $2 million alone was from Labre. COX: I convinced myself that this was OK and that I was doing such good works, and I was building amazing projects in the community. I went from fighting monsters to becoming a monster. SULLIVAN: Boggio and Greer went to prison last year for the scheme. Cox avoided prison and got probation because he cooperated with prosecutors. He never spends any of the money he stole, and he returned all of it. He's since gone back to his roots, working for nonprofits. But the impact of the theft is lasting. COX: When costs are inflated, the number of housing units actually produced decreases. At Labre, if the cost had been stated in a correct way, we could have built 10 more housing units. So that's 10 more people every year that that project could have served. Those are 10 lives, and so it's those people that really take it on the chin when the costs are inflated. SULLIVAN: Just a couple miles away from Labre in a government office building is the man who was able to unravel their theft. MICHAEL SHERWIN: My name is Michael Sherwin. I'm an assistant United States attorney here in Miami, Fla. SULLIVAN: Sherwin spent five years investigating the tax credit program in Florida for the Department of Justice. SHERWIN: This program has been described as a subterranean ATM, and only the developers know the pin. SULLIVAN: He flips through reams of paper showing how Boggio and Greer devised a way to steal millions with inflated construction costs. But he says he does not believe the Florida Housing Agency which gave them the money was equipped to spot it. SHERWIN: These are IRS tax credits. They rely upon the states to ensure that they set up an architecture to oversee the program. SULLIVAN: So the IRS is relying on the housing authorities to ferret out problems and corruption. SHERWIN: Correct, correct. These housing agencies don't have a lot of funding. Looking at Florida housing, they have good people that work there, but they're a limited resource. It's a small office with a limited staff that is in charge of managing hundreds of millions of dollars in state, local and federal money. So it's really a program of trust. So. . . SULLIVAN: Did you just call an $8 billion tax program a program of trust? SHERWIN: Yes, it is a program of trust. It is. SULLIVAN: Do you think that's a problem? SHERWIN: I think we have a lot to learn from this case and how this program should be managed. There's a lot of holes that developers have been exploiting that we're trying to correct. SULLIVAN: I went to talk with the man who runs Florida's housing agency, the Florida Housing Finance Authority. Steve Auger says program money is well spent. The $34 million theft was a one-time thing. STEVE AUGER: This kind of fraud has not been rampant in the tax credit program both here in Florida or nationally. SULLIVAN: Auger says Florida has added some additional audits to make sure developer theft won't happen again. AUGER: It's probably the most efficient tax housing program that's ever existed. That's why you've got this asset class that's performed so well with such few scandalous incidents. SULLIVAN: A week after our interview, Steve Auger was forced to resign after a state audit revealed he spent more than $50,000 on a steak and lobster dinner for affordable housing lenders and gave his own staff almost half a million in bonuses. And a couple months after that, the Assistant U. S. Attorney Michael Sherwin charged another company, a shell company called DAXC that belongs to the owners of another of the largest affordable housing developers in the country, Pinnacle Housing Group. He charged DAXC with the theft of $4 million from four tax credit developments in Florida. In a statement, Pinnacle says the owners did not violate state housing rules. But in a federal court filing, DAXC acknowledged that it, quote, \"inflated costs for its owners' personal benefit. \" Sherwin says he's not done investigating the program. SHERWIN: I know that this fraud doesn't just reside in South Florida. There's too much money involved. And based upon information we've looked at, this fraud exists in other jurisdictions. SULLIVAN: Sherwin says his investigation is expanding to other developers with projects in other states, and he's now turning his attention to the banks, lenders and syndicators. To be sure, developers all over the country are using the money as taxpayers intended, using tax breaks to build homes with cheap rent. And there are millions to be made on these deals. Just like the developers, the contractors and syndicators also get fees. Industry officials said syndicator fees were more than $300 million last year. And usually the more a project costs, the bigger the fees everyone gets. Industry officials say the business is less profitable than it used to be, but they did not provide specific profit figures to compare. Mary Tingerthal with the state agencies says the fees are reasonable, and in return, taxpayers have gotten quality developments. TINGERTHAL: If we didn't have developers and investors at the table, this housing wouldn't be produced at all. SULLIVAN: That may be true, but what's not clear is whether the developers and investors could have produced more of it. I ask Tingerthal how she knows this is the most housing taxpayers should expect. And here's what she said. TINGERTHAL: This is a market-driven program, and our barometer is really that rate of return. How much is the investor willing to pay for those tax credits and for those units of housing? We're working all the time to drive towards more cost efficiency. SULLIVAN: Industry officials also said this. The program is efficient because banks and investors get into bidding wars over the tax credits. But efficient for whom, banks and investors fighting over tax credits or poor people in need of more housing? Take a look at the thousands of tax credit properties across the country. You'll find attractive, well-designed buildings. Taxpayers spent billions on their construction, but taxpayers don't own them. The banks do. Usually that's part of the deal. NPR traced dozens of properties, following them from the developers to the syndicators to the investors. Mostly they are the nation's biggest banks - Wells Fargo, Bank of America, PNC, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase. Syndicators and some banks bundle the properties taxpayers built for the poor into hundreds of private equity funds worth billions of dollars. It's another incentive to get banks to invest. And yet taxpayers know little about these funds, how they operate or if they may be impacting the program. It's hard to know. The government does not audit the funds or how much the banks make off of them. CHARLES GRASSLEY: If you aren't following the money, how do you know that the low-income housing tax credit is working? SULLIVAN: Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is one of the few lawmakers to look into the program. He recently asked government auditors to find out how much the syndicators and banks are making and whether that is influencing developments. And he says in addition to profits, the IRS needs to start reviewing the 58 housing agencies who oversee them. The vast majority of housing agencies have never been audited even once. GRASSLEY: There's only been seven audits in 29 years. It may not be serving all the people it should serve. There may be people in the middle getting more than they should. My suspicion is that there's a lot of things wrong with the program. SULLIVAN: Longtime civil rights lawyer Mike Daniel says you don't have to look far. If you want to see how money influences the program, he says you only have to look at where projects are built. Daniel brought a landmark lawsuit against the program to the Supreme Court after discovering 90 percent of projects in Dallas were built in high-poverty areas with high crime and terrible schools. MIKE DANIEL: Well, they were being put there because it's easier to do. There was no opposition from those communities to it. You don't have everybody mad at you. You get your deals done. SULLIVAN: And getting deals done appears to have mattered. New research from the University of Kansas found nationwide, only 17 percent of projects have been built in neighborhoods with opportunity, the kind of places that studies show can actually get families out of poverty so maybe they won't need low-income housing in the first place. Industry leaders say their projects have improved poverty-stricken neighborhoods, but Daniel says for developers, investors and banks, how many units their projects are producing or where they are putting them has always mattered less than closing the deal. DANIEL: They don't make these deals in good places. They make these deals in the same places they won't lend. SULLIVAN: Still, he says, you won't find many housing advocates publicly criticizing the program. DANIEL: People protect it because it is all that there is. And if they take it away, what do you have? And not only do you take it away from poor people, but you also take it away from all the intermediaries who lose the money. It's difficult to get anybody to look at it from the taxpayers' point of view or even the families that should be benefiting from it. It's all we got. SULLIVAN: On a recent afternoon in South Dallas, I stood outside Nena Eldridge's wooden house where she can't afford to pay for water. ELDRIDGE: It's a pretty day out here, ain't it? SULLIVAN: Just up the road to the left is the tax credit property that has no room for her. And just down the road to the right is where she gets her water. ELDRIDGE: I don't take them out at daytime. I go down there early in the morning when it's dark; I go at night. They don't see me toting water. It's embarrassing. It is. I don't want them to know. SULLIVAN: But for her, it's a simple choice - housing instead of water. ELDRIDGE: I'm not homeless. I'm not living on the streets. And I look at other peoples be under bridges and sleeping. And I'm like, you know, that what make my pray every day, like, God, I'm not homeless. SULLIVAN: After billions of dollars a year and 30 years of effort, there's still no place Nena Eldridge can afford to live. Laura Sullivan, NPR News.

For the federal government, those lack of payments amount to an unpaid bill of $137 billion. For decades, the government has tried to get borrowers to pay up by hiring debt collection agencies to call and send letters. But as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports, a new controversial strategy to collect on student loan debt is being ramped up in cities around the United States, including Philadelphia. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: On Adriene McNally\u2019s 49th birthday in January, she heard a knock on the door of her modest row home in northeast Philadelphia. ADRIENE MCNALLY: They actually paid somebody to come out and serve me papers on a Saturday afternoon. I went to the door and he goes, sorry, just handed me the papers. ALLYN: The papers the papers were from a government lawsuit. The suit represents something more than just an unwelcome birthday gift. It's an example of a program the federal government has quietly brought to 19 federal district courts around the country, including ones that cover Brooklyn, Detroit and Miami. If nothing else works, officials are hiring private law firms to sue to recover unpaid student loans like McNally's. MCNALLY: Your whole body heats up with frustration because I'm so frustrated over all this. It's been so many years that they've been sending me mail and threatening me on the phone. ALLYN: McNally filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and cleared out all of her creditors except for the student loans, which are nearly impossible to get rid of in bankruptcy. As many others have found out, it's not easy escaping federal student loan debt. In the last two years, more than 3,300 student loan borrowers have been sued after defaulting, and that brought in $29 million. That's according to data obtained from the Department of Justice. In nearly every one of these suits, the borrower loses and the government wins. And what do they win? A lien on the borrower's assets. JENNIFER SCHULTZ: I describe a lien as like a marker on the house. ALLYN: Jennifer Schultz is an attorney with Community Legal Services of Philadelphia. She says if the borrower owns a home like McNally, it's like house handcuffs, people feel trapped. SCHULTZ: And so any time a person tries to do a transaction involving their house - a new mortgage, a refinance, or if they try to sell it - they're going to be expected that they clear up any debt that's attached to that house. ALLYN: The government has long been able to garnish wages, take income tax returns and divert Social Security and disability benefits, but targeting a property is a way of applying even more pressure to get former students to pay up. DREW SALAMAN: It's to try to awaken the avoider from their slumber. ALLYN: Drew Salaman doesn't do student loan work but has spent his career as a debt collection attorney. He says some of the borrowers are playing catch me if you can. And the lawsuits, he says, ensure that people take responsibility for their debts. SALAMAN: After all, if we don't have systems in place to recover debts, how can credit be extended? How can banks, stores, merchants extend credit? ALLYN: But the end result of these suits, the liens, can be seriously threatening to borrowers. That's according to Joanna Darcus, an attorney who works on the student loan team at the National Consumer Law Center. JOANNA DARCUS: So fighting against these lawsuits is actually a matter of housing preservation. And for folks who are already living on the margins financially, the fear of losing that house can be palpable. ALLYN: Once a lien is in place, the government can force the sale of a former student's home. Justice officials say that it's, quote, \"exceedingly rare\" but admitted it does happen. Advocates like Darcus say with the lawsuit program expected to keep expanding, the possibility is a real stick for the government. And with more than 8 million people currently behind on their federal student loans, the private firms won't run out of work any time soon. For NPR News, I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia.

It's a new collection of photographs by Lauren Greenfield. And it's not just pictures of people who are wealthy. It's people who want to be wealthy - a homeless woman with her knockoff Louis Vuitton purse, gang members with diamond and platinum grills. This is Lauren (laughter). LAUREN GREENFIELD: Hi. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hi. GREENFIELD: Nice to meet you. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Nice to meet you. (CROSSTALK)GREENFIELD: OK, great. Let me just. . . MCEVERS: I met up with Greenfield at the Annenberg Space for Photography here in Los Angeles, where there is an exhibit to accompany the new book. And she says some of her early work was photographing kids here in LA where she grew up. And this project about wealth and striving for wealth just developed from there even though she didn't know it was about that at the time. GREENFIELD: I started it as a kind of looking back at the culture that I grew up in. And then I went on to do other things about gender, about fashion, about consumerism, about how our values were exported. And it wasn't until the 2008 financial crash I realized that the stories that I had been doing for a couple of decades were all connected and kind of formed a morality tale. And so I started a process of going back and going forward, going back and looking through all my old work and seeing how the pieces of the puzzle fit together, what I had missed and also making new work that filled out this picture that I was starting to see about what it all added up to. MCEVERS: What it added up to is this massive collection of images organized into sections with titles like \"I Shop Therefore I Am\" and \"The Princess Brand. \" It's in chronological order, and at the exhibit, we start in the early '90s with images of private school kids, seventh graders, each flashing a hundred-dollar bill. If you're going to do a story about growing up in LA, they told Lauren Greenfield, you have to show money. Then there's the photo of high school kids who've skipped school to cruise the beach in their convertibles. And Greenfield says these kids aren't rich. GREENFIELD: I mean the thing about this project is it's not about the rich. It's really about our aspiration to wealth and our kind of needing to show that off whether we have it or not. So with the rich kids, I was kind of looking at how they were growing up quickly and how they were influenced by the values of Hollywood. But they were really influenced by the media and kind of MTV and hip-hop and looking to gangster culture and hip-hop culture for inspiration. And so then I also photographed kids from East LA and South LA who, on the other side, were emulating the trappings of wealth. MCEVERS: It's like a feedback loop, she says. The rich kids want to look like the poor kids, and the poor kids want to look like the rich kids. We look at another picture of a kid in a pinstriped suit and a rose boutonniere paying for a limo outside his prom date's house. GREENFIELD: Enrique was living in South Central. His mother was a seamstress. And he spent two years saving the $600 that he spent on prom. And his mother thought money could go to better use, but that - she knew how important it was to him. And he said it was completely worth it. They had a limo. It picked them up in South Central. Everybody was looking. And he said he felt like the king that day. MCEVERS: Yeah. GREENFIELD: So I think it's really important to understand that these values go beyond the rich. They go beyond the poor. They kind of cross class and race and even border. MCEVERS: All right, let's keep walking. Oh, yeah. There's a section in the exhibit called \"The Queen Of Versailles\" about a wealthy couple that builds this huge mansion, a section called \"Cult Of Celebrity\" with early images of the Kardashians. I mean this is Greenfield capturing famous people learning how to be famous. GREENFIELD: Fame has been an important driver in the work and the rise of fame. And with the rise of reality TV and the rise of social media, everybody can be a celebrity, and fame has currency. And so in a lot of my interviews, when you ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, they say rich and famous. MCEVERS: A theme that seems to emerge a lot, too, in your work is that people will pay money and want to acquire money to look like and have the trappings of having money. GREENFIELD: Exactly. There's a lot of fake it till you make it. Future the rapper says fake it till you make it. Kingpin (ph), a rap promoter, says playing the role is as important as being the role. MCEVERS: You know, there's all these pictures of people at pool parties and other sections - you know, champagne and all this stuff. Like, in some ways, they look like they're having a really good time. Did you get a sense that these people are happy? GREENFIELD: Well, David Siegel from \"The Queen Of Versailles\" had a great quote when he said, money doesn't make you happy. It just makes you unhappy in a better section of town. MCEVERS: (Laughter). GREENFIELD: You know, there's a striving that kind of continues among the rich. And \"Queen Of Versailles\" was a perfect example. They lived in a 26,000-square-foot house and then built a 90,000-square-foot house. So that is just kind of the best example of it never being enough. There's kind of a theme of addiction and the addiction of consumerism. And so with addiction, you never have enough, and there's no satisfaction. And eventually you hit rock bottom. MCEVERS: Which brings us to a section called \"The Fall\" where Lauren Greenfield captures the damage done by the 2008 economic crash. The pictures are different here. There are no pool parties. This is wealth pursued and taken away, people who reached up and discovered they reached too far. GREENFIELD: From Chuck, a GM worker who is in foreclosure and lost his job when the GM factory left town, to Jenny, who was a real estate agent, very successful in the crash, bought a house, built a pool and then lost it to foreclosure and had to turn to phone sex because it was the only job she could do at home where she wouldn't take her truck out and fear having her truck be repossessed. MCEVERS: Wow. GREENFIELD: This is an empty home where the child's trophies were all left in the garage. MCEVERS: The exhibit ends with a section called \"Make It Rain\" - dollar bills floating down on naked women who crawl on the floor and pick them up at a famous strip club in Atlanta, a T-shirt that says being broke is not an option. And Greenfield says now, decades after she started taking these pictures, projecting wealth is more important than ever. GREENFIELD: I think the backdrop of these 25 years is that we've never had more inequality, and we've never had less social mobility. So in a way, fictitious social mobility, bling and presentation, has replaced real social mobility. MCEVERS: Right because it's all you can get. GREENFIELD: Because it's all you can get. And there's - you know, I've kind of looked at this shift in our values where we've gone from kind of the Protestant ethic of hard work and thrift and frugality and modesty to a culture of bling and showing off and narcissism. And there is this kind of elevation of materialism that's almost like the new spirituality. MCEVERS: Lauren Greenfield, thank you so much. GREENFIELD: Thank you. MCEVERS: This has been really, really interesting. GREENFIELD: Thanks for doing it.

And this project about wealth and striving for wealth just developed from there even though she didn't know it was about that at the time. GREENFIELD: I started it as a kind of looking back at the culture that I grew up in. And then I went on to do other things about gender, about fashion, about consumerism, about how our values were exported. And it wasn't until the 2008 financial crash I realized that the stories that I had been doing for a couple of decades were all connected and kind of formed a morality tale. And so I started a process of going back and going forward, going back and looking through all my old work and seeing how the pieces of the puzzle fit together, what I had missed and also making new work that filled out this picture that I was starting to see about what it all added up to. MCEVERS: What it added up to is this massive collection of images organized into sections with titles like \"I Shop Therefore I Am\" and \"The Princess Brand. \" It's in chronological order, and at the exhibit, we start in the early '90s with images of private school kids, seventh graders, each flashing a hundred-dollar bill. If you're going to do a story about growing up in LA, they told Lauren Greenfield, you have to show money. Then there's the photo of high school kids who've skipped school to cruise the beach in their convertibles. And Greenfield says these kids aren't rich. GREENFIELD: I mean the thing about this project is it's not about the rich. It's really about our aspiration to wealth and our kind of needing to show that off whether we have it or not. So with the rich kids, I was kind of looking at how they were growing up quickly and how they were influenced by the values of Hollywood. But they were really influenced by the media and kind of MTV and hip-hop and looking to gangster culture and hip-hop culture for inspiration. And so then I also photographed kids from East LA and South LA who, on the other side, were emulating the trappings of wealth. MCEVERS: It's like a feedback loop, she says. The rich kids want to look like the poor kids, and the poor kids want to look like the rich kids. We look at another picture of a kid in a pinstriped suit and a rose boutonniere paying for a limo outside his prom date's house. GREENFIELD: Enrique was living in South Central. His mother was a seamstress. And he spent two years saving the $600 that he spent on prom. And his mother thought money could go to better use, but that - she knew how important it was to him. And he said it was completely worth it. They had a limo. It picked them up in South Central. Everybody was looking. And he said he felt like the king that day. MCEVERS: Yeah. GREENFIELD: So I think it's really important to understand that these values go beyond the rich. They go beyond the poor. They kind of cross class and race and even border. MCEVERS: All right, let's keep walking. Oh, yeah. There's a section in the exhibit called \"The Queen Of Versailles\" about a wealthy couple that builds this huge mansion, a section called \"Cult Of Celebrity\" with early images of the Kardashians. I mean this is Greenfield capturing famous people learning how to be famous. GREENFIELD: Fame has been an important driver in the work and the rise of fame. And with the rise of reality TV and the rise of social media, everybody can be a celebrity, and fame has currency. And so in a lot of my interviews, when you ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, they say rich and famous. MCEVERS: A theme that seems to emerge a lot, too, in your work is that people will pay money and want to acquire money to look like and have the trappings of having money. GREENFIELD: Exactly. There's a lot of fake it till you make it. Future the rapper says fake it till you make it. Kingpin (ph), a rap promoter, says playing the role is as important as being the role. MCEVERS: You know, there's all these pictures of people at pool parties and other sections - you know, champagne and all this stuff. Like, in some ways, they look like they're having a really good time. Did you get a sense that these people are happy? GREENFIELD: Well, David Siegel from \"The Queen Of Versailles\" had a great quote when he said, money doesn't make you happy. It just makes you unhappy in a better section of town. MCEVERS: (Laughter). GREENFIELD: You know, there's a striving that kind of continues among the rich. And \"Queen Of Versailles\" was a perfect example. They lived in a 26,000-square-foot house and then built a 90,000-square-foot house. So that is just kind of the best example of it never being enough. There's kind of a theme of addiction and the addiction of consumerism. And so with addiction, you never have enough, and there's no satisfaction. And eventually you hit rock bottom. MCEVERS: Which brings us to a section called \"The Fall\" where Lauren Greenfield captures the damage done by the 2008 economic crash. The pictures are different here. There are no pool parties. This is wealth pursued and taken away, people who reached up and discovered they reached too far. GREENFIELD: From Chuck, a GM worker who is in foreclosure and lost his job when the GM factory left town, to Jenny, who was a real estate agent, very successful in the crash, bought a house, built a pool and then lost it to foreclosure and had to turn to phone sex because it was the only job she could do at home where she wouldn't take her truck out and fear having her truck be repossessed. MCEVERS: Wow. GREENFIELD: This is an empty home where the child's trophies were all left in the garage. MCEVERS: The exhibit ends with a section called \"Make It Rain\" - dollar bills floating down on naked women who crawl on the floor and pick them up at a famous strip club in Atlanta, a T-shirt that says being broke is not an option. And Greenfield says now, decades after she started taking these pictures, projecting wealth is more important than ever. GREENFIELD: I think the backdrop of these 25 years is that we've never had more inequality, and we've never had less social mobility. So in a way, fictitious social mobility, bling and presentation, has replaced real social mobility. MCEVERS: Right because it's all you can get. GREENFIELD: Because it's all you can get. And there's - you know, I've kind of looked at this shift in our values where we've gone from kind of the Protestant ethic of hard work and thrift and frugality and modesty to a culture of bling and showing off and narcissism. And there is this kind of elevation of materialism that's almost like the new spirituality. MCEVERS: Lauren Greenfield, thank you so much. GREENFIELD: Thank you. MCEVERS: This has been really, really interesting. GREENFIELD: Thanks for doing it. MCEVERS: Lauren Greenfield's book is called \"Generation Wealth. \" The exhibit is up at LA's Annenberg Space for Photography through August 13.

Precisely - over $120 billion in debt that the U. S. territory owes to bondholders, to other creditors, also to retirees with pensions. So a federal judge is presiding over a legal process set up by Congress to help Puerto Rico restructure its massive public debt. And this is similar to the bankruptcy proceedings Detroit went through, but Puerto Rico's debt is actually many times larger. NPR's Greg Allen is in San Juan covering the first hearing in what could be a long legal process. Hey, Greg. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Morning, David. GREENE: So is the Detroit comparison right, I mean, a place mired in debt and filing for bankruptcy? ALLEN: Yes, but unlike Detroit, Puerto Rico can't access Chapter 9 bankruptcy under U. S. bankruptcy law 'cause it's a U. S. territory. So because of that, Congress last year passed a law which sets up a fiscal oversight board that's been working with the government here. The government's been working to cut spending and improve revenues. And they've submitted a fiscal plan that leaves them just $800 million a year to service its debt. And that's just a quarter of what it owes all its creditors. So they're having this Title III hearing it's called. It's being done in federal district court here. U. S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain will now be sorting through the claims and begin deciding who gets what out of all this money. GREENE: Well, how did Puerto Rico - this U. S. territory - manage to run up so much - so many billions and billions in debt? ALLEN: Well, you know, it doesn't happen overnight, of course. It's - it built up really over more than a decade here. Puerto Rico's been in a recession now since 2006. And that's led this huge exodus of people from the island. As you know, 450,000 people left here over the last decade, so revenues have dropped. The government's funded operating expenses in some cases by issuing bonds and accumulating debt. In 2015, the governor declared that they couldn't pay the debt. They began to default. And that forced Congress to take action last year, passing this law that created a structure for the island to begin restructuring its debt. I talked to an economist, Sergio Marxuach with the Center for a New Economy here in San Juan. He said there's little hope of getting the economy going until the island actually resolves this issue of its crushing debt. SERGIO MARXUACH: Right now, we have this big cloud over the economy, right? We have all this debt that hasn't been restructured and which we cannot pay. So to the extent you still have that uncertainty hanging over the economy, I think it's going to make it very difficult for Puerto Rico to attract the amount of investment we need to really get the economy going. GREENE: Yeah. Greg, it sounds like - I mean, you and I reported on people leaving the island in economic distress. It sounds like this just snowballs. Once people leave, the economy gets even worse because the revenue's not coming in and they get in this position. ALLEN: That's right. It's been this spiral. And it's not clear when the spiral's going to end, but this process that's beginning today will start to put this behind them they're hoping. But it's going to be worse than the Detroit bankruptcy in many cases because there's so many different classes of bondholders, many who think they have precedence over others. You've got all these retirees that are owed pensions. The governor's said they're going to get at least a 10 percent cut, at least some of them will. You've got other creditors. They've just closed 180 public schools on the island, which left parents and students very upset. There's a half - there's $500 million in cuts proposed for the university here, and there's a student strike. So lots of pain to come here. And the governor is going to be releasing a budget a little later this month which will show a lot more pain coming. Among the things that are going to happen is I think big cuts in health care benefits here. So it's going to be a messy thing here. And it could take as long as Detroit's case. That was about a year and a half. This one some people think might take much longer, maybe four or even five years. GREENE: Wow. All right, talking with NPR's Greg Allen in San Juan, Puerto Rico, about that U. S. territory trying to find a way to climb out from billions of dollars in debt. Greg, thanks a lot.

The White House is pushing for a series of personal and corporate tax cuts. One industry that benefits from the current tax code is real estate. President Trump himself has long taken advantage of local, state and federal tax breaks. Any changes in the tax code could affect his bottom line, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: When a young Donald Trump came to Manhattan from Queens in the 1970s, this was the project that made him famous - The Grand Hyatt, a gleaming glass tower on East 42nd Street. TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: This was his first sort of flag in the ground as a New York developer. ZARROLI: Trump biographer Timothy O'Brien says the deal would never have gone through if city officials hadn't agreed to an unprecedented 40-year tax abatement. O'BRIEN: It was crucial to the finances of the deal-making sense at the time it was struck. It was crucial to the banks who loaned him money to get it done. ZARROLI: Over the years, Trump would seek lavish tax breaks for every property he built, including Trump Tower. O'BRIEN: Once he got the tax abatement on the Grand Hyatt, that became like red meat to Donald. I think it was always part and parcel of his negotiating stance. ZARROLI: Although Trump has never released his tax returns, The New York Times estimated last year that Trump had received some $885 million in tax abatements over a 40-year career. Nicole Gelinas is with the Manhattan Institute. NICOLE GELINAS: Long before Trump ran for president, he was known in New York City as a developer who was consummate at finding and obtaining these tax breaks, even when these tax breaks weren't specifically designed for his types of projects. ZARROLI: And he would do the same thing in Nevada, Florida and almost anywhere he did business. Trump would persuade local officials to cut his property taxes, and he would regularly appeal the assessments of properties he owned. Trump also benefited greatly from federal tax breaks. Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center says in some significant ways, the U. S. tax code helps real estate developers. For instance, they have much more leeway to deduct expenses. STEVE ROSENTHAL: A normal taxpayer outside of this area would be limited on, say, interest expense deductions, operating expense deductions. But there are special forms of relief for real estate investors. ZARROLI: Over the years, there have been scattered attempts to eliminate some of these breaks, but they have never gone far, says Nicole Gelinas. GELINAS: People talk about it but never very seriously. Even in the very vague tax proposal that Trump put out, they would leave real estate alone. ZARROLI: But some members of Congress say it may be necessary to reconsider a few of these tax breaks. One idea under consideration is to reduce deductions for interest payments. In a business like real estate that relies heavily on debt financing, that could be a big blow. The Trump administration has resisted such ideas in the past, and the Tax Policy Center's Steve Rosenthal says there's likely to be big pushback against such a change. ROSENTHAL: Real estate is a very powerful political force. There are real estate interests in every congressional district in the country. ZARROLI: Rosenthal says other moves being contemplated by Congress would actually benefit Trump. For instance, most of Trump's businesses are what are called pass-through entities. The money they make is counted as income. So a big cut in personal income tax rates would reduce Trump's tax bill. Whether Republicans can succeed in pushing through their tax overhaul this year is unclear. But for Trump, a lot is at stake if they do. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. (SOUNDBITE OF YASUAKI SHIMIZU'S \"108 DESIRES\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Despite the political drama surrounding President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan said today he's confident Republicans can still achieve one of their major policy goals this year - a tax overhaul. The White House is pushing for a series of personal and corporate tax cuts. One industry that benefits from the current tax code is real estate. President Trump himself has long taken advantage of local, state and federal tax breaks. Any changes in the tax code could affect his bottom line, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: When a young Donald Trump came to Manhattan from Queens in the 1970s, this was the project that made him famous - The Grand Hyatt, a gleaming glass tower on East 42nd Street. TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: This was his first sort of flag in the ground as a New York developer. ZARROLI: Trump biographer Timothy O'Brien says the deal would never have gone through if city officials hadn't agreed to an unprecedented 40-year tax abatement. O'BRIEN: It was crucial to the finances of the deal-making sense at the time it was struck. It was crucial to the banks who loaned him money to get it done. ZARROLI: Over the years, Trump would seek lavish tax breaks for every property he built, including Trump Tower. O'BRIEN: Once he got the tax abatement on the Grand Hyatt, that became like red meat to Donald. I think it was always part and parcel of his negotiating stance. ZARROLI: Although Trump has never released his tax returns, The New York Times estimated last year that Trump had received some $885 million in tax abatements over a 40-year career. Nicole Gelinas is with the Manhattan Institute. NICOLE GELINAS: Long before Trump ran for president, he was known in New York City as a developer who was consummate at finding and obtaining these tax breaks, even when these tax breaks weren't specifically designed for his types of projects. ZARROLI: And he would do the same thing in Nevada, Florida and almost anywhere he did business. Trump would persuade local officials to cut his property taxes, and he would regularly appeal the assessments of properties he owned. Trump also benefited greatly from federal tax breaks. Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center says in some significant ways, the U. S. tax code helps real estate developers. For instance, they have much more leeway to deduct expenses. STEVE ROSENTHAL: A normal taxpayer outside of this area would be limited on, say, interest expense deductions, operating expense deductions. But there are special forms of relief for real estate investors. ZARROLI: Over the years, there have been scattered attempts to eliminate some of these breaks, but they have never gone far, says Nicole Gelinas. GELINAS: People talk about it but never very seriously. Even in the very vague tax proposal that Trump put out, they would leave real estate alone. ZARROLI: But some members of Congress say it may be necessary to reconsider a few of these tax breaks. One idea under consideration is to reduce deductions for interest payments. In a business like real estate that relies heavily on debt financing, that could be a big blow. The Trump administration has resisted such ideas in the past, and the Tax Policy Center's Steve Rosenthal says there's likely to be big pushback against such a change.

And while many are sorry to see the circus close, animal welfare activists are counting this as a major victory. The Humane Society of the United States and the people for the Ethical Treatment of Animals see the closing as part of a broader trend in the way Americans think about animals and treat them. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: If you've gone to the circus in recent years, you probably saw them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTORS: (Chanting) Boycott the circus. ALLEN: That's from a protest outside the Ringling Brothers Circus when it was in Phoenix earlier this year. In January when Feld Entertainment said this would be the Ringling Brothers' last season, animal welfare groups cheered. The circus and how it treats its animals, especially elephants and big cats, has long been a focus for the groups. LISA LANGE: PETA was founded in 1980 and Ringling Brothers was a target of ours from the very beginning. ALLEN: Lisa Lange with PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, believes the protests played a key role in changing public attitudes about the circus. In announcing the end, Feld Entertainment chairman Kenneth Feld acknowledged the decades of conflict with animal welfare groups. But he said the decision was made because of declining attendance and a change in public taste. Here's Lange. LANGE: Yes. People no longer have a taste for that kind of entertainment, but we believe it's because they now know what that kind of entertainment cost those animals. ALLEN: The demise of the Ringling Brothers' circus comes just months after SeaWorld agreed to stop breeding its captive orcas and to move away from its signature theatrical shows around the same time the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced it was closing its dolphin exhibit and would move its dolphins to an ocean sanctuary. Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the U. S. believes a major change is going on in how Americans view animal welfare issues. WAYNE PACELLE: It's happening across the economy. It's happening across our culture, and we're really seeing a rising tide of consciousness when it comes to the treatment of animals. ALLEN: Animal welfare groups have seen success in many other areas as well. In the last few years, major pork producers have eliminated confinement pens for pregnant sows. Egg producers have also begun getting rid of cages for their chickens. Pacelle says some of this has been accomplished through legislation. In other cases, change had been pushed by retailers like McDonald's and Wal-Mart. PACELLE: In most cases, companies are now adapting. They're simply changing the way they do business to reflect a greater consciousness about animals and ringing the animal cruelty out of the business model. ALLEN: Lisa Lange of PETA says after decades of working on animal rights, she believes the movement has finally hit the mainstream. A major factor she believes is the power of social media. LANGE: We have the ability to show people a video of elephants, for example, being beaten behind the scenes at a Ringling Brothers' performance, and we put that up on our Facebook page, Instagram. We tweet it out and millions of people see that video within hours. ALLEN: Pacelle cites a powerful example, the death of Cecil the lion. For years, the Humane Society worked to stop trophy hunting of lions, elephants and other big game with limited success. But two years ago when a Minnesota dentist killed a lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, Pacelle recalls it went viral. PACELLE: Many of these things go unnoticed, but one brave Zimbabwean activist got a hold of the image of the grinning hunters over the slain lion. And within 24 hours, more than a billion people had seen it. ALLEN: Soon, all the major air carriers had agreed to ban shipment of lion, elephant, rhino and other large animal trophies worldwide. Pacelle believes concern about animal welfare is now a value shared by all Americans.

It's presenting the 2018 budget today. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney calls it a, quote, \"taxpayer first\" budget. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICK MULVANEY: We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs. MARTIN: The budget includes less money for Medicaid, food stamps and disability payments; more money for the military, Border Patrol and veterans. We've got NPR's Scott Horsley on the line with us to give us a preview of the budget. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: How does this spending plan measure up to the draft budget plan that we saw earlier this year? HORSLEY: Well, the budget that came out a couple of months ago was referred to at the White House as the skinny budget, and it only dealt with a skinny piece of the overall government spending pie, namely the so-called discretionary spending that Congress has to authorize each year. This budget is more comprehensive, and it includes what is really the bulk of government spending, which is entitlement programs. Now, it doesn't make big changes to the biggest entitlement programs, namely Medicare and the Social Security retirement programs. But it does call for substantial cuts to other mandatory spending, including the Social Security disability program, food stamps, as you mentioned, and Medicaid. It would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid spending over the next decade. MARTIN: Didn't we hear about these Medicaid cuts when the House passed their health care bill and didn't some senators say no way to those cuts? HORSLEY: (Laughter) You're right. And that is a useful reminder, that this blueprint that the White House puts out is just sort of a notional idea of what the White House would like to see. But ultimately, it's Congress that controls the purse strings, and lawmakers will have to decide what sort of spending they're going to authorize. But yes, the Obamacare repeal bill that was drafted by Republicans in the House would cut substantially into Medicaid, and there are some Republican senators who have expressed concern about that, certainly moderate Republicans but also some very conservative Republicans in states that did expand the Medicaid program under Obamacare and in some cases saw big gains in the number of people getting health insurance. MARTIN: So what about the deficit - which is something that has traditionally been incredibly important to the Republican Party, getting the deficit under control. Does this budget move in that direction? HORSLEY: It does. This budget, if it were actually adopted, says it would reduce the deficit as a share of the overall economy really right away and would actually eliminate the federal budget in its 10th year in 2027. However, big asterisks attached to that one as it does rely on these pretty substantial cuts, which Congress may or may not see fit to enact. And also it relies on a relatively rosy forecast of what's going to happen with the U. S. economy. Namely, it suggests that the economy is going to ramp up rather quickly in the next several years to 3 percent annual economic growth - that's about double the growth rate we saw last year - and that it would sustain that 3 percent growth rate for the better part of a decade. Now, a lot of independent forecasters think that's overly optimistic, partly because where would the workers come from to have that level of economic growth? We already have relatively low unemployment, and we have a lot of baby boomers who are hitting retirement age every day. One of the rationales the Trump administration offers for these cuts to safety net programs is it would effectively force some people who are not working now to get back into the workforce.

Store closings and bankruptcies are expected to continue as the Internet hammers stores. Retail firms will need more labor in the future - high-skilled labor - but companies have not invested much in retraining for new times. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: For 35 years, Harry Friedman has run a Lenexa, Kansas-based consultancy that trains entry-level retail workers in customer service and other basics. I asked him whether he also retrains laid-off retail workers for new skills. HARRY FRIEDMAN: No, we do none of it. I don't know that anybody does any of it. NOGUCHI: He says training, in general, is not a top priority for most retailers, making things tough on his business. FRIEDMAN: It's like owning a film processing store or a travel agency. (Laughter). It's kind of tough. NOGUCHI: Retail is increasingly what experts call omnichannel, meaning most retailers sell through a hybrid of online and traditional stores. Just as manufacturing jobs evolved to incorporate more computing, retails hiring needs are mostly on the e-commerce side, jobs in areas such as warehousing, logistics and technology. The National Retail Federation says to better equip people for those new jobs, it launched a training and certification program for workers. Maureen Conway is skeptical that will work. Conway is executive director of the Economic Opportunities Program at The Aspen Institute and notes the industry backed a similar certification program over a decade ago. MAUREEN CONWAY: Unfortunately, it didn't seem that retail employers valued somebody who had the certificate versus somebody who didn't. NOGUCHI: The challenges to retraining in retail are myriad. Frieda Molina is deputy director of MDRC, a social research group. She says many workers simply aren't interested. FRIEDA MOLINA: It's hard to make that case to them given the sort of more negative reputation of retail and the fact that many people at that lower level don't have the resources to be able to invest time and effort and lost wages, potentially, in getting additional training. NOGUCHI: Kathryn Shaw, a professor at Stanford Business School, says there's a basic question of the payoff. In manufacturing, there were government programs to support retraining, and the industry wages were pretty high. The same dynamics don't exist in retail. KATHRYN SHAW: Coal mining is very vocal. Manufacturing is vocal. Retail is a very dispersed, diffuse group, not unionized. And therefore, they're going to be less vocal. NOGUCHI: Still, some retailers see a business need to invest in retraining. Two years ago, Walmart started an academy that trains about a quarter of a million of its employees a year, while they work in more advanced skills. Kathleen McLaughlin, chief sustainability officer for Walmart, says the training for both in-store and online operations have paid off in higher comparable store sales and improved customer service marks. KATHLEEN MCLAUGHLIN: It is very economic for retailers to invest in their people at all levels. NOGUCHI: McLaughlin says Walmart is trying to partner with other large retailers to develop industry-wide training standards. MCLAUGHLIN: Retailers do need to take a look at their people and create paths for them that are exciting and provide the skills needed to succeed, not only the jobs of today but as these jobs continue to evolve.

S. oil industry is coming out of a slump that's gone on for two years. Today, there are more than twice as many rigs drilling for oil compared to a year ago. One big factor is OPEC, the cartel of oil exporting states. Last year, OPEC cut oil production to prop up the market. Tomorrow, it decides whether to keep that cut going. Amy Sisk of Prairie Public Broadcasting reports on the impact all of this is having in oil rich North Dakota. AMY SISK, BYLINE: It's busy again at this gas station in Williston, the hub of the Bakken oil patch. ANGELA NEUMAN: What's up buddy? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Not much. Pump one and two, please. SISK: Manager Angela Neuman says, lately, cigarettes and chewing tobacco are flying off the shelves. NEUMAN: But now there's so many new people, I cannot get a handle on that. It's been a little rough (laughter). SISK: It wasn't like this a year ago. The price of oil was low, and that made drilling less profitable. Across town at the Winterton Suites hotel, sometimes there were only one or two guests. The price dropped to a bargain - $100 a night. CHELSEY CROZIER: We almost actually thought we were going to lose it for a little bit. SISK: Hotel manager Chelsey Crozier says occupancy ticked back up this spring. CROZIER: Of course, not as crazy as it was, but it's doing better. SISK: It was crazy busy a few years back when the price of oil was sky high. A room here cost $300 a night. No Vacancy signs were lit up across the oil patch. But that boom led to so much oil production that the market got flooded, and the price of oil tanked. That's when OPEC's stepped in to boost prices by cutting production. Russia followed suit. Eugene Graner is with Heartland Investor Capital Management in Bismarck. EUGENE GRANER: Effectively, these cuts that were put into place last fall are being filled in by other countries for oil. SISK: Countries like the United States. America ramped up production to 9. 3 million barrels of oil per day, close to the level before prices plummeted. When OPEC's meets tomorrow, it's expected to keep its cuts in place. Graner says that would help ensure this mini boom in America keeps going. President Trump has promised to unleash the energy industry by lifting all kinds of regulations. His full rollback hasn't happened yet, but energy analyst Trisha Curtis with PetroNerds says his move to approve the Dakota Access Pipeline is helpful. TRISHA CURTIS: That gives sort of a green light. If you were a little hesitant on the Bakken on activity or development, that certainly is a game changer there. SISK: The pipeline is slated to come online next week. It will make transporting Bakken oil cheaper and allow it to reach the Gulf Coast. In North Dakota, jobs to produce that oil abound.

'S SONG, \"BEHAVE YOURSELF\")CORNISH: That story comes to us from Inside Energy, a public media collaboration focused on America's energy issues. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The U. S. oil industry is coming out of a slump that's gone on for two years. Today, there are more than twice as many rigs drilling for oil compared to a year ago. One big factor is OPEC, the cartel of oil exporting states. Last year, OPEC cut oil production to prop up the market. Tomorrow, it decides whether to keep that cut going. Amy Sisk of Prairie Public Broadcasting reports on the impact all of this is having in oil rich North Dakota. AMY SISK, BYLINE: It's busy again at this gas station in Williston, the hub of the Bakken oil patch. ANGELA NEUMAN: What's up buddy? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Not much. Pump one and two, please. SISK: Manager Angela Neuman says, lately, cigarettes and chewing tobacco are flying off the shelves. NEUMAN: But now there's so many new people, I cannot get a handle on that. It's been a little rough (laughter). SISK: It wasn't like this a year ago. The price of oil was low, and that made drilling less profitable. Across town at the Winterton Suites hotel, sometimes there were only one or two guests. The price dropped to a bargain - $100 a night. CHELSEY CROZIER: We almost actually thought we were going to lose it for a little bit. SISK: Hotel manager Chelsey Crozier says occupancy ticked back up this spring. CROZIER: Of course, not as crazy as it was, but it's doing better. SISK: It was crazy busy a few years back when the price of oil was sky high. A room here cost $300 a night. No Vacancy signs were lit up across the oil patch. But that boom led to so much oil production that the market got flooded, and the price of oil tanked. That's when OPEC's stepped in to boost prices by cutting production. Russia followed suit. Eugene Graner is with Heartland Investor Capital Management in Bismarck.

The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been since 2007, but these students have also come of age during a recession followed by a sluggish recovery. So we were wondering how all this could be affecting these freshly minted graduates and job seekers. To talk about this, we called Mihir Desai. He's a professor at the Harvard Business School. He has a new book out called \"The Wisdom Of Finance. \" But we called him because he published a piece this week in The Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper. In the spirit of full disclosure, that was my first journalism gig. Professor Mihir Desai, thank you so much for joining us. MIHIR DESAI: Thanks so much. It's a pleasure. MARTIN: So the last time the unemployment numbers were this low, these students were in third grade. Do you see an impact on this generation of having grown up in this timeframe? DESAI: Yeah. I think part of what's happened is they don't allocate as much importance to economic outcomes that, perhaps, previous generations did. So they grew up in an era of reduced expectations in some ways. And as a consequence, they look for different ways to fill their life up which is not purely professional. In some ways, that's quite helpful. On the other hand, it is a time in their life when they really should be dedicating themselves to building the human capital that will last them through the rest of their lives. MARTIN: And let me get to the piece that caught our eye which is the piece that you posted in The Crimson, \"The Trouble With Optionality\" which is a way of saying - can you break it down in layman's terms for us - what? - hedging your bets? DESAI: Yeah, exactly. MARTIN: Keeping your options open? DESAI: Yeah. So the number of young people I see who talk about maximizing optionality which is just a fancy way of saying I want to make sure and have as many options as possible, so I think that sounds like a great strategy. But what I've observed over the last several years is these people become obsessed with optionality, you know, with having options. And instead of doing what we think that we do, which is enable risk-taking, you know, which is what options are supposed to be able to do. Right? You don't acquire options just for their own use. You do it, so you can actually take on big risks. What I observed these people doing is just habitually acquiring options. They just get so used to the process of acquiring options that they never really execute on this larger vision of what they want. So part of what I wanted to do in the piece is say, look, that's not the right way to think about this. In fact, when you do these things that acquire options, for example, working at prestigious firms - these are, again, for the elite graduates going to grad school - you know, your social network, yes that's wonderful. It allows you to have a lot of optionality. But don't forget that the really great things in life come from big, risky investments. And I think that's a really important piece of what people are missing out on. And in particular, you can get stuck. You can get stuck in a place where you think you're maximizing your options, and then you wake up. And you're, you know - you're still there 20 years later. MARTIN: That was going to be my last question. It's commencement season, and everybody from Hillary Clinton to Will Ferrell is - as we just heard - are offering advice to recent graduates. So any other advice that I didn't have the wit to squeeze out of you to this point? DESAI: Well, yeah. It is - it's always remarkable how in some ways consistent graduation advices, and, in some ways, that makes it anodyne, but that doesn't make it any less true, which is the pursuit of things that we truly love is the secret to professional happiness and blocking out the noise. I guess that's one thing I would add which is there is so much noise out there, noise about what, you know, the unemployment rate is or noise about what you should be doing with your life or noise about what your friends are doing or what your parents want you to do. Just block it all out. Look inside yourself. Find out who you are and pursue that. So block out all the noise I think is an important piece of it as well.

It would slash a lot of spending on education, environmental programs, food stamps, Medicaid funding and more and increase military spending by 10 percent. There's doubt in Congress that the budget will pass without a lot of changes. All of the proposals bank on a projection of 3 percent growth in the U. S. economy by 2021. Nick Timiraos is national economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. NICK TIMIRAOS: Thanks for having me. SIMON: Based on what you've learned, 3 percent growth - does that seem confident, optimistic or naive? TIMIRAOS: Well, it's extremely optimistic. The professional forecasters at the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve see growth of a little less than 2 percent over the coming decade. And that's where we've been for the past decade. Now, presidents, in their budget, get to assume that all of their policies become law. So you always see a little bit higher increase in the growth rate in the White House budgets but nothing that's quite diverged like this from what the consensus view is. SIMON: Are there times in history when the U. S. has had a growth rate of 3 percent? TIMIRAOS: Yes, it's been quite common. I mean, if you look back over the last 200 years - and the Trump administration says this - we have grown at 3 percent. And we don't want to give in to this idea that we now have a lower growth rate. They see that as giving up. The issue right now - growth is a combination of your labor force, how fast you're adding workers to the economy and how productive those workers are. So labor force productivity has been slow for the last decade. And the demographics in our country, the aging of the baby boom, means that the workforce is not growing as quickly as it used to. Those two things together explain why we've had 2 percent growth, and demographics are really baked in. So unless you're going to increase immigration, the labor force isn't going to grow at the rate that it did in the 1970s and the 1980s. That puts the onus on productivity. Boosting productivity was what the Trump administration is going to have to do to get 3 percent growth. SIMON: And that would entail what? TIMIRAOS: Well, the level of productivity growth you would need to get 3 percent growth - you'd have to see a boom. You'd have to see some of the best productivity the country has had since World War II, really something like the late 1990s. To do that, you would want to see investment in education, research and development or business spending, businesses investing more in factories and robotics and technology that's going to allow their workers to be more productive. SIMON: Would 3 percent growth create enough economic activity to give jobs or wage increases to people, for example, who might lose food stamps? TIMIRAOS: It would. If you don't think that it's realistic that we're going to get 3 percent growth - economic policy is about trade-offs. And so the Trump administration is inheriting a bleak fiscal picture here. Deficits are rising again because the baby boom generation is retiring. We're going to be spending more on Medicare and more on Social Security. And so you either have to change those programs or raise taxes or cut spending to prevent deficits from rising. An alternative is you can say - well, we're just going to grow faster. But if you don't do that, then you end up with even higher deficits. So in 2027, the 10th year of this budget, the Trump administration assumes that their growth forecast will actually reduce spending by $500 billion that year. It'll bring in revenue of $500 billion so they can show a balanced budget. If you don't have that growth, now you actually have a much higher deficit.

It bars employers from asking job candidates about their salary history. California and Massachusetts recently adopted laws that do this, and this year, 25 states and the District of Columbia are considering such measures. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has more. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Aileen Rizo was four years into her job as a math teaching consultant for Fresno County, Calif. , when she found out a new male hire with less education and experience was offered a salary roughly 20 percent more than she was making. AILEEN RIZO: I kind of knew that I had broken stereotypes as a mathematician and as the only full-time woman in that department. But then to find out that you're getting paid less than all of your male counterparts, that they all started much higher salary steps than you did is just devastating. NOGUCHI: Rizo complained to human resources and was told her salary was set based on previous pay and that nothing would change. She was shocked, she says, and felt locked in. RIZO: I couldn't educate myself out of being paid less. I couldn't get more experience or be in the job market longer to break that cycle 'cause low wages will follow you wherever you go as long as someone keeps asking you how much you were paid. NOGUCHI: Rizo sued after that 2012 incident, arguing her employer violated the Equal Pay Act. RIZO: I have three young daughters, and I don't want them ever to feel that way. NOGUCHI: Rizo prevailed in lower court, but last month, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that ruling. Now she's considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. RIZO: After the 9th Circuit decision, I felt like now it's black and white. You can pay a woman less. So I don't want that to be the end of the story. NOGUCHI: In the years since Rizo filed her case, Massachusetts, California and New York City have passed or amended laws to ban employers from asking about previous salaries. Philadelphia's law is stayed pending litigation. Most of the measures have yet to take effect, so there's no data to show what impact they've had. Kevin Miller, a researcher at the American Association of University Women, says what is known is that college-educated women start out making 7 percent less than men a year after graduating. This is true comparing women and men who have similar levels of education who might have majored in the same subjects and chose the same jobs or industries to work in. Miller says that gap tends to increase with age and is worse for minorities. Employers who set their own pay without union or government salary bands also tend to see greater pay disparities. KEVIN MILLER: When you have more room to maneuver and more room to negotiate, I think that's where you see bias come in. NOGUCHI: Rizo's case prompted Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, representing Washington, D. C. , to introduce federal legislation banning employers from asking about prior salary information. Holmes says her bill has support from only Democrats, but she's hoping to build broader support over time. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON: We don't sit here and say, look at the current Congress. Why put this bill in? We do the opposite. I ask you to look at what you think the next Congress is going to look like. NOGUCHI: Employer groups generally oppose these new measures, saying they add to businesses' administrative burdens. Nancy Hammer is government affairs counsel for the Society for Human Resource Management. She says many employers ask about prior salary but not in order to discriminate. NANCY HAMMER: They don't want to waste the time of a candidate who's seeking a higher salary than they can offer. NOGUCHI: Instead of telling employers they can't ask about salary history, she says policies should focus on encouraging businesses to audit, identify and fix any internal pay gaps. HAMMER: Right now employers are hesitant to do that because it raises alarm bells that they were doing something wrong all along. NOGUCHI: Most employers want to keep their workers happy and motivated, she says, so it's in their interest not to create big disparities in pay. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

HAMMER: Right now employers are hesitant to do that because it raises alarm bells that they were doing something wrong all along. NOGUCHI: Most employers want to keep their workers happy and motivated, she says, so it's in their interest not to create big disparities in pay.

At this unsettled and unsettling moment, we're asking what big trends are driving our history. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Presidential adviser Michael Anton talked of rising nationalism, Irish leader Mary Robinson of the threat to global institutions, Francis Fukuyama of the threat to liberal democracy. Historian Jill Lepore quoted Alexander Hamilton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)JILL LEPORE: He says it has fallen to the people of the United States to answer the great question of human history, which is are people capable of writing a constitution in which they can live justly and fairly by reason? Or are we all fated inevitably to be ruled by force and accident? MARTIN: Our next guest has studied the way Americans wrestle with that question. INSKEEP: And he says a hidden force is shaping our politics. Actually, it's hidden in plain sight. Scholar Richard Reeves wrote a book called \"Dream Hoarders. \"What are dream hoarders? Who are they? RICHARD V. REEVES: They are members of the American upper middle class who through various ways are rigging the market - the housing market, the college market - are essentially hoarding the American dream. INSKEEP: Now, you didn't say middle class, you said upper middle ideas. And who do you mean? REEVES: I did because, well, one of the things you learn as you become an American, as I have, is that everyone's middle class. INSKEEP: At least nearly all of us think so, whether we're far upscale or far down. When Reeves says upper middle class, he means a smaller group, the top 20 percent or so of Americans, those with six-figure incomes and above. Remember all those political slogans about the 1 percent? Well, to Reeves, it's actually the 20 percent who dominate the best schools, live in the best located homes and pass on the best futures to their kids. REEVES: The things that bother me and that have startled me as a new American and someone who comes from a class-bound society like the U. K. are the opportunity hoarding mechanisms such as zoning our neighborhoods in a way that ensure our house prices go up. We protect our own neighborhoods. We hoard housing wealth. We also monopolize selective and elite higher education. And then we hand out internships and work opportunities on the basis of the social networks, so people we know in the neighborhood or meet on the tennis courts and so on. And so to that we are kind of hoarding those things that should be more widely available. INSKEEP: OK. You come from a country with princes and princesses and dukes and duchesses and knights, and you said you were surprised by how class bound the United States is. What are you talking about? REEVES: Yeah. You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I sort of miss the class consciousness of my old country which I grew up hating. The reason I miss it is because at least we're aware of it. It seems to me that in the U. S. , you have a class system that operates every bit as ruthlessly as the British class system but under the veneer of classless meritocracy. So there isn't even a self-awareness. INSKEEP: You have a heavily packed sentence here that I wrote down. We are using the tax system to help richer people buy bigger houses near the best schools. What do you mean by that? REEVES: The tax breaks, the tax incentives that are available to people to buy houses in the U. S. are unnecessarily tilted. It's very controversial. Something like $70 billion go on mortgage interest deductions and the deductions for local property taxes. What that does is it means that we're not increasing housing ownership in terms of breadth, we're increasing it in terms of depth. We're actually encouraging people who already have plenty of wealth to just double down on that by buying a more expensive. . . INSKEEP: Buy an even bigger house. REEVES: . . . Buy an even bigger house. INSKEEP: Which you can sell later for even more. REEVES: And you'll get an even bigger tax incentive from doing so. And so the cycle turns. And so the whole system is almost designed to seal off the upper middle class from everybody else. INSKEEP: Have we touched the main reasons that you say the system is rigged, housing and education? REEVES: Housing, education and then entry into work - the workplace. So we see that from one survey of colleges, just 3 in 5 graduating college students have done an internship. But the way those internships are handed out are very, very far from meritocratic. So to the extent that they're valuable opportunities, that is yet another way in which we rig the system. INSKEEP: Where did this system come from? Did somebody invent it? REEVES: Many of the mechanisms actually have racist roots. So the zoning laws, quite often they had racist origins, but they now work for class. INSKEEP: Oh, saying, for example, everybody has to have a 1-acre home lot gets lower class apartments out of your neighborhood, for example. REEVES: Absolutely, keeps them out, yes. Legacy preferences, which are one of the ways that college admissions are rigged. Legacy preferences are genuinely extraordinary in the literal sense. INSKEEP: Meaning if your mother went or your father went, you can go. REEVES: Yeah. And they're literally extraordinary in the sense that no other country in the world does that. Unthinkable in the land of my birth that. . . INSKEEP: Unthinkable in Britain, really? REEVES: Unthinkable, disappeared half a century ago if not more ago. They're unthinkable everywhere, Steve, except the United States of America. There were actually an attempt by elite colleges to keep Jewish students out. And so what you see is the sort of mechanisms that were evolved for different reasons. Now they interweave with each other to create a deeply unequal society. INSKEEP: So to what extent are the trends you describe driving the history we're living right now? REEVES: I have come to believe that the dangerous separation of the American upper middle class from the rest of society is a huge problem for politics because there's a sense of a bubble. There's a sense of people who are kind of making out pretty well from current trends and who are increasingly separate occupationally, residentially, educationally and economically from the rest of society. They are also disproportionately powerful. And the fact that they are not only separate from the rest of society but unaware of the degree to which the system works in their favor strikes me as one of the most dangerous political facts of our time. INSKEEP: Is this trend why Donald Trump became president of the United States? REEVES: I do think the - to the extent that there was a kind of anger that lay behind Trump's support and anger at a certain class, I think it's pretty clear that that anger was at us. It was at the upper middle class. And I'm not legitimizing that anger at all, but I am pointing out that to some extent the system is in fact rigged in our favor. And unless we're willing to admit that and do something about it, then to some extent people are right to be angry at us. INSKEEP: Have you ended up at dinner with upper middle class friends and started talking about this? REEVES: Yes. And I discovered that the idea that some people should be downwardly mobile in order to allow other people to be upwardly mobile is a deeply unpopular one around upper middle class dinner tables. . . INSKEEP: (Laughter). REEVES: . . . Especially when you start sort of trying to identify which of your own children are being identified as the downwardly mobile ones. But, you know, these are very uncomfortable conversations in many ways. But I think that unless we're willing to tolerate a little bit of discomfort in our conversations, then really we're in really deep trouble. INSKEEP: Richard V.

As we've reported recently, it is one of the fastest depopulating towns in rural America. Now some more tough news for the town. It's two large public housing projects are being shut down. And that is leading to questions about whether Cairo can or even should survive. Here's NPR's Kirk Siegler. MONTE ELLIS: What they doing to us, G? KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Monte Ellis and his little sister Ashay's whole lives are being uprooted. ELLIS: Yeah. They're just forcing us out, man, pretty much. ASHAY: They're just saying get out. SIEGLER: Ashay's 11. Her brother Monte, 18. They're standing by what passes for a playground in the battered McBride housing projects. For years, families like theirs complained of squalor conditions here - leaky ceilings, mold, rats. ELLIS: A lot of broken promises. SIEGLER: Last year when the federal housing agency HUD took over the scandal-ridden local housing authority, people hoped things would turn around. Instead, a few weeks ago, the dreaded news - the projects were deemed uninhabitable and will be demolished within months. HUD says it doesn't have the money to bring these up to code. Instead, it's offering relocation assistance and housing vouchers for new places. But where? Cairo is rural and isolated. A lot of the other properties in town are abandoned or condemned. The anger here is palpable. ASHAY: And it's not all about money. It's about us, too. So when we on the streets and stuff, ya'll just going to be riding around looking at us like we stupid. No, ya'll did that to us. SIEGLER: How do you just pick up and move if there's nowhere to go? The nearest cities of size in Kentucky are an hour away, and people's families, their support networks are here. ELLIS: You know, I go to Cairo High School. It's like I want to see Cairo High School get big and succeed. And can't do that if there's no community. SIEGLER: Cairo and its schools were already on life support. If everyone from the projects leaves town, the district's enrollment would drop another 40 percent. Would the town still be viable without its school? MARY BETH GOFF: Can I stay with you for 15 minutes. . . SIEGLER: There are real fears of a domino effect over at the Cairo School District, which is also the town's largest employer. Sixth grade teacher Mary Beth Goff got so frustrated that she had her students write letters to HUD Secretary Ben Carson pleading with him to reconsider. GOFF: I get what Ben Carson says. He says, you know, public housing should be a springboard, not a hammock. I've read that statement. In a sense, that's great, but these are kids. SIEGLER: In a letter back, the secretary promised to help the families find a better home. Goff will hold them to that. This housing crisis is just the latest disruption for her students. GOFF: Our kids are living in conditions that they should not have to live in, and I don't think anybody disagrees with that. So then the question is do you make it better or do you abandon them? JERRY BROWN: Nothing is simple with Cairo because when you go there and you look at the units, it literally tugs at your heart. SIEGLER: This is Jerry Brown a deputy secretary at HUD. He says the unfortunate reality is that HUD is no longer in the housing construction business. It relies on private developers. And attracting them to an isolated place like Cairo is tough. There hasn't been a new private home built in this town for 50 years. That's 50 years. BROWN: We're going to do everything we can to allow everyone that can find affordable housing in that community to remain there. SIEGLER: And he's right. There is stuff happening. Illinois' governors sent teams down to assess abandoned properties and see if expedited grant money could turn them into possible Section 8 rentals. Cairo's mayor Tyrone Coleman is holding landlord fares doing whatever he can. TYRONE COLEMAN: I'll never give in to the point that Cairo is finished - never. If I'd thought that, I'd been gone myself, you know? But there's enough of us here to keep life here. SIEGLER: But just how far do you go to keep people in a town where opportunities are few? Like a lot of rural America, Cairo was built for things - river barges, manufacturing, that aren't as relevant today. The mayor shakes his head at this, though. He says the town is close to getting a grocery store back and hopefully a new port which will attract investment and jobs. COLEMAN: Cairo - it's used to having to overcome, you know. That's just the part of our character, our nature. SIEGLER: People's character, their identity is wrapped up tightly in Cairo. So even if it was easy to pick up and move to a new city, many people probably wouldn't. MELVIN DUNCAN: They literally going to have to put me out. I will do what I can to stay. SIEGLER: Back of the projects one morning, I meet Melvin Duncan who is on break from his handyman job over at the school. He's got spindly long dreadlocks, smoker's laugh and jokes a lot. Lately, he's taken on a sort of neighborhood activist role. DUNCAN: I mean, this property right here is empty. That's an old nursing home - could've. . . SIEGLER: He's pointing to some places that could be refurbished so people could stay. Duncan says he has a possible lead on a place for his family about three-hours drive from here, but it's an absolute last resort. DUNCAN: Like I said, I was born here. I've been here most of my life. I have lived a couple of other places, but this is home. Who wants their home destroyed? SIEGLER: Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Cairo, Ill.

S. was pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, he said he was doing it to protect American workers. He talked about the coal industry, and there was a surprise mentioned about one particular coal mine in Pennsylvania. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn't happened. MCEVERS: American coal mines have been shutting down for about a decade. Reid Frazier of the public radio program \"The Allegheny Front\" reports on why this one opens tomorrow. REID FRAZIER, BYLINE: The Acosta Deep Mine is an hour east of Pittsburgh in a green valley between two ridges. Matt Owens stands where the mine entrance will be, at the bottom of a freshly dug hole about the size of a football field. MATT OWENS: This is the actual coal pit. FRAZIER: Owens is the mine's safety manager. A couple of crews around the pit are installing high-voltage electric lines to run equipment and fitting together big tubes to bring fresh air underground. When opened, the Acosta Deep Mine will employ around 70 miners. Owens points to the wall of the pit. OWENS: The coal seam's right there at the bottom. I mean, it's 43 inches over on this side. That's our high spot. FRAZIER: Now, this mine was in the works well before Donald Trump was elected president. And it's not the same kind of coal used to make electricity. The mine will produce metallurgical or met coal, which is used to make steel. Coal industry consultant Art Sullivan says the price for metallurgical coal has surged in the past year thanks to events outside the U. S. China cut back its own production, and a cyclone hurt the coal industry of Australia, the largest exporter of met coal. Sullivan says this mine opening is about market economics, not politics. ART SULLIVAN: It's quite certain that the president's election and any of his policies have had absolutely nothing to do with that new mine. FRAZIER: But don't tell that to the regulars at the nearby Coal Miner's Cafe. DAVE BERKEY: My business changed since November the 8. FRAZIER: Dave Berkey owns an excavating company that had done work with the mines, but that work slumped. Half the coal mining jobs in the county were lost between 2012 and 2015. BERKEY: But now it's coming back. And actually, people in the area's happier right now because there is jobs coming into the area. FRAZIER: Berkey is having breakfast with a group of other local business owners, all of whom supported Trump. He says his business from coal mines began picking up the day after the election. BERKEY: Literally, literally. TOM ALTMAN: You could actually feel the difference in the atmosphere up here the day of the election. FRAZIER: That's Tom Altman. He owns a local company that makes lighting. ALTMAN: People just felt hopeful again. There's hope back in this country where there was no hope before. FRAZIER: That optimism may be real, but energy analysts say most coal in this country is used to make electricity. And it still faces big challenges, namely competition from cheap natural gas. Whoever or whatever is causing the Acosta mine to open, the end result is the same for Matt Owens. As he leaves the mine pit in his pickup, he remembers worrying about losing his job as his company weathered layoffs over the last few years. OWENS: I was hoping it didn't come to that. It crossed all of our minds. We didn't know what was going to happen. FRAZIER: Now, he says, it feels good to have work for a few years at least. For NPR News, I'm Reid Frazier. (SOUNDBITE OF PARCELS SONG, \"OLDER\") KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  When President Trump announced the U. S. was pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, he said he was doing it to protect American workers. He talked about the coal industry, and there was a surprise mentioned about one particular coal mine in Pennsylvania. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A big opening of a brand-new mine. It's unheard of. For many, many years, that hasn't happened. MCEVERS: American coal mines have been shutting down for about a decade. Reid Frazier of the public radio program \"The Allegheny Front\" reports on why this one opens tomorrow. REID FRAZIER, BYLINE: The Acosta Deep Mine is an hour east of Pittsburgh in a green valley between two ridges. Matt Owens stands where the mine entrance will be, at the bottom of a freshly dug hole about the size of a football field. MATT OWENS: This is the actual coal pit. FRAZIER: Owens is the mine's safety manager. A couple of crews around the pit are installing high-voltage electric lines to run equipment and fitting together big tubes to bring fresh air underground. When opened, the Acosta Deep Mine will employ around 70 miners. Owens points to the wall of the pit. OWENS: The coal seam's right there at the bottom. I mean, it's 43 inches over on this side. That's our high spot. FRAZIER: Now, this mine was in the works well before Donald Trump was elected president. And it's not the same kind of coal used to make electricity. The mine will produce metallurgical or met coal, which is used to make steel. Coal industry consultant Art Sullivan says the price for metallurgical coal has surged in the past year thanks to events outside the U. S. China cut back its own production, and a cyclone hurt the coal industry of Australia, the largest exporter of met coal. Sullivan says this mine opening is about market economics, not politics. ART SULLIVAN: It's quite certain that the president's election and any of his policies have had absolutely nothing to do with that new mine. FRAZIER: But don't tell that to the regulars at the nearby Coal Miner's Cafe. DAVE BERKEY: My business changed since November the 8. FRAZIER: Dave Berkey owns an excavating company that had done work with the mines, but that work slumped. Half the coal mining jobs in the county were lost between 2012 and 2015. BERKEY: But now it's coming back. And actually, people in the area's happier right now because there is jobs coming into the area.

As NPR's Joel Rose reports, Canada is making it easier for highly skilled workers to move north of the border. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: A lot of people talked about moving to Canada after the U. S. election. Kathryn Hume actually did. Earlier this month, Hume packed up her apartment in New York and moved to Toronto. KATHRYN HUME: It wasn't a, like, going on Facebook and being like, I'm done. I'm moving to Canada. It was a little bit more organic. ROSE: Hume works in the field of artificial intelligence. She is employee number three at a startup company called Integrate AI, where her title is vice president of product and strategy. HUME: I had a couple of job offers also in the U. S. , and I chose it primarily because it really felt like the right job. ROSE: Still, Hume says Trump's election was in the back of her mind. She voted for Hillary Clinton. HUME: You know, I thought, well, if there's a time to move to Canada, it may as well be now. ROSE: Canadian tech companies are hoping to capitalize on this moment. For years, the industry watched in frustration as Microsoft and Google hired the country's top computer science grads for high-paying jobs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. Now Canada believes it's found a new way to lure international tech workers. NAVDEEP BAINS: For us to compete globally, we need to be open. ROSE: Navdeep Bains is Canada's minister of innovation, science and economic development. Starting Monday, Bains says the government will streamline the visa process so that international tech workers can get a work permit in just two weeks, compared to a complicated process in the U. S. that can take months. BAINS: We do believe it does give us a competitive advantage. ROSE: Bains insists this was in the works before last year's U. S. election, but the timing is striking. The White House stoked anxiety among international visitors and would-be immigrants with its travel ban. And President Trump has sharply criticized the U. S. visa program for technical workers. His administration could reduce the cap for such visas, which is set at 85,000 per year. The president vowed to reform that program in Wisconsin a few months ago.

No one can compete with American workers when they are given a fair and level playing field. SALIM TEJA: We feel that Canada has a window of opportunity here to be able to attract the best and the brightest here. ROSE: Salim Teja is vice president of the MaRS Discovery District, a major incubator for tech companies in Toronto. Teja says there's fierce global competition for talent in the industry, with companies offering escalating salaries and perks. And those employers need to know that they can get visas for the people they're hiring. TEJA: A lot of these technology companies are very international businesses where talent is flowing freely in and out of different countries. And I think that if the U. S. becomes a tough place to do business that way, they may look at Canada as an easy market for them to set up in. ROSE: Facebook, Google and Uber have recently opened or expanded their offices in Toronto. Microsoft has satellite offices in Vancouver, and smaller Canadian companies say they're getting interest from a pool of American and international job applicants they hadn't heard from before. Roy Pereira is the founder of Zoom. Ai, a startup in Toronto. After Trump's election, Pereira says he saw a 30 percent jump in Americans applying for engineering jobs. ROY PEREIRA: As Canadians, we're not accustomed to seeing Americans who want to move to Canada. You know, they have a perception that Canada is cold.

The president promised to bring back coal jobs. That's one reason he said he wants out of a global climate agreement, and it's also why he's blocking President Obama's Clean Power Plan. But a visit to a coal town shows its people are suffering an unintended consequence of President Trump's moves. Here's NPR's Nathan Rott. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Colstrip, Mont. , is a town built on coal, coal that's scraped from the ground beneath the rolling sage-covered hills, trucked or transported by a humming four-mile conveyor belt past tree-lined streets and idle train cars to a towering four-unit power plant at the heart of this tiny town. It's there at the second-largest coal-fired power plant in the West that the coal is burnt, turning water to steam, providing electricity from Montana clear to the greater Pacific Northwest. LU SHOMATE: That's who we are. If it wasn't for the coal and then the generation of course, none of this would be here. ROTT: Lu Shomate runs the town's historical center in an old schoolhouse. SHOMATE: Built in 1924. ROTT: The same year that the Northern Pacific Railroad decided to turn this coal-rich patch of prairie into a company town. There have been booms and busts since, as with any resource town. Right now there's fear of a bust. Half of Colstrip's power plant is slated to close in the coming years because of a lawsuit over air quality. On top of that, the two biggest customers for Colstrip's energy, Oregon and Washington, have made long-term commitments to get off coal. The combined uncertainty has caused real estate values in the town to plummet, leaving people in sunk mortgages. Shomate says the same thing that's happened in Appalachia and other blue-collar parts of the country is now starting to happen here. SHOMATE: The middle class is being ripped apart. ROTT: Shomate and others in Colstrip are not giving up on coal - far from it. But they want a plan for the future. That means money. And if you ask people here where that money should come from, they'll tell you to look west. DUANE ANKNEY: There would be no Facebook. There would be no Bill Gates. None of that would be in Seattle without low-cost, reliable power that comes from Colstrip, Mont. ROTT: Duane Ankney is Colstrip's Senator in the state legislature, and he proposed a bill in Montana's legislature earlier this year to get that money. There are six utilities that own Colstrip's power plant. All are based out of state. Ankney's bill would have put them on the hook when they decide to leave by requiring them to help pay for lost tax revenues, job training for workers and those sunken real estate values. Ankney, a Republican, says it was about accountability, accountability to the state of Montana and the workers who made the utilities what they are. ANKNEY: I think that would go a long ways to - to cop a phrase - make America great again - is when you have corporate responsibility. ROTT: Ankney's bill failed. It was fought by utilities and environmental groups who feared it would scare away future investment for renewable energy. Its sister bill, though, which required the utilities have a plan and money set aside for environmental remediation at the plant site passed. So there's a plan for the environment in Colstrip, not for the people. The irony, though, here is there was a plan for people. . . REX ROGERS: That's the Clean Power Plan. ROTT: . . . President Obama's plan to reduce carbon emissions. Rex Rogers keeps a copy of it, all 1,560-some pages, at the union hall. Rogers represents about 250 workers at the power plant here. He's a business manager for the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, or IBEW. And as such, he fought against the Clean Power Plan because it likely would have meant closures here. Fast forward to now. The Clean Power Plan is stopped. The Trump administration is working on a repeal. ROGERS: But yet we see coal plants shutting down. Well, the concern with that is, built into the Clean Power Plan. . . ROTT: In some of those 1,500 pages was a section. ROGERS: . . . About transitioning, taking care of the workers in those parts of it. ROTT: It was the Obama administration's way of saying, yes, we know this will close down plants; here is our plan to cushion the fall. Now Rogers says that cushion is gone, and there's nothing being proffered by the new administration to replace it. ROGERS: Even though we won the war on coal, it doesn't appear that there was anything in that for the workers. ROTT: Julia Haggerty, a professor at Montana State University, studies efforts to help struggling coal towns. And she thinks the federal government's new never-say-die approach to the coal industry could have repercussions. JULIA HAGGERTY: It appears that that comes with a price of - then let's pretend that the transition isn't happening. And that I think does not do a service to the places that are experiencing the transition. ROTT: Haggerty wants to see more discussion about what happens to a town like Colstrip as the nation shifts further away from coal. And she says it's important that people in a place like this are part of it. That, she says, would help soothe the bitterness that exists between rural places that have historically provided this energy and their urban neighbors who may no longer want it.

That's a reversal from his predecessor Barack Obama who tried to promote more engagement with the island after decades of diplomatic isolation. The new policy fulfills a promise Trump made to conservative Cuban exiles in last year's presidential election. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The venue for Trump's announcement speaks volumes about America's more-than-a-half-century effort to topple the Castro regime. Trump spoke in a sweltering Miami theater named for Manuel Artime, a leader of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am so thrilled to be back here with all of my friends in Little Havana. (CHEERING)HORSLEY: Trump won the endorsement of Bay of Pigs veterans in the final days of last year's presidential campaign, and he credits his narrow victory in Florida to support from the most conservative elements of the Cuban-American community. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: You went out, and you voted. And here I am, like I promised. . . (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)TRUMP: . . . Like I promised. HORSLEY: Polls show even in South Florida, most Cuban-Americans would like to see more contact with Cuba, not less. But that's not the audience Trump was speaking to. His listeners cheered the president when he announced a change in course. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with Cuba. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)HORSLEY: Trump is not completely reversing Obama's Cuba initiatives. The U. S. Embassy in Havana will stay open, and commercial air service between the U. S. and Cuba will continue. But the president's order will make it harder for Americans to travel to Cuba on their own for so-called people-to-people visits. Trump also plans to block most business transactions with companies connected to the Cuban military. That could have far-reaching effects since the military touches almost every corner of the Cuban economy, including many of the big tourist hotels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We will very strongly restrict American dollars flowing to the military, security and intelligence services that are the core of the Castro regime. They will be restricted. HORSLEY: Trump's new policy was heavily influenced by a handful of Cuban-American lawmakers, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: America is prepared to outstretch its hand and work with the people of Cuba. But we will not - we will not empower their oppressors. HORSLEY: Even in a Republican Congress, though, Rubio's tough-on-Cuba stance represents a minority viewpoint. Most of his Senate colleagues support legislation that would make it easier for Americans to visit Cuba. The White House says Trump is open to relaxing the new restrictions once the Cuban government frees political prisoners and holds fair elections. But Geoff Thale of the Washington Office on Latin America questions the administration's tactics. GEOFF THALE: A policy of isolation does nothing and has done nothing to improve the human rights situation. HORSLEY: Supporters of the Obama-era Cuba policy concede. It has not produced the kind of economic and political reforms they'd like to see. But James Williams, who heads a lobbying group that promotes engagement with Cuba, says it's too soon to quit trying. JAMES WILLIAMS: We've had this new policy for basically two years, and we've already seen significant changes. Is it as much as we'd like to see - absolutely not. But the idea of returning to something that we know does not work doesn't make any sense. HORSLEY: Trump is not changing some elements of the Obama Cuba policy. Americans who make it to the island will still be allowed to come home carrying Cuban rum and cigars. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am so thrilled to be back here with all of my friends in Little Havana. (CHEERING) HORSLEY: Trump won the endorsement of Bay of Pigs veterans in the final days of last year's presidential campaign, and he credits his narrow victory in Florida to support from the most conservative elements of the Cuban-American community. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: You went out, and you voted. And here I am, like I promised. . . (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) TRUMP: . . . Like I promised. HORSLEY: Polls show even in South Florida, most Cuban-Americans would like to see more contact with Cuba, not less. But that's not the audience Trump was speaking to. His listeners cheered the president when he announced a change in course. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration's completely one-sided deal with Cuba. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Trump is not completely reversing Obama's Cuba initiatives. The U. S. Embassy in Havana will stay open, and commercial air service between the U. S. and Cuba will continue. But the president's order will make it harder for Americans to travel to Cuba on their own for so-called people-to-people visits. Trump also plans to block most business transactions with companies connected to the Cuban military. That could have far-reaching effects since the military touches almost every corner of the Cuban economy, including many of the big tourist hotels. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We will very strongly restrict American dollars flowing to the military, security and intelligence services that are the core of the Castro regime. They will be restricted. HORSLEY: Trump's new policy was heavily influenced by a handful of Cuban-American lawmakers, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARCO RUBIO: America is prepared to outstretch its hand and work with the people of Cuba. But we will not - we will not empower their oppressors. HORSLEY: Even in a Republican Congress, though, Rubio's tough-on-Cuba stance represents a minority viewpoint. Most of his Senate colleagues support legislation that would make it easier for Americans to visit Cuba. The White House says Trump is open to relaxing the new restrictions once the Cuban government frees political prisoners and holds fair elections. But Geoff Thale of the Washington Office on Latin America questions the administration's tactics. GEOFF THALE: A policy of isolation does nothing and has done nothing to improve the human rights situation. HORSLEY: Supporters of the Obama-era Cuba policy concede. It has not produced the kind of economic and political reforms they'd like to see. But James Williams, who heads a lobbying group that promotes engagement with Cuba, says it's too soon to quit trying. JAMES WILLIAMS: We've had this new policy for basically two years, and we've already seen significant changes. Is it as much as we'd like to see - absolutely not. But the idea of returning to something that we know does not work doesn't make any sense. HORSLEY: Trump is not changing some elements of the Obama Cuba policy. Americans who make it to the island will still be allowed to come home carrying Cuban rum and cigars.

His secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, would like flexibility in dealing with Russia, but this bill would make sanctions harder to lift without congressional approval. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Idaho Republican Mike Crapo is one of the sponsors of the legislation, which expands sanctions on Russia and ensures that the Trump administration can't ease up on the pressure without a congressional review. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL CRAPO: Americans are concerned about Russia's behavior in the Ukraine and Syria, and they're concerned about Russia's increased cyber intrusions. Many of us, on both sides of the aisle, feel that the United States needs to be much stronger in its response to Russia. KELEMEN: The senator says Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has become increasingly belligerent, nationalistic and autocratic. Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire adds it was important to send a bipartisan message to the Kremlin, which she says tried to undermine U. S. elections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEANNE SHAHEEN: What we have heard from experts in the intelligence community - they have warned us that if Russia gets a pass on this, that it will interfere in future U.

KELEMEN: Engel was unimpressed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELIOT ENGEL: The only thing that Russia understands is tough talk. And if they think that we're somehow willing to relax the sanctions on them before they've complied with the Minsk framework and left Crimea, I think it just will encourage Putin to continue his bullying.

You know, bitcoin, the virtual currency. Can't hold it in your hand, although you can send it online. You just can't really spend it in a physical store. The price of buying bitcoin with other money has tripled this year as buyers rushed in. If you could go back to 2010 and buy $1,000 worth, it would be worth an estimated $20 million right now. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  You're making it sound like we should buy this. INSKEEP: Well, maybe you should have. We sent NPR's Kevin Leahy to see how bitcoin works. Let's see what he says. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)PETER VAN VALKENBURGH: Hey, are you downstairs? KEVIN LEAHY, BYLINE: I'm in the lobby. VAN VALKERBURGH: OK. Let me come grab you. LEAHY: So before I bought bitcoin, I came here to Coin Center, a Washington, D. C. , think tank with hipster vibes, exposed brick walls, cold brew coffee on tap and a small staff all funded by investors with a stake in digital currencies. Coin Center's lead researcher and chief enthusiast is Peter Van Valkenburgh. He explains bitcoin as cash for the Internet. VAN VALKERBURGH: People understand cash. Cash is something I keep in my wallet in my pocket. And I can pull it out of my wallet, and I can hand it to Neeraj here. LEAHY: Neeraj Agarwal, his colleague with us. Van Valkenburgh says sending money through banks is way different from cash. VAN VALKERBURGH: I'm with Bank of America. Neeraj is with Wells Fargo. They promised me that they have this much value in deposit for me. And if I want to send to Neeraj, I talk to them. They talk to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo credits Neeraj. That's not cash. That's a brittle system that's reliant on a lot of trust and a couple big, giant corporations or banks. LEAHY: As opposed to bitcoins, he says, which can be sent directly from smartphone to smartphone through a decentralized network. The network lists every transaction on a kind of public digital ledger. VAN VALKERBURGH: Peter sent to Neeraj. Neeraj sent to his mom. LEAHY: Except instead of names, you're identified by strings of letters and numbers, which creates a level of anonymity. But enough of this technical stuff. I need to get rich right now. So with $50 in my boss's money, Peter and I set out to buy some bitcoin at a falafel shop around the way. Yes, this falafel shop with its 4 a. m. closing time is home to a bitcoin ATM. It's a one-way ATM. Cash only goes in. VAN VALKERBURGH: It looks like it's well-maintained. LEAHY: It's got a big display monitor and one single button. I'm going to push the button that says buy bitcoins. VAN VALKERBURGH: The only button on the screen. LEAHY: I punch in my phone number and get a text with a verification code. VAN VALKERBURGH: Now, you've got to bring up the QR code here. See the X there? LEAHY: OK, here goes my cash - two 20s, two 5s. (SOUNDBITE OF BITCOIN ATM)LEAHY: And out comes a receipt. I check the Wallet app I downloaded onto my smartphone. And I'm the proud owner of . 016 bitcoins. (Laughter) So my $50 got me just a tiny sliver of one bitcoin. A whole coin would have cost me 3,068 bucks including the fees. Now, waiting behind me is a buff guy in a tank top and a ponytail. We'll call him Tony (ph). He asked us not to use his real name, and he's not here for falafel. He's here for bitcoin. TONY: And I kind of like the anonymity of it, you know, like, the fact that it's easier to gamble with on casinos. LEAHY: He's talking about online gambling. TONY: Dealing with credit cards, they don't like the transactions obviously because it comes from, like, China and stuff. So it's really easy to get money in and out for sports betting and things like that. LEAHY: Then another guy came in. He put so many $20 bills into the machine one by one, he actually pulled up a chair to do it. It was going to be a while. Back at Coin Center, the think tank, I asked Peter Van Valkenburgh if it's wise to shove all in on bitcoin. VAN VALKERBURGH: Never, never, never invest more than you're willing to lose because it could go to nothing. LEAHY: Me? I've lost some money so far, but I'll hang on to my small piece of bitcoin and report back. Kevin Leahy, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Bitcoin has been on a wild ride.

Twelve billion barrels of oil later, it's completely reshaped Alaska. Finding Prudhoe Bay led to a major economic boom and also to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. But the discovery of the giant oil field that started it all almost didn't happen. Elizabeth Harball from Alaska's Energy Desk has the story. ELIZABETH HARBALL, BYLINE: On the floor of a drilling rig on Alaska's northernmost edge, oil workers are dwarfed by giant pieces of machinery. They're pushing pipe thousands of feet below the tundra to tap one of the biggest oil fields in North America, Prudhoe Bay. You could argue - and a lot of people do - that Prudhoe Bay's billions of barrels of oil wouldn't have seen the light of day if it weren't for a little, old man who lives in a little, brown house in Anchorage. Hello? TOM MARSHALL: Hello. HARBALL: Hi. MARSHALL: I'm Tom Marshall. HARBALL: Tom Marshall won't bring it up himself, but for many Alaskans, this unpresuming 91-year-old is a hero. I find an award tucked between the photos lining his living room wall. What does it say? For extraordinary foresight. MARSHALL: For professional discernment and courageous foresight (laughter). HARBALL: Marshall earned this award for something he did in the early 1960s, when he worked for the brand-new state of Alaska. He remembers it as a tense time with a tiny economy and population. It was a real question whether Alaska could support itself. MARSHALL: There was a great deal of anxiety - just how we're going to accomplish this. HARBALL: But under the Statehood Act, Congress handed Alaska something like a scratch-off lottery ticket without really knowing what was there. The state could select over 100 million acres of federal land in its borders. And if Alaska picked land with valuable resources, it would have a winning ticket. MARSHALL: This land would put us in a position to pay our bills. HARBALL: That's when Marshall, a petroleum geologist, quietly became Alaska's most important employee. He was tasked with picking the land. And a ragged chunk of Arctic coast called Prudhoe Bay caught his eye. The geology reminded Marshall of big oil basins he'd seen in Wyoming. This could be the jackpot Alaska needed. But when Marshall suggested selecting a remote chunk of tundra on the icy ocean, Alaska's first governor, Bill Egan, was not impressed. MARSHALL: Governor Egan's comment was, doesn't he know it's frozen? HARBALL: But others thought Marshall was on to something. The federal government had started leasing land in Alaska's Arctic in 1958. And a handful of oil companies were laying plans to drill. Harry Jamison worked for one of those companies. Like Marshall, Jamison hoped there might be a billion-barrel oil field hiding up there. It would take that much to justify the astronomical cost of getting the oil to market. HARRY JAMISON: Billion-barrel oil fields don't come along every day. There have been very, very few ever discovered in the United States. HARBALL: Starting in 1963, BP and Sinclair teamed up and drilled six wells near Alaska's Brooks Range. JAMISON: And all six were dry. HARBALL: After that, other companies started coming up short. Eventually, that included Jamison's company, ARCO. The oil companies that had taken a risk on Alaska's North Slope started hemorrhaging money. JAMISON: Yeah. It was extremely discouraging. So the whole industry was really down on the North Slope by that time. HARBALL: During this time, Tom Marshall kept pressing Governor Egan to select Prudhoe Bay. Egan finally relented in 1964. But there were a lot of skeptics. When the Prudhoe Bay selection was posted, Marshall remembers someone scrawled a note across the map in 5-inch-tall letters. MARSHALL: They wrote Marshall's folly on there. HARBALL: After so many failed wells, Marshall's selection did start to seem like a long shot. By 1967, most oil companies had given up. Then, ARCO and Humble Oil teamed up and moved the only drill rig left on the North Slope to Prudhoe Bay. It was the oil industry's last shot. On a flight to check out the Prudhoe Bay well just before Christmas 1967, Jamison remembers looking out the window of the plane. JAMISON: And you don't see anything. I mean, it's absolutely black. And it's not just remote and dark and cold. But it's downright dangerous. HARBALL: Far in the distance, Jamison spied a single light from the lonely rig. A young geologist named Gil Mull was also there. Mull says for weeks, drilling the well wasn't all that exciting. GIL MULL: It's almost like watching grass grow. HARBALL: Then one day, they tested the well's pressure. When the crew opened the valve, Mull says there was a powerful burst of gas. MULL: It sounded like a jet plane overhead. It's shaking the rig. It's a rumble. It's a roar. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oil at Alaska's North Slope at Prudhoe Bay - a lot of it. Possibly the biggest discovery in history. HARBALL: Alaska would never be the same. Today, the state of Alaska believes Prudhoe Bay contained about 25 billion barrels of oil in all. Marshall's selection helped transform the state into a powerhouse fueled by oil. Marshall says he was just doing his job. I ask if it still bothers him that so many people doubted him for so long. MARSHALL: Oh, not at all, you know, because they're so wrong (laughter). HARBALL: For NPR News, I'm Elizabeth Harball in Anchorage.

ROTT: Littlebird is set up on the side of a highway in Lame Deer, Montana, under the shade of some trees. This is his second year selling dollar burgers to get by. LITTLEBIRD: I've been trying to get a job over here at the store, at the depot. I put my applications in and nothing, you know? So you got to hustle somehow. ROTT: Jobs are scarce here on Northern Cheyenne - coal is not. There's an estimated 23 billion tons of it under Littlebird's feet and beneath the surrounding pine-dotted prairie. And it's come under increased attention during the last few months. In a recent visit to a nearby coal mine, Vice President Mike Pence said the Trump administration was, quote, \"absolutely determined to continue to expand the opportunities to develop American energy in an environmentally responsible way. \" Littlebird and others here on Northern Cheyenne would like to be a part of that expansion.

But we don't know how to take that. I mean, that's a scary word. We're going to make you rich. Wow, you know? ROTT: There are a lot of reasons the coal has never been developed but Small says the main one is culture. The land here is considered sacred. People don't want to sacrifice it for money. SMALL: You know, culture's really nice. And I love my culture, but it doesn't put food on the table. ROTT: Small is sitting at a table. And as he speaks, a woman standing next to him shakes her head. You disagree? SMALL: She disagrees totally. ROTT: Can I ask you why? ALAINA BUFFALO SPIRIT: Well. . . ROTT: The woman's name is Alaina Buffalo Spirit, and she says she's concerned about air quality, water quality, the impact that mining would have on the land and the people.

ROTT: This last point is an important one because sure, from a regulatory standpoint, now is as good a time as any to start new coal development. From a market standpoint though, it makes less sense.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross who's off this week. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first major-party candidate in more than half a century to advocate a return to the gold standard for the U. S. dollar. My guest, James Ledbetter, says most mainstream economists agree the idea is completely unworkable. But for much of American history, it was an article of faith that real money ought to be gold or at least redeemable for gold or another precious metal. In his new book, Ledbetter explores our fascination with gold as a symbol of permanence and quality and most of all a store of value. It's a book about financial panics, gold sellers who warn of impending doom and - I'm not making this up - government funding for half-baked schemes to increase the supply of gold including one relying on nuclear explosions. James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc. magazine. His writing on business and politics has appeared in The New Yorker and The New York Times. He's the author of five previous books. His latest is, \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Priceless Metal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four Centuries. \"Well, James Ledbetter welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, you hear some politicians these days - even President Trump has said it would be great if we could do it to take the United States - to take American currency back to the gold standard. What does that mean exactly? JAMES LEDBETTER: The gold standard is a way of valuing money that has been used at various points in American history, going back to the beginning of the Republic - a gold and silver standard. Gold is mentioned in the U. S. Constitution and depending on how you read that Constitution, is supposed to be the basis for our money. And what it simply means is that the value of the dollar, or any currency on the gold standard, is fixed to a certain amount of gold. So when I was growing up, the Bretton Woods system was still in place. And the dollar was - gold was worth $35 an ounce. That was fixed. It wouldn't change, except in private markets where it didn't change very much because the U. S. Treasury would willingly buy gold at the rate of $35 an ounce or sell gold at $35 an ounce. And there was no point in anyone buying or selling it for much more than that. And the appeal that it has to Trump and to many in the Republican Party particularly, is that it fixes the value in a way that is thought to be stabilizing to the economy. One of the reasons why I wrote this book is to point out that many of the worst economic catastrophes that have happened in American history happened when we were on a gold standard. So as a protector, it doesn't do a very good job. But on the other hand, the collapse that we saw most recently in the Great Recession arguably also demonstrates flaws in the current system we have, which is a floating currency. The value of the dollar is what people who want to buy and sell dollars say it is. It's a market-based system, and most of the major currencies in the world today are on that. But I think the appeal is not only for financial stability, but there's a kind of psychological component to it, too, that taps into gold's rich role in American history. DAVIES: All right, we're going to get to all of that stuff, I think. But let me just ask you one other thing. Does any country in the world today define its currency in terms of. . . LEDBETTER: No. DAVIES: . . . Gold? No, just no. LEDBETTER: No major - there might be some tiny, you know, republic in Africa or something, but no major currency has been on the gold standard for a while. I believe Switzerland was the last to abandon it in the late part of the 20th century. DAVIES: Your book tells the interesting story of how we got here in American history. And, you know, today we're used to having a currency that's stable, that we rely on. I mean, when I put my five bucks down on the counter at Panera, I know they're going to accept it, and their vendors are going to accept it. We don't even think about who authorizes our money and where its value comes from. But that wasn't always so. So if you go back to, say, the first half of the 19th century, when we were an agrarian country - industrializing and plenty of commerce, what was used for money? LEDBETTER: Lots of things were used for money. There was actually no federal legal tender currency until the second half of the 19th century. So you had states that issued currency. You had banks that issued their own forms of currency. People, of course, did use gold and silver and barter and all sorts of things. But there were - there was a kind of kaleidoscope of different types of money. In fact, in the book, I mention the money that George Washington took on a single trip to Philadelphia - six joes, 67 half joes, two one-eighteenth joes, three doubloons, one pistole, two moidores, one half moidore, two double Louis d'or, three single Louis d'or, 80 guineas, seven half guineas besides silver and banknotes. This was currency from Portugal, Spain, France and Britain all of which could be used as currency at the time. So it was this kind of crazy quilt of different types of currency paper, metal, and many of those currencies would fail. And so the reputation of paper money in the - particularly in the first half of the 19th century was very, very low. It was considered to be hugely unstable and would become worthless often rather quickly. And so that fueled the need for a kind of single standard that is represented by gold. DAVIES: All right, so in 1848, we all know Sutter's Mill in California, right? There's the - gold is discovered. And there is the California gold rush. You mean, thousands of people coming and some of them getting rich in a hurry. Tell us about the impact of this - well, first of all, just the macroeconomic effect. I mean, did it affect the country's economy to have all this gold discovered? LEDBETTER: It did profoundly. The gold rush represents a transformational moment in American history and the real development of what becomes the West. I mean, San Francisco was a dot on the map prior to the discovery of gold in 1848. And within a couple of years, it becomes almost like a second financial capital within the United States. For a brief time, its stock market actually outpaced the New York Stock Exchange. There was so much gold and commerce coming into the country out of nowhere that America now becomes a kind of world economic power. Remember, through the middle part of the 19th century, the United States of America was a relatively new, often broke country. The War of 1812 was extremely devastating to the economy. The Mexican War that just preceded the gold rush really kind of bankrupted the country. And so - but suddenly, wealth is coming from the ground. And the gold that finds its way back east, the economy becomes increasingly dependent on this supply of gold. You have, within a few short years, also a similar discovery in Australia that has a similar effect on that. So this is, you know, the creation of value out of nothing. And I think it also represents a sort of shift in the American character. Prior to that, the Puritan idea that, you know, the only way to make money is to work hard and believe in God. Here is, you know, get rich quick - the original get-rich-quick scheme. Go west, dig in the ground and you may, you know, strike it rich. Now, in reality, most people didn't strike it rich. I mean, I think we tend to mythologize and kind of view through a kind of golden hue this idea of people going west and striking it rich. But a lot of people failed. A lot of people starved. A lot of people went crazy. The first mental institution in California was actually opened to deal with people who - because it took such a long time to get from the East Coast to the West Coast before the Panama Canal existed, they would go crazy on the voyages. They would literally go mad. And the state found itself suddenly having to deal with all these people and had to create a mental institution to deal with it. DAVIES: So as you go through the second half of the 19th century, you see that gold is still important in the currency. During the Civil War, the federal government issues greenbacks - paper money. LEDBETTER: Right. DAVIES: And it works. It helps to finance the war, but a lot of people hate it because it's just paper, and they don't trust it. And. . . LEDBETTER: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . On we go. I mean, there are financial panics in what, like, 1893, 1907? And then in the early 20th century, we finally have a central bank. The Federal Reserve system is established to have one central institution to regulate our currency. Are we still committed then to the gold standard? LEDBETTER: Yes, gold becomes the official standard with silver now, you know, kind of being tossed aside. Silver - through most of the 19th century, America was what was called a bimetallic standard. That is, both gold and silver were legal tender. The creation of greenbacks in the Civil War, you know, is something that some people see as a kind of original sin because for the first time, we have a nationally issued currency that's not backed by gold. It's just kind of whatever the government says it's worth, it's worth or what the market will bear. And this goes all the way to a Supreme Court decision that is then overturned, declaring the greenbacks ultimately to be legal tender. But it's - much of the latter half of the 19th century, you find the populist movement trying to restore silver to some kind of legal tender status because that's what was plentiful in many of the Western states. That's what leads William Jennings Bryan to deliver the famous \"Cross Of Gold\" speech. You will not crucify mankind on a cross of gold. So gold. . . DAVIES: Now, that was in the 1896 Democratic Convention. . . LEDBETTER: That's right. DAVIES: . . . Right? LEDBETTER: That's right. DAVIES: And he was railing against the Eastern elites who loved the gold standard, the poor farmers. . . LEDBETTER: That's right. DAVIES: . . . That wanted silver. LEDBETTER: The farmers wanted silver. So you have a kind of agrarian, populist movement that sees gold as the enemy, that sees gold as the province of wealthy East-Coast bankers. And silver is the kind of populous metal. A half-century later, it flips because now, you know, paper money is considered to be the evil, and gold is the channel of populism. So the populist sentiment is kind of fluid. It can attach itself to different metals as necessary. But at the time the Federal Reserve is formed, gold is the official backing of all of our currency. And that remains the case until Roosevelt was elected after the Great Depression starts. DAVIES: We're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book about gold and its impact on U. S. culture, history and monetary policy is called \"One Nation Under Gold. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NAOMI MOON SIEGEL'S \"IT'S NOT SAFE\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine and has written several books. His new one is called \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Precious Metal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four centuries. \"So if we go up to the 1930s - when the stock market crashes in 1929, the president is Herbert Hoover, who you remind us was one of the most committed presidents to the gold standard in history - believed firmly in it and stuck with it as the economy began to contract and unemployment began to build. What do economists think now about the role that this adherence to the gold standard played in this economic disaster? LEDBETTER: I think the mainstream economic position is that the gold standard acted as a kind of set of handcuffs on the economy that because Hoover was so committed - and the Republican Party as a whole - so committed to the gold standard during this time that there was simply not enough motion, not enough flexibility to be able to move the economy back in the direction that it needed to go. And in fact, you know, Hoover began cracking down on people that he believed were hoarding gold. Again, when economies go haywire, it's very common for people to snap up gold because they think, you know, who knows where it's going? And this is the safest form of - the safest form in which to store our wealth. And that that was not helping because if people were holding onto the gold, it can't circulate through the economy and lead to recovery. According to Hoover, we came very near running out of gold, a couple of weeks away from a kind of disaster whereby the government couldn't pay its bills. DAVIES: Hoover was committed to the gold standard. And that meant sort of the money in circulation was limited by the amount of gold that's available. I wonder, if he had done in 1930 what President Obama did in 2009, which was to try and flood the markets with credit to try and get - to stimulate the economy and get people investing - what do we think might have happened? LEDBETTER: Well, it's conceivable that the recovery could have come much more quickly than it did. If the Hoover administration and the Federal Reserve, critically, had methods by which to create liquidity into the economy, to sort of inject some life into the economy, it's entirely possible that recovery would have begun. But that hypothetical, you know, demonstrates the weakness that I think the gold standard created during this period. It kind of acted as a pair of golden handcuffs on the engineers of the economy. They simply couldn't get the thing going because there was not enough wealth to go around. There was no form of stimulus available to them. DAVIES: So when Franklin Delano Roosevelt takes office in 1933, he wants to aggressively get the economy moving. He enacts a bunch of government programs. What was his attitude towards gold and the gold standard? LEDBETTER: So we learn a lot about the New Deal. But literally, the first thing that FDR did, the first piece of legislation was to close every bank in the United States and to outlaw the individual ownership of gold. So all the gold in the country was officially confiscated at a rate that was nicely above the market price. So people got - you know, they got a good deal. But they had to turn in their gold. It was, in theory, against the law to own gold during this time. And broadly speaking, people complied with this because they were desperate. And, you know, the goodwill toward Roosevelt and the kind of - the need for new leadership and fresh ideas led most people to comply with this law. There were some exceptions. I don't think anyone actually went to jail for hanging onto their gold. But there were some trials and fines that were assessed. DAVIES: You actually have a reproduction of a leaflet that was handed out. Executive order of the president, April 5, 1933, where people have to turn in their gold coin and bullion. The government paid them for this. . . LEDBETTER: They did. And. . . DAVIES: . . . When they turned the gold in. What was the logic? What was the goal here? LEDBETTER: Roosevelt was trying to get some kind of control over the economy. And the - what was going on in the latter days of the Hoover administration is a lot of gold was leaving the country. France, in particular, during this period, in part because of their experience with World War I, was hoarding as much of the world's gold as it could get its hands on. And people were panicking. They were taking gold out of, you know, vaults, out of banks and hanging onto it because of the fear that the economy would just get worse and worse. Roosevelt felt he had to put a stop to this before anything could get better. And similarly, every bank in the United States had to close. And then the healthier ones were brought back to life. But the gold prohibition, which was probably never really intended as permanent, stays for 40 years. So throughout, you know, the middle part of the 20th century, it is actually illegal for Americans to own gold except for, you know, jewelry or teeth fillings, that kind of thing and certain industrial applications. But we lived for 40 years without the ability to own gold. DAVIES: So the government kind of, in effect, bought a lot of gold and amassed it. How did that help the economy? LEDBETTER: What Roosevelt ended up doing was to revalue the relationship between gold and the dollar. And this, you know, inflation is literally what it was actually helped the economy grow. There was more money in circulation. There were, you know, all of the different New Deal programs to get people to work and get people to spend. That is directly related to the recovery that begins in the 1930s. Now, there's a second dip in the recession that, again, economists have, you know, various theories about what caused that second dip, as do historians, but the important thing is that the relationship between the dollar and gold changed. Roosevelt essentially took us off the gold standard for a time. And there's a kind of comical moment where he and his administration every day fixed the price of gold to something new. So literally, one day, he decides gold's going to go up 21 cents because seven times three seems like a lucky number. This is - I'm not making this up. I mean, this is the arbitrariness for several months of how gold was managed. And then finally, by the time the 1934 Gold Act is passed, a fixed value of gold and dollar is restored, and some version of that continues until well after the World War II period. DAVIES: The other thing that's interesting about this period is that, you know, it was a time when Roosevelt wasn't sure whether he wanted us on the gold standard or not. But the U. S. government acquired massive stocks of gold, and that led to the construction of a vault, right? That's Fort. . . LEDBETTER: Of Fort Knox. DAVIES: Yeah. LEDBETTER: That's right. The bullion reserve at Fort Knox was they took over a portion of a, you know, military encampment, Fort Knox, and began stockpiling what becomes the largest pile of gold ever assembled, you know, by mankind. It is this, you know, massively secure and kind of famously almost comically guarded, you know, with - poison gas will come in if anybody twists the wheel and the - nobody knows the entire combination. People are given portions of the combination to the safe so that nobody knows the whole thing. I mean, it's this ridiculous level of security to guard all of this metal that has been, you know, both confiscated from individuals, amassed and bought. And also, you know, during this time, the only gold that can be legally bought or sold in the United States is through the Treasury Department. No one else is actually authorized to do it without permission. And this - you know, presumably, this what I call the arsenal of gold is supposed to be a guarantor of economic security. But, of course, it's not that simple. DAVIES: James Ledbetter's book is \"One Nation Under Gold. \" After a break, he'll talk about some pretty wild schemes that got government funding in the 1960s to find or create more gold. We'll discuss President Trump's views on the gold standard, and Kevin Whitehead tells us about the jazz quartet Sexmob. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with James Ledbetter, whose new book \"One Nation Under Gold\" explores America's fascination with the precious metal and the many battles over whether American currency should be pegged to the price of gold. Ledbetter says despite many financial crises, the U. S. government maintained its attachment to the gold standard for much of the 20th century. So through the '40s, '50s and '60s, the United States is more or less on the gold standard, as are other countries. And you write that there were times when there would be massive shipments of gold bullion in, like, big, military transport planes. . . LEDBETTER: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . Like, from the U. S. to England. Why? LEDBETTER: So after World War II, the - what's called the Bretton Woods system is - fixes the price of gold at $35 an ounce. That's what the dollar's worth. Treasury will sell gold at about $35 an ounce, buy gold at about $35 an ounce. And every other currency - every other major currency in the world is tied to the dollar and can only trade within a very, very narrow band of its fixed value to the dollar. So it's kind of a qualified gold standard. It's really a dollar standard, but the dollar is defined by gold. You know, this of course requires gold to be moved around or moved from one part of a vault to another or tagged. You know, this is now France's pile, and this is now the Netherland's pile - whatever it is. The system works. It works. It works so well that it actually represents a kind of crisis because when Western Europe and Japan grow as rapidly as they do through the late-1940s and 1950s, you now have all of these dollars and dollar-backed securities out there in the world. And if they were all to be cash at the same time at the Treasury window, there's no longer enough gold to meet all the obligations. So this is a tremendous dilemma. DAVIES: So at this point in time, the United States made the pledge that if you show up with $35 American currency, you can buy an ounce of gold, right? LEDBETTER: Correct. Now, in reality, they tried to discourage people from doing that (laughter). But in theory, that was what was propping up the world monetary system. So you can either let it happen and run out of gold, and therefore, you know, people thought the world would collapse. Or you could announce to the world, hey, we're not going to do this anymore; we're going to close the Treasury window, with the same effect. Everyone - they called it the nuclear option because the feeling was that that would cause such mistrust in the global economy that everything would collapse. It's not not a sustainable system. It was going to break down one way or the other. And a lot of very strange things happened in order to prop up this system whose logic no longer made any sense. So you have in 1967 a crisis in the U. K. where its currency devalued by about 15 percent, and there was simply no gold left in the Bank of England vault. And so in the middle of the night, these massive cargo planes - the largest cargo planes in the world carrying payloads of more than 60,000 pounds flew from Fort Knox to to England to prop up the pound at the same time that much of this gold was being siphoned off into a private market. And it was kind of crazy. I mean this was done in such a rush. They didn't even weigh the gold before they loaded it onto the planes. They really thought that the world economy was going to fall apart in late-1967. DAVIES: And so that meant that the Bank of England then could make - had the gold to pay to people to try to redeem their pounds. It propped up the pound. LEDBETTER: It did. But again, also, a lot of it was being siphoned off into the private market. There was a private gold market, you know, for a lot of central banks kind of, you know, selling and buying gold every day. And suddenly in the '60s, there becomes kind of a run on the private gold market. And again, if you don't back it up with gold, people begin to think, oh, there's something wrong, and then they're going to panic by even more. So you have to keep this market alive in order to keep the monetary system alive. This is a crazy system. I mean no one would have designed a system to work this way if they knew this is what it was going to play out as. But that's kind of where we ended up in the 1960s. And that's not even the weirdest part (laughter). DAVIES: What's the weirdest part? LEDBETTER: So to the extent that there is such a thing as a scoop in history, I think I found one while doing the research for this book. The best way to put it is in the middle part of the 1960s, several people in - high up in the Johnson administration and some sympathetic members of Congress embarked on a top-secret - there's no other way to describe it - a 20th century alchemy quest. Again, the monetary system was running out of gold. This was a massive problem that was very well-recognized at the highest levels. But there was just nothing to do about it. And so Donald Hornig, who was LBJ's science technology adviser and later the president of Brown, and Joe Barr, who was an assistant treasury secretary and some other folks in the administration created a top-secret project to find gold where it had never been found before. And because this was the mid-1960s, what else are they going to call it - Operation Goldfinger. Operation Goldfinger had three major components. The first was to use state-of-the-art technology to find gold in places where it had never been looked for before. And so you have dozens or hundreds of scientists scurrying around the country. Is there gold in coal ash? Is there gold in plants? Is the gold in meteorites that hit the Earth? Is there gold an animal brains? Is there gold in deer antlers? DAVIES: (Laughter). LEDBETTER: You can't make this stuff up. They were looking for gold in all these crazy places. And the technology was quite sophisticated. It could measure parts per million, parts per billion. And at that level, the answer to all those questions is, yeah, kind of. There's a tiny trace amount of gold in lots of things. But to extract it from deer antlers, for example, is going to cost way more than $35 an ounce, so it almost doesn't matter whether it's there. DAVIES: So that was - finding gold in weird places was one thing. There was also this idea of, well, blowing stuff up, right? LEDBETTER: Yeah. So think about fracking. There's oil under the ground that's just really hard to get by traditional methods, so you need to come up with a different method to get the oil out of the ground. And if oil is trading at, you know, $20 a barrel, it's probably not even worth doing. But once it goes to a hundred dollars a barrel, then it makes economic sense to do fracking. Similarly, there were plenty of places in the United States and outside the United States where all the gold that could be mined profitably near the surface had been mined. They know or strongly suspect that there's more gold down there, but they can't get at it using conventional explosives. So why not put nuclear explosives in the ground, blow out the gold and leach it up with an acid process? And this experiment went pretty far. There were some test blasts done and lots of plans drawn up. Ultimately it didn't get off the ground because scientists realized that there would be tremendous radioactive fallout from doing this. But again, this shows the logic of a monetary system that had lost its mind. The idea that you would put nuclear weapons in the ground just to get gold to prop up your monetary system shows that there's something wrong with that system. DAVIES: And there's more. LEDBETTER: Yes. The third component was, let's make gold out of base metals. It sounds like a joke, but actually, you can do it. It has been done. Glenn Seaborg, who was the chairman of the AEC, actually did it a few years later after Operation Goldfinger had been kind of quietly shut down. You can take something like bismuth and very, very thin foil and bombard it with a proton beam to displace the electrons. And what's left over is gold. However, Seaborg calculated that to create gold in this method would cost approximately 1 quadrillion dollars per ounce. And so as a economically viable system, it didn't work. But again, this shows the desperation of high-placed officials. I mean this was approved by the president. This was driven by. . . DAVIES: By Johnson, yeah. LEDBETTER: . . . The Treasury secretary. This was LBJ, Eugene Rostow, his esteemed Under Secretary of Treasury who later was the dean of Yale Law School. These were highly respectable, powerful people who were driven to what seems today kind of like madness because of the centrality of gold to the international monetary system. DAVIES: We're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book about gold and its impact on U. S. history, culture and monetary policy is called \"One Nation Under Gold. \" We'll continue our conversation after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, we're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book is \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Precious Metal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four Centuries. \"So in 1971, Nixon takes the U. S. dollar off the gold standard. Supposed to be temporary - it isn't. I mean, it - finally, the tether is broken. How'd the economy do? LEDBETTER: Well, it was a tremendous shock to the system. There's no question about it. But on the other hand, it was inevitable. There was simply no way that the Bretton Woods system was going to survive, in part because it was so successful. It kind of collapsed under its own success because it - because there wasn't enough gold to sustain all the economic growth in the world. I'm not sure that Nixon really recognized that. I think that it was - like so many things that Nixon did in the - in the '71 period, it was really motivated by domestic political concerns and the need to be re-elected. The economy was not in great shape in 1971. And had it not improved, it might well have led to his defeat in the election of 1972. So it was a highly calculated political move that, nonetheless, kind of had to be done. I mean, I think even had a Democrat been in the White House in the early '70s, something similar would have happened because there was simply too much pressure on the dollar from foreign trading and simply not enough gold to go around. So what we get in '71 is essentially what we still have, which is a floating currency. The value of the dollar is determined not by any particular amount of gold or metal or anything but rather, it trades freely in the marketplace. The dollar is worth what the dollar is said to be worth. It was a tremendous shock to the system. It's certainly linked to the energy crisis that comes a couple of years later because oil is traded in dollars. We have tremendous inflation in the - throughout the 1970s, getting worse as the decade goes on, stagflation with - unemployment and inflation both in double digits at times. It was - it was great growing pains for the world. But I think most mainstream economists today would say we're better off with a floating currency than we would have been had we stuck to some version of gold standard. DAVIES: You know, if you watch cable TV or surf the internet or look in newspapers, there are lots of people offering to sell gold as an investment. So what's the pitch? Why do these folks that are hawking gold tell you you need it? I mean, why would I want gold? LEDBETTER: Yeah. I mean, I think there is a kind of rational pitch and a super-rational pitch, or a irrational pitch. The rational pitch is, look, as part of a broader portfolio in which you also own stocks, bonds, real estate, what have you - other types of investment - a certain amount of gold could be a good thing. It's - depending on the timing of the market, it - you might outperform other investments. It's certainly, you know, stable. You'll always be able to resell it whenever you need to put your hands on it. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I personally don't own any gold, but that just has to do with my taste as an investor rather than any kind of philosophy or ideology about it. Then there's the less rational pitch, which can involve things like, you know, the government's going to shut down one day, and civilization is going to come to an end. I mean, there is a history of this that goes back even before gold was legal to own in this country. A massive best-seller in 1970 called \"How You Can Profit From The Coming Devaluation\" not only advised readers to buy gold and silver but also to bury it in your yard because who knows what's going to happen when the, you know, the cities spill over into riots and there are kind of wars going on. These apocalyptic scenarios somehow have gold as the salvation as if, you know, when civilization is broken down, we're going to be, like, handing each other gold coins. It never has made any sense to me whatsoever, but lots of people believe it. For whatever reason, gold is the salvation from this, you know, gloom-and-doom apocalypse that is, you know, always just another year or a year away. DAVIES: You know, it seems to me that the other reason that people have affection for the gold standard is that, you know, the monetary system we have is essentially - the currency is based on trust in the government that issues it. And people - some group of people are making decisions about the level of our money supply, and those are elites. And you worry - are they going to have my interests at heart? So you have this ability to create money in the hands of people that you don't know and may not trust. And then, in addition, there's this temptation to just print money easily and generate inflation. There's no discipline to it, whereas if you're pegged to gold, even if it's tough, there's a discipline to it. LEDBETTER: Well, at least in theory. Again, throughout the period in which the dollar was tied to gold, you had, you know, tremendous economic panics and depressions of all kind. We were on a gold standard when the Great Depression hit, so it's not really a guarantor of anything. The discipline is largely theoretical. And I would also point out yes, I mean - look, as a critique of the existing monetary order, the idea of a gold standard is very interesting and very useful to say, well, it could look like this instead of like that. At the same time, we don't really have meaningful inflation right now. Inflation has largely been tamed, I mean, compared to, you know, when I was growing up in the 1970s or you know, what Argentina has looked like at times or what Japan has looked like at times. You know, inflation can get really bad. We have got that more or less under control for the last several decades thanks to - we think - prudent monetary policy and a rational basis for our currency. So I certainly think the existing order has lots of limitations and problems. It does not follow from that that a gold standard would be superior in any way. DAVIES: What do we know about Donald Trump's views about the gold standard? LEDBETTER: Not much. It really was not a big issue in the 2016 primaries compared to the 2012 primaries I think in part because the price of gold was much higher in 2012 than it was in 2016. And for whatever reason, you get more political discussion around this idea when gold is relatively high than when it's relatively low. We do know - I mean, he was asked at one point in the campaign about it and said basically boy, what a great idea it would be. It would be really hard to do, but it would finally mean that our money was tied to something. It's also true, however, that Robert Mercer, a billionaire who was originally a Ted Cruz supporter and then became Trump's biggest backer and also a former employer of Stephen Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, is a big supporter of a return to a gold standard and has funded conferences and literature around this idea. So - and early on in the Trump administration, he flirted with a treasury secretary candidate who was a banker who favors a return to the gold standard, but he didn't actually appoint that man. He appointed Mnuchin instead. I - you know, Trump has trouble just getting his executive orders filled. The idea that he would take on a topic of this level of complexity and this level of disruption to the economy, I just don't see it as very likely. It's a wildly, wildly impractical proposal despite whatever theoretical appeal it might have. DAVIES: And so no signs that in the actual, you know, functioning of the government in its moves in the Treasury Department that. . . LEDBETTER: I haven't seen anything from Treasury indicating that they're thinking in this direction. I haven't seen any proposed legislation. You've had some efforts on the state level in recent years to do things like make gold legal tender in Utah. The sticking point there being it's only for the face value of the coin. So if you have some, you know, 19th-century $10 coin that's in gold, you can take it to 7-Eleven and buy a Slurpee with it. But you'd be foolish to do so because it's worth thousands of dollars. But you can only spend the $10, though, on its face value. These are symbolic gestures, again, usually designed to appease, you know, either the gold mining industry or a certain sector of the Republican electorate. I don't see any serious efforts on the federal or state level to truly restore a gold standard despite a fair amount of rhetoric about it. DAVIES: Well, James Ledbetter, thanks so much for speaking with us. LEDBETTER: Thank you for having me. DAVIES: James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book is \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Priceless Medal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four Centuries. \" Coming up, Kevin Whitehead tells us about the jazz quartet Sexmob. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross who's off this week. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first major-party candidate in more than half a century to advocate a return to the gold standard for the U. S. dollar. My guest, James Ledbetter, says most mainstream economists agree the idea is completely unworkable. But for much of American history, it was an article of faith that real money ought to be gold or at least redeemable for gold or another precious metal. In his new book, Ledbetter explores our fascination with gold as a symbol of permanence and quality and most of all a store of value. It's a book about financial panics, gold sellers who warn of impending doom and - I'm not making this up - government funding for half-baked schemes to increase the supply of gold including one relying on nuclear explosions. James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc. magazine. His writing on business and politics has appeared in The New Yorker and The New York Times. He's the author of five previous books. His latest is, \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Priceless Metal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four Centuries. \" Well, James Ledbetter welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, you hear some politicians these days - even President Trump has said it would be great if we could do it to take the United States - to take American currency back to the gold standard. What does that mean exactly? JAMES LEDBETTER: The gold standard is a way of valuing money that has been used at various points in American history, going back to the beginning of the Republic - a gold and silver standard. Gold is mentioned in the U. S. Constitution and depending on how you read that Constitution, is supposed to be the basis for our money. And what it simply means is that the value of the dollar, or any currency on the gold standard, is fixed to a certain amount of gold. So when I was growing up, the Bretton Woods system was still in place. And the dollar was - gold was worth $35 an ounce. That was fixed. It wouldn't change, except in private markets where it didn't change very much because the U. S. Treasury would willingly buy gold at the rate of $35 an ounce or sell gold at $35 an ounce. And there was no point in anyone buying or selling it for much more than that. And the appeal that it has to Trump and to many in the Republican Party particularly, is that it fixes the value in a way that is thought to be stabilizing to the economy. One of the reasons why I wrote this book is to point out that many of the worst economic catastrophes that have happened in American history happened when we were on a gold standard. So as a protector, it doesn't do a very good job. But on the other hand, the collapse that we saw most recently in the Great Recession arguably also demonstrates flaws in the current system we have, which is a floating currency. The value of the dollar is what people who want to buy and sell dollars say it is. It's a market-based system, and most of the major currencies in the world today are on that. But I think the appeal is not only for financial stability, but there's a kind of psychological component to it, too, that taps into gold's rich role in American history. DAVIES: All right, we're going to get to all of that stuff, I think. But let me just ask you one other thing. Does any country in the world today define its currency in terms of. . . LEDBETTER: No. DAVIES: . . . Gold? No, just no. LEDBETTER: No major - there might be some tiny, you know, republic in Africa or something, but no major currency has been on the gold standard for a while. I believe Switzerland was the last to abandon it in the late part of the 20th century. DAVIES: Your book tells the interesting story of how we got here in American history. And, you know, today we're used to having a currency that's stable, that we rely on. I mean, when I put my five bucks down on the counter at Panera, I know they're going to accept it, and their vendors are going to accept it. We don't even think about who authorizes our money and where its value comes from. But that wasn't always so. So if you go back to, say, the first half of the 19th century, when we were an agrarian country - industrializing and plenty of commerce, what was used for money? LEDBETTER: Lots of things were used for money. There was actually no federal legal tender currency until the second half of the 19th century. So you had states that issued currency. You had banks that issued their own forms of currency. People, of course, did use gold and silver and barter and all sorts of things. But there were - there was a kind of kaleidoscope of different types of money. In fact, in the book, I mention the money that George Washington took on a single trip to Philadelphia - six joes, 67 half joes, two one-eighteenth joes, three doubloons, one pistole, two moidores, one half moidore, two double Louis d'or, three single Louis d'or, 80 guineas, seven half guineas besides silver and banknotes. This was currency from Portugal, Spain, France and Britain all of which could be used as currency at the time. So it was this kind of crazy quilt of different types of currency paper, metal, and many of those currencies would fail. And so the reputation of paper money in the - particularly in the first half of the 19th century was very, very low. It was considered to be hugely unstable and would become worthless often rather quickly. And so that fueled the need for a kind of single standard that is represented by gold. DAVIES: All right, so in 1848, we all know Sutter's Mill in California, right? There's the - gold is discovered. And there is the California gold rush. You mean, thousands of people coming and some of them getting rich in a hurry. Tell us about the impact of this - well, first of all, just the macroeconomic effect. I mean, did it affect the country's economy to have all this gold discovered? LEDBETTER: It did profoundly. The gold rush represents a transformational moment in American history and the real development of what becomes the West. I mean, San Francisco was a dot on the map prior to the discovery of gold in 1848. And within a couple of years, it becomes almost like a second financial capital within the United States. For a brief time, its stock market actually outpaced the New York Stock Exchange. There was so much gold and commerce coming into the country out of nowhere that America now becomes a kind of world economic power. Remember, through the middle part of the 19th century, the United States of America was a relatively new, often broke country. The War of 1812 was extremely devastating to the economy. The Mexican War that just preceded the gold rush really kind of bankrupted the country. And so - but suddenly, wealth is coming from the ground. And the gold that finds its way back east, the economy becomes increasingly dependent on this supply of gold. You have, within a few short years, also a similar discovery in Australia that has a similar effect on that. So this is, you know, the creation of value out of nothing. And I think it also represents a sort of shift in the American character. Prior to that, the Puritan idea that, you know, the only way to make money is to work hard and believe in God. Here is, you know, get rich quick - the original get-rich-quick scheme. Go west, dig in the ground and you may, you know, strike it rich. Now, in reality, most people didn't strike it rich. I mean, I think we tend to mythologize and kind of view through a kind of golden hue this idea of people going west and striking it rich. But a lot of people failed. A lot of people starved. A lot of people went crazy. The first mental institution in California was actually opened to deal with people who - because it took such a long time to get from the East Coast to the West Coast before the Panama Canal existed, they would go crazy on the voyages. They would literally go mad. And the state found itself suddenly having to deal with all these people and had to create a mental institution to deal with it. DAVIES: So as you go through the second half of the 19th century, you see that gold is still important in the currency. During the Civil War, the federal government issues greenbacks - paper money. LEDBETTER: Right. DAVIES: And it works. It helps to finance the war, but a lot of people hate it because it's just paper, and they don't trust it. And. . . LEDBETTER: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . On we go. I mean, there are financial panics in what, like, 1893, 1907? And then in the early 20th century, we finally have a central bank. The Federal Reserve system is established to have one central institution to regulate our currency. Are we still committed then to the gold standard? LEDBETTER: Yes, gold becomes the official standard with silver now, you know, kind of being tossed aside. Silver - through most of the 19th century, America was what was called a bimetallic standard. That is, both gold and silver were legal tender. The creation of greenbacks in the Civil War, you know, is something that some people see as a kind of original sin because for the first time, we have a nationally issued currency that's not backed by gold. It's just kind of whatever the government says it's worth, it's worth or what the market will bear. And this goes all the way to a Supreme Court decision that is then overturned, declaring the greenbacks ultimately to be legal tender. But it's - much of the latter half of the 19th century, you find the populist movement trying to restore silver to some kind of legal tender status because that's what was plentiful in many of the Western states. That's what leads William Jennings Bryan to deliver the famous \"Cross Of Gold\" speech. You will not crucify mankind on a cross of gold. So gold. . . DAVIES: Now, that was in the 1896 Democratic Convention. . . LEDBETTER: That's right. DAVIES: . . . Right? LEDBETTER: That's right. DAVIES: And he was railing against the Eastern elites who loved the gold standard, the poor farmers. . . LEDBETTER: That's right. DAVIES: . . . That wanted silver. LEDBETTER: The farmers wanted silver. So you have a kind of agrarian, populist movement that sees gold as the enemy, that sees gold as the province of wealthy East-Coast bankers. And silver is the kind of populous metal. A half-century later, it flips because now, you know, paper money is considered to be the evil, and gold is the channel of populism. So the populist sentiment is kind of fluid. It can attach itself to different metals as necessary. But at the time the Federal Reserve is formed, gold is the official backing of all of our currency. And that remains the case until Roosevelt was elected after the Great Depression starts. DAVIES: We're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book about gold and its impact on U. S. culture, history and monetary policy is called \"One Nation Under Gold. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NAOMI MOON SIEGEL'S \"IT'S NOT SAFE\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine and has written several books. His new one is called \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Precious Metal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four centuries. \" So if we go up to the 1930s - when the stock market crashes in 1929, the president is Herbert Hoover, who you remind us was one of the most committed presidents to the gold standard in history - believed firmly in it and stuck with it as the economy began to contract and unemployment began to build. What do economists think now about the role that this adherence to the gold standard played in this economic disaster? LEDBETTER: I think the mainstream economic position is that the gold standard acted as a kind of set of handcuffs on the economy that because Hoover was so committed - and the Republican Party as a whole - so committed to the gold standard during this time that there was simply not enough motion, not enough flexibility to be able to move the economy back in the direction that it needed to go. And in fact, you know, Hoover began cracking down on people that he believed were hoarding gold. Again, when economies go haywire, it's very common for people to snap up gold because they think, you know, who knows where it's going? And this is the safest form of - the safest form in which to store our wealth. And that that was not helping because if people were holding onto the gold, it can't circulate through the economy and lead to recovery. According to Hoover, we came very near running out of gold, a couple of weeks away from a kind of disaster whereby the government couldn't pay its bills. DAVIES: Hoover was committed to the gold standard. And that meant sort of the money in circulation was limited by the amount of gold that's available. I wonder, if he had done in 1930 what President Obama did in 2009, which was to try and flood the markets with credit to try and get - to stimulate the economy and get people investing - what do we think might have happened? LEDBETTER: Well, it's conceivable that the recovery could have come much more quickly than it did. If the Hoover administration and the Federal Reserve, critically, had methods by which to create liquidity into the economy, to sort of inject some life into the economy, it's entirely possible that recovery would have begun. But that hypothetical, you know, demonstrates the weakness that I think the gold standard created during this period. It kind of acted as a pair of golden handcuffs on the engineers of the economy. They simply couldn't get the thing going because there was not enough wealth to go around. There was no form of stimulus available to them. DAVIES: So when Franklin Delano Roosevelt takes office in 1933, he wants to aggressively get the economy moving. He enacts a bunch of government programs. What was his attitude towards gold and the gold standard? LEDBETTER: So we learn a lot about the New Deal. But literally, the first thing that FDR did, the first piece of legislation was to close every bank in the United States and to outlaw the individual ownership of gold. So all the gold in the country was officially confiscated at a rate that was nicely above the market price. So people got - you know, they got a good deal. But they had to turn in their gold. It was, in theory, against the law to own gold during this time. And broadly speaking, people complied with this because they were desperate. And, you know, the goodwill toward Roosevelt and the kind of - the need for new leadership and fresh ideas led most people to comply with this law. There were some exceptions. I don't think anyone actually went to jail for hanging onto their gold. But there were some trials and fines that were assessed. DAVIES: You actually have a reproduction of a leaflet that was handed out. Executive order of the president, April 5, 1933, where people have to turn in their gold coin and bullion. The government paid them for this. . . LEDBETTER: They did. And. . . DAVIES: . . . When they turned the gold in. What was the logic? What was the goal here? LEDBETTER: Roosevelt was trying to get some kind of control over the economy. And the - what was going on in the latter days of the Hoover administration is a lot of gold was leaving the country. France, in particular, during this period, in part because of their experience with World War I, was hoarding as much of the world's gold as it could get its hands on. And people were panicking. They were taking gold out of, you know, vaults, out of banks and hanging onto it because of the fear that the economy would just get worse and worse. Roosevelt felt he had to put a stop to this before anything could get better. And similarly, every bank in the United States had to close. And then the healthier ones were brought back to life. But the gold prohibition, which was probably never really intended as permanent, stays for 40 years. So throughout, you know, the middle part of the 20th century, it is actually illegal for Americans to own gold except for, you know, jewelry or teeth fillings, that kind of thing and certain industrial applications. But we lived for 40 years without the ability to own gold. DAVIES: So the government kind of, in effect, bought a lot of gold and amassed it. How did that help the economy? LEDBETTER: What Roosevelt ended up doing was to revalue the relationship between gold and the dollar. And this, you know, inflation is literally what it was actually helped the economy grow. There was more money in circulation. There were, you know, all of the different New Deal programs to get people to work and get people to spend. That is directly related to the recovery that begins in the 1930s. Now, there's a second dip in the recession that, again, economists have, you know, various theories about what caused that second dip, as do historians, but the important thing is that the relationship between the dollar and gold changed. Roosevelt essentially took us off the gold standard for a time. And there's a kind of comical moment where he and his administration every day fixed the price of gold to something new. So literally, one day, he decides gold's going to go up 21 cents because seven times three seems like a lucky number. This is - I'm not making this up. I mean, this is the arbitrariness for several months of how gold was managed. And then finally, by the time the 1934 Gold Act is passed, a fixed value of gold and dollar is restored, and some version of that continues until well after the World War II period. DAVIES: The other thing that's interesting about this period is that, you know, it was a time when Roosevelt wasn't sure whether he wanted us on the gold standard or not. But the U. S. government acquired massive stocks of gold, and that led to the construction of a vault, right? That's Fort. . . LEDBETTER: Of Fort Knox. DAVIES: Yeah. LEDBETTER: That's right. The bullion reserve at Fort Knox was they took over a portion of a, you know, military encampment, Fort Knox, and began stockpiling what becomes the largest pile of gold ever assembled, you know, by mankind. It is this, you know, massively secure and kind of famously almost comically guarded, you know, with - poison gas will come in if anybody twists the wheel and the - nobody knows the entire combination. People are given portions of the combination to the safe so that nobody knows the whole thing. I mean, it's this ridiculous level of security to guard all of this metal that has been, you know, both confiscated from individuals, amassed and bought. And also, you know, during this time, the only gold that can be legally bought or sold in the United States is through the Treasury Department. No one else is actually authorized to do it without permission. And this - you know, presumably, this what I call the arsenal of gold is supposed to be a guarantor of economic security. But, of course, it's not that simple. DAVIES: James Ledbetter's book is \"One Nation Under Gold. \" After a break, he'll talk about some pretty wild schemes that got government funding in the 1960s to find or create more gold. We'll discuss President Trump's views on the gold standard, and Kevin Whitehead tells us about the jazz quartet Sexmob. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with James Ledbetter, whose new book \"One Nation Under Gold\" explores America's fascination with the precious metal and the many battles over whether American currency should be pegged to the price of gold. Ledbetter says despite many financial crises, the U. S. government maintained its attachment to the gold standard for much of the 20th century. So through the '40s, '50s and '60s, the United States is more or less on the gold standard, as are other countries. And you write that there were times when there would be massive shipments of gold bullion in, like, big, military transport planes. . . LEDBETTER: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . Like, from the U. S. to England. Why? LEDBETTER: So after World War II, the - what's called the Bretton Woods system is - fixes the price of gold at $35 an ounce. That's what the dollar's worth. Treasury will sell gold at about $35 an ounce, buy gold at about $35 an ounce. And every other currency - every other major currency in the world is tied to the dollar and can only trade within a very, very narrow band of its fixed value to the dollar. So it's kind of a qualified gold standard. It's really a dollar standard, but the dollar is defined by gold. You know, this of course requires gold to be moved around or moved from one part of a vault to another or tagged. You know, this is now France's pile, and this is now the Netherland's pile - whatever it is. The system works. It works. It works so well that it actually represents a kind of crisis because when Western Europe and Japan grow as rapidly as they do through the late-1940s and 1950s, you now have all of these dollars and dollar-backed securities out there in the world. And if they were all to be cash at the same time at the Treasury window, there's no longer enough gold to meet all the obligations. So this is a tremendous dilemma. DAVIES: So at this point in time, the United States made the pledge that if you show up with $35 American currency, you can buy an ounce of gold, right? LEDBETTER: Correct. Now, in reality, they tried to discourage people from doing that (laughter). But in theory, that was what was propping up the world monetary system. So you can either let it happen and run out of gold, and therefore, you know, people thought the world would collapse. Or you could announce to the world, hey, we're not going to do this anymore; we're going to close the Treasury window, with the same effect. Everyone - they called it the nuclear option because the feeling was that that would cause such mistrust in the global economy that everything would collapse. It's not not a sustainable system. It was going to break down one way or the other. And a lot of very strange things happened in order to prop up this system whose logic no longer made any sense. So you have in 1967 a crisis in the U. K. where its currency devalued by about 15 percent, and there was simply no gold left in the Bank of England vault. And so in the middle of the night, these massive cargo planes - the largest cargo planes in the world carrying payloads of more than 60,000 pounds flew from Fort Knox to to England to prop up the pound at the same time that much of this gold was being siphoned off into a private market. And it was kind of crazy. I mean this was done in such a rush. They didn't even weigh the gold before they loaded it onto the planes. They really thought that the world economy was going to fall apart in late-1967. DAVIES: And so that meant that the Bank of England then could make - had the gold to pay to people to try to redeem their pounds. It propped up the pound. LEDBETTER: It did. But again, also, a lot of it was being siphoned off into the private market. There was a private gold market, you know, for a lot of central banks kind of, you know, selling and buying gold every day. And suddenly in the '60s, there becomes kind of a run on the private gold market. And again, if you don't back it up with gold, people begin to think, oh, there's something wrong, and then they're going to panic by even more. So you have to keep this market alive in order to keep the monetary system alive. This is a crazy system. I mean no one would have designed a system to work this way if they knew this is what it was going to play out as. But that's kind of where we ended up in the 1960s. And that's not even the weirdest part (laughter). DAVIES: What's the weirdest part? LEDBETTER: So to the extent that there is such a thing as a scoop in history, I think I found one while doing the research for this book. The best way to put it is in the middle part of the 1960s, several people in - high up in the Johnson administration and some sympathetic members of Congress embarked on a top-secret - there's no other way to describe it - a 20th century alchemy quest. Again, the monetary system was running out of gold. This was a massive problem that was very well-recognized at the highest levels. But there was just nothing to do about it. And so Donald Hornig, who was LBJ's science technology adviser and later the president of Brown, and Joe Barr, who was an assistant treasury secretary and some other folks in the administration created a top-secret project to find gold where it had never been found before. And because this was the mid-1960s, what else are they going to call it - Operation Goldfinger. Operation Goldfinger had three major components. The first was to use state-of-the-art technology to find gold in places where it had never been looked for before. And so you have dozens or hundreds of scientists scurrying around the country. Is there gold in coal ash? Is there gold in plants? Is the gold in meteorites that hit the Earth? Is there gold an animal brains? Is there gold in deer antlers? DAVIES: (Laughter). LEDBETTER: You can't make this stuff up. They were looking for gold in all these crazy places. And the technology was quite sophisticated. It could measure parts per million, parts per billion. And at that level, the answer to all those questions is, yeah, kind of. There's a tiny trace amount of gold in lots of things. But to extract it from deer antlers, for example, is going to cost way more than $35 an ounce, so it almost doesn't matter whether it's there. DAVIES: So that was - finding gold in weird places was one thing. There was also this idea of, well, blowing stuff up, right? LEDBETTER: Yeah. So think about fracking. There's oil under the ground that's just really hard to get by traditional methods, so you need to come up with a different method to get the oil out of the ground. And if oil is trading at, you know, $20 a barrel, it's probably not even worth doing. But once it goes to a hundred dollars a barrel, then it makes economic sense to do fracking. Similarly, there were plenty of places in the United States and outside the United States where all the gold that could be mined profitably near the surface had been mined. They know or strongly suspect that there's more gold down there, but they can't get at it using conventional explosives. So why not put nuclear explosives in the ground, blow out the gold and leach it up with an acid process? And this experiment went pretty far. There were some test blasts done and lots of plans drawn up. Ultimately it didn't get off the ground because scientists realized that there would be tremendous radioactive fallout from doing this. But again, this shows the logic of a monetary system that had lost its mind. The idea that you would put nuclear weapons in the ground just to get gold to prop up your monetary system shows that there's something wrong with that system. DAVIES: And there's more. LEDBETTER: Yes. The third component was, let's make gold out of base metals. It sounds like a joke, but actually, you can do it. It has been done. Glenn Seaborg, who was the chairman of the AEC, actually did it a few years later after Operation Goldfinger had been kind of quietly shut down. You can take something like bismuth and very, very thin foil and bombard it with a proton beam to displace the electrons. And what's left over is gold. However, Seaborg calculated that to create gold in this method would cost approximately 1 quadrillion dollars per ounce. And so as a economically viable system, it didn't work. But again, this shows the desperation of high-placed officials. I mean this was approved by the president. This was driven by. . . DAVIES: By Johnson, yeah. LEDBETTER: . . . The Treasury secretary. This was LBJ, Eugene Rostow, his esteemed Under Secretary of Treasury who later was the dean of Yale Law School. These were highly respectable, powerful people who were driven to what seems today kind of like madness because of the centrality of gold to the international monetary system. DAVIES: We're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book about gold and its impact on U. S. history, culture and monetary policy is called \"One Nation Under Gold. \" We'll continue our conversation after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, we're speaking with James Ledbetter. He is the editor of Inc. magazine. His new book is \"One Nation Under Gold: How One Precious Metal Has Dominated The American Imagination For Four Centuries. \" So in 1971, Nixon takes the U. S. dollar off the gold standard. Supposed to be temporary - it isn't. I mean, it - finally, the tether is broken. How'd the economy do? LEDBETTER: Well, it was a tremendous shock to the system. There's no question about it. But on the other hand, it was inevitable. There was simply no way that the Bretton Woods system was going to survive, in part because it was so successful. It kind of collapsed under its own success because it - because there wasn't enough gold to sustain all the economic growth in the world. I'm not sure that Nixon really recognized that. I think that it was - like so many things that Nixon did in the - in the '71 period, it was really motivated by domestic political concerns and the need to be re-elected. The economy was not in great shape in 1971. And had it not improved, it might well have led to his defeat in the election of 1972. So it was a highly calculated political move that, nonetheless, kind of had to be done. I mean, I think even had a Democrat been in the White House in the early '70s, something similar would have happened because there was simply too much pressure on the dollar from foreign trading and simply not enough gold to go around. So what we get in '71 is essentially what we still have, which is a floating currency. The value of the dollar is determined not by any particular amount of gold or metal or anything but rather, it trades freely in the marketplace. The dollar is worth what the dollar is said to be worth. It was a tremendous shock to the system. It's certainly linked to the energy crisis that comes a couple of years later because oil is traded in dollars. We have tremendous inflation in the - throughout the 1970s, getting worse as the decade goes on, stagflation with - unemployment and inflation both in double digits at times. It was - it was great growing pains for the world. But I think most mainstream economists today would say we're better off with a floating currency than we would have been had we stuck to some version of gold standard. DAVIES: You know, if you watch cable TV or surf the internet or look in newspapers, there are lots of people offering to sell gold as an investment. So what's the pitch? Why do these folks that are hawking gold tell you you need it? I mean, why would I want gold? LEDBETTER: Yeah. I mean, I think there is a kind of rational pitch and a super-rational pitch, or a irrational pitch. The rational pitch is, look, as part of a broader portfolio in which you also own stocks, bonds, real estate, what have you - other types of investment - a certain amount of gold could be a good thing. It's - depending on the timing of the market, it - you might outperform other investments. It's certainly, you know, stable. You'll always be able to resell it whenever you need to put your hands on it. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I personally don't own any gold, but that just has to do with my taste as an investor rather than any kind of philosophy or ideology about it. Then there's the less rational pitch, which can involve things like, you know, the government's going to shut down one day, and civilization is going to come to an end. I mean, there is a history of this that goes back even before gold was legal to own in this country. A massive best-seller in 1970 called \"How You Can Profit From The Coming Devaluation\" not only advised readers to buy gold and silver but also to bury it in your yard because who knows what's going to happen when the, you know, the cities spill over into riots and there are kind of wars going on. These apocalyptic scenarios somehow have gold as the salvation as if, you know, when civilization is broken down, we're going to be, like, handing each other gold coins. It never has made any sense to me whatsoever, but lots of people believe it. For whatever reason, gold is the salvation from this, you know, gloom-and-doom apocalypse that is, you know, always just another year or a year away. DAVIES: You know, it seems to me that the other reason that people have affection for the gold standard is that, you know, the monetary system we have is essentially - the currency is based on trust in the government that issues it. And people - some group of people are making decisions about the level of our money supply, and those are elites. And you worry - are they going to have my interests at heart? So you have this ability to create money in the hands of people that you don't know and may not trust. And then, in addition, there's this temptation to just print money easily and generate inflation. There's no discipline to it, whereas if you're pegged to gold, even if it's tough, there's a discipline to it. LEDBETTER: Well, at least in theory. Again, throughout the period in which the dollar was tied to gold, you had, you know, tremendous economic panics and depressions of all kind. We were on a gold standard when the Great Depression hit, so it's not really a guarantor of anything. The discipline is largely theoretical. And I would also point out yes, I mean - look, as a critique of the existing monetary order, the idea of a gold standard is very interesting and very useful to say, well, it could look like this instead of like that. At the same time, we don't really have meaningful inflation right now. Inflation has largely been tamed, I mean, compared to, you know, when I was growing up in the 1970s or you know, what Argentina has looked like at times or what Japan has looked like at times. You know, inflation can get really bad. We have got that more or less under control for the last several decades thanks to - we think - prudent monetary policy and a rational basis for our currency. So I certainly think the existing order has lots of limitations and problems. It does not follow from that that a gold standard would be superior in any way. DAVIES: What do we know about Donald Trump's views about the gold standard? LEDBETTER: Not much. It really was not a big issue in the 2016 primaries compared to the 2012 primaries I think in part because the price of gold was much higher in 2012 than it was in 2016. And for whatever reason, you get more political discussion around this idea when gold is relatively high than when it's relatively low. We do know - I mean, he was asked at one point in the campaign about it and said basically boy, what a great idea it would be. It would be really hard to do, but it would finally mean that our money was tied to something. It's also true, however, that Robert Mercer, a billionaire who was originally a Ted Cruz supporter and then became Trump's biggest backer and also a former employer of Stephen Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, is a big supporter of a return to a gold standard and has funded conferences and literature around this idea. So - and early on in the Trump administration, he flirted with a treasury secretary candidate who was a banker who favors a return to the gold standard, but he didn't actually appoint that man. He appointed Mnuchin instead. I - you know, Trump has trouble just getting his executive orders filled. The idea that he would take on a topic of this level of complexity and this level of disruption to the economy, I just don't see it as very likely. It's a wildly, wildly impractical proposal despite whatever theoretical appeal it might have. DAVIES: And so no signs that in the actual, you know, functioning of the government in its moves in the Treasury Department that. . . LEDBETTER: I haven't seen anything from Treasury indicating that they're thinking in this direction. I haven't seen any proposed legislation. You've had some efforts on the state level in recent years to do things like make gold legal tender in Utah. The sticking point there being it's only for the face value of the coin. So if you have some, you know, 19th-century $10 coin that's in gold, you can take it to 7-Eleven and buy a Slurpee with it. But you'd be foolish to do so because it's worth thousands of dollars. But you can only spend the $10, though, on its face value. These are symbolic gestures, again, usually designed to appease, you know, either the gold mining industry or a certain sector of the Republican electorate. I don't see any serious efforts on the federal or state level to truly restore a gold standard despite a fair amount of rhetoric about it. DAVIES: Well, James Ledbetter, thanks so much for speaking with us. LEDBETTER: Thank you for having me. DAVIES: James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc. magazine.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Weird Cafe has got to go. That was the chant by the small but serious band of protesters. They don't want people buying coffee at this cafe because they worry that new business of this kind will make a working-class Latino neighborhood less affordable. GREENE: They are worried about gentrification. And that is the topic of news stories this summer from the NPR Cities Project. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I was a part of the community. LEONARDO VILCHIS: You need to move out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Supporting gentrifying establishments. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thank God we found a beautiful home. EVA CHIMENTO: I may not afford the rent. GREENE: And we should say coffee shops are not the only target in LA's Boyle Heights neighborhood. Art galleries are also a major point of conflict. Here is Saul Gonzalez from member station KCRW. SAUL GONZALEZ, BYLINE: I'm walking down Anderson Street in Boyle Heights, and it all looks pretty gritty and industrial - old brick warehouses, small workshops. But step inside some of these old soot-stained buildings and you're in a very different world. CHIMENTO: Nine paintings total in the exhibition, which is called \"Until The End Of The World. \" And his paintings are done with oil and alkyd. Alkyd is what gives it the shine. GONZALEZ: Eva Chimento is the owner of Chimento Contemporary. It's one of about a dozen high-end art galleries that have opened on Anderson Street in recent years, mostly in vacant industrial spaces. Like Chimento, many of the gallery owners moved to Boyle Heights, which is just across the Los Angeles river from downtown LA, to escape high rents and overhead in other parts of the city. CHIMENTO: I opened my gallery with $1,500 in my checking account. And I think I spent $1,000 on beer and pizza for opening night. GONZALEZ: Chimento admits before her gallery's opening night she was pretty clueless about this part of Boyle Heights. CHIMENTO: You know, like when you cross a state line, how there's empty fields that are just like no man's land? That's where I thought I was. GONZALEZ: You didn't think people were claiming this as my neighborhood? CHIMENTO: Not at all. GONZALEZ: But Chimento's no man's land is this man's home. VILCHIS: It's a very tight community. Everybody knows everybody. GONZALEZ: Leonardo Vilchis is a Boyle Heights resident and neighborhood activist. We meet a block east of Chimento's gallery, where Boyle Heights residential neighborhoods begin. Vilchis's organization, Union de Vecinos, wants the galleries out of Boyle Heights. With a third of its 90,000 residents living below the poverty line, Vilchis says the neighborhood has more important needs. VILCHIS: A laundromat, a homeless shelter, affordable housing for people who make less than $20,000 a year. You put a gallery with paintings things that costs tens of thousands of dollars, and the audience that comes to this place, it starts looking for other kinds of amenities, right? They look for the coffee shop, for the place to hang out. All of those things increase the cost and the value of the local neighborhood. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Hey, hey, ho, ho, these gentrifiers have got to go. Hey, hey. GONZALEZ: Boyle Heights is a community with a long history of protests that dates back to the Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s. And some of that same energy is now being used against coffee shops and art galleries alike. Tactics range from marches and protests to threatening messages. One group posted fliers showing a human skull in gun sights and the words, Boyle Heights is not safe for hipster trash. And the LAPD is conducting a hate crime investigation after the graffiti tagging of a gallery door last year with the words, F white art. Vilchis uses tough talk himself and says he's not interested in talking to gallery owners who say they want to be good neighbors. VILCHIS: What you need to do with cancer is, you know, to do surgery on it, right? You need to start killing the cells that are creating the cancer. So to say, OK, I'm a cancer cell, but I want to be good doesn't change the fact that you're a cancer cell. You need to move out. GONZALEZ: And how are the gallery owners reacting to the protests? I went to find out at one exhibition opening. MIHAI NICODIM: The only thing they want is for me to get out the [expletive] out of here. I cannot agree with that. I mean, this is not how you solve the conversation. GONZALEZ: Mihai Nicodim opened his Boyle Heights gallery in 2015, but he's a longtime figure in the LA art scene. NICODIM: No, I'm not going anywhere. I mean, I've been here in downtown area for the last 25 years. I'm not going to go away because somebody tells me to just go, you know. I'm home. GONZALEZ: Gallery opponents, though, recently scored their first victory. Citing persistent harassment and trolling, one art space in Boyle Heights closed earlier this year. Back at Chimento Contemporary, owner Eva Chimento is already thinking about her long-term future here. CHIMENTO: Well, when my lease is up, I may be moving, too (laughter). GONZALEZ: But she says it doesn't have much to do with community protests because. . . CHIMENTO: I may not afford the rent.

It's to increase productivity. That's the amount of stuff we produce for every hour of work. If people produce more, it is, at least in theory, possible to pay them more. But productivity growth has been weak lately. To find out what's going wrong and what to do about it, we've reached out to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and also a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How long has this been a problem? WESSEL: Well, it's been a problem for about a decade. Right now productivity is growing at a pace that - the experts tell us the economy can grow at about 2 percent a year. Now, President Trump and others would like to see it grow faster. And that would mean finding a way to raise productivity growth back to the levels we saw, say, in the late 1990s or in the period after World War II. INSKEEP: Oh, and these are periods when there was a lot of technological change, a lot going on in the economy. And it was possible, for example, in the '90s with the internet, to do jobs in different ways. Are we not still in such a phase? WESSEL: Well, apparently not. It's one of the conundrums here. On one hand, you see a lot of technology. Look at your iPhone, for instance. But it isn't showing up in the efficiency of production of goods and services. In the late '90s and early 2000s, it did. And it's beginning to worry people because this has been going on for a decade both before, during and after the Great Recession. INSKEEP: I think I figured this out now. The iPhone is actually distracting me from work and making me less productive. So maybe technology is getting in my way here. WESSEL: There are some people who think that. You know, like, is Twitter and Facebook and shopping online at work really making you more productive or subtracting from productivity? INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK. So we have this problem. Does this mean that getting beyond 2 percent annual growth is impossible? Because 2 percent raise a year - that sounds OK, but it's not a great raise. WESSEL: So there's some economists - Robert Gordon at Northwestern University, for one - who thinks that the wonders of the internet and the iPhone just aren't as economically potent as, say, the arrival of electricity or motorized transit. So he's kind of gloomy going forward. But I was kind of cheered to see that a couple of other economists, Dan Sichel and Lee Branstetter, are much more optimistic. What they argue is that the official data - the official productivity investment data - don't properly record all the seeds of innovation and investment that are being planted today that they think will pay off in the near future in more efficient health care, smarter robots, e-learning that's better. And so they think we can do substantially better over the next decade than we have over the past. INSKEEP: OK. That sounds cool, David. But if we're thinking about jobs and improving people's wages, you were just referring to technology like robots that would replace people. And maybe one person would end up doing what had been the job of 10. Is there a danger that this technology would make us more productive but actually make the job market worse? WESSEL: Well, look. Productivity growth can and often does eliminate jobs in industries that harness the technology aggressively. That's what happened when we mechanized the farm. But what history tells us - even recent history - is that we lose jobs in one place, and we get jobs somewhere else and that as wages go up, people spend more money. And that creates more goods and services and more demand. The big question now - is this time different? Are robots and artificial intelligence somehow going to spell the end of work, even though that has never happened before? INSKEEP: What is the government's role in nudging things in the right direction? WESSEL: Well, as Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, put it recently, sometimes, growth is not enough. And what we've seen is a lot of unevenness in the economy. Some people are benefiting from surges in technology and productivity. And some people aren't. So he thinks we need a better - what he calls a more comprehensive set of policies - to help individuals and communities that are battered by extraordinarily rapid change, better job training, help for people to move from one place to another and so forth. INSKEEP: We need to think bigger. WESSEL: We need to think bigger. And we need to remember that the government policies can help grow the economy, but they also have a role in making sure the fruits of that prosperity are more widely distributed.

I'm Terry Gross. Good jobs are getting harder to find in America. That's the starting point of the new book by my guest Rick Wartzman. By good jobs, he means jobs that offer a decent wage, job security, good benefits, including affordable health insurance and a safe way of having money set aside for retirement. His new book, \"The End Of Loyalty,\" examines the erosion of that social contract between corporations and employees since World War II and analyzes the forces that got us to this point, including automation, globalization, outsourcing, the weakening of unions and the emphasis on cost cutting to deliver a profitable bottom line to shareholders. He focuses on the history of four companies - Kodak, GE, GM and Coca-Cola. Wartzman was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal for 15 years where he tracked the coal, steel and aerospace industries. He now writes about the future of work for Fortune magazine online and directs the Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute, a part of Claremont Graduate University. Rick Wartzman, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, you wrote recently that thanks to President Trump's populist rhetoric, the most romanticized figure in America now is the blue-collar worker of yesteryear. Who do you think he's romanticizing, and how does that compare with what you see when you look back on the, quote, \"Golden Age? \"RICK WARTZMAN: So clearly President Trump appealed to a large section of voters who feel left behind. And many are in communities where there was once a real vibrancy to them. There were good jobs, good middle-class jobs that one could get with very little education and very little skill but find your way to the middle class by working in a factory. And you know, President Trump in a greatly oversimplified way and, you know, I think a bit of a bait and switch frankly promised that he could bring those jobs back. I don't think they're coming back. But he really has romanticized, again, this kind of blue-collar figure in America. When you look back, the history's actually a lot messier. You know, it really was a golden age for many people. As I said, there was a path to the middle class for those who were not well-educated, who had limited skills. But those were really tough jobs. It was an era that excluded women and people of color to a great degree from the workplace. They faced open hostility and discrimination. Many still do of course, but I think conditions were even far worse for them then. And there were a lot of complexities to, again, even this Golden Age where there was still quite a bit of poverty in America. Maybe 25 percent of Americans lived in poverty then. And some - you know, not all boats lifted, but many more boats lifted than are lifting today. And that's why those communities feel left behind and why Trump was able to appeal to them. GROSS: How did benefits become a way of compensating employees for their work? When does it date back to - things like health insurance or pensions? WARTZMAN: So a lot of these things rose sort of first during World War II. The government kept a lid on wages as a way to hold down inflation during wartime. But they allowed companies to increase benefits. And so companies began using health care and other benefits to attract employees during the war. And there were labor shortages obviously as people went overseas to fight. And so that sort of became embedded in the social contract. In the period after World War II, unions that were so important in forging the social contract not just for union members but really for all workers - there was a tremendous spillover effect that happened across the economy and even into the ranks of white-collar workers by what unions like the United Auto Workers and the Electrical Workers were able to do at the bargaining table. They fought hard for benefits. There was a period where they were bent on adding health care and retirement security for their members, and again, it spilled over. So after World War II, you see all of these things rise substantially. So where you would have, you know, in the 1940s say, you know, something like 15 percent of workers have their basic medical needs covered, you know, that would explode to over 70 percent by the 1970s. You had, you know, relatively few people covered by pensions in the early '40s. And that would get up where people had guaranteed defined benefit plans where they were guaranteed a set amount of income for life. You know, that would rise to about half of all workers by the '70s. And so these things all exploded in this postwar period really from the late '40s to the early '70s. GROSS: Just looking back a little further as you do in your book, you give some examples of companies in the early part of the 20th century who took it upon themselves to offer certain benefits to their workers. You use Kodak as an example. Tell us some of the things Kodak did in the early 1900s. WARTZMAN: Oh, it was tremendous. I mean, you know, George Eastman, the founder of the company, lavished perks on his workers. And so they had everything from giant recreation centers and, you know - with bowling alleys and, you know, all kinds of sports leagues. I mean it really was - Rochester was a company town. There were traveling nurses that if you were sick, they would come and visit you and make sure that you were OK. He had symphony orchestras play during lunch time at the, you know, at the company. And movies were shown. And this was just - this was company life in a place like Rochester. There was a real mix of impulses for someone like George Eastman to do these things. Part of it was that he really did - and some would say in a paternalistic way, and others would say in a genuinely caring way - want to take care of his people. And he seemed to greatly value his workers. At the same time, he very strongly, in Kodak's case, wanted to keep unions out. And by lavishing great pay and benefits on his folks, it was a way to look at union organizers and have his people say, we don't need you; we're already getting a great deal here. GROSS: Was Kodak ever unionized? WARTZMAN: It wasn't. No, Kodak always managed to keep organized labor at bay. But again, the spillover effect's important. Kodak executives kept an eye on what unionized companies in Rochester were providing to their workers and would often then match or exceed that compensation as part of their way to keep unions out. GROSS: What's the turning point for you where you think you start to see the social contract between employer and employee starting to shatter? WARTZMAN: It was really interesting doing the research. So I guess I would say, you know, the early '70s, which is where a lot of people sort of mark the beginning of the end - and there's a lot of things that happened there in terms of the economy, in terms of the rise of global competition, in terms of unions beginning to really go into decline, in terms of other forces beginning to really take hold - this shift from kind of a blue-collar economy, if you will, to a knowledge economy, which had a lot of ramifications for workers and soon thereafter the rise in this ethic of maximizing shareholder value, which has become the preeminent sort of corporate ethic and is really driving so much of corporate culture now. And that wasn't there before. And that's a huge theme of the book - is how much that has amplified all these other trends. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rick Wartzman. He's a journalist who has written about business for many years. He writes now for Fortune magazine online. And he's the author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \"Well, you do attribute a lot of other changes in the social contract between employer and employee to corporations putting shareholders and the bottom line above their employees. Describe a pivot point that you write about in which corporations start heading in that direction. WARTZMAN: There were several things going on here. One is that coming out of the Depression and World War II, if you just looked at the way CEOs talked, that the way corporations framed who they were responsible to, this was not BS. This was real stuff. They were - they talked in terms of a we, and they had a very stakeholder orientation, meaning that companies felt an obligation, spoke of an obligation to take care of the communities where they had a presence, their customers for sure, their workers and their shareowners - all of those groups. And by the 1980s for sure and really beginning in the mid-1970s, you know, we began to see this shareholder primacy, this idea that companies should maximize shareholder value. And by definition, all those other groups get left behind. And the effect on workers has been tremendous. This you can trace in some ways to, again, I think some broader cultural shifts - this kind of we mentality; we're all in this together coming out of the Great Depression and the Great War and moving more to an age of I, the individual. The marketplace is sacrosanct, and it's all about, you know, lifting ourselves up. And I think that corporate culture - it changed reflecting these shifts in national norms and national culture. GROSS: So one of the things you say in the book is that when executives - when their own incomes were so linked to the bottom line by having so many shares in the company, they were incentivized to behave in, as you put it, perverse ways. What are some examples of the quote, \"perverse ways\" that you think executives started behaving in? And maybe you'd want to use one or two executives who you profile in your book. WARTZMAN: Absolutely. Well, there is a lot of evidence that companies and executives who run them are now being forced to think more in the short term and not about the long-term sustainability of the company. So if you want to see share price rise in the short term, you do things to cut costs, make sure profits go up. But that doesn't work forever obviously, but it does work for a while. And so we've seen stinting investment in things like R&D at many companies. We've certainly seen great cutbacks in investing in workers not only in their compensation but in their training. They're not investing in their own future. They're not investing in the long term by investing in their workers. They are trying to make their share price go up in the short term, and that is, as you pointed out, often in the interests of the executives whose compensation is based in large part on how the shares do. GROSS: Jack Welch, who was the longtime CEO of GE, became a corporate superstar. What was his reputation by the time he left? WARTZMAN: Well, Jack Welch had a great reputation, you know, as he was leaving. I mean he was arguably the superstar CEO of the 20th century. He left the company riding high. His reputation has taken I guess, you know, a bit of a hit since then. There was - there were many who began to think that he had built the company up largely through financial engineering through GE Capital and that he had gotten the - GE too far away from its roots of actual engineering, industrial engineering, making things and that Jeff Immelt, who is - now announced he's leaving the company - but, you know, he tried to right that ship, many think, and that Welch had again pushed too far into financializing the company. The really significant thing I think, though, about Jack Welch is he really began this trend in a very high-profile way of taking a very large company and just engaging in - not to sugarcoat it - it was a very brutal downsizing. And you know, depending on how you count the numbers, you know, some have said that Welch ended up through cuts and attrition and other means getting rid of 170,000 jobs at GE during his tenure. And he became known as Neutron Jack, as I'm sure many of your listeners know, because supposedly he just left the building standing, right? All the people were gone. And you know, there's a real complication to Welch's story. In many ways, Jack Welch did a lot of good for workers at GE in that he made the company much more of a meritocracy. He was somebody who flattened the organization. GE, when he came in 1980, '81, was a very high-bound, bureaucratic company. And he blew it up, and he made it so that people's ideas were welcome no matter where they were in the enterprise right down to the front lines. He instituted all kinds of programs. Work-Out is one that got a lot of attention - to be able to pull in ideas from anywhere, the best ideas. And that was exciting for many and terrific. And so in some ways, he's reflective of a time when many companies actually began to engage their workers much more and not just have sort of this top-down management structure. And work for many became more interesting, more exciting. There was more fulfillment in it. But at the same time, this other part of the social contract - namely job security, you know, what you were earning, your benefit levels and things like that - that was all eroding at the same time. And so, you know, Welch came in and downsized to a degree. It was shocking when he first did it, and then that level of downsizing just became kind of normal throughout corporate America. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Rick Wartzman. He's the author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \" We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, \"PEACOCKS\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rick Wartzman. He's the author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \" It's about the social contract between employers and employees and how that contract has eroded over the years. He's also the director of the Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute, which is part of Claremont Graduate University. And he is a contributor to Fortune magazine online. You know, we were talking earlier about unions and how early on, like, Kodak didn't unionize because the workers felt that the benefits at Kodak were good enough. Kodak tried to be on its own competitive with unions. How has the union situation in the four companies you profile changed in the past few years? Like, what is the importance of unions in those organizations now, and how powerful are they compared to the power they had in the past? WARTZMAN: Well, in terms of how much - how powerful they are, they're a shadow of themselves. But you know, now the auto workers - you know, after the bankruptcy, there have been some gains restored. But you know, they had to go to a two-tier wage structure where even unionized employees coming into General Motors were starting at much lower wages. And suddenly auto workers were facing something they never did before. Again, this used to be a path to a really solid middle-class life. And now even auto workers, you know, are struggling to get by. At other companies like General Electric, unions just have - you know, they're still there, and - but they've become much less a presence as the company has shifted into this kind of new economy and digital economy. And there are just fewer and fewer union jobs at a company like that. And that is reflective of what's happening across America. We're now at a point where fewer than 7 percent of private sector workers are unionized in this country. And it's just clearly not enough to have the kind of collective voice and countervailing power against corporate power that, again, was able to lift wages and benefits for all folks, not only those carrying union cards but other blue-collar workers and even white-collar workers in the past. GROSS: What do you see as one of the big turning points in the weakening of unions? WARTZMAN: Well, there were a couple of things going on. Unions definitely made their own missteps. You know, some of it I think was born of in the 1930s and into the '40s when conditions were so terrible and there was so much to fight for. It was a cause that - and a movement that many could rally behind and understand the need for. As unions won many gains, you know, some would say that they lost their soul a little bit. They lost their reason for being, to some degree. It just wasn't as clear anymore. And there was an argument that in fact their power had now almost eclipsed corporate power in some ways. I'm not sure that was true, but that became kind of a conventional wisdom even by the '60s. And then over time, the bigger thing that happened, more than unions' own missteps and their lack - they also, I should mention - unions didn't do as good a job of just organizing people. But there were two other things that happened. One is that the structure of the economy changed. So as we moved from more of a manufacturing economy to a service economy - you used to be able to go into a GM complex, and there were, you know, several thousand people, perhaps, at one factory or, you know, a series of buildings at a factory complex. It was relatively easy to organize them just physically and logistically. It's much harder to do that in a service environment. I mean even a big-box retailer or a - you know, might have a few hundred workers - or you know, a fast food place even fewer. And so they're just - the organization is actually tougher in a lot of ways. And then the biggest factor of all I think is that corporations went hammer and tong against organized labor. There were all kinds of efforts from all kinds of companies that once accepted unions as kind of a fact of life and in some ways even welcomed them for the stability they brought to the workplace and the predictability that a contract would bring. They now had - they now saw unions as just a cost. And again, as this maximizing shareholder value mindset kicked in, unions were something that they decided to really fight against. And they did so sometimes with legal means and often through illegal means. And they really stomped out organized labor.

And we'll hear from Sharon Horgan, the co-creator and star of the Amazon comedy series \"Catastrophe\" about a couple who get married to raise their baby who was conceived during a one-night stand. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BILL CHARLAP SONG, \"NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Rick Wartzman, author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \" It's about how fewer companies are offering job security, retirement security and good benefits. Wartzman was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal for 15 years. He now writes about the future of work for Fortune online. In one of your columns, you wrote about President Trump's promise of returning jobs to the coal industry. You followed the industry for years. When you look at the big picture, how did the jobs get lost in the first place? WARTZMAN: Well, a lot were automated away. And that, again, is a trend that has affected many sectors. You know, it's really striking. I mean if you look at photographs from the postwar era, factories were filled with people. Now you walk into a factory; they're kind of ghost towns for the most part. And the same thing I think has happened to - you know, to the forests and the mines and other work like that. And the biggest, you know, thing that's happened lately is that the market has shifted. And so coal jobs are disappearing because of big market forces that are moving away from, you know, carbon and moving toward cleaner forms of energy. And you know, that's something that is already so down the track that we're not going back on that. And again, I just think there's so many false promises that the president has made about his ability or anybody's ability to bring back these jobs of yesteryear when we should be focused on training for the jobs of the future. GROSS: So are the coal mining jobs that the president has promised to return jobs that still exist in the same number, jobs that are still needed in the same number in the coal industry as it is today as opposed to how it was in the past? WARTZMAN: Yeah, again, I think that because of these market forces that are moving in the other direction, no, we don't need those jobs. You know, there just aren't going to be those positions to fill. There won't be the demand for them. I know there have been some examples of different, you know, operations that have started up. And then when you actually look at the number of jobs created, it's, you know, in the double digits or maybe the triple digits. You know, it's tens of people or hundreds of people. It's not thousands and thousands of people. And the truth is, again, I don't mean at all to make light of the miner's plight. It's very serious, and I think we need to do much more to shore up those communities that are really in pain and are so desperate in so many cases. But you know, there are not that many jobs we're talking about in the scheme of things. You know, it's - whatever it is - 60,000, 70,000 jobs, something like that who are miners. I mean, you know, you could put all those people in the Rose Bowl, you know, here in LA and have plenty of seats left over. I mean it's just not that many jobs. And so I think it's gotten kind of an inordinate share of attention, frankly. GROSS: Has the U. S. ever managed to deal in a good way with a whole, like, industry or a whole type of job that no longer exists to the extent that it did and take those workers and find alternatives for them so that they could have decent work without making promises that can't be kept about bringing back the past? WARTZMAN: In some ways, yeah. I mean I - so I would look at things like, you know, these, again, big moonshot ideas. So one of the things that we did do to prepare an earlier generation for moving from, you know, blue-collar work in some ways into knowledge jobs was something like the G. I. Bill, which was a tremendous piece of legislation that gave a level of access to college that just didn't exist, right? That was really the province, the purview of the rich before the G. I. Bill. And that opened up avenues, and much more of the American population was able to, you know, go on to higher education. It was hugely important and a huge lift. But I don't see anything like that of that magnitude, again, that we're doing today. The other thing that's really important is - we've been talking a lot about what government can do, and I think government's hugely important. It is something that I do talk quite a bit about in the book. But the real focus of my book is on the private sector for a reason. The government provides a safety net. The government provides very important guardrails for how the economy operates and sort of sets the playing field. But it's corporate America, too, that has a huge responsibility in all this. Again, corporate America used to spend a lot more time and money educating its people, training its people than it does today. There's a lot of lip service that, oh, you know, our people are our most important asset. Every executive you talk to will tell you that. Very few seem to actually act like it in terms of really investing in their people. There are obviously exceptions to this, and there are companies that do a good job of training and development. But they are the exception. They really are the exception. There's an effort going under - on now by AT&T, actually, to retrain about a hundred thousand of its workers, as I understand it, to move them from kind of a landline age and give them new skills and science and technology and math and things that they'll need to know to be able to operate in digital systems and computer systems. And it's a massive retraining effort underway. It's been described as - it's perhaps the largest going on right now. And we need to see much more of that kind of investment. It is the great exception. And so I think government's important, but I don't want to let corporate America off the hook here. GROSS: Well, Rick Wartzman, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. WARTZMAN: Thank you so much for having me. GROSS: Rick Wartzman is the author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \" After we take a short break, we'll hear from Sharon Horgan, the co-creator and star of the Amazon comedy series \"Catastrophe. \" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TED NASH'S \"THE FOUR FREEDOMS - FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Good jobs are getting harder to find in America. That's the starting point of the new book by my guest Rick Wartzman. By good jobs, he means jobs that offer a decent wage, job security, good benefits, including affordable health insurance and a safe way of having money set aside for retirement. His new book, \"The End Of Loyalty,\" examines the erosion of that social contract between corporations and employees since World War II and analyzes the forces that got us to this point, including automation, globalization, outsourcing, the weakening of unions and the emphasis on cost cutting to deliver a profitable bottom line to shareholders. He focuses on the history of four companies - Kodak, GE, GM and Coca-Cola. Wartzman was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal for 15 years where he tracked the coal, steel and aerospace industries. He now writes about the future of work for Fortune magazine online and directs the Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute, a part of Claremont Graduate University. Rick Wartzman, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, you wrote recently that thanks to President Trump's populist rhetoric, the most romanticized figure in America now is the blue-collar worker of yesteryear. Who do you think he's romanticizing, and how does that compare with what you see when you look back on the, quote, \"Golden Age? \" RICK WARTZMAN: So clearly President Trump appealed to a large section of voters who feel left behind. And many are in communities where there was once a real vibrancy to them. There were good jobs, good middle-class jobs that one could get with very little education and very little skill but find your way to the middle class by working in a factory. And you know, President Trump in a greatly oversimplified way and, you know, I think a bit of a bait and switch frankly promised that he could bring those jobs back. I don't think they're coming back. But he really has romanticized, again, this kind of blue-collar figure in America. When you look back, the history's actually a lot messier. You know, it really was a golden age for many people. As I said, there was a path to the middle class for those who were not well-educated, who had limited skills. But those were really tough jobs. It was an era that excluded women and people of color to a great degree from the workplace. They faced open hostility and discrimination. Many still do of course, but I think conditions were even far worse for them then. And there were a lot of complexities to, again, even this Golden Age where there was still quite a bit of poverty in America. Maybe 25 percent of Americans lived in poverty then. And some - you know, not all boats lifted, but many more boats lifted than are lifting today. And that's why those communities feel left behind and why Trump was able to appeal to them. GROSS: How did benefits become a way of compensating employees for their work? When does it date back to - things like health insurance or pensions? WARTZMAN: So a lot of these things rose sort of first during World War II. The government kept a lid on wages as a way to hold down inflation during wartime. But they allowed companies to increase benefits. And so companies began using health care and other benefits to attract employees during the war. And there were labor shortages obviously as people went overseas to fight. And so that sort of became embedded in the social contract. In the period after World War II, unions that were so important in forging the social contract not just for union members but really for all workers - there was a tremendous spillover effect that happened across the economy and even into the ranks of white-collar workers by what unions like the United Auto Workers and the Electrical Workers were able to do at the bargaining table. They fought hard for benefits. There was a period where they were bent on adding health care and retirement security for their members, and again, it spilled over. So after World War II, you see all of these things rise substantially. So where you would have, you know, in the 1940s say, you know, something like 15 percent of workers have their basic medical needs covered, you know, that would explode to over 70 percent by the 1970s. You had, you know, relatively few people covered by pensions in the early '40s. And that would get up where people had guaranteed defined benefit plans where they were guaranteed a set amount of income for life. You know, that would rise to about half of all workers by the '70s. And so these things all exploded in this postwar period really from the late '40s to the early '70s. GROSS: Just looking back a little further as you do in your book, you give some examples of companies in the early part of the 20th century who took it upon themselves to offer certain benefits to their workers. You use Kodak as an example. Tell us some of the things Kodak did in the early 1900s. WARTZMAN: Oh, it was tremendous. I mean, you know, George Eastman, the founder of the company, lavished perks on his workers. And so they had everything from giant recreation centers and, you know - with bowling alleys and, you know, all kinds of sports leagues. I mean it really was - Rochester was a company town. There were traveling nurses that if you were sick, they would come and visit you and make sure that you were OK. He had symphony orchestras play during lunch time at the, you know, at the company. And movies were shown. And this was just - this was company life in a place like Rochester. There was a real mix of impulses for someone like George Eastman to do these things. Part of it was that he really did - and some would say in a paternalistic way, and others would say in a genuinely caring way - want to take care of his people. And he seemed to greatly value his workers. At the same time, he very strongly, in Kodak's case, wanted to keep unions out. And by lavishing great pay and benefits on his folks, it was a way to look at union organizers and have his people say, we don't need you; we're already getting a great deal here. GROSS: Was Kodak ever unionized? WARTZMAN: It wasn't. No, Kodak always managed to keep organized labor at bay. But again, the spillover effect's important. Kodak executives kept an eye on what unionized companies in Rochester were providing to their workers and would often then match or exceed that compensation as part of their way to keep unions out. GROSS: What's the turning point for you where you think you start to see the social contract between employer and employee starting to shatter? WARTZMAN: It was really interesting doing the research. So I guess I would say, you know, the early '70s, which is where a lot of people sort of mark the beginning of the end - and there's a lot of things that happened there in terms of the economy, in terms of the rise of global competition, in terms of unions beginning to really go into decline, in terms of other forces beginning to really take hold - this shift from kind of a blue-collar economy, if you will, to a knowledge economy, which had a lot of ramifications for workers and soon thereafter the rise in this ethic of maximizing shareholder value, which has become the preeminent sort of corporate ethic and is really driving so much of corporate culture now. And that wasn't there before. And that's a huge theme of the book - is how much that has amplified all these other trends. GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rick Wartzman. He's a journalist who has written about business for many years. He writes now for Fortune magazine online. And he's the author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \" Well, you do attribute a lot of other changes in the social contract between employer and employee to corporations putting shareholders and the bottom line above their employees. Describe a pivot point that you write about in which corporations start heading in that direction. WARTZMAN: There were several things going on here. One is that coming out of the Depression and World War II, if you just looked at the way CEOs talked, that the way corporations framed who they were responsible to, this was not BS. This was real stuff. They were - they talked in terms of a we, and they had a very stakeholder orientation, meaning that companies felt an obligation, spoke of an obligation to take care of the communities where they had a presence, their customers for sure, their workers and their shareowners - all of those groups. And by the 1980s for sure and really beginning in the mid-1970s, you know, we began to see this shareholder primacy, this idea that companies should maximize shareholder value. And by definition, all those other groups get left behind. And the effect on workers has been tremendous. This you can trace in some ways to, again, I think some broader cultural shifts - this kind of we mentality; we're all in this together coming out of the Great Depression and the Great War and moving more to an age of I, the individual. The marketplace is sacrosanct, and it's all about, you know, lifting ourselves up. And I think that corporate culture - it changed reflecting these shifts in national norms and national culture. GROSS: So one of the things you say in the book is that when executives - when their own incomes were so linked to the bottom line by having so many shares in the company, they were incentivized to behave in, as you put it, perverse ways. What are some examples of the quote, \"perverse ways\" that you think executives started behaving in? And maybe you'd want to use one or two executives who you profile in your book. WARTZMAN: Absolutely. Well, there is a lot of evidence that companies and executives who run them are now being forced to think more in the short term and not about the long-term sustainability of the company. So if you want to see share price rise in the short term, you do things to cut costs, make sure profits go up. But that doesn't work forever obviously, but it does work for a while. And so we've seen stinting investment in things like R&D at many companies. We've certainly seen great cutbacks in investing in workers not only in their compensation but in their training. They're not investing in their own future. They're not investing in the long term by investing in their workers. They are trying to make their share price go up in the short term, and that is, as you pointed out, often in the interests of the executives whose compensation is based in large part on how the shares do. GROSS: Jack Welch, who was the longtime CEO of GE, became a corporate superstar. What was his reputation by the time he left? WARTZMAN: Well, Jack Welch had a great reputation, you know, as he was leaving. I mean he was arguably the superstar CEO of the 20th century. He left the company riding high. His reputation has taken I guess, you know, a bit of a hit since then. There was - there were many who began to think that he had built the company up largely through financial engineering through GE Capital and that he had gotten the - GE too far away from its roots of actual engineering, industrial engineering, making things and that Jeff Immelt, who is - now announced he's leaving the company - but, you know, he tried to right that ship, many think, and that Welch had again pushed too far into financializing the company. The really significant thing I think, though, about Jack Welch is he really began this trend in a very high-profile way of taking a very large company and just engaging in - not to sugarcoat it - it was a very brutal downsizing. And you know, depending on how you count the numbers, you know, some have said that Welch ended up through cuts and attrition and other means getting rid of 170,000 jobs at GE during his tenure. And he became known as Neutron Jack, as I'm sure many of your listeners know, because supposedly he just left the building standing, right? All the people were gone. And you know, there's a real complication to Welch's story. In many ways, Jack Welch did a lot of good for workers at GE in that he made the company much more of a meritocracy. He was somebody who flattened the organization. GE, when he came in 1980, '81, was a very high-bound, bureaucratic company. And he blew it up, and he made it so that people's ideas were welcome no matter where they were in the enterprise right down to the front lines. He instituted all kinds of programs. Work-Out is one that got a lot of attention - to be able to pull in ideas from anywhere, the best ideas. And that was exciting for many and terrific. And so in some ways, he's reflective of a time when many companies actually began to engage their workers much more and not just have sort of this top-down management structure. And work for many became more interesting, more exciting. There was more fulfillment in it. But at the same time, this other part of the social contract - namely job security, you know, what you were earning, your benefit levels and things like that - that was all eroding at the same time. And so, you know, Welch came in and downsized to a degree. It was shocking when he first did it, and then that level of downsizing just became kind of normal throughout corporate America. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Rick Wartzman. He's the author of the new book \"The End Of Loyalty: The Rise And Fall Of Good Jobs In America. \" We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.

He's also the director of the Center for a Functioning Society at the Drucker Institute, which is part of Claremont Graduate University. And he is a contributor to Fortune magazine online. You know, we were talking earlier about unions and how early on, like, Kodak didn't unionize because the workers felt that the benefits at Kodak were good enough. Kodak tried to be on its own competitive with unions. How has the union situation in the four companies you profile changed in the past few years? Like, what is the importance of unions in those organizations now, and how powerful are they compared to the power they had in the past?

There's an effort going under - on now by AT&T, actually, to retrain about a hundred thousand of its workers, as I understand it, to move them from kind of a landline age and give them new skills and science and technology and math and things that they'll need to know to be able to operate in digital systems and computer systems. And it's a massive retraining effort underway. It's been described as - it's perhaps the largest going on right now. And we need to see much more of that kind of investment. It is the great exception. And so I think government's important, but I don't want to let corporate America off the hook here.

When there's more demand for housing, things get more expensive. Neighborhoods change. And that's the subject of this summer's stories from the NPR Cities Project.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Thank God we found a beautiful home. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I may not afford the rent. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  Today we're going to Austin, Texas. It's been one of the fastest growing cities in the country for years with a fast and furious technology sector. One of the parts of the city that is changing drastically is a historically black neighborhood, east Austin. A lot of longtime residents are moving. Audrey McGlinchy of member station KUT has been talking to people who've left but are still coming back to go to church. CLARENCE JONES: Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. Congregation? UNIDENTIFIED CONGREGATION: I saw the Lord and he heard me. AUDREY MCGLINCHY, BYLINE: Pastor Clarence Jones leads the Greater St. John's Baptist Church in east Austin. It's been around for more than 75 years. JONES: Back in 1944, '45, somewhere in there, the members moved here, pitched a tent. You know, and they worshipped in the tent until they was able to build this little port right here. MCGLINCHY: This little port is a small church on a corner lot. The white paint's chipped and a steeple rises above the gabled roof. Around the time this church was built, single-story homes were cropping up nearby. People like choir director Lisa Spearman have spent many Sundays in the area. LISA SPEARMAN: I have belonged to this church since I was a little girl, maybe 4 years old. MCGLINCHY: And how long have you been directing the choir here? SPEARMAN: I've been doing this for I want to say five years. And my mother was doing it before me. MCGLINCHY: But Spearman recently moved to the suburbs as the neighborhood around the church began to change. She'd been living in her grandmother's house when the family decided to sell. SPEARMAN: The taxes were too high. They're sky high. Houses around us were getting remodeled and sold for double, triple of what they paid for back in the day. MCGLINCHY: Others have moved to smaller towns outside of Austin, including Pastor Jones. JONES: I like that it's more quieter (laughter). MCGLINCHY: I wanted to know more about how east Austin is changing, so I took a walk with University of Texas professor Eric Tang. Back in the 1950s and '60s, nightclubs here on East 11th Street hosted major music acts. The street was also busy during the day. ERIC TANG: You had Hillside Pharmacy, which was the main pharmacy for African-American residents on the east side. MCGLINCHY: They had few other options of places to shop - or to live, for that matter. Starting in 1928, the city refused basic services to black families living anywhere but in east Austin. And so this area became a bustling black neighborhood. These days, most of the businesses have changed. TANG: Hillside Pharmacy by name still exists. And it's rather controversial. It is now a restaurant. And pharmacy, P-H-A-R-M, has been replaced by F-A-R-M to highlight the farm-to-table service that this restaurant provides to its customers. MCGLINCHY: Tang says many longtime residents feel that new restaurants aren't catering to them. It's a sign of a larger shift. TANG: Among the fastest growing cities in the United States between 2000 and 2010, Austin was the only one to see absolute numerical decline in its African-American population. MCGLINCHY: Tang talked to former east Austin residents. He found that many had moved to suburbs just outside the city to towns like this one. LESLIE PERKINS: This is the grocery store that I used to go to when I first moved here. It was very small, not very much produce, fresh produce. MCGLINCHY: Twelve years ago, Leslie Perkins moved to the town of Manor. It's 15 miles east of Austin, fewer than 10,000 people. And while Austin has lost black residents, Manor's black population has increased by 10 percent since 2000. Perkins and I go inside a Mexican restaurant. There she tells me why she left Austin. PERKINS: Even though I was a teacher, I could not afford to live in Austin. So the closest and most direct to my job was Manor. MCGLINCHY: After a little bit, she changed jobs as well and began teaching in a Manor school. When she did, Perkins saw the migration of black families like her own. PERKINS: My students followed. So I would be teaching a new group of students, but I'd, like, oh, I know your cousin or, oh, you're the younger sibling of the student I already taught. MCGLINCHY: Perkins and her family will still drive into the city for things Manor can't offer - a museum or a dip in a pool. But she misses living in Austin. PERKINS: I was a part of the community. It doesn't really exist anymore as it did. And that's pretty sad for me. MCGLINCHY: As for Manor, it's small, but it's growing rapidly. The town just got a Walmart and a Starbucks and soon perhaps a new congregation. UNIDENTIFIED CONGREGATION: (Singing) It will. . . MCGLINCHY: Back at Greater St. John's Baptist Church in east Austin, there's a for sale sign on the front lawn. Pastor Clarence Jones is looking to move. JONES: And I see a whole lot of hope and growth there in Manor. And I think that the church would do well to move in that direction. MCGLINCHY: In a church driveway in east Austin, I'm Audrey McGlinchy for the NPR Cities Project. MCEVERS: That story was produced in partnership with KUT's On My Block project about the changing east Austin area. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, professor Eric Tang says a store once called the Hillside Pharmacy is now a restaurant called Hillside Farmacy. In fact, while the business that was there before was known to local residents as the Hillside pharmacy, its name was Hillside Drugstore. ](SOUNDBITE OF CANCHA VIA CIRCUITO'S \"SUENO EN PARAGUAY - EL BUHO REMIX\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Now we're going to look at what can happen when a city gets really hot economically.

You know, I worked as a receptionist at my cousin's business during high school. Thirty years ago, 70 percent of all teens worked a summer job. Today, less than half of teenagers do. NPR's Jessica Diaz-Hurtado reports on why. JESSICA DIAZ-HURTADO, BYLINE: Sixteen-year-old Matthew Howell from East Palestine, Ohio, hoped to be working this summer. MATTHEW HOWELL: I have applied. I've applied at a McDonald's before. They've never gotten back to me. Tried applying for Dairy Queen. They'd never gotten back to me. DIAZ-HURTADO: He says he's going to keep looking. But his mother, Amy Ward, isn't convinced. As a teen, she babysat and worked in fast food. She blames her son's lack of motivation on today's gadgets and technology. AMY WARD: We didn't have all the mobile devices that they have now. My kids would rather sit on their butts and play video games all day long than go out and get a job. DIAZ-HURTADO: Anthony Carnevale is not so hard on the kids. He's the director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University. ANTHONY CARNEVALE: First of all, they don't have the option of working for a decent wage at a young age. The jobs aren't there, and the wages aren't there. DIAZ-HURTADO: He says summer teen jobs have been declining with every decade, beginning in the '70s, even as real wages have been flat or even falling. At the same time, he says, school, for many kids, has become like a job. More schools operate nearly year-round. CARNEVALE: Young people in America, especially teenagers - we work them harder than we ever did, by a lot. It used to be, back in the '60s and the '70s, the young people had eight to 10 hours a day free time. It's down to two.

DIAZ-HURTADO: She's come to Washington, D. C. , for a pre-college leadership program at American University. That means no job. EVELYN: I just didn't have a lot of time this summer because I did choose to come here for the experience. DIAZ-HURTADO: Carnevale says it's a choice that will probably pay off. He says, compared to someone with a high school education, a college graduate will make about a million dollars more over a lifetime. CARNEVALE: The time you put in the books is really worth a lot more than the time you put in at a job in retail. DIAZ-HURTADO: Some teenagers do see the worth of a summer job, and they're getting creative.

Over the past several years, dozens of city and county governments have raised their base wages to levels far above the federal minimum wage of $7. 25. Some state legislatures are saying, not so fast. They've passed laws limiting what the cities can do. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The last time the federal minimum wage was raised was in 2009. Brooks Rainwater, a senior executive at the National League of Cities, says the municipal measures had popular backing. BROOKS RAINWATER: Seeing as we haven't had a raise in the minimum wage at the federal level, people within cities where the cost of living oftentimes can be higher needed a raise. And city leaders have responded to that. NOGUCHI: Business groups, meanwhile, argue complying with disparate city laws is too complex, and that the additional costs would force them to curtail hiring, which in turn hurts workers. State legislatures where more conservative rural interests tend to wield a lot of power responded, and now 27 states have passed laws pre-empting local laws and setting statewide limits on minimum wages. Missouri's new law takes effect next month, rolling back a $10 an hour minimum wage in the city of St. Louis to the statewide rate of $7. 70. Similar rollbacks occurred this spring in four counties in Iowa that had voted to increase their wages. Rainwater says this trend is undermining local governance. RAINWATER: There used to be a shared value around this concept of local control. You know, whether a conservative or a liberal, the idea that the representative closest to the people would be able to decide many of these fundamental questions. NOGUCHI: He says attorneys representing the cities face an uphill battle. RAINWATER: A big challenge here is cities aren't enumerated within the constitutional powers. And so they are in effect creations of the state. NOGUCHI: Pat White is president of the central labor council for the AFL-CIO in St. Louis. He says minimum wage workers will lose income when the law takes effect August 28, but so will workers higher up on the wage scale who were hoping to see corresponding increases as well. White calls state lawmakers' moves hypocritical given how they chafe against federal control. PAT WHITE: They're always complaining about how the federal government is dipping into what they want to do here in the state, but they're doing the exact same thing with municipalities here from the state level. NOGUCHI: White says it raises questions for him about the point of city government. WHITE: Why have them even run for office if they're not allowed to govern their own area? NOGUCHI: The reason, says Mike Aitken, director of government affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management, is that having a patchwork of laws is highly impractical. MIKE AITKEN: It becomes an administrative headache for sophisticated employers, let alone for a lot of your smaller employers that may be operating within one state. NOGUCHI: Aitken says there are other ordinances around paid and sick leave that make it very difficult for a trucking company, for example, whose employees may operate in many jurisdictions. He argues states are operating well within their rights. AITKEN: Cities are allowed to set their own minimum wage, but so are states then allowed to pre-empt them. NOGUCHI: Cynthia Sanders now commutes into St. Louis city for her janitorial job after moving further out because the cost of living was too high. She says when the Missouri state law takes effect, her wages will fall and she'll have to cut back again. CYNTHIA SANDERS: I'm just scared for everybody 'cause it's a sad, sad situation. And I don't understand how it's legal. NOGUCHI: Sanders says the issue is making a political crusader of her. SANDERS: We're mad enough to really, really fight now. NOGUCHI: As soon as she hangs up with me, she says, she's calling a long list of legislators. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

He argues states are operating well within their rights. AITKEN: Cities are allowed to set their own minimum wage, but so are states then allowed to pre-empt them. NOGUCHI: Cynthia Sanders now commutes into St. Louis city for her janitorial job after moving further out because the cost of living was too high. She says when the Missouri state law takes effect, her wages will fall and she'll have to cut back again. CYNTHIA SANDERS: I'm just scared for everybody 'cause it's a sad, sad situation. And I don't understand how it's legal. NOGUCHI: Sanders says the issue is making a political crusader of her. SANDERS: We're mad enough to really, really fight now. NOGUCHI: As soon as she hangs up with me, she says, she's calling a long list of legislators. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

The major U. S. stock indexes are up near record highs. A number of global indexes are, too. NPR's John Ydstie is here to talk with us about what's lifting the market. Hey there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So in the months after Donald Trump was elected president, the market actually rose, and everyone called it the Trump rally. YDSTIE: Right. CORNISH: But there's been a lot of turmoil in Washington since he took office. So it's what we're seeing in the stock market connected to the president? YDSTIE: Well, since the election, S&P 500 is up 16 percent, and the Dow is up 18 percent even though President Trump has yet to deliver on most of his pro-growth policies. On the other hand, the Congress and the White House have eased regulations and created a more business-friendly regulatory environment, and that's helped stocks. Also there's still the possibility of tax relief. And a failure of the health care bill could actually clear the way for action on taxes later this summer. That's helping drive stocks higher. But there's enough skepticism that I would say it's not solely a Trump rally anymore. CORNISH: Well, if they don't think it's a Trump rally, then what else could be pushing stocks to these levels? YDSTIE: Well, one big reason is that the global economy is growing faster. That combined with the recent decline in the value of the dollar has sparked more demand for U. S. goods abroad. That's helped boost U. S. company profits. And here's a relevant data point. Forty percent of the profits of S&P 500 companies come from foreign sales. So a stronger global economy is boosting U. S. stock prices. CORNISH: What about here in the U. S. though? I mean growth here is still sluggish for many people far below the Trump administration's goal. YDSTIE: True. But the U. S. economy does continue to chug along. And there's still solid job creation. And another thing that's helped stocks is that they're very attractive compared to bonds, which investors see as the main alternative. That's because long-term interest rates remain very low. And investors would rather buy stocks than a 10-year bond that gives them an annual return of only 2 and a quarter percent or so. CORNISH: Now, people are talking about a stock market bubble. So how real is that fear? YDSTIE: Yeah, you know, that fear is largely connected to the huge stimulus central banks have injected into the global economy since the financial crisis. The concern is that lots of that money has been invested in stocks and dramatically inflated their value. Central bankers like Janet Yellen have made clear the stimulus will be taken away very gradually. So far that's been enough to reassure investors. However, back to Washington turmoil - if efforts to get a tax cut stall, we're likely to see stocks retreat. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

On Friday, all of them signed a letter to leaders of Congress. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: (Reading) We write to express our strong objection to recent attacks on the integrity and professionalism of the agency and on the agency's role in the legislative process. SIEGEL: That's Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as the director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2003 to 2005. He's a Republican, and he's now head of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute. What's at issue here is how the Congressional Budget Office has scored Republican health care bills, how it estimates how many people would be left uninsured and how much it would cost the government. Doug Holtz-Eakin, why did you and your fellow past CBO directors choose to write this letter now? What worries you? HOLTZ-EAKIN: It's fine, in my view, to disagree with the CBO on the substance of a score, on the research that goes behind how people choose their health insurance policies or the likely pace of medical inflation. It's not OK, in my view, to attack the professionalism, the integrity and the mission of the CBO. And in recent weeks we've seen those kinds of attacks, and we thought it was time to simply say it's unacceptable. SIEGEL: The Congressional Budget Office began in 1975. And President Trump's budget director - he's part of the executive branch of government, Mick Mulvaney - in an interview with the Washington Examiner said the day of the CBO has probably come and gone. What do you say to that? HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the CBO exists because the Office of Management and Budget had a monopoly on budgetary information and the Congress didn't like it. And so far from the day having come and gone, the CBO has a great future. SIEGEL: The letter that you sent to congressional leaders says this - unfortunately, even nonpartisan and high-quality analysis cannot always generate accurate estimates. What did you have in mind when you wrote that? HOLTZ-EAKIN: The purpose of scoring is to be able to rank the budget cost of different bills. So if you're comparing a House and a Senate bill, you have to know which is going to cost the taxpayer more. And the primary objective is to do those apples-to-apples comparisons. The CBO does try to do the best projection of the cost and have it be as accurate. But the reality is that you're never going to hit the number if only because the laws themselves get changed. And so the most important part of scoring is really not did you get the number right for 2021 - when that year shows up almost certainly it'll be wrong. The question is, did you give every bill a fair hearing and rank it equally? SIEGEL: I've heard two versions of the CBO's scoring of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. One is that the CBO got it so wrong that we shouldn't take its scores of new health care bills all that seriously. The other is that the CBO got something wrong, which was how many employers would stop providing insurance at work and how many people therefore would move into the exchanges, but that it got right how many people would still be left uninsured. Who's more right in that discussion? HOLTZ-EAKIN: I actually think of it very differently. The CBO was asked to score a bill, but which Affordable Care Act did we actually get, that bill or the one after healthcare. gov melted down and gave that the worst brand in history, or after the Obama administration decided not to enforce the employer mandate for a couple of years? The law that's passed is not the law we saw. There was no way the CBO could, quote, \"get it right. \"SIEGEL: Of course, one can say in that case a big law, once it's in effect for a few years, is invariably going to be different from the bill that was presented in Congress. Does that go to the question of the effectiveness of CBO scoring? HOLTZ-EAKIN: No, because the question is, when that big law was being considered, how did it look compared to other proposals for a big law? If you're going to change laws after the fact, you're never going to get the forecast right. But you should be able to get them ranked right so that Congress can pick the one they like the best at the moment. SIEGEL: When you became director of the Congressional Budget Office, there were doubts raised. You know, would Doug Holtz-Eakin be a supply side partisan who wouldn't call it straight? People generally agreed after you'd been in that job for a while that they were wrong, that this is an office that's remained reasonably nonpartisan. Is that in danger right now in the current mood in Washington? HOLTZ-EAKIN: It was one of the reasons I was interested in signing the letter. I was the first Congressional Budget Office director to go directly from the White House to the CBO. And there were frankly legitimate concerns on the part of Democrats about whether I was a partisan hack or whether I was there to do the job correctly. I always felt I could do the job correctly. And I think that proved that even in a town where people have their political beliefs you should respect the quality, the professionalism and the integrity of a nonpartisan CBO. And to see people question that again really troubled me. SIEGEL: Former director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Thanks for talking with us. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.

What's not happening is inflation. You would expect a little bit more than there is given that there have been low interest rates for years, and there's a bit of economic growth. This is of interest to David Wessel, who is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal and a regular guest here. Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK, so it's not that there's no inflation, right? WESSEL: Right. Basically, the Fed's favorite inflation measure shows that prices of all sorts have risen by only 1. 4 percent over the past year. That's shy of their 2 percent target. And they've been shy of that target for much of the past decade. Now, a few months ago, as unemployment came down, inflation seemed to be creeping up. But lately, it's been a surprise. We have unemployment at a 16-year low. And the inflation rate has actually been coming down, not up. So that's both a surprise, and it's become a worry at the Federal Reserve. INSKEEP: Why worry? Isn't low inflation good? WESSEL: Well, look, first of all, you have to remember that every price you pay is someone else's income. So what the Fed is talking about is not just getting the prices you pay up but getting incomes and wages up more rapidly. But secondly, there's some economic problems with too little inflation. One of them is this. When there's very little expected inflation, interest rates are very low - the ones in the markets. And when interest rates are very low, the Fed doesn't have much maneuvering room. If a recession hits, and it wants to cut interest rates to give the economy a boost, they don't really have much cushion to get the economy going again if we hit hard times. INSKEEP: Why would the Fed raise interest rates, which is something you do to fight inflation, if there's hardly any inflation? WESSEL: Great question. Look, many - not all, but many Fed officials figured that the last few months are an aberration. With unemployment so low and the economy doing better, there's just some temporary factors that are distorting the numbers. And so they basically say inflation is around the corner. Here's how Janet Yellen explained it in a recent congressional hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: I do believe that part of the weakness is (ph) - inflation represents transitory factors, but we'll recognize inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective, that there could be more going on there. INSKEEP: OK, what's the theory that there could be more going on there? WESSEL: Well, one possibility is that the economy isn't nearly as close to full employment as the experts say - that there were enough people on the sidelines of the economy, who are now starting to look for work, that employers still don't have to give very many wage increases. Another one is that the economy has kind of changed some way. Maybe it's more competition from Amazon, weaker unions, the impact of globalization - something that just makes it harder to get wages and prices going up. This is a global phenomenon. The European Central Bank has been frustrated that inflation there has been so stubbornly low. And the Bank of Japan has done everything that anybody could ever think of to get inflation up. It's managed to get prices rising at 0. 5 percent a year. And it now says it doesn't expect to meet its 2 percent target until the year 2020. INSKEEP: Well, David, now, we're getting to a subject that I know has been of great concern to you over the years - wage stagnation. I think what you're telling me is that it's possible that very low inflation, which sounds like a good thing, is just a symptom of stagnant wages continuing, which is a very bad thing. WESSEL: Yes, when we talk about wage stagnation, we usually mean inflation-adjusted wages. But you're right. This is a symptom of an economy that just doesn't seem to have much zip. INSKEEP: David Wessel nearly always has zip when he comes by. He's with the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and The Wall Street Journal. David, thanks. WESSEL: You're welcome.

S. economy shows it is growing a bit faster. It grew at 2. 6 percent annual rate during April, May and June, so says the government. The question is, was it just a normal bounce back from a winter funk? Or was it a breakout toward the 3 percent growth the Trump administration has promised? Here's NPR's John Ydstie. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The stronger growth in the second quarter was more than double the pace posted in January, February and March. Among the big contributors was a pickup in business investment in things like plants and equipment, says Sara Johnson, an economist at IHS Markit. SARA JOHNSON: It reflects a strengthening global economy and more export opportunities as well as sustained growth in the domestic economy. YDSTIE: Those investments will help companies meet growing demand from consumers, which was also evident in today's GDP report. Today's data was a welcome bounce back from dismal first-quarter growth. But Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, says it wasn't much more than that. When you average the growth rates for the first and second quarter, she says, you get an annual rate of just under 2 percent. And that's right where the U. S. economy has been for years. MEGAN GREENE: The U. S. is fundamentally a 2 percent growth economy. And there is very little coming down the line that will shift the U. S. sustainably off of that 2 percent growth figure. YDSTIE: Greene shares the view of many economists that U. S. growth is constrained by a slow-growing workforce and a lack of innovations that make workers more productive, innovations like the microchip or electricity. Of course, the idea that the U. S. is stuck in a 2 percent growth world is at odds with the Trump administration's view. It claims that it can boost long-term growth to 3 percent a year or more. Here's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin testifying on Capitol Hill in May.

YDSTIE: IHS Markit's Sara Johnson says the administration might get a short burst from tax overhaul, but not long-term growth at 3 percent. Megan Greene agrees. GREENE: We may get some short-term sugar hits to the U. S. economy. We might have some quarters of 3 percent GDP growth. But I don't think it will be sustained. YDSTIE: So the U. S. is largely stuck in a 2 percent growth world, according to Greene. That's largely where we've been since the end of the Great Recession. And for millions of people, it's been a devastating time with no job or a low-paying job and little hope for the future. But Greene says compared to major competitors like Japan and Europe, U. S. growth actually looks good. GREENE: Two percent isn't bad. I think that we're just looking at the wrong thing. YDSTIE: Greene says GDP has been the gold standard for measuring our economic well-being. But a big part of the U. S. problem, she says, is the way GDP growth is distributed. GREENE: It's not necessarily that we're just not growing enough. It's that a lot of people aren't feeling the benefits of our growth. YDSTIE: Greene says it's time for the U.

S. has seen in years? His administration began with slow growth. Today we got another number for the second quarter and it was much better - a 2. 6 percent annual growth rate during April, May and June. Joining us now to talk about this is NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie. Hey, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So the administration has promised to move the economy to a 3 percent growth rate, which would be pretty aggressive growth. Is this a step in that direction? YDSTIE: You know, I don't think we can say that because the number we got, 2. 6 percent, was slightly below expectations. And growth for the first quarter was revised downward to 1. 2 percent. If you average the two, you're right at a 2 percent growth rate that you - we had during the Obama years. So far I think you'd have to say the economy is still on that long-term trend, one that's been disappointing for a lot of people who feel stuck. MARTIN: But the second quarter growth doubled the growth rate in the first quarter. Isn't that a good sign? YDSTIE: Well, what happened in the second quarter is people came out to shop, construction picked up after the ice and snow left, which is normally what happens. That's certainly been the pattern since the Great Recession, a very slow start to the year and then a bounce back in the spring. A couple of signs that there may be some momentum building are that consumer spending picked up nicely and business investment, which has been very weak, picked up as well. MARTIN: What about the president's promises to get tax reform done, to cut taxes and to boost infrastructure spending? Could that get us to 3 percent? YDSTIE: You know, a lot of economists don't think so. And if you look at the trouble the Republicans are having legislating, it's hard to bet on a tax cut the size of the one the president campaigned on. And there's not even much talk about an infrastructure program these days. If Trump got those, a lot of economists think it might add a few tenths of a percent to growth for a time, but not move the needle up to 3 percent for a long period, and certainly not the 4 percent that the president promised during the campaign. I think that the consensus is the economy remains on this 2-percent growth path that's - we've averaged since the Great Recession ended. MARTIN: For millions of Americans, that's just - that's too slow, right? I mean, people's wages haven't been growing. They've been stagnant for so long. YDSTIE: Yeah. For lots of Americans, the economy hasn't provided what they need to get by, much less to get ahead. But lots of economists say that's - for a variety of reasons that's really the economy's potential. For instance, we're not seeing game-changing innovation like jet travel or microchip development these days that would make us more productive and richer. And there's still a hangover from the Great Recession, consumers and businesses still being very cautious. Although there are some signs in this report that that might be changing a bit.

Tomorrow's monthly jobs report could provide some encouragement. Many economists are expecting it will show another drop in the unemployment rate. Now, that should boost wage growth, but as NPR's John Ydstie reports, that's far from certain in the current economy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The U. S. economic recovery has gone on for eight years now. The unemployment rate is at 4. 4 percent. That's very low. And there are near record numbers of job openings. Normally that scenario would have employers boosting wages to attract workers, but wage gains have been very sluggish. That's got economists scratching their heads. Andrew Chamberlain is chief economist at Glassdoor, an online employment information and recruiting service. He says though the unemployment rate is near a 16-year low, his company's data indicates that wage growth is slowing. ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN: Very sluggish growth, the slowest pace we've recorded in about three years. And it's the sixth straight month that that pay growth has declined. YDSTIE: The Labor Department's numbers also show yearly wage growth slowing to just 2-and-a-half percent in recent months. Chamberlain says at this stage in an economic recovery, it should be 3-and-a-half percent. There are a number of theories about why that hasn't happened. Chamberlain says one important factor is that a tide of young, inexperienced workers is entering the labor force. CHAMBERLAIN: Younger workers who are coming into the workforce that are replacing baby boomers who are leaving near their peak earning years. YDSTIE: Those young workers are paid much less, and they're dragging down the average earnings growth for the nation as a whole. Chamberlain says there's another factor in the disconnect. The low unemployment rate doesn't count a large number of working-age people who are currently on the sidelines. These are people between the ages 25 to 54, the prime working years, who aren't employed and aren't looking for a job. But Chamberlain says many would go to work if the conditions were right. CHAMBERLAIN: Sometimes these are stay-at-home parents. Sometimes these are people with an injury that has kept them out of the labor force. But for the right price, the right offer, it would pull them back in. YDSTIE: About 22 percent of this prime age group remain on the sidelines of the U. S. labor force. That number was lower before the Great Recession, and Chamberlain says a good-paying job is the best way to lure them back. CHAMBERLAIN: People who are out of the labor force are weighing the tradeoff between - you know, is it worth it? When I factor in all taxes and benefits, is it worth it for me to pay for daycare, to go take a full time job or not? Wage growth definitely pulls people back in - no question. YDSTIE: Economist Dean Baker of the Center for Policy Research says he often sees stories in the newspaper with employers complaining that they can't find enough workers. DEAN BAKER: Well, you know, I'd look at and go, well, have you tried raising wages? YDSTIE: Chamberlain says these people on the sidelines have been slowly returning to the workforce as wages have slowly risen. But he says at the current pace, it will take six months or more to get their participation back to levels seen before the Great Recession. Baker says there's a danger that Federal Reserve interest rate hikes could slow this process of bringing people back into the workforce. Fortunately, he says, it looks like the Fed has put off further rate hikes at least for the time being. BAKER: That will allow the economy more room to grow, the labor market to tighten further. That will presumably mean more wage growth. YDSTIE: There are other reasons wages aren't rising, says Baker. A decline in unionization and slow productivity growth are among them. Both of those require longer-term solutions. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Many Americans have been waiting years for a solid pay raise.

This came in the government's jobs report for July. It shows 209,000 jobs were added to the U. S. economy as the unemployment rate touched a 16-year low. NPR's John Ydstie has more. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: July job growth exceeded expectations, and the past two months have been well above the monthly average of around 180,000 jobs during the past year. John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, says he's impressed with the U. S. economy's staying power. JOHN SILVIA: I am very surprised that it's been as steady as it has with so little major crises. YDSTIE: In fact, July was the 82nd consecutive month of job gains for the U. S. economy, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4. 3 percent. But economist Beth Ann Bovino of S&P Global says that very low unemployment rate does not count a lot of potential workers still on the sidelines who are currently not in the workforce. BETH ANN BOVINO: The labor participation rate is so low. People are out of the market. We still have a 38-year low, which is not a positive. YDSTIE: Actually, the silver lining in that statistic is that there are still potential workers on the sidelines who might be coaxed back into the labor force and help the economy keep growing. And they might be able to find a job in the record number of job openings in the U. S. economy. But Bovino says matching jobs with potential workers can be difficult. BOVINO: Businesses are saying, well, we can't find the workers. But yet workers are struggling to get the jobs that they want. YDSTIE: Employers complain workers don't have the right skills, but workers on the sidelines may be reluctant to return to take a job unless they can get wages that make it worth their while. John Silvia says he did see some positive signs on this issue in the July numbers. SILVIA: So if you look at the labor force participation rates for folks with less than high school or high school degrees, you see that those participation rates are picking up. And so that is a signal that you're bringing in more marginal workers into the labor force. YDSTIE: Sylvia says getting these less-educated workers back into the workforce is evidence the gains in the economy are broadening out. But, he says, these workers are generally coming in at low wages, so they may be suppressing the average wage gains included in the employment report. SILVIA: They're getting jobs but at a lower wage. And that's lowering the average earnings numbers. YDSTIE: And today's report showed the average hourly earnings rising just 2 and a half percent over the past year. Economists say at this point in an economic recovery, that number should be closer to 3 and a half percent. But there was a glimmer of hope on that front in today's report, too. Average hourly earnings rose three-tenths of a percent last month. If that continued, earnings growth would get to more normal levels over the next year. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

U. S. job growth beat expectations in July. That's according to the government's monthly employment report. The unemployment rate also returned to a 16-year low. NPR's John Ydstie joins us to talk about all of this. Hey, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: A better-than-expected report - what's it tell us about the economy? YDSTIE: Well, I think it tells us the economy continues to grow at a solid, if not spectacular, pace. And it may be strengthening a bit. The economy added 209,000 jobs in July. That's about 25,000 more than the average for this year. A lot of people have thought job growth would tail off as this economic recovery, which is now eight years old, gets more mature. And we get low unemployment, which makes the labor market tighter. MARTIN: So the unemployment rate - we say it's returning to a 16-year low because we also touched that mark back in May. YDSTIE: Right. MARTIN: Now we're back there again. We're at a 4. 3 unemployment rate. How significant is it? YDSTIE: You know, it's an important milestone. It would seem to suggest that the country is running out of workers, which could end up being a barrier to faster growth. But it's not clear the unemployment rate is capturing all the people in the economy who might work if offered the right job at good wages. There are still a lot of people in prime working age group between 25 and 54 years of age who are on the sidelines, not actively looking for work. So they're not counted as unemployed. But as wages have inched up, more of them are being enticed to come back into the workforce and take jobs. There's some evidence of that happening in this report because it shows the U. S. workforce grew by almost 350,000 in July. MARTIN: So you mentioned wages are inching up. Is that right? Because they've been so stagnant for so long. YDSTIE: Yes. Hourly wages in this report rose three-tenths of a percent - doesn't sound like much. But it's better than in recent months. And if that number were repeated for a year, we'd be up where we should be at this point in a recovery. So we'll have to see. Of course, everyone doesn't get the average wage increase. There's a great deal of variation in wages. If you're in Boston, Seattle or San Francisco, you're probably getting more than that average wage increase. If you're in Houston or Atlanta, you could be getting less. And, of course, it depends on what kind of work you do. If you're in health care tech, you're probably seeing big wage gains. If you're a retail buyer, not so much. MARTIN: And just briefly, any particular industry doing exceptionally well here? YDSTIE: Leisure, hospitality, health care. No industry had significant losses last month. MARTIN: All right. NPR's John Ydstie, thank you so much. YDSTIE: You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  There are new jobs numbers out today. U.

Now some states are passing laws to help capture that diversity and requiring state agencies to collect more detailed data about Asian-Americans. But those policies are facing protests. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports on a controversy brewing in Massachusetts. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Democratic state Representative Tackey Chan says he didn't expect a backlash over his bill about data collection. TACKEY CHAN: Yeah, I was - have to be honest with you, I was rather surprised by that. WANG: If his bill is passed, state agencies in Massachusetts would be required to identify Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in surveys about health, schools and employment, for example. And that data would have to be broken down by ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Indian and Vietnamese. CHAN: We are a data-driven society. It's hard to make public policy without data. And if you don't have data, you can't advocate. WANG: Chan says there's little to no information at the state or local level about the country's fastest growing racial group. States including California, Minnesota and Rhode Island have recently passed similar laws. Lawmakers say more data can help pinpoint needs that can be hard to see. But some demonstrators disagree. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) Stop the racist bill. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Stop the racist bill. WANG: About 60 protesters waved picket signs and American flags recently on the steps of the Massachusetts State House in Boston. Andy Liu, a computer engineer from Sharon, Mass. , helped organize the protest. ANDY LIU: The fear is, you know, how you can guarantee the demographic data collected will not be abused or will not be misused for other purposes. WANG: Almost all of the demonstrators were immigrants from China, including Linglan Zhang of Lexington, Mass. LINGLAN ZHANG: (Speaking in Mandarin). WANG: \"This is obviously discrimination against Asian-Americans,\" Zhang said in Mandarin. She questioned why Massachusetts' bill calls for detailed data only for Asian-Americans and not for other racial groups. Protesters in other states have also raised that concern, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan. He's a political scientist at the University of California, Riverside, who's been following the activism against the data collection laws. And he says this debate shows the divide between a new generation of Chinese immigrants and more established Asian-American groups who've been calling for more data for years. KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN: These mainstream Asian-American organizations are nearly completely absent from the spaces where a large and growing number of Chinese immigrants are active. WANG: Ramakrishnan is a longtime advocate for more Asian-American data. And he says a main issue driving this fight over data collection is affirmative action. He says many of the immigrants from mainland China, who are protesting, are worried about their children's schooling. RAMAKRISHNAN: The belief is that by killing any kind of data collection on race, these Chinese-Americans might have a fair shot getting into Ivy League schools. That's the theory. WEN ZHAO: They use those data in education, in college admissions and even in workforce. That's not fair. WANG: Wen Zhao of Westford, Mass. , says she's concerned that separating data by ethnic groups would further divide Asian-Americans. But for service providers, like Anh Vu Sawyer of the Southeast Asian Coalition in Worcester, Mass. , more data could mean more help. ANH VU SAWYER: I have to have data to let them know there's a need right here. WANG: Sawyer says many of the grant-makers that could fund services to immigrants from Vietnam, Burma and other countries, they need data. Still, Sawyer, who was a refugee who escaped the Vietnam War, says she understands the privacy concerns in a political climate that doesn't seem to welcome immigrants. SAWYER: This is a very interesting time because after 40 years in this country, I thought I'd never have to deal with fear again.

And this week, the U. S. economy seemed to have some. There was a new stock market milestone and a positive jobs report. President Trump quickly took to Twitter to brag the stock market is at an all-time high and that the mainstream media rarely mentions that. Well, we're mentioning it right now. NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben joins us. Danielle, thanks so much for being with us. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Of course. SIMON: So this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 22,000, an all-time high for the stock index. We've mentioned it again. And President Trump tweeted that doesn't just happen. Is he right? I mean, after six months in office, can the administration take credit for this? KURTZLEBEN: Maybe in part but certainly not for all of it. I mean, look. You can see how investor might be inspired by the Trump administration, right? He is seen as business-friendly, as is the Republican Congress. They're talking about cutting corporate taxes. They're talking about cutting regulations. So that might make investors more bullish. But you have so many other factors that weigh on the markets. For example, low interest rates. That might be sending stocks higher. Job creation is steady, like we were saying. And the global economy is doing OK. And one other thing to emphasize here, Donald Trump does have a lot of economic policies he wants to pass. You know, he's talked about infrastructure. They've talked about overhauling the tax code. Those things haven't happened yet. SIMON: Who seems to benefit from the stock market climb right now? KURTZLEBEN: Definitely rich people, I mean, is the short answer. You know, according to data from 2013 - and I find this astounding - the top 10 percent of households in terms of wealth owned 80 percent of the stocks in America. That's a huge discrepancy. And still others, you know, are invested via retirement accounts. So you have some of the middle class that is benefiting, but you have all of those other people that own no stock. They might see some indirect effects. You know, a climbing stock market might boost economic confidence, which might boost spending, which might boost the economy. But the bottom line is that a lot of Americans just won't see benefits from this. You know, the way that Americans interact with the economy is through their paychecks. And the latest jobs report showed that unlike the stock market, wages really aren't climbing that quickly. SIMON: There was a solid jobs report, as we note, along with this new stock market high. And I guess it's the longest sustained period of job growth that's on record. That must indicate a healthy economy? KURTZLEBEN: Yes, absolutely. And, you know, the Trump administration understandably, you know, touts these numbers. But then again, presidents always take credit for economic numbers. President Obama did this. But presidents don't have a whole lot of control over the economy. So presidents do brag about this, not necessarily their doing. But more importantly, these numbers require context. Yes, we have a long period of job growth. But in part, think about the deep hole that the recession put us in. It was bound to be a long slog out of that. And the question now is, how long can that job growth last? At some point, all of those jobs created have to push wages up. That just isn't happening yet. SIMON: And one of the reasons is organizations follow stock prices is the idea that a healthy stock market indicates that companies are making money and they'll hire more people. But in this new high-tech economy, is that still the case? KURTZLEBEN: I mean, there is evidence that companies invest more when stock prices go up. But yeah, like you said, it's not necessarily on hiring. They might spend on equipment, factories, technology. And some of that could mean fewer jobs. You know, some of that technology makes things more efficient. The bottom line is it's not an easy cause and effect. In the recovery from the recession, stocks went up, jobs didn't go up nearly as quickly. And sometimes, a company's stock price goes up after it lays people off. Investors say, oh, you're saving money. You're cutting spending. Good for you. In other words, it's not very simple. The stock market is a broad economic indicator, but it is not at all nuanced.

S. economy. After nearly seven months in office, Trump says the economy is surging. And there are signs of improvement in the stock market and the unemployment rate. But by other metrics, progress is pretty slow. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Throughout his campaign, candidate Trump painted a gloomy picture of the economy. Here he was in a debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look. Our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. ZARROLI: At the time, the unemployment rate had been falling for years, dipping below 5 percent in early 2016. But Trump said the Labor Department numbers were fake. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: These are phony numbers put up by politicians to make them look good. When you hear 5 percent, then 4. 9 percent, it's not the right number. ZARROLI: The real unemployment rate, Trump said, was much higher than the government claimed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The number isn't reflective. I've seen numbers of 24 percent. I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment - 42 percent. ZARROLI: Trump noted that the unemployment rate only includes people searching for work. It doesn't include all those people who've grown discouraged and quit looking. That's a point made by a lot of people, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, though few of them think the real unemployment rate is as high as 42 percent. These days, however, Trump seems to like the Labor Department's numbers a lot more than he used to. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We continue to see incredible results. ZARROLI: In his weekly address on Saturday, the president boasted that the unemployment rate in July fell to 4. 3 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we're putting America workers and families first. ZARROLI: Seven months into an administration is probably too soon to judge whether a president's economic policies are working, especially for a White House that has struggled to get its agenda off the ground. But so far, at least, Trump's claims of a resurgent U. S. economy don't really square with the data. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin says for better or worse, not all that much has changed since last year. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: By and large, we have the same strengths. We continue to see the unemployment rate fall. We continue to see jobs created. We continue to have the same weaknesses. We don't see wages rising rapidly enough to greatly raise the standard of living. ZARROLI: For instance, during his address in West Virginia last week, Trump cited the increase in the growth rate during the second quarter of this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Economic growth has surged to 2. 6 percent nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. ZARROLI: In fact, a 2. 6 percent increase in growth is only a little higher than it was in the second quarter of 2016, and it's equal to the annual growth rate of 2015. Holtz-Eakin, who served as an economist under both Bushes, says some positive things are happening. The stock market is rising faster than it did. Surveys suggest consumers are more optimistic. But, he adds. . . HOLTZ-EAKIN: To my eye, that's one thing. The second thing is, do they spend more money because they're confident? And the spending really hasn't changed very much. It's going on at about the same pace it did last year. ZARROLI: Holtz-Eakin says it's the same in the business sector. Businesses say they're more confident about growth. But so far, at least, they're not putting their money where their mouth is by investing more. If that happens, Trump's claims about the economy will be more credible. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

That's a point made by a lot of people, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, though few of them think the real unemployment rate is as high as 42 percent. These days, however, Trump seems to like the Labor Department's numbers a lot more than he used to. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We continue to see incredible results. ZARROLI: In his weekly address on Saturday, the president boasted that the unemployment rate in July fell to 4. 3 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we're putting America workers and families first. ZARROLI: Seven months into an administration is probably too soon to judge whether a president's economic policies are working, especially for a White House that has struggled to get its agenda off the ground. But so far, at least, Trump's claims of a resurgent U. S. economy don't really square with the data. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin says for better or worse, not all that much has changed since last year. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: By and large, we have the same strengths. We continue to see the unemployment rate fall. We continue to see jobs created. We continue to have the same weaknesses. We don't see wages rising rapidly enough to greatly raise the standard of living. ZARROLI: For instance, during his address in West Virginia last week, Trump cited the increase in the growth rate during the second quarter of this year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Economic growth has surged to 2. 6 percent nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. ZARROLI: In fact, a 2. 6 percent increase in growth is only a little higher than it was in the second quarter of 2016, and it's equal to the annual growth rate of 2015. Holtz-Eakin, who served as an economist under both Bushes, says some positive things are happening. The stock market is rising faster than it did. Surveys suggest consumers are more optimistic. But, he adds. . . HOLTZ-EAKIN: To my eye, that's one thing. The second thing is, do they spend more money because they're confident? And the spending really hasn't changed very much. It's going on at about the same pace it did last year. ZARROLI: Holtz-Eakin says it's the same in the business sector. Businesses say they're more confident about growth. But so far, at least, they're not putting their money where their mouth is by investing more. If that happens, Trump's claims about the economy will be more credible. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning. CHANG: David, there were many tremors that led up to the financial earthquake. But what is so significant about the one on August 9, 2007? WESSEL: On August 9, 2007, a French bank, BNP Paribas, surprised everyone. This bank had taken money from investors and invested that money in subprime mortgages. BNP Paribas told their investors, you cannot take your money out because we have no idea what a subprime mortgage is worth anymore. This was the moment that the subprime housing crisis in the U. S. crossed over into the global banking system. I mean, think about it. Some bank in Paris is discovering that they have a whole lot of mortgages from Detroit or Las Vegas, and they're so bad, they can't even put a price on them. CHANG: Many Americans would eventually suffer devastating financial losses. Have we made up this lost ground? Are we whole again? WESSEL: You can never undo the damage that was done to millions of people. But if you step back and look at it, yes, the U. S. economy has finally recovered. Housing prices in general across the country have returned to the levels that they were at at 2006 when housing prices peaked, but that's not true everywhere. Chicago, Las Vegas, Arizona, Florida - their housing prices are still lower than they were. And I find this really shocking. Today nearly 1 in every 10 people with a mortgage owes more money to the bank than their house is worth. CHANG: You mean they're still underwater. WESSEL: They are still underwater 10 years after the start of the crisis. So what does it mean for those people? They can't refinance their mortgage to take advantage of lower interest rates. They probably can't move to get a job somewhere else. And they are less likely to buy cars or go out to the movies and stuff because they have this big burden, knowing that they have no equity in their homes. CHANG: But more broadly speaking, what about banks? Banks are often called the arteries of the economy. Are they healthy now? Could they withstand another shock like the one we saw? WESSEL: The banks are definitely stronger. They've been forced by the regulators and Congress and international financial regulatory institutions to build bigger capital cushions and to rely less on borrowed money. We force banks to run themselves more conservatively. They're not supposed to bet their own money alongside the customers'. CHANG: But about those regulations you just mentioned, there's been a lot of criticism that those regulations put in place went too far, that they have strangled the economy, that they are preventing banks from lending freely. Do you agree with those criticisms? WESSEL: It is certainly true that we created a patchwork of regulations. We didn't streamline the regulatory agencies. I think banks have a point when they say, we're getting shot at from every direction. But the evidence is that these new rules are not restraining credit across the economy. I don't think they are strangling the economy. We have told the banks, you can't do what you were doing before the crisis, and that has made the financial system less vulnerable and more resilient. But Congress is now revisiting some of the rules. And the Trump-appointed regulators are doing the same. So I think there's a chance that things were put in place to reduce the chances of another financial crisis or deal with one when it occurs will be undone. And that could leave us vulnerable to another shock. CHANG: That's David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Thanks so much for talking with us.

S. companies lose as much as $300 billion a year to China because of the theft of intellectual property. Today President Trump formally asked the U. S. trade representative to look into the problem, and NPR's Jim Zarroli reports that investigation could eventually lead to trade sanctions against China. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: President Trump said intellectual property theft costs the United States millions of jobs each year. That includes the forced transfer of valuable technology from U. S. companies as a condition of access to China's markets. Trump said, for too long, wealth has been drained from our country while Washington turned a blind eye. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will safeguard the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that is so vital to our security and to our prosperity. ZARROLI: The steps announced by the White House today are very preliminary. U. S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer will essentially look into the issue, and depending on what he finds, the administration could initiate what's called a Section 301 investigation, a rarely used mechanism from the 1974 Trade Act. That would eventually allow the U. S. government to impose tariffs on China, and it could do so unilaterally without having to go through the World Trade Organization. Matt Gold is a former deputy assistant U. S. trade representative. MATT GOLD: It saves time. The WTO case - it would take a few years for us to bring it to a WTO panel, get a decision. Then it will get appealed to the WTO appellate body. Then we get another decision. ZARROLI: The president's move was applauded by technology groups who have long complained about IP theft. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation issued a statement saying, for too long, China has flouted the spirit, if not always the letter, of its commitments under the WTO and other agreements. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said launching the investigation sends a strong signal to China that it will be held accountable if it doesn't work with the U. S. to level the playing field. But he said the Trump administration needs to go further to address the dumping of products such as steel. SHERROD BROWN: We need to follow through with meaningful action. And that means the president needs to get serious about trade enforcement, especially on steel. ZARROLI: But there are risks to what the White House is embarking on. Trade disputes are typically arbitrated by the WTO, and acting unilaterally could backfire. Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says U. S. companies that try to do business with China could get hurt in several ways. CAROLINE FREUND: One, China is likely to retaliate with tariffs of their own on U. S. goods, and then U. S. companies will be further hurt in China. It won't lead to anything positive. ZARROLI: But Freund also points out that for all of Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail, the White House has so far been slow to take action against unfair trade practices. Trump backed off of labeling China a currency manipulator, for instance, and a long-promised report on steel dumping has been delayed. FREUND: The administration embarks on something. They think it's going to be simple. Let's just impose tariffs on steel. But then it turns out to be a lot more complicated because of the way the economy is so intertwined. ZARROLI: It's one thing to talk about steel tariffs, for example, Freund says, but imposing them hurts other U. S. manufacturers such as automakers and appliance companies. President Trump has asked for an investigation into intellectual property theft, but any action to stop it still seems a long way off. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: During the campaign, Donald Trump clearly tapped into frustration about workers who had lost jobs in manufacturing. And one of the central villains responsible for stealing those American jobs was NAFTA. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: NAFTA was the worst deal ever made in the history of the world. It was a one-way highway out of the United States. ARNOLD: Upon taking office, President Trump followed through on his pledge to scuttle another trade deal - the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. But by April of this year, it was becoming clear that NAFTA would be different. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Well, I was going to terminate NAFTA as of two or three days from now. The president of Mexico, who I have a very, very good relationship, called me. And also the prime minister of Canada, who I have a very good relationship - and I like both of these gentlemen very much - they called me. And they said, rather than terminating NAFTA, could you please renegotiate? ARNOLD: There are also a lot of U. S. manufacturing and agricultural companies, and businesses of all kinds, really, who do not want the president to throw out NAFTA. Analysts say most U. S. industries support NAFTA because the deal has actually increased U. S. exports to Canada and Mexico. And it appears that the administration is hearing that message. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I decided rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate. ARNOLD: OK, so if we're not throwing out NAFTA, what's on the table as far as changes to it? JAIME REUSCHE: We see the changes as departing from a lot of the rhetoric that we saw during the campaign, where now we see them as relatively modest. ARNOLD: Jaime Reusche is a vice president with Moody's who follows Mexico. He says that the U. S. is looking to get tougher enforcement of environmental and labor regulations in Mexico. There will also be an effort to update NAFTA with regard to all the information-age technologies, products and issues that didn't exist when NAFTA was created. Also on the to-do list - it changes to the dispute resolution process between the three countries. But as far as making really big changes to NAFTA, Jaime Reusche says to understand how hard that would be to actually do, just look at that little switch on your car door that makes your window go up and down. He says those switches. . . REUSCHE: They start off as small components in Asia, which are then imported and brought over to the U. S. to Colorado. In Colorado, they make these components into a capacitor. The capacitor then goes over to Mexico. ARNOLD: And he says the components cross back into the U. S. or Canada, back to the U. S. or Mexico again, before finally being part of a finished car. So multiply that by thousands of different products across a slew of industries. The root system that's been laid down is just an immensely complex web of interconnected business relationships across both borders. REUSCHE: Perhaps it's a parallel to the health care issue, where they realize, to actually be able to make significant changes that don't hurt anybody, it becomes very challenging to actually change. ARNOLD: Of course, regardless of what the administration's trade officials have said they want to do so far, you don't have to stretch your imagination too much to think that the president might make news with a tweet or a statement that catches the negotiators on all sides off guard. Caroline Freund is with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. CAROLINE FREUND: Well, I guess the thing about a wild card is it can go in either direction. So on the one hand, if Trump insisted that Mexico pay for the wall as part of the NAFTA negotiations, that would derail the negotiations completely.

TEMPLETON: The owner of the Normandy declined to comment for this story. But Labra and the other tenants did win a small concession. The rent increase was delayed by several months. They still had to move out eventually. Community organizers helped about half the families find new homes in the neighborhood, including Michelle Labra and her kids. DAPHNE LABRA: This is our yard. TEMPLETON: You might be surprised where they ended up - a little house in somebody else's backyard, a cottage - 800 square feet. LABRA: (Through interpreter) When we first came in and I saw this beautiful house, I was really amazed. My kids loved it. We've never had a place that's sort of new like this. TEMPLETON: The Labra's new home is known as an accessory dwelling unit, or an ADU. They're becoming trendy in Portland. ELI SPEVAK: We're coming up to the first accessory dwelling unit that I know of on this street. TEMPLETON: To find out more about ADUs, I took a walk with Eli Spevak. He builds smaller homes, including ADUs. SPEVAK: An accessory dwelling unit is a fully legal, independent structure that has its own front doors, own address and its own kitchen. TEMPLETON: Spevak lives and works in Cully. In true Portland style, there is a flock of chickens right outside his office. (SOUNDBITE OF CHICKENS SQUAWKING)SPEVAK: I'm not the expert on the chickens. TEMPLETON: Cully used to be a place you went to find cheap rent or cheap land. Then its big lots at the edge of the city started attracting urban farmer types. Now Spevak points out expensive new homes going up. SPEVAK: So this is the house that was built as a spec development, and it sold for $720. That was an eye-opening change for this Cully neighborhood, where we realized many new people who want to live here might be able to afford to outbid anybody who lives here already. TEMPLETON: Spevak says Portland's zoning code is contributing to its housing problems. On much of the city's land, it limits how many units you can build on a lot. So developers build the biggest house possible to turn the most profit. ADUs help sprinkle some smaller, lower-rent housing into single-family neighborhoods. SPEVAK: They allow neighborhood to have people at a wide range of incomes living with each other. TEMPLETON: Portland has some of the most permissive zoning for ADUs in the country. Almost any homeowner is allowed to add one. And the city has encouraged property owners to build them by exempting them from certain fees and parking requirements. That's led to a backyard construction boom in Portland. Last year, the city issued building permits for about one ADU a day. SPEVAK: And the numbers seem to be climbing, still. TEMPLETON: It's catching on in other places, too. Seattle, Austin, Washington, D. C. , and San Francisco all recently made it easier to add a second unit, or granny flat. DAPHNE: Look. This is my mom and dad bedroom. TEMPLETON: Oh, it's really nice. Back with the Labra family, the kids are settling in to their cottage. 5-year-old Daphne likes showing visitors around. There's a queen bed that her brother Jose likes to jump on. JOSE LABRA: I'm going to do it right now. You do a flip in the air. TEMPLETON: The rent here is still a stretch - $900 a month - more than half what the family earns. But Michelle Labra says it's worth it because her kids get to stay right here in Cully, and they didn't have to leave their school. In a backyard in Portland, I'm Amelia Templeton for the NPR Cities Project. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   And now, how one family found a way to stay in their neighborhood, even after their rent doubled. They moved into someone's backyard. This is the latest from the NPR Cities Project. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I was a part of the community. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: You need to move out. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fix up these properties. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: A wide range of incomes living with each other. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: I may not afford the rent. GREENE: Portland, Ore. , is ranked the fastest-gentrifying American city by Governing magazine. But the city is working on ways to keep at least some housing affordable. Amelia Templeton of Oregon Public Broadcasting reports on one solution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: No more landlord greed, housing for human need. AMELIA TEMPLETON, BYLINE: This was back in February outside an apartment complex in Portland - hundreds of people protesting a rent increase. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Cheering). TEMPLETON: The Normandy was an aging complex of two-story yellow buildings with siding coming loose in places. It's on the main drag in Cully, a neighborhood of mobile home parks and ranch houses. About 20 families, most of them Hispanic, lived in the complex, including Michelle Labra's family. MICHELLE LABRA: (Through interpreter) We are me, my husband and two kids - my son, who's 8 years old and my daughter, who's 5. TEMPLETON: The new owner sent Labra a notice doubling her rent from around $620 a month to more than $1,300. Talking about it brings her to tears.

S. illegally are doing some of the most dangerous jobs. They face high rates of injury and death. States such as Florida give undocumented immigrants the right to workers' compensation when they're injured on the job. But an NPR and ProPublica investigation found dozens of cases of undocumented workers being arrested, prosecuted and even deported. NPR's Howard Berkes reports. HOWARD BERKES, BYLINE: In a cramped kitchen in Fellsmere, Fla. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MIXER WHIRRING)BERKES: . . . Thirty-two-year-old Yuliana Rocha uses a mixer churn waffle batter in a bowl. She was doing something similar seven years ago, preparing breakfast for her little boy, who was 4 then and watching cartoons. YULIANA ROCHA: (Through interpreter) All of a sudden, I hear a knock at the door, and I got scared because they were officers. One officer pushed me, and two or three officers entered. They came in the house and checked the rooms, the kitchen, everything. I just stood there, saying, what is happening? Why are you searching my house? BERKES: The agents included a state insurance detective. Rocha tried to comfort her son. ROCHA: (Through interpreter) He saw everything, and he was crying. He was saying to me, Mommy, why are there police in the house, Mommy? And he just hugged me and cried. I asked the officer, why are you arresting me? And he told me that it was because I asked for workers' compensation. BERKES: Eight months before, Rocha slipped and banged her knee hard on a bathtub while working at a locally owned Comfort Suites in Vero Beach. She suffered contusions and pain so bad she couldn't walk or stand. But instead of getting ongoing workers' compensation benefits, Rocha was charged with felony workers' comp fraud even though her injury was legitimate. She was shuffled for months from county to immigration jails, worried about her three children. ROCHA: (Through interpreter) I was away from my children for a year. I didn't see them. I only spoke with them. BERKES: Once she was jailed, according to court documents, the sexual assaults began at home. Rocha's 10-year-old daughter was raped repeatedly by her father, who was convicted and imprisoned for life. Rocha believes the nightmare her daughter endures wouldn't have happened if she'd been home to protect her. ROCHA: (Through interpreter) She's afraid to go out, to speak with people. She always stays glued to my side. She doesn't want to sleep alone in her room. It's hard, and it's sad. But I pray often to God that he give me the strength to be able to move my daughter forward. BERKES: Rocha herself was just 13 when her mother snuck her across the Mexican border. She was 17 when her father gave her an elicit Social Security number. She needed it to get a job in this country like all undocumented immigrants. Eight years later, that number prompted her arrest. It hadn't been checked thoroughly by any employer until she needed workers' compensation. BRIAN CARTER: And it looks good when they allege that these people are trying to defraud the system when they're not defrauding the system. BERKES: Brian Carter is a workers' comp attorney in Pensacola, Fla. CARTER: The question of them being in the country undocumented is a different question. This focus is whether they're entitled to those benefits. And they are by law. BERKES: In Florida and most states, the law and court decisions are consistent. Undocumented workers qualify for workers' compensation benefits. That's fundamental, says David Michaels, a former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration now at George Washington University. DAVID MICHAELS: If you allow a class of workers who can be injured without any repercussions against the employer, then there's no reason for the employer to keep all workers safe. So that employer is likely to hire more undocumented workers and invest little or nothing in safety. The result - even more workers will be injured. BERKES: Still, a growing number of states have considered ending workers' comp for undocumented workers. An investigation by NPR and ProPublica found it's already happening in Florida indirectly. There, undocumented workers face criminal charges and even deportation after legitimate injuries at work. We found 130 cases in state and court records in the last 14 years. And get this. Five-hundred-sixty-five more were charged with workers' comp fraud even though they didn't file workers' comp claims. These cases hinge on a 2003 change in state workers' comp law. It banned the use of illicit Social Security numbers in workers' comp claims or in simply getting jobs. JIMMY BENINCASA: There's two purposes really that this statute serves for the state of Florida. BERKES: Jimmy Benincasa is Yuliana Rocha's immigration attorney. BENINCASA: One is to protect employers' profits by reducing claims and put money back in the pockets of the insurance companies and employers. But the real intent behind what they're doing is to regulate immigration because they don't feel the federal government's doing enough. BERKES: The state agency involved says immigration has nothing to do with its aggressive enforcement. Simon Blank directs Florida's insurance fraud unit. SIMON BLANK: The statute is not meant to go after illegal people. The statute is meant to go against anyone who uses fictitious personal information. And the concern is that there's always somebody that's being impacted by it. BERKES: Blank says the Social Security numbers might be used for identity theft, credit fraud, avoiding liens or hiding assets. And the law requires employers, insurance companies and his agency to respond. BLANK: I think you're looking at it from the immigration point of view. There's quite a lot of other circumstances why people use fake names and IDs and Social Security numbers. It's not always an immigration issue. BERKES: But it mostly is by far. State records analyzed by NPR and ProPublica show nearly 800 cases investigated under this law. Almost all involve undocumented immigrants with Hispanic surnames. Only six cases do not - just six. Even the state agency's annual report says close to a hundred percent of the workers investigated are undocumented. At least a quarter of the injured workers charged were either placed on immigration holds or deported. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)BERKES: In an NPR studio in Washington, our producer reaches a cellphone in a remote mountain town in Honduras with sketchy cell service. NIXON ARIAS: Hello. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Hola, Nixon. ARIAS: Hello. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Spanish)? ARIAS: Si. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Spanish). BERKES: It took 40 minutes to get through, and the signal was faint. But we finally had Nixon Arias on the line. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Spanish). BERKES: For more than a decade, Arias worked in the United States illegally, mostly at the same landscaping company in Pensacola. He was the foreman five years ago when the riding mower he drove hit a hole and jerked him violently. His doctor later recommended an expensive spinal procedure. And six days after that, his employer's workers' comp insurance company suddenly decided to investigate. Arias was eventually arrested, jailed and deported, leaving three sons behind, all American citizens. ARIAS: (Through interpreter) I was arrested around the time that it was supposed to go into surgery. They gave me some light pain killers while I was in jail. I'd asked for stronger ones, but they didn't allow higher dosages. I started to think about dying there. God forgive me. I even tried to take my own life. I felt worthless. BERKES: Court records show that Arias didn't actually put his illicit Social Security number on his workers' comp forms. The employer and insurer did that. This is important because Social Security numbers are not required for workers' comp claims in Florida. In fact, the state provides substitute numbers if asked. Workers can be trapped, says attorney Brian Carter, who represents Nixon Arias. CARTER: If an undocumented worker's entitled to workers' compensation benefits but the only way they get the job is through the use of a false Social Security number and the employer or an insurance company provides that false Social Security number to the doctors for medical treatment, it's automatically set up to capture the individual and the alleged misuse of that number. BERKES: Undocumented workers need Social Security numbers to get jobs, so Carter wonders why some employers don't thoroughly check those numbers before workers' comp claims are filed. That's what we wanted to ask Florida-based John Porreca, whose employee leasing firm and insurance companies turned in Yuliana Rocha and a third of the injured undocumented workers snared by this law according to public records. Porreca declined multiple requests for interviews. His attorney wrote that the companies strictly adhere to state and federal law. And it appears that they do. Bram Gechtman is a Miami workers' comp attorney with cases involving Porreca's companies. BRAM GECHTMAN: We were a bit dumbfounded how a company was able to allow these people that had invalid Social Security numbers work for weeks, months, if not years. But as soon as an injury occurred, they're able to identify that it was then invalid and therefore against the law. It was being used to commit a fraudulent act. BERKES: Public records show that another company, a private investigation firm, reported 75 percent of the injured undocumented workers prosecuted under this law since 2013. Command Investigations has a wall of shame on its website showing booking photos of dozens of these workers, including Nixon Arias. Command's CEO, Steve Cassell, also declined to be interviewed. Simon Blank of the state insurance fraud unit says he's sympathetic with undocumented workers who suffer under his agency's enforcement. BLANK: And I think that any person that has a family, has kids would feel for them, too. You know, the question is still, is this causing more harm than good - I guess is one that should be taken up by the legislature and other bodies. BERKES: Actually, it was Blank's agency that sought this authority according to a state senate report, arguing that undocumented immigrants conspire with unethical lawyers and doctors to bilk the workers' comp system. But neither Blank nor his agency could provide a single example of an actual case. All of this baffles Nixon Arias, who struggled in jail to make sense of his predicament. ARIAS: (Through interpreter) I was always asking, why? What's the reason I'm here? I haven't stolen anything. I haven't killed anyone. I haven't done anything. BERKES: Arias hasn't seen his sons in two years. He still suffers pain and needs surgery. Yuliana Rocha says she's still in pain. ROCHA: (Through interpreter) I think it's an injustice what happened to me all because I fell. I slipped. All of this didn't have to happen. And because of this, because I was in jail, because of this injustice, my daughter suffered so much. BERKES: And because her daughter was raped and because her daughter is an American citizen and because her daughter is a minor and needs her mother's support, Rocha's attorney was able to get her a green card. She has a real Social Security number now and legally works, washing dishes in a Florida restaurant. Most aren't so lucky - if you can call that luck. Howard Berkes, NPR News.

NPR's Sarah McCammon grew up in Kansas City, Mo. So we sent her back for the next installment in our Going Home series. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Like a lot of places, Kansas City is experiencing a couple of major trends - suburban sprawl, and, more recently, downtown revitalization. My two siblings, who still live in the area, are a pretty good example of this. DAN FOWLER: I am Dan Fowler, and should I mention that I'm your (laughter) brother at all, or are you including that? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I'm including that. Dan is in his late 20s, worked for a tech startup and like most of his friends, lives in downtown Kansas City, Mo. There's been a lot of public and private investment in downtown since I left in 1999 - a new streetcar line, condos, restaurants and bars, an arts district. It's a lot different than it was when we were kids. FOWLER: I just remember it as being the rundown place that nobody really goes. But now I'm living here. MCCAMMON: Kansas City is spread out - built on what was once a prairie, with more freeway miles per capita than any other major metro area. So you can get to my sister's house way out south in Kansas in less than half an hour. Hi. Do you want to say something? UNIDENTIDIED CHILD: Hi, (unintelligible). MCCAMMON: Hi, Aunt Sarah. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Unintelligible). MCCAMMON: That's my niece and my sister, Mary Hodges. She and her husband are in their 30s and recently moved to this suburb where farmland has been slowly turning into subdivisions, office parks and shopping centers for many years. She says a big draw was the highly-rated schools. MARY HODGES: Both of us work on this side of town and have - majority of our friends now live on this side of town because they were looking for the same things we were, the good school districts. MCCAMMON: But my memories of Kansas City center neither around downtown nor the suburbs. Most of my early years were spent in neighborhoods in between, full of modest, ranch-style homes. I went to a private religious school, Blue Ridge Christian, based in a church on the edge of an area called Raytown. Larry Becker, a teacher whose family helped found the school, says the neighborhood has changed a lot from the mostly white, middle-class suburb where he's lived since the late 1950s. LARRY BECKER: We were on the south edge of Kansas City, and it was mainly upper-middle-class class families that were utilizing the school there. Now we're probably more middle-class to lower-middle class. MCCAMMON: I've known his daughter, Sarah Helmering, since preschool. We went for a drive through the old neighborhood to what used to be a major shopping destination, Bannister Mall. SARAH HELMERING: It's still - every time I drive by this area - still it's so strange to me to look over into this area and not see Bannister Mall, Best Buy, Toys R Us, Babies R Us, Montgomery Ward. MCCAMMON: Between a slumping economy and declining interest in traditional malls, it was leveled several years ago. Now the site is home to a big corporate campus for the health technology company Cerner. As for our school, it recently moved out of the neighborhood after enrollment plummeted. The church itself is also preparing to move, which is creating an opportunity for a predominantly African-American church that's raising money to buy the property. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing gospel). PASTOR AARON LAVENDER: One more time. Come on. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing gospel). MCCAMMON: Pastor Aaron Lavender leads Grace Baptist Church of Greater Kansas City. He sees Raytown, which is increasingly black and Hispanic, as a prime location for the ministry. And Lavender says this has happened before. In the early 1990s, the church bought its current building, closer to the urban core, from another white congregation. LAVENDER: We call it white flight. Let me explain what that is. When the neighborhood changes, you know, whites move. MCCAMMON: Kansas City has long struggled to integrate many of its neighborhoods, says Dianne Cleaver, who runs the nonprofit Urban Neighborhood Initiative. But as practices like redlining, which barred African-Americans from living in some places, have gone away, she says many of these families have migrated to areas in the middle like Raytown. Cleaver says these areas are both affordable and in some cases more culturally accessible than the far-flung suburbs. DIANNE CLEAVER: So people were trying to get into better neighborhoods, better school districts, get away from some of the crime. And those inner-ring suburbs are close in - didn't seem like a bridge too far. MCCAMMON: As Kansas City's downtown and suburbs continue to draw investment and young professionals, like my siblings, she hopes the places and people in between won't be forgotten.

The aftermath of Hurricane Harvey will shut down the city's economy and leave plenty of long-term damage as well. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Chuck Watson studies the impact of natural disasters for the consulting firm Enki Holdings. He's been tracking Hurricane Harvey for days, and he says the huge amount of rainfall it's produced has taken everyone by surprise. CHUCK WATSON: If Harvey were just a hurricane, it would've only caused maybe $4 or $5 billion worth of damage. At the tropical storm phase, it's actually producing maybe five times that much damage. ZARROLI: Right now, Watson calculates that Harvey will cause a staggering $30 billion in damage. Houston is an oil and gas center, but it's also home to companies such as KBR, Sysco and Waste Management as well as lots of small manufacturers. They're all shut down now, as are the two airports, several hospitals and the Port of Houston. Bill Gilmer is an economic forecaster at the University of Houston. BILL GILMER: You've got, you know, the fifth-largest economy in the United States basically sitting at a dead stop for three or four days. ZARROLI: Gilmer says Houston can quickly make up the lost work. He says the city has been through bad storms before, and residents know how to recover. Gilmer, who lives in a wooded area outside Houston, remembers waking up the morning after Hurricane Ike in 2008. GILMER: First sound I heard was chainsaws. And I looked out, and all my neighbors were out there clearing the streets, clearing their yards, cleaning up the yards. And then they went out, and they cleaned up all of the trails. ZARROLI: But Gilmer also acknowledges that the damage from Harvey is likely to be out of scale with anything the city has seen before. Right now, estimates of the damage vary wildly, but the cost of just repairing people's homes will be many billions of dollars. Loretta Worters is with the Insurance Information Institute. LORETTA WORTERS: There will be some flood - some wind damage, but I think the majority of the losses are going to come from flooding. ZARROLI: And the great majority of homeowners don't have flood insurance, especially low-income people. So to rebuild, they'll have to take out federal loans. And Chuck Watson says the damage could be even greater depending on how long the rain continues. Watson also worries about something else. Houston's oil refineries haven't been seriously damaged so far. But if they flood, there aren't a lot of companies that know how to repair them. WATSON: Then you're talking - instead of a couple of weeks, you're talking months to come back online. And then you're starting to think in terms of gasoline shortages and longer-term price hikes. And that's going to have a ripple effect to the whole economy. ZARROLI: At that point, Hurricane Harvey will become not just a Houston problem but a problem for the whole country.

S. , around 6 million. That's just over one job opening for every officially unemployed person in the country. Matching that person with the right job is tough, though. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, employers could do more to improve those odds. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist for the online job site Glassdoor, says U. S. employers often complain that workers don't have the skills needed for the jobs available. He says that's true for some upper-level health care and technology jobs. ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN: But for the most part, it doesn't look to be like there is a skills gap. That's not the main reason why there are many job openings. YDSTIE: Chamberlain says that with unemployment so low and the U. S. labor force growing slowly, there's no doubt it's harder for companies to find workers. But he says if that were the main problem, you'd see wages rising more rapidly in the economy. That's not been the case in many industries. Part of the problem, says Chamberlain, lies in company hiring policies. Peter Cappelli, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, agrees. He says one problem is that companies are posting openings that require qualifications that aren't really necessary for the job. PETER CAPPELLI: They're just asking for the moon and not expecting to pay very much for it. And as a result, they couldn't find those people. Now, that didn't mean there was nobody to do the job. It just meant that there was nobody at the price they were willing to pay. YDSTIE: Jason Lorenz says he's seen that in his work at Human Technology Incorporated (ph), a corporate recruiter that provides workers for firms in the Carolinas, many of them auto parts manufacturers. Lorenz says the companies come to him with a long checklist of qualifications. And he says. . . JASON LORENZ: OK, we understand you would love to have that perfect employee, but give me a couple things that a successful candidate would look like for this specific job on this shift. YDSTIE: For instance, he asks, do they really need to be able to operate a computer? Or do they only need to be able to lift 35 pounds? Lorenz says another thing that employers need to understand is that wages need to rise. LORENZ: I'm telling manufacturers now if you're below $12 an hour, I don't know that I'm going to be the person to be able to help you with those jobs. YDSTIE: That's because in the past year, job openings have nearly doubled in western North Carolina, where he works. And the supply of additional workers is shrinking fast. Wharton's Peter Cappelli says part of the problem is employers haven't adjusted to new conditions. For years they've had their choice of workers desperate for a job. Now the labor market has tightened, says Cappelli, but many employers haven't responded. CAPPELLI: Wages have not gone up despite all the talk about a tight labor market. And I think most important for the economy, we still don't see lots of employers being willing to take people in right out of school and train them for jobs. YDSTIE: Jason Lorenz says that's also the case with many companies he deals with. Companies anxious to meet quarterly earnings targets don't want to spend money training workers. That's left the ball in his court. So he finds workers and gets them enrolled in community college programs. LORENZ: And then we're able to move those folks from, say, an entry level position at the $10 to $12 range and then promote them within those companies at the $16 to $17 an hour range. YDSTIE: Glassdoor's Andrew Chamberlain says it is important for companies to adjust their behaviors for their own good. CHAMBERLAIN: Every open position in the economy is money left on the table. It's a lost paycheck to a worker. It's also lost productivity to the company. YDSTIE: And it's lost growth for the U. S. economy. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: The day she spoke with us, she was also a little hoarse from cheering at a high school football game, where she was also working security. Christy's life is packed. FAYMONVILLE: I wake up around 5:45. Then I'll go to school. And I'll get out of there at 3:45. And then from there, I usually have my retail job, which starts at 5 but really, really great boss. And sometimes if I have a meeting with kids as an advisor for different clubs, I'll say, hey, I can't get there till 5:15 or 5:30, and that's OK. And then I'll work till about 9, 9:30 and then come home and see if the kids need help with homework or what laundry needs to get done kind of thing. But my children are very helpful and very independent. So they know what it's like. They've been living like this for years so. GARCIA-NAVARRO: When do you get time to spend time with them? I mean, do you? FAYMONVILLE: A little bit in the morning. So there's that crossover. Hey, make sure you're up. And we chit chat a little bit. I'm very thankful for texting and Facebook. I make sure that I'm not working every night Monday through Thursday. I'm very involved in their schools, so sometimes I might have a meeting. So I might work two nights a week for the retail and both Saturday and Sunday. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me a little bit about the jobs that you have. Who else is in those jobs with you? FAYMONVILLE: Well, I guess I'd like to preface with, I'm not the only teacher, by any means. Most police officers I know and most teachers I know do have some sort of second income. And it's not for a means of luxury. It's for the needs. If they have children - and, you know, if you do want to have a house or you do want to have a vehicle, it takes a lot of extra work. So I just want to make sure I preface that. And I'm by no means the only one out here that is like that. There are some retirees for the retail job, but other ones - college students. There is a nurse. There is another woman that is in the reserve military, and that is one of her jobs. Couple of them are kind of stay-home moms and just kind of want to get out of the house for a few hours. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Are you able to save? FAYMONVILLE: As far as a savings account, no. But I do have money taken out every paycheck towards retirement. But by no means is it a large nest egg. I'm not one of those that could walk away tomorrow and say, OK, I'll be alright. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what would happen in an emergency if something happened, an unexpected cost? Do you have money on reserve? FAYMONVILLE: I don't. It would be a call to Mom, or it'd be call to the other grandparents. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you think the minimum wage should be, especially for people who are trying to live on it? FAYMONVILLE: That's a tough question because if you do raise the minimum wage - I don't know what that number X is. But once you reach that number X, it actually hurts the economy. So it's almost a catch-22 question. I would like to think that if I'm able to work 80 hours a week, then other people are too. And if you are making minimum wage, are you doing everything you can? Do you really need a phone that costs a hundred dollars a month? I have a $20 slide phone because I don't want to pay that 50 to 70 dollars a month for a smartphone. That's something that we don't have in our house except, of course, my daughter who paid for her own. But I do think, however, that we need to train people better, so they're not stuck in that minimum wage job. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you want people to know about working so many different jobs and having to work so many hours? FAYMONVILLE: That it's very tough. And I really wish I didn't have to. I would love to be able to wake up, go to work, come home and hang out and, you know, relax like so many other people do. But I'm not the only one. And a lot of people are doing it. And I think that compassion and empathy will go a long way when working with people who have to work all these jobs. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Christy Faymonville from Green Bay, Wis. Noam Scheiber covers the economy for The New York Times. We asked him to give us a picture of what minimum and low-wage jobs look like in this country. And he said it was a lot of what we'd think - fast food, retail. But it's also home health aides who work with people who can't care for themselves. I asked him what we know about what happens when you raise the minimum wage. There's a fierce argument across the political spectrum and conflicting data. NOAM SCHEIBER: Right now, we are just conducting this large-scale economic and social experiment because some cities have and states have raised the minimum wage or have signed legislation that will raise it in the coming years. So that's really what we're waiting to see. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So it basically depends on where you live, for example, on what the possible effects might be? It's not just a one-size-fit-all issue. SCHEIBER: Very much, very much. Depends on what the kind of wage structure of your city is. And if the median wage - the wage of a typical worker in your city - is very high, then those cities can typically absorb a high minimum wage. So Seattle, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D. C. , which enacted its own $15 an hour minimum wage increase - all those cities, economists believe, are perfectly capable of withstanding a very high minimum wage, even as high as $15 an hour. But if you go to Binghamton, New York, or, you know, places in the Inland Empire in California where people don't make that much, then suddenly there is a concern that the cities will not be able to withstand that a high a minimum wage. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The woman we spoke to - her name is Christy. She's a teacher. And she uses the minimum wage jobs to fill in the cracks. And she mentions she knows lots of teachers, police officers and other people who have sort of a main job that doesn't pay enough who also do that, not for luxuries, but maybe to have a second car or to pay their mortgage. Do you get a sense that her story is common? SCHEIBER: Very common. It's been a historical trend since the 2008-09 recession and financial crisis. And I think it really helps fuel the growth of the so-called gig economy. We see a lot of people driving for Uber or doing odd jobs on TaskRabbit. And a lot of what's happening on those platforms is people either supplementing steady jobs that they have and just don't quite pay the bills or stitching together a bunch of different gigs so that they add up to a livelihood. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How do you solve the problem of keeping the economy going while paying workers a living wage? That seems to be the crux of the debate. SCHEIBER: It's an incredibly complicated and vexing question. To simplify massively, you sort of have two views of low-paid work. One is that it's really not sustainable for someone, particularly someone with a family who lives in a city with any kind of expenses, to get by on the minimum wage in most places. The other view is that low-wage employment is kind of an apprenticeship. It's kind of a temporary stop on the way to bigger and better things. You often hear of people who are critics of the minimum wage point out that a lot of teenagers work minimum wage jobs. I think those claims have been overstated. But clearly, some teenagers work these jobs and people while they're in school and in college. And so the idea is, well, we shouldn't overregulate these jobs. We shouldn't try to raise wages too high because people rely on them. Again, it's - at the highest level, it's really a debate about how we see employment and particularly low-wage employment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: New York Times reporter Noam Scheiber, thank you so much. SCHEIBER: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Next week on the Call-In, yet another major study has challenged what we know about a healthy diet or what we think we know - calling carbs, not fat, the real killer. But it's only the latest in the war of the healthy diets. What are your questions about what we eat and what's actually healthy? What are you eating? Call in at 202-216-9217.

(SOUNDBITE OF CORDUROI'S \"MY DEAR\") LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  This is the Call-In. (SOUNDBITE OF CORDUROI'S \"MY DEAR\") GARCIA-NAVARRO: And today we're looking at minimum wage - the jobs that pay people the bare legal minimum. JO JO: Hi my name is Jo Jo (ph). MICAH CLARK: Yeah, my name is Micah Clark (ph). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I'm from Cabot, Ark. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I live in Iowa City, Iowa. JO JO: I work four different jobs. CLARK: I've also worked 7. 25 an hour at a Little Caesar's, where they work you half to death. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We struggled to get by. We could not afford the cars we need. And we couldn't afford, you know, all the food. CLARK: It makes you beyond tired because you work down to the bone. And you do it day in and day out all week. JO JO: It doesn't always make ends meet, but it usually does. CLARK: That's my thoughts. Thank you. JO JO: Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We heard from Christy Faymonville this week. She lives in Green Bay, Wis. - a single mom with two kids. One's in the Navy, graduated and was valedictorian of her class. The others, still in high school. Christy is a teacher. She teaches math. But it doesn't pay enough. And like almost everyone who called in, she told us a story of multiple jobs. CHRISTY FAYMONVILLE: I work retail part-time. I waitress on the weekends.

NPR's Cheryl Corley spent most of her adolescence in Harvey, Ill. , about 20 miles south of Chicago's downtown. She left Harvey for college in the 1970s. It was once considered a 20th-century boomtown. Now Harvey is a struggling suburb devastated by a loss of factories, the country's housing crisis, crime and political infighting. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: It's been decades since I really visited Harvey, so first stop on this reunion tour - my alma mater, Thornton Township High school, home of the Wildcats. In the main hallway, a welcome sign in English and Spanish greets visitors. And there's lots of purple and white, the school colors, all over the place. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: All right, look at the camera for me. CORLEY: As photographers give quick instructions, a long line of students inches forward, getting ready for new school IDs. Asya Bost, a senior now, says there's a reason she's so Thornton proud. ASYA BOST: I like the diversity of this school. It's a lot of different ethnicities, different type of people, different personalities. I'm the captain of the spoken word team. I'm a part of the speech team. CORLEY: Out in one of the courtyards, there's principal Tony Ratliffe. This day, he's a chef wearing a purple Wildcat apron, tossing some hot dogs on a grill for students and staff. TONY RATLIFF: Always a honor to have our Wildcats return. CORLEY: Ratliff is a Thornton graduate himself. He became the principal six years ago. When I attended Thornton, there were about 4,500 students, the majority white. It's now less than half that and mostly African-American. RATLIFF: Because the economy just - over the years in our area, we've lost that homesteadness. One of the disadvantages of our school in particular is it has a high mobility rate - a lot of people in, a lot of people out, you know? CORLEY: In its heyday, more than 30,000 people lived in the village. Today it's closer to 25,000, and more than a third live below the poverty line. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)CORLEY: A drive through Harvey's downtown today is a stark contrast to the bustle of years ago. There's a few banks, a thriving hospital, the YMCA. But they are vastly outnumbered by vacant and boarded-up businesses. On the street where I lived about a mile from Thornton, the home with the big yard my parents were so proud of is abandoned, a tattered wreck, the sky visible through the roof. The tree I planted in the backyard is towering and strong, but the awnings on the house are faded and frail. ANNE DAVIS: My heart aches. You will see as many boarded-up homes as there are homes that are occupied. CORLEY: Anne Davis lived in Harvey for nearly four decades. A retired teacher and union official, Davis and her husband bought their home in 1963. DAVIS: And guess what? It was employment. We had all kinds of restaurants, and downtown Harvey was vibrant. And so the question becomes, what happened? (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)CORLEY: There's a ghostly reminder of what happened at the northern edge of town. The vacant Wyman-Gordon factory sits like a hulking shell. It's one of many manufacturers that employed thousands in Harvey but dried up or left town for areas with lower labor costs. Ever since, Harvey has struggled with declining tax revenues, high levels of crime and poverty. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAFFIC)CORLEY: Along Dixie Highway, there's a new business called Entrance entertainment venue. It sits on the corner of a site once dominated by a defunct mall. JOSEPH BROOKS: In the front, we have a bar-grill, which we have a full-size menu. CORLEY: Co-owner Joseph Brooks says there's space for concerts and other events in the back. He says it's a good opportunity for him and for Harvey. BROOKS: Oh, most definitely. That allows me to bring employment in the black community. CORLEY: That's the first item on the agenda for many in Harvey. But a plague of crime, charges of financial mismanagement and political infighting at City Hall hasn't helped matters much. Still, there are some bright spots, including some beautiful homes that remain, plus a few factories. And the library where I used to study looks brand new. There's books, computers and, on Tuesday nights. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Take it back. CORLEY: . . . Adult line dancing classes. The dance class is just one of many services the library offers, says Antonia McBride, the head of circulation. McBride grew up in Harvey, left for college and returned. McBride knows lots of young professionals won't stick around the Chicago suburb, but she hopes for a turnaround. ANTONIA MCBRIDE: And have people see the location as being someplace where it could become prosperous again. But I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. CORLEY: And as I remember what Harvey used to be and visit it now as an adult, it seems as if it would almost take a miracle for the suburb where I grew up to see a glimmer of its former days.

YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Express Employment Professionals sits on Muncie's main commercial artery and places about 120 people every month in jobs at local companies. Hi. NATE MILLER: Hi, I'm Nate. NOGUCHI: Around 2007, the last time hiring was this hot, job applicants streamed through its doors. Nate Miller is Express's owner. MILLER: Even with the low unemployment rates that we had at that time, there were still plenty of applicants. Now we're down to that 3 percent to 4 percent unemployment throughout all of Indiana, but there's very few applicants. And the question is, you know, where'd they go? NOGUCHI: Where did they go? That is an enigma for economists, from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on down. In the 1950s, nearly all working-age men were in the labor force. Now that's 88 percent. Baby boomer retirement is a big factor, but opioid addiction might also explain some of the decline. Miller says a third of his applicants these days fail pre-employment drug screens, nowadays almost always for opioids. Meanwhile employers tell him they could build and sell more if they could only find and keep more workers. MILLER: We know employers who just don't want to know. Don't drug-test them. We don't want to know. It's not necessarily the best practice, but it is something that they do because they need people, and they need them so badly. NOGUCHI: The opioid crisis is no worse in Muncie than elsewhere. It's representative of the typical small American town with an economy built on manufacturing, agriculture and Ball State University. People here say problems associated with pain pills and heroin ramped up about two years ago. It hit more people harder and across more walks of life than the methamphetamine boom did several years back. For metal parts-maker Mursix Corp. , dealing with it head on has been both painful and necessary. SUSAN CARLOCK: You can see all these punch presses out here will stamp-out metal parts or components, right? NOGUCHI: Susan Carlock is co-owner and vice president of Mursix. She says two years ago productivity took a hit as some employees dealt drugs, got high or nodded-off on the factory floor. Others took time off to handle opioid-related family emergencies. At the time, the company wanted to expand. Instead, Carlock says, establishing new procedures for drug monitoring, rehab and dismissal became the top priority. CARLOCK: We have companies, overseas companies that are coming to us for us to be a supplier to them, and their No. 1 question is workforce - and sober workforce. NOGUCHI: Zero-tolerance, she says, is still a balancing act. So many applicants have drug-related records the company now has to consider people with those charges. CARLOCK: We are a victim of the lack of workforce in this community, and we've had to - I don't want to say lower or bend our standards, but we've re-evaluated. NOGUCHI: Data indicate alcohol abuse is more prevalent and it's health effects ultimately more lethal, but opioids have a bigger impact on work. The National Safety Council and the NORC Research Group at the University of Chicago say opioid users miss twice as many days of work as people with addictions to alcohol or other drugs. And an untold number of opioid users don't work at all. I meet Shon Byrum at a diner that no longer serves spoons so customers won't use them to cook drugs in the bathroom. Byrum is 34, grew up just outside of Muncie, in Winchester, and is now that town's mayor. He worries about an economic vicious cycle, one where people find dealing opioids more lucrative than working. That, in turn, makes recruiting more challenging. One local manufacturer, he says, found a workaround. SHON BYRUM: They are investing, in their plant, in $5. 5 million dollars' worth of mechanical arms to take the place of entry-level worker because they cannot keep them. They're failing drug tests or they don't show up. NOGUCHI: Byrum wants to open new drug treatment centers, not just for public health, but also to foster a reliable workforce so employers can stick around. Michael Hicks directs the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State. He estimates roughly 1. 5 percent of Muncie's population is neither working nor looking for work because of opioids. MICHAEL HICKS: Which seems like a small amount, but with an unemployment rate at 4 percent, that means 1 out of every 4 people who might otherwise be applying for a job are out of the labor force. NOGUCHI: The after-effects, Hicks says, will linger for at least a generation. HICKS: What we're really worried about should be a long-term effect of people who are bounced entirely out of a productive life because of this addiction. NOGUCHI: For those in recovery, employers like Richard Gill want to offer second chances. He co-owns Gill Bros. Furniture, started by his family 50 years ago. Higher turnover and an opioid-related firing left him short staffed. RICHARD GILL: I have been running a forklift for the last two days in our warehouse so I literally took a shower before I came to this interview. NOGUCHI: Gill says he would love to expand. GILL: By all means we want to hire younger workers. We do. They have more energy. They have better backs. But it is difficult to find them. NOGUCHI: And also difficult to make sure they're sober. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Muncie, Ind. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  In Muncie, Ind. , the unemployment rate is 4. 4 percent, which is to say that just about everyone who wants a job has one. Some economists say that low figure may be deceiving, though, because a significant number of people are missing from the labor force.

This week, NPR's Yuki Noguchi has been asking how much the opioid epidemic contributes to that. She's looking at the drug's impact on Muncie, Ind. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Jonathan Guffey has chiseled, youthful looks and, at 32, does not have the haggard bearing of someone who's spent more than half his life hooked on opioids. That stint with the drug started at 15 and ended, he says, for good, 22 months ago. He now works in construction, but his work history is pockmarked by addiction. JONATHAN GUFFEY: I've worked in a couple factories for a short amount of time, probably just long enough to get the first check to get high off of. NOGUCHI: I meet Guffey at Road to Redemption, a free weekly dinner and support meeting in Muncie for people in recovery. He says his habit was enabled by other users - family, friends, even a boss at a factory where he once worked. GUFFEY: And there was plenty times when I wouldn't go to work there, and my boss would call me. And he wouldn't even say anything about work. He would just want more opiates, pills or whatever it was that I could get at the time. NOGUCHI: Those with opioid addictions tell strikingly similar stories, where work takes a back seat to an intensifying compulsion to use. They're sleepy on them and horribly sick when they aren't. They say the physical impact is worse than with other drugs. Those I interviewed describe a deepening alienation that ultimately includes both family and work. Most say they eventually supported themselves by dealing drugs. Opioid use is less common and, in the aggregate, less lethal than alcohol. But the data show opioids effect users' work life more. The National Safety Council and the Nork Research group at the University of Chicago show opioid users miss twice as many days of work than those with alcohol or other drug addictions. Princeton economist Alan Krueger released a study this week linking about 20 percent of recent declines in labor-force participation to opioids. His earlier research showed nearly half of prime-aged men absent from the labor force used pain medication, mostly opioids. Melissa Wallace's ex-husband and three children all wrestle with various addictions. She also owns a small cleaning business that hires some people in recovery. MELISSA WALLACE: Oftentimes, they relapse. So there's reliability. Are they going to show up? NOGUCHI: Wallace, who works for a Road to Redemption, says opioids strike the rich, the poor and the promising. WALLACE: I know a lot of my kids' friends have fallen into that trap, in and out of jail - kids that if you would've told me 10 years ago would have ended up in jail, I would have just been like, no way. NOGUCHI: She's referring to people like Kathryn Sexton, a tall, attractive 23-year-old from an upper-middle class family, whose perfect high school grades landed her a full-ride college scholarship. KATHRYN SEXTON: And that's where I met heroin. NOGUCHI: She dropped out of college. She says among her circle of a dozen high school friends, seven are dead of overdoses or drug-related car accidents and medical crises. Sexton sobered up a month ago, only to confront a felony possession charge that might cost her her nursing assistant's license, the only thing remaining of her career plan. It might also mean she won't be able to go back to school. SEXTON: If these charges stick, I will not be able to get any federal loans because they don't give them to felons. NOGUCHI: It's not just the addicted whose careers suffer. I meet Roger and Katiena Johnson in front of their house. The lawn is strewn with toys, evidence they've been thrust back into parenting their two grandchildren. Their 26-year-old daughter Destini went to jail on drug charges but once worked at the same company as her father. ROGER JOHNSON: She's worked with me twice. KATIENA JOHNSON: She worked there when she was 16. R. JOHNSON: Yeah, when she was 16 years old and going to school. So I mean, you know, once this drug gets a hold of you, it's - it brings you down. NOGUCHI: Katiena Johnson says she missed work driving Destini to rehab, to doctors and her own plans are on hold. K. JOHNSON: No, I mean, once you raise your kids, you're wanting to, you know, retire or something, you know. We went ahead and took on our grandkids, in which - we love them. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Hey. K. JOHNSON: But this is my daughter. R. JOHNSON: This is Destini. K. JOHNSON: She - did you get out of jail? DESTINI JOHNSON: Yes. R. JOHNSON: She's right here. K. JOHNSON: I love you. R. JOHNSON: Sixty days. NOGUCHI: Destini Johnson's homecoming is unexpected. Jail overcrowding, she says, led to her early release. Her mother, who works the overnight shift at a children's home, looks both happy and worried. Destini wasn't given a shot to control her opioid cravings. Once again, her mom rethinks her work plans. K. JOHNSON: Kind of makes me even want to try to stay home tonight just to make sure she doesn't use. NOGUCHI: Destini says she wants a good job. In the past, she says, addiction got her hooked on making the quick buck. D. JOHNSON: I'd rather go and trick. I don't know if you know what that is but, you know, have sex for money to get my drugs because it was a lot faster and easier. You have to wait a whole week for a paycheck. No addict wants to wait that long to get their drugs. NOGUCHI: Mom urges her daughter to take it slowly, focusing on recovery before applying for jobs. Rejection, she worries, might lead back to the drugs. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Muncie, Ind.

There are still a lot of challenges, though. And many businesses in the state haven't been able to reopen yet. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: With about 5 million homes and businesses remaining without electricity throughout the state of Florida, a lot of the business recovery efforts there will depend on how quickly power can be restored. Carol McDaniel is vice president of human resources for the Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. CAROL MCDANIEL: It's going to be probably many more days before they can even assess and turn it back on because there's a lot of lines down in the streets and stuff with trees on them. NOGUCHI: The hospital generates its own power and remained open. But McDaniel says she does not know yet how many employees' homes and cars have been damaged. A consultant I reached in Jacksonville said many office workers whose downtown offices flooded were telecommuting. Some stores have also reopened to sell critical supplies. In heavily damaged areas like Naples and Fort Myers, calls would not go through. Others left greetings like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Unfortunately, at this time, we are closed due to Hurricane Irma. NOGUCHI: Overall, Irma's late turn up the less populated western side of Florida and its rapid loss of strength helped limit the economic damage. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi estimates losses from Irma, in terms of lost business and property damage, will total between 60 and $90 billion, which is less than half the damage of Hurricane Katrina. MARK ZANDI: The economic hit is temporary. Rebuilding will kick in quickly. And, you know, a year or two down the road, these economies should be back up and running in full strength. NOGUCHI: Gus Faucher is chief economist for PNC Financial. He expects hurricanes Irma and Harvey will take about half a percent off the national economic growth rate for the quarter - not as bad an outcome as some had feared. GUS FAUCHER: It's not going to be a complete rebuilding project. NOGUCHI: That's not to say individual businesses won't struggle. Joyce Chastain is an employment law consultant in Tallahassee who has clients around the state. She says most remain closed through at least Tuesday. Larger businesses, she says, will rebuild relatively quickly. JOYCE CHASTAIN: Smaller businesses - they just don't have that kind of infrastructure. And some of them won't come back. NOGUCHI: Business shutdowns also have a big impact on hourly employees, who may have to go without pay. CHASTAIN: There will be many employers who just simply will not be in a financial position to continue pay for several weeks, when they can't be open to generate revenue. NOGUCHI: Meanwhile in Houston, Paula Harvey is still dealing with the effects of the hurricane that shared her surname. She says some orders for her business, Schulte Building Systems, are delayed, but none so far canceled. A bigger, long-term concern is whether the handful of employees who lost their homes and cars will remain. PAULA HARVEY: What happens during these types of things is some people just say forget it and leave because they've lost everything. And they go, you know, somewhere else and start over again. NOGUCHI: So far, she says, that's happened with one employee who simply did not report back to work. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

Driving home yesterday, he says virtually every gas station he passed was closed. Now he uses an app on his smartphone to find places to fill up his tank. And Kemp says it's not looking good. MATTHEW KEMP: People are, you know, posting desperately in some cases, you know, is anything open? Is anything open? One person replied and said she had basically driven all around south Tampa today, and every single establishment that is a chain was closed. ZARROLI: Kemp says a lot of people fled to Georgia or South Carolina to escape the storm. Now they want to come home, he says, and they can't. KEMP: They feel paralyzed. And they cannot return from their evacuation because no one wants to get in their car and go south on I-95 or south on I-75 and make it 300 miles, run out of gas on the side of the road. ZARROLI: Irma may be gone, but Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at the website GasBuddy, says thousands of gas stations remain closed. PATRICK DEHAAN: Fort Myers, Naples, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, Tallahassee, Tampa - all of those areas are seeing outages over 40 percent and in some cases as high as 65 percent. ZARROLI: Because Irma's struck such a large area, an unusual number of people evacuated. And too many of them rushed to fill up their tanks at the same time. John Kilduff off of Again Capital says a shortage of supply is one reason that so many stations remain closed. JOHN KILDUFF: But also, power is the issue. And most of these gas stations don't have backup generation that can allow the pumps to work. ZARROLI: Patrick DeHaan of GasBuddies says utility companies trying to get power back on are having trouble keeping up. DEHAAN: Motorists are coming back. The storm has moved on. And that's the problem - is motorists really can move, you know, in this case quicker than utility crews restoring vital services. ZARROLI: So for now, people are making do any way they can. There's no gas available at a 7-Eleven in Fort Myers, and plastic wrap is placed over the gas tanks. Andrew Haltunnen tried to buy gas with no luck. So he ended up calling his father, and now he's siphoning gas from his car. He wants to take I-75 across the state. ANDREW HALTUNNEN: I'm trying to get to Miami, and Alligator Alley is a long stretch. Looked on the app, went to many stations - all out - all no power in this area. ZARROLI: Nearby, Devan Rios has stopped to buy snacks for his son. Coming from Tampa, he says he'd passed about 50 closed gas stations. DEVAN RIOS: It's crazy. Obviously a hurricane just passed. It's understandable, but I mean we're not used to this. ZARROLI: The good news is that gasoline is coming back into the state. And as ports re-open, supplies should gradually return to normal. But as long as power remains out in so many places, a lot of stations will remain closed anyway. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

Here's NPR's Chris Arnold. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The last time Americans had taken on a record level of debt, we were in the throes of the financial crisis. But the economy's in much better shape now, home loans are being made to people who can actually afford them and a lot of the borrowing is arguably pretty responsible. SASHA GALLAGHER: My husband and I recently had a baby in February. And we've had a lot of changes in the past year. ARNOLD: Sasha Gallagher lives outside Richmond, Va. The couple just bought a house. They spent their savings on a down payment. So they used one of those 0 percent credit card offers to buy a whole bunch of stuff for their new home - a washing machine, a refrigerator, a rideable lawnmower. GALLAGHER: We're at roughly $6,000. And it will probably grow because at this point, we've got appliances on there but we really haven't furnished the home yet. ARNOLD: That might sound like quite the credit card buying spree, but Gallagher says she hasn't taken leave of her senses. GALLAGHER: You know, we're still driving both of our old beat up cars basically into the ground because a house in a good school district was more important than a new car. ARNOLD: And Gallagher just finished pharmacy school and got a good job. So she's gone from being basically a starving student to being the bigger breadwinner for the family. And she says they'll be able to pay off that credit card pretty quickly. Likewise, millions of Americans have found work in recent years. And, of course, spending money keeps the U. S. economy chugging along. So maybe all this debt isn't so bad. On the other hand, some economists don't like this record borrowing. Lucia Dunn is an economist at Ohio State University. LUCIA DUNN: The new level of debt is cause for alarm. ARNOLD: Dunn's been studying consumer debt for more than 20 years. Her research shows that overall, only about half of credit card debt gets paid off each month. And so she says that rising credit card debt suggests that more Americans are getting stuck paying those high interest rates. DUNN: Being in debt is a very stressful way to live. There's a lot of people who are just, you know, in a hole and so stressed out over it. We believe that group is growing. SUNG WON SOHN: We are beginning to forget the lessons learned from the painful recession in 2007 to 2009. ARNOLD: Sung Won Sohn is an economist at Cal State. He says he'd like to wave a cautionary flag about all this borrowing. WON SOHN: Because consumer spending is really the largest portion of the economy and when the time comes for an economic recession, this is going to make the situation worse. ARNOLD: In addition to all that credit card debt, Americans owe even more on student loans. Sasha Gallagher, who just bought the new house, says that pharmacy school was not cheap. GALLAGHER: Yeah, I also have, like, a mortgage-worth of student loan payments (laughter). I'd like to not put the actual number on the radio. ARNOLD: But it's a lot. Still, Gallagher says her degree got her that new job that's got a nice paycheck. Research shows that if you have a college or advanced degree, you're much more likely to own a house and earn a higher salary. But rising student debt is becoming a bigger drag on many Americans' finances. OK, so household debt overall is at a record high, but economist Sung Won Sohn says to keep it in perspective. . . WON SOHN: I don't think this is anything like what we faced in 2007. ARNOLD: For one thing, we don't have the systemic risk of financial collapse that we had back then when banks were making those huge bets on bad mortgages. Also, Americans' incomes have been slowly rising. So while overall debt is at a new high, it's still a lower percentage of people's incomes than it was when the financial crisis hit.

Cities around the country have moved to increase the minimum wage for workers at restaurants. Now, in turn, those restaurants have responded by trying to find ways to cut costs or pass the bill on to customers. But there is another unexpected effect of raising the minimum wage. To explain, we are joined by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Good morning. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Mary Louise. KELLY: All right, the suspense is killing me. What is the unexpected side effect? VEDANTAM: Well, the new research explores hygiene violations in the restaurant industry, specifically looking at Seattle, which has been in the vanguard of raising the minimum wage. So the minimum wage in Seattle went from about $8 an hour in 2010 to about 13 to $15 an hour this year. I was speaking to Srikant Devaraj at Ball State University in Indiana. Along with his co-author Subir Chakrabarti and Pankaj Patel, Devaraj analyzed the effects of the minimum wage increase on restaurant health and hygiene. Seattle's King County keeps detailed inspection records based on surprise visits from inspectors. Since different parts of King County raise the minimum wage at different times, the economists were able to track the trajectory of violations in Seattle as the minimum wage changed. SRIKANT DEVARAJ: We find that a dollar increase in minimum wage resulted in a 6. 4 percent increase in overall health violations and 15. 3 percent increase in less severe violations as a result of the increases. KELLY: That's a pretty striking set of numbers there, Shankar. So what is the link that they've found? VEDANTAM: Devaraj and his colleagues think that when restaurants face higher costs, they can do one of two things. They can find ways to pass these costs on to consumers. But, obviously, diners don't like to see this. They might also scale back some services, cutback hours of workers or add additional tasks to staff jobs. As a result, some service issues might start to crop up. Crucially, the researchers do not find increases in serious health violations that could get a restaurant shut down. In Seattle, these are termed red risk factors. The researchers instead find an increase in less serious violations. I asked Devaraj to give me some examples of these so-called blue violations. DEVARAJ: Protection from contamination, like things like - insect, rodents, animals, employee cleanliness and hygiene; toilet facilities - whether they were properly constructed, supplied and cleaned; the garbage has been properly disposed of. So these are some of the examples of these blue risk factors. KELLY: OK. Let me catch up with you. What we're seeing here is the research shows if workers get paid more, to earn the same profit, businesses need to cut on something and where they're cutting is around the edges on hygiene? VEDANTAM: That seems to be what the research is suggesting. Now, we don't know what the long-term trends are. It could be that over five years, this is going to look very different as the effects of the minimum wage shakeout. It could also be this is the effect of raising the minimum wage. And one implication is if cities are going to raise the minimum wage, one thing they might want to do is step up inspections of these more minor violations because you can expect that businesses that face higher costs might sometimes seek to cut corners. KELLY: You know, you could also expect that this might go the other way - that with better pay, morale would go up. People would take greater pride in where they work. They would take better care of the facilities. VEDANTAM: It certainly could work that way. And maybe it will work that way over the long term. It's also possible that that's happening simultaneous with other factors. So, for example, if a restaurant pays you more but cuts your hours, is your morale going to go up or down? KELLY: Shankar Vedantam - he joins us regularly to talk about social science research, and he's also host of the podcast Hidden Brain. Thanks, Shankar. VEDANTAM: Thanks so much.

This is the generation that was born after 1980. They came of age during the Great Recession. And now, as they grow older and have children, many are doing things like buying SUVs and homes. NPR's Sonari Glinton takes a look. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: For the last decade or so we've heard a lot about how millennials are different from the rest of us. As a matter of fact, I've even done some of that reporting. And it turns out, well, not so much. MICHELLE KREBS: Millennials are pretty mainstream when it gets right down to it, especially when they start creating households and having families. GLINTON: So who are you (laughter)? KREBS: Who am I? I'm Michelle Krebs, executive analyst with AutoTrader. And remember that this is the generation that just got clobbered during the Great Recession. They came out of college just loaded down with debt. And they were unemployed, underemployed, moving back in with mom and dad. So they were set behind economically. GLINTON: Krebs says this kept millennials out of the car market. But that's changing. In 2011, Krebs says millennials were 20 percent of the market. They're about 30 now. They'll be 40 percent of the market before the next decade if current trends continue. Growing older also is beginning to mean buying a house in the suburbs, says Svenja Gudell, the chief economist with Zillow. SVENJA GUDELL: When it comes time for millennials to actually purchase a home, oftentimes they choose suburbs over urban neighborhoods. GLINTON: Zillow, by the way, is the real estate site. Gudell says millennials as a generation were scarred by the last Great Recession. GUDELL: If you graduate into a recession, your lifetime earnings are likely to be lower than someone who doesn't graduate into a recession. GLINTON: The car and housing surveys show that the result of that scarring is millennials are much more budget-conscious than their older siblings, Gen Xers, and their baby boomer parents. The recession acted kind of as a big pause button for many choices Gudell says millennials were already going to be slow to make. GUDELL: They end up dating for a longer amount of time before they actually end up getting married. And then we're seeing that the age at which women have kids has also gone up. And so instead of having children in your late 20s, you might start having kids when you're in your early 30s at this point. GLINTON: Now, it's important to note that all millennials haven't given up their fixed-gear bikes and their downtown lofts. It's the oldest millennials who are entering a sort of key age, over 35. Now, depending on who you talk to, the oldest millennials are 37. As they cross that threshold Erich Merkle, an economist with Ford, says the group is buying SUVs - large ones. And the best-seller for millennials for Ford is their large SUV, the Explorer. ERICH MERKLE: We expect them to carry on as they age with three-row SUVs and likely go larger simply because they need the space that - to accommodate children that are now teenagers or preteenagers. GLINTON: This all seems good for the car companies, right? Well, Michelle Krebs, the auto analyst, says not so fast. KREBS: We know that millennials will buy one car. Will they be like the baby boomers and have 2, 3 or more cars in the driveway, in the household fleet? GLINTON: That's kind of the looming trillion-dollar question for the auto industry. Though as a Gen Xer, it's kind of fun to think millennials aren't that special. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

NPR's John Ydstie answers that question. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Currency expert Jens Nordvig says the biggest factor in the dollar's fall is growing doubts that the Trump administration will be able to put in place its economic growth policies. JENS NORDVIG: We came into the year with some very elevated expectations. There was a lot of hope that we were going to get a big tax reform. There was a lot of hope that we were going to get fiscal expansion. YDSTIE: Which was supposed to come from a jump in government spending on infrastructure and consumer spending fueled by tax cuts. That would have led to faster growth and multiple interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Rising U. S. rates would have put upward pressure on the dollar. NORDVIG: The overarching theme has been that those expectations have been disappointed. YDSTIE: But positive developments have also contributed to the dollar's decline, says Nordvig. NORDVIG: If you look at the global picture where you have better growth in Europe, better growth in Canada, for example, those are positive things because there's something better going on in the global economy. YDSTIE: That's pushed the value of the euro up about 15 percent against the dollar this year. That might make U. S. tourists unhappy, but it helps U. S. exporters whose products are now more competitive. Nordvig says it's also important to remember the dollar has weakened after peaking around New Year's at highs not seen since the 1980s. So the dollar is nowhere near touching new lows. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Let's talk about currency. The U. S. dollar rallied a bit last week.

So what is that? Well, it means the Fed is going to begin to shrink this $4 trillion portfolio of bonds and mortgages it has. They built up this portfolio over the last decade to revive a struggling economy. I'm going to stop talking now because we should hear from someone who actually knows this stuff. It is David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution also a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. And of course, you've heard him on this program many times. Hey there, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So is this this thing called quantitative easing that you and I talk so much about - this big experiment that the Fed did to try and help the economy? WESSEL: Yes. Basically, back in 2008, the Fed cut short-term interest rates to zero. That wasn't enough to rescue the sinking economy, so it launched this experiment - quantitative easing - printing money to buy more than $3 trillion dollars in bonds to try and push down long-term interest rates - the ones that set mortgages and the ones that influence what businesses pay to borrow. Now, it stopped adding to this portfolio a few years ago. But it held off on actually shrinking it until it was persuaded that the economy was kind of strong enough to take it. Well, unemployment is now at a 16-year low. Hiring is a pretty good pace. The rest of the world is doing better. So the Feds basically decided it's time to let the economy begin to stand on its own. It's not quite declaring mission accomplished. But it's a first step toward saying that. GREENE: OK. So if you're the Fed, you buy all this stuff to push down interest rates. Do you now sell these bonds and mortgages or what happens? WESSEL: No. That's a kind of a common misconception. What they're likely to say this afternoon - that they'll gradually allow this portfolio to shrink, not by selling anything, but by reinvesting the proceeds - when a bond matures or someone pays off their mortgage. So it's going to be very gradual. There's an economist up in Columbia, Rich Clarida, who told The Wall Street Journal the other day that this is kind of like losing weight by eating only two desserts instead of three. GREENE: (Laughter) Well, that doesn't sound that terrible. WESSEL: (Laughter). GREENE: But, well - but is it a bad thing for consumers, though? I mean, if everyone's gotten used to these low interest rates, is getting a mortgage and things like that going to be a lot more expensive now? WESSEL: Yeah. I mean, logically, if buying trillions of dollars in bonds pushed down mortgages and other long-term interest rates - the Fed economists say they think rates are about a full percentage point lower than they would have been if they hadn't done that - then, obviously, if you stopped doing that, if you shrink a little bit, it'll have the opposite effect and push rates up. Now, the Fed is hoping that by advertising its plans well in advance and moving very gradually, that it can avoid unsettling the financial markets and triggering a reaction from the bond market where these rates are set that leads to a sharp increase in rates. So there's going to be some increase in interest rates. The Fed's never done anything before like this. So they can't be certain what the effects will be. I think it's a sign, though, of the Fed's confidence in the economy that it's finally willing to take this step. GREENE: OK. So the message is this could feel bad if you're not getting the low mortgage rates and interest rates that you've gotten before. But overall, you should feel like this is a good step because it's a sign that the economy is improving and should make you feel more confident. WESSEL: Yes, as long as the Fed is not miscalculating - if the Fed is not overly optimistic about the strength of the economy. GREENE: All right. That is David Wessel - he is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, also a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal - speaking to us about the great unwinding.

In the days after they receive the benefit each month, there's plenty of food on the table. But as the weeks tick away, food becomes scarce. Here with some new research on the consequences of this monthly cycle is NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam. Good morning. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: Hi. This new research, I gather, it focuses on the link between food stamps and academic performance. How so? VEDANTAM: That's right. This work comes from Orgul Ozturk, she's an economist at the University of South Carolina, along with her colleagues, Chad Cotti, and John Gordanier. They find that children who come from families that are several weeks removed from receiving their food-stamp benefits perform worse on an important math exam. ORGUL OZTURK: We find that when the test date happens to be very far away from the receipt date, students score much lower, significantly lower on the mathematics test. KELLY: It seems like it kind of makes sense, that if you're hungry you can't concentrate so you might test lower. How do they know, though, that this is the food-stamp cycle, that that's what's responsible? VEDANTAM: Well, it has to do with two quirks in the way the food-stamp program is administered in South Carolina. Recipients receive benefits on the first 10 days of the month. Some families get it on the first, some on the second and so on. Simultaneously, children in grades three through eight also have to take an annual math exam on the second Wednesday of May. Now, the second Wednesday of May falls on different dates each year. So if your family received food stamps on the 10th of April, for example, and the exam falls on the 8th of May, you're likely to have gone hungry for several days before you took the test. KELLY: And to be clear, people don't all get their food stamps on the same day. It's. . . VEDANTAM: Precisely. KELLY: . . . Scattered around the month. VEDANTAM: Exactly. Now, on the other hand, if your family received food stamps on the 2nd of May and the test is on the 8th of May, you've probably eaten well in the days before the test. The researchers not only compared kids who've eaten well to kids who are hungry, they also compare the math performance of kids who've eaten poorly to their own math performance in another year when they've eaten well. Ozturk told me that while her study measures the effect of being hungry on one math test, this is a monthly cycle, meaning that the real effects are likely to be much larger. OZTURK: This is happening to these kids every month over the course of nine months. It adds up. What we are measuring is a reduction in performance that month. But they are hungry every single month. The cumulative effect is very significant. KELLY: Shankar, can researchers control whether this is in fact food? It seems like they're clear on the link to food stamps, but if food stamps are running out maybe the parents are stressed, there's stress in the household and that's what kids are reacting to? VEDANTAM: That's a fair point, Mary Louise. We know that there's a relationship between food stamps and math performance. We don't know specifically if it's about food or just because the family as a whole is stressed and the kids in some ways are reacting to that stress. KELLY: So what's the implication here? Might it be better to, say, distribute food stamps more frequently? VEDANTAM: So that's an idea that some people are thinking about, and it's an intriguing idea. If you can distribute the benefit twice a month, perhaps you can smooth-out the cycle. But it's the kind of thing that needs to be tested because you could have unintended consequences, and now instead of students being hungry once a month they're going to end up being hungry twice a month. KELLY: Which is clearly not the direction that you would want to go. VEDANTAM: Precisely. KELLY: That's NPR's Shankar Vedantam. Shankar, thank you. VEDANTAM: Thank you, Mary Louise.

Well, now, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, co-working is an industry unto itself. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Michael Silvers has worked at home and in corporate offices but prefers his small, rented, glass-walled co-working space in downtown Washington, D. C. MICHAEL SILVERS: Every office that I've worked in - you're kind of down in your own little hole. You don't really interact as much with other types of businesses. NOGUCHI: Co-working led to unexpected benefits for Silvers and his co-founder, who run ClearCodeX, an app development firm. They recruited a business partner they met at WeWork and learned a far more efficient way to develop software from other startups there. SILVERS: From concept design through to a working app in the App Store in four weeks. It was just amazing. I mean, that - we saw how fast you can do development because of what we caught up on here at WeWork and seeing other people doing it. NOGUCHI: Co-working spaces are attracting a growing population of office workers who spend more time working from home, hotels and cafes. Walk into one, and you'll find desks, monitors and meeting rooms along with the creature comforts of home. There are convivial, open spaces and areas to allow silent retreat into more focused, productive work. Close quarters bring with it some privacy challenges. Tan Ly, who runs Visually Dynamic, says he's learned to cope. TAN LY: You minimize the screen. Or (laughter) you know, you kind of turn the monitor a little bit. NOGUCHI: Part of the appeal is flexibility. Monthly membership means avoiding the commitment of a long-term lease and the hassle of stocking, say, printer ink. Travelers can use memberships at multiple locations. But the real value, co-working companies say, is a more innovative work culture. David Fano is chief growth officer for WeWork, the largest player, which has expanded to more than 220 worldwide offices in less than a decade. He says the biggest demand comes from large corporations looking for ways to make their workers happy and productive. DAVID FANO: How do companies engage in helping individuals be successful and fulfilled? NOGUCHI: Customers want WeWork to provide the basics, as well as to plan happy hours, cooking classes and to manage the online forums that keep workers engaged. FANO: Programming around wellness. We're doing a lot of things with workplace mindfulness, thinking about the kinds of food and beverages that are in the work environment and being just as thoughtful about that as we are with, like, ergonomics and furniture. NOGUCHI: There are several factors driving growth. Telework keeps growing, and independent workers, contractors, freelancers and the like make up a bigger part of the labor force. Plus, there are more tools that make it easier to collaborate online. Gretchen Spreitzer is a management professor at the University of Michigan and says there are psychic benefits. GRETCHEN SPREITZER: Qualitative research does show that people feel like they're more productive in the company of others that they trust rather than just sitting in a coffee shop. NOGUCHI: But, Spreitzer says, WeWork has plenty of competition. And it's under pressure to keep their members renewing month after month. SPREITZER: We're seeing today turnover of members and spaces as competitors come up with cooler spaces or other amenities. NOGUCHI: Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University, agrees. He says the big question is how big or valuable the co-working industry might be. Privately held WeWork is valued by some estimates at $20 billion, a sum Galloway doesn't believe is justified. SCOTT GALLOWAY: There are a lot of organizations that own real estate. They could probably offer somewhat of a me-too model. NOGUCHI: WeWork might not be that valuable, he says, but the company and the co-working movement are here to stay.

Yesterday the president gave a hint of who might be getting what. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class. Not just a little bit but tremendously. That includes nearly doubling the standard deduction that most families take on their taxes and increasing the child tax credit. KELLY: Also businesses are expected to get a big tax break. How big? We'll find out some details later today. We already know big questions remain, like how will the U. S. pay for the cuts? Well, we've got two views this morning on that. Former chief economist for Vice President Biden, Jared Bernstein, is here. Good morning. JARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning. KELLY: And conservative economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland is also here. Good morning to you. PETER MORICI: Good morning. KELLY: Jared Bernstein, I'm going to let you get the first word in here, and I want you to start with what we just heard the president say - this plan will help the middle class, he says, tremendously. Will it? BERNSTEIN: No. In fact, I suspect this plan will hurt the middle class. And, you know, you really can't trust the things that President Trump has said about this tax plan because they've been completely inconsistent with the plans that he himself has actually proposed. KELLY: How is this going to hurt the middle class? BERNSTEIN: In two ways. First of all, by really sharply cutting taxes at the high end of the scale, particularly for corporations, multinational corporations, and for high-end, pass-through businesses - so small businesses that make a lot of money, hedge funds, law firms - most of the benefits, about 70 percent of the benefits of this cut, end up at the top 1 percent. That means there's very little for anybody else, and that means that unless you're going to load this all on the deficit, you're going to have to cut the heck out of spending, spending that supports moderate and low-income families. KELLY: Well, Peter Morici, jump in here. Is this going to add up to a whopper of a tax cut for the richest Americans? MORICI: No, I don't think so. They're going to increase the standard deduction. They're going to simplify the tax system. They basically have earmarked $150 billion a year which is going to increase the deficit. Now, when Mr. Obama was in office, Mr. Bernstein was very happy to do that. Now that Mr. Trump is in office, he's not. The difference is they're going to give the money back to people. Will it benefit wealthy people? Yes, they're going to get some money back. Will middle-class people be benefited? Well, by doubling the standard deduction, not only will they pay less taxes but they will have a much simpler income-tax return. There's two dimensions here. A hundred-and-fifty billion is not a huge amount of money, but they're going to spread it around. And the other dimension is people don't like the system. So this simplifies it for ordinary people. If you want to make points with people, make it easier to file taxes. KELLY: And that's one of the - that's - one of the key points here, if they are going to narrow the number of tax brackets, take it down from seven. BERNSTEIN: Quick fact-check. The deficit under Obama went from 10 percent down to 3 percent. That's just factually incorrect. So on the - look, on the middle class, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has run the numbers. And they found that as far as what's been proposed so far, initially, the middle-class income would go up about 1 percent under this plan. The top income would go about 12 - go up about 12 or 13 percent. Now, that's before. So the middle class gets bupkis, as my grandma used to say. That's Yiddish for almost nothing. KELLY: OK. BERNSTEIN: After the spending cuts that kick-in down the road to offset the deficit - and its 1. 5 trillion over - over 10 years. So that's - that's real money even here - then you see middle-class incomes actually go down. And for families at the bottom end of the scale according to this analysis, their income goes down by 16 percent. So we already have an inequality problem in this country. We already have a lack of revenue problem in this country. This plan exacerbates both of them. It gives us more inequality and less resources to help folks in need. KELLY: Peter, jump in on this question of the deficit. Can - can you rewrite the tax code in this way without adding to the deficit? MORICI: You either have to cut entitlements or add to the deficit. Entitlements are now 60 percent of the budget, and they're on track to be a hundred percent of revenue within 10 years. Now, there are elements of entitlements programs which I find abhorrent. For example, we're paying men who are perfectly able-bodied at the age of 35 not to work, through Section-8 housing, bogus Social Security disabilities, access to Medicaid. These are people without children. They just sit at home in Bangor, Maine, and, you know, play video games. I don't know why a waitress, a mom, with three kids and no husband should send taxes to Washington so that, you know, Senator Collins can send them back to Maine to subsidize one of those guys. So if we're talking about. . . KELLY: Am I hearing some agreement here from you two? One way or the other is likely to add to the deficit, at least in the short-term? MORICI: You can't cut taxes and not change spending without adding to the deficit. That's arithmetic. Conservatives and liberals can at least do arithmetic together. But I'm really surprised by the volume of numbers that I've heard this morning simply because we haven't seen the plan. You can't score a plan until you've seen it. So let's not prejudge it. BERNSTEIN: Well, actually, we've seen more than you think. So for example. . . MORICI: Really? BERNSTEIN: Yeah. So the administration has suggested that they're going to cut the corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, OK? Thirty-five to 20. That's a big - that's a big cut. And 30 percent of those benefits go to the top 1 percent. Only 15 percent of those benefits go to the middle class and below. So it's a good example of precisely the type of tilted-to-the-top problem I'm talking about. And furthermore, who's doing great in this economy? It's the corporate sector. KELLY: All right. And lots of questions still ahead about what details we're going to get on this and whether it will actually be able to come to a vote by the end of the year. That's former chief economist for Vice President Biden, Jared Bernstein, and Peter Morici of the University of Maryland. Thanks to you both for stopping by.

Front and center is a big cut in taxes on business with the goal of spurring economic growth. David Wessel is a director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. Yesterday, you may recall, he talked to us through the question of who would benefit from the GOP tax plan. Today he's back to talk to us about what it might mean for business. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. KELLY: So it seems like one of the things you always hear when people talk about the business tax code is that it is broken. So let me start there - is it broken? WESSEL: Yes. Look, the tax rate on corporate profits in the United States is 35 percent. That's higher than in other major countries. And that's encouraging companies who can locate elsewhere to do so. The tax code encourages companies to rely more on debt to finance themselves than on selling shares of stock. And it doesn't reflect the realities of globalization, a world in which capital can easily move across borders and companies can park their patents and tax havens and so forth. But the problem is we've got to figure out how to change the business tax code to encourage businesses to invest in the U. S. without losing a lot of revenue - the corporate tax brings in about $300 billion a year - and without giving a windfall to the best-off Americans, some of whom are entrepreneurs creating the future and some of whom are simply making or inheriting a lot of money. KELLY: OK. So the goal is encouraging businesses to invest. Does this tax plan, as far as you've seen so far - does it - would it do that? WESSEL: Yes. Essentially, by letting business keep more of the profits from their investments, we think they would invest more. It would lower the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, cut the tax on many businesses that aren't legally organized as corporations. It will allow companies to deduct all their spending on computers and machines in the year in which they spend the money instead of spreading the deductions out over time. So direction - yes, up - it would encourage businesses to invest more than they do today. KELLY: But the big-picture question then becomes - would this boost the overall economy? I mean, that's the big goal here. Right? Would this create jobs? WESSEL: Exactly. So fans of the plan, like the president, say it would boost investment a tremendous amount, unleash a wave of faster productivity growth and eventually higher wages. Maybe. . . KELLY: What do you say? WESSEL: Well, it seems to take more than the promise of slightly higher profits to prompt businesses to invest. After all, business investment has been very disappointing lately, even though businesses can borrow very cheaply, the stock market's high. And then the other thing is if you're going to cut the business tax and run up the deficit, to think about the big picture, you have to think about - how are we going to close this deficit? What taxes will we raise? What spending will we cut? Will we get higher interest rates? And that could hurt the economy. KELLY: Let me circle you back to where we started then. Would this tax plan and these cuts bring an end to the exodus of jobs and American corporate headquarters to overseas? WESSEL: Would it end it? No. Look, American multinationals are going to continue to invest and employ overseas because they have so many customers there. And some companies are going to figure out ways to move their patents to tax havens to reduce their taxes. But the point of the exercise is this - companies say, we're going to Ireland because they're not going to tax us very much. And this plan responds by saying, OK, then the U. S. won't tax you very much either. It'll reduce, though it certainly won't eliminate, the incentive for companies to shift profits and production and jobs overseas. KELLY: All right.

After the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Republican Congress and President Trump are turning their attention to a tax overhaul.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Texas Republican Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. But some early analysis suggests the GOP tax plan would mostly benefit the wealthy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: Under this plan, the wealthiest Americans and wealthiest corporations make out like bandits while middle-class Americans are left holding the bag. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So who will benefit? Professor of law Dorothy Brown from Emory University writes on how tax policy impacts minorities, and she joins us now. Thanks for being with us. DOROTHY BROWN: Thank you for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: From what you've read, how would this outline proposal affect minorities in this country? BROWN: So when you look at who is benefiting - so, for example, they're keeping the homeownership tax subsidy, mortgage interest deduction. That's going to benefit more whites than blacks and Latinos, who don't own homes to the same extent. They're keeping retirement plans. Retirement plans from private employers tend to go to those who hold jobs at the higher incomes which, again, tend to be disproportionately white. So we know that even with the minimal sketching that we see in the Trump tax plan, rich, white Americans are going to benefit the most. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's talk about the deduction known as head of household. That's what single parents use. This. . . BROWN: Correct. GARCIA-NAVARRO: . . . Tax plan doesn't mention them, so it's not really clear what the fate may be. But first, explain what that is and why it's important for single parents in particular. BROWN: So there's a system for singles. There's a system for married, and there's a tax system if you're head of household. So you're a single parent. The rate structure for you is better than, for example, a single tax payer. So that means a single mother or a single father is going to ultimately pay lower taxes. That isn't included in this plan. Maybe it gets added back in. Maybe it doesn't. But if it doesn't, then that's going to be detrimental to single parents. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And single parents are overwhelmingly minorities? BROWN: Yes. That's absolutely right - will impact disproportionate percentage of people of color. You're a single parent. You're trying to make ends meet, and Uncle Sam wants to tax you more. GARCIA-NAVARRO: If you were asked to create a tax code that gave the middle class a break, what would it look like? What would you like to see? BROWN: I'd like to see a tax break targeted towards two-earner household because right now, if you have two single earners who get married, they pay higher taxes. And it just so happens that black married couples are more likely to have two equal-wage earners. And white married couples are more likely to have single-wage earner, stay-at-home spouses. So as it works out, white married couples - more likely get a tax cut. Black married couples - more likely to pay higher taxes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We've been speaking about the impact of this tax policy on people of color. What are you hearing among leaders and minority groups about what their impression is and what they're prepared to do about it? BROWN: You know, honestly, I haven't seen much about that. So I think it's really important that we're having this conversation because I happen to think it's the 21st-century issue. You know, you shouldn't pay more taxes because of the color of your skin.

After many, many months of growth, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded some backsliding in September. The economy lost 33,000 jobs. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins us now. Jim, what went wrong? JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Well, it was almost certainly due to one thing, which is the hurricanes, all the bad weather we saw in Texas and the Southeast that - especially Hurricane Irma because that took place during the period in September when the Labor Department surveys businesses about, you know, job creation. Meanwhile, people were still recovering from Harvey and all the flooding that caused in, you know, Texas and Louisiana. Maria was not really a factor because this survey by the Labor Department doesn't include Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. But just in general, you know, people weren't able to get to work. You saw a big drop in hotel and restaurant jobs, lots of them in Florida. So this isn't a surprise at all. I think most economists were expecting, you know, job creation to go down, perhaps not this much. But they thought this was going to happen. It is remarkable in the sense that this is the first time in 83 months, really since 2010, that the economy lost jobs during the month. INSKEEP: Wow, significant step back. But with these hurricanes, you do have more activity when places start to rebuild. Will there be a bounce back? ZARROLI: Yes, I think you'll see a rebound pretty quickly in the months to come. You know, there's rebuilding. As you point out, construction jobs get created. And this is still, you know, a pretty healthy economy. Before these numbers came out, we saw on average 176,000 jobs created every month this year. And that's not, you know, spectacular growth, but it is, you know, fairly steady, strong growth. You're hearing a lot of information, a lot of anecdotal information from businesses about how much trouble they're finding workers. So the job market is basically tight, and it's going to remain so for a while. INSKEEP: This is what we've heard in the last few months when we've interviewed business owners, that the problem is they can't find enough qualified people. Is that improving people's paychecks, the tight labor market? ZARROLI: Well, this - we did see an increase in wages in September. Hourly wages have now - are going up at a rate of almost 3 percent this year, so you're seeing a rise in wages. And that's important because the Federal Reserve is going to look at that when it meets in December and decides what to do about interest rates. I mean, always, they have this concern about inflation. You know, when do they start to rein in - increase interest rates and try to rein in the economy? So that's what they're going to be thinking about. There's a lot of debate about whether this is the right time to do that. But I think the wage numbers we see today will make it a bit more likely that we'll see an interest rate increase. INSKEEP: Jim, thanks for the insight. Appreciate it. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

Rick Hammond has harvested soybeans, corn and cattle in Nebraska for 40 years. In \"This Blessed Earth\" by Ted Genoways, Rick and his family confront climate change, family tensions and a recently revived pipeline project that jeopardizes their land. Ted Genoways' new book \"This Blessed Earth\" documents a year in modern farm life in Nebraska. And he joins me now from WCBE in Columbus, Ohio. Welcome to the program. TED GENOWAYS: Thanks so much for having me on. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Can you tell me a little bit about Nebraska's land and what it means to its residents, the farmers? GENOWAYS: Yeah. So Nebraska is in many ways a typical Great Plains state. Because the Missouri River cuts through along the eastern edge of the state, that's where all of the population originally settled. And so you have major industrial centers in south Sioux City and in Omaha. And then you have the capital educational center of Lincoln. But when you travel west of Lincoln, there's almost no one there. The small farming communities have gotten smaller and smaller in the last 50 years. And you can drive for hours essentially seeing only flatlands that are planted to corn and to soybeans and occasionally dotted with hog barns and feedlots for cattle. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Speaking to that disappearing landscape, I'd like you to read a page from your book, page 69. GENOWAYS: (Reading) To understand, first remember - Nebraska is a place. It sits square as an anvil in the center of our maps. And yet somehow, everyone manages to forget it exists. Maybe that's because Nebraska is also a land of ghosts, of small towns dwindling to the point where in another generation they might simply cease to exist. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why are they disappearing? Where are they going? GENOWAYS: The biggest thing that's happened in the last 50 years is a lot of mechanization that has been aimed at trying to save labor for farmers. At the same time, farm operations have gotten bigger. You can do more with this high-tech equipment and do it with fewer people. What that means when you have fewer people on the farm is that you have less need for all the things that you need when you have a community. You don't need as many doctors and nurses. You don't need as many schoolteachers. And we're now reaching a point where the farmers who have remained on the land are quite isolated and often face long trips just to get to any place where there might be a school or there might be some sort of cultural activity. And it leaves them relatively separated from the national conversation, even as the politics of the country and of the world directly bear on their lives. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How does that impact them and their views on the rest of the country? GENOWAYS: I think one of the things that has certainly happened is that when you lose your population, when the towns start to die, you lose your local newspaper. For the towns that were large enough, you lose your local radio station. So now the way that the news arrives to farming communities is through AM radio, which is often conservative talk radio. And it arrives via television and the Internet. And that means that those local issues get less coverage, and they make it into the national conversation less. But it also means that all of the polarization of our current political moment has made it all the way down to these tiny communities. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how is that played out? GENOWAYS: Well, one of the great conundrums of where we've arrived at this particular moment is that farm communities across the middle of the country voted for Donald Trump at a rate of about 3 to 1, carried about 75 percent of the farm vote. And yet he was running on a platform that he would end the trade agreements that farmers are wholly dependent upon. And now as he has come in and canceled the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has talked about wanting to renegotiate NAFTA, it introduces tremendous amounts of uncertainty. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you think the future is of some of these communities? You're talking about them dwindling, about increasing isolation. But they are at the center of a massive industry to which we are all so indebted and tied to. GENOWAYS: Well, I think the future of the communities themselves is that they're going to continue to shrink. And I think that many of them will disappear. The movement with the technology is aimed toward fewer and fewer farm workers. But I also think that we're not very far away from a point where the large interests in agribusiness will be pushing for an Ag system that has no farmers. And so as we've already been more and more divorced from the food system, I think our connection to our food and our sense of how that routes us in place and connects us to the planet has been radically reshaped and not for the better.

His career as an economist and central banker is unique. As an MIT professor, Stanley Fischer's graduate student advisees included former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the head of the European Bank, Mario Draghi, and George W. Bush's White House economic adviser, Gregory Mankiw. Fischer was a senior official at both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. And in 2005, he took a job as head of the Bank of Israel, where he is credited with stabilizing that country's economy even as other economies suffered through the Great Recession. Then it was back to the U. S. and the Fed as second in command to Janet Yellen. Thanks for talking with us today. STANLEY FISCHER: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: I want to ask you about the Federal Reserve. It's a unique institution - a central banking system, not a central bank - with both public and private characteristics. There are critics who say that it should be more transparent. Should the proceedings of the Federal Reserve be available to Congress and the public, or would that risk politicizing monetary policy too much? FISCHER: Well, they are published. The transcripts of the discussions are published with a five-year leg, which is probably the shortest among any government institutions. There is a problem with discussing unusual ideas in a public meeting. And if you say, gee, you know, we're getting stuck on this and I thought about that; what do you guys think, you're asking for people's reactions. You're not making a proposal. And that disappears if everything comes out immediately. So I think the five years is workable. I think the Fed is very transparent. The chair testifies four times a year at the Congress, and everybody speaks. SIEGEL: But chairs of the Fed speak in a notoriously opaque dialect of English, which is often hard to follow. And five years puts the actions of the Fed into the historical record. It's not what we would call instant transparency. FISCHER: But Robert, it's not a matter of instant transparency. It's a matter of the fact that that is the final description of what was said. There are minutes within three weeks of the meeting. There are presentations. There are speeches. I don't think there's a whole lot that is going on except very incipient ideas. SIEGEL: When you serve at the Fed, since it is this odd hybrid version of a central banking system, do you feel like an officer of the government of the United States of America, part of the federal government? FISCHER: Well, I had a former member of the Fed who always used to say the Fed is of the government but not in the government. I wasn't absolutely sure what it meant. SIEGEL: (Laughter) I was going to. . . FISCHER: But it sounds (laughter) - it sounds about right. SIEGEL: OK. FISCHER: Yes, you feel you're part of the government. But do you feel you're part of the government which the rest of the government feels free to attack when the need arises in their view. SIEGEL: They can attack, but they do so pretty well knowing that you're insulated from those attacks. FISCHER: Yes, you are insulated. When I was governor of the Bank of Israel, I used to say, we are independent. But understand that two bad decisions, and we're not independent. SIEGEL: I see. That was the limit of independence. I want to ask you about Fed policy and the economy these days. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates very, very low. Stock market's going gangbusters, and one explanation that skeptics offer is that it's because you can't make anything from any interest yielding security, therefore money goes into stocks. Is there an equities bubble, a stock market bubble right now in America? FISCHER: Well, with low interest rates, stock market prices will tend to be higher than they would be if the interest rates were higher. So people who sort of look at the stock market compared with when interest rates were 6 percent or 7 percent will say values are very high. But we don't think we're in a situation where we have an inflationary bubble or an unsustainable set of prices in the asset markets. But we don't comment on that. And I shouldn't go on. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Well, when you referred to the days of 6 and 7 percent rates of interest, should we assume for the rest of our natural lives - those of us with a few decades left, let's say - that we won't see such days again? FISCHER: It's so hard in economics to know what is coming down the road. As economists say, it's very difficult to forecast, especially about the future. SIEGEL: (Laughter) OK. You could remain as vice chair for another few months. But couldn't you remain in office until June if you chose? FISCHER: I could remain in office until June, but I have personal reasons for stepping down now. SIEGEL: And if you were to give advice to somebody on the way in about the Federal Reserve and what wisdom you've gained about it, what would your advice be to a new vice chair or a new governor? FISCHER: You know, it's the usual advice to anybody going into a new institution. Don't throw your weight around until you know in which direction to throw it. Remember; you are in a professional agency with a legal mandate to keep prices stable and to keep full employment. That's the role of the Fed defined in the law. SIEGEL: Stanley Fischer, retiring vice chair of the Federal Reserve, thanks a lot for talking with us today. Good luck. FISCHER: Thank you, Robert.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: NAFTA was the worst trade deal in the history - it's, like, the history of this country. MONTAGNE: Trump blames NAFTA for the loss of millions of U. S. manufacturing jobs. Now his administration is demanding changes during current negotiations, changes that may be difficult for Mexico and Canada to accept. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, that's making many American farmers and ranchers nervous. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: In the fellowship hall of a Lutheran church on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Chip Councell, a local farmer, is singing the praises of the lunch the church ladies just served to a trade delegation from Taiwan. CHIP COUNCELL: This is truly a local meal. Local sweet corn, tomatoes, crab cakes from the local rivers. . . YDSTIE: This little white church sits in the middle of corn and soybean fields on America's rich farm land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Chesapeake Bay. Councell raises corn, soybeans and wheat. His ancestors began farming here in 1690. COUNCELL: My son farms with us in the operation, and he is the 11th generation. YDSTIE: And Councell says in today's world, U. S. farmers have to look abroad for markets. COUNCELL: Ninety six percent of the world's population lives outside of our borders. We are very blessed in this country to have productive farm land, productive agricultural system. And if we are going to grow and prosper, then the outside of our borders - that is our market. YDSTIE: Canada and Mexico, America's NAFTA partners, are two of the biggest markets for U. S. farmers. For instance, Mexico is the No. 1 buyer of U. S. corn. So Councell, a past president of the U. S. Grains Council, says he and a lot of other corn farmers were alarmed when candidate Trump attacked NAFTA, a trade deal that has opened the door for U. S. corn exports to Mexico and Canada. He says he has been told by Trump administration officials that they understand NAFTA's importance for agriculture. COUNCELL: One of the main goals that we've been told by the administration is to do no harm to agriculture. Having said that, unfortunately, if we look back over time in history, if there are trade disputes among countries, easily, agriculture is the one that gets hit first and hit the hardest. YDSTIE: Trade expert Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics agrees. CHAD BOWN: Yes, I think it's inevitable that agriculture will suffer collateral damage if the NAFTA agreement is terminated or somehow ends up being in much diminished form. Agriculture has been such a success story for the United States. YDSTIE: And not just for corn exports. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Let's give Mike another big round of applause. (APPLAUSE)YDSTIE: At the North Dakota Stockmen's Association meeting in Fargo recently, a roomful of ranchers in big hats and pearl button shirts heard speakers talk about the relationship between exports and prices. Julie Ellingson, who raises cattle with her husband south of Mandan, is the group's executive vice president. JULIE ELLINGSON: Beef exports drive about $300 of value per animal. And so that is real dollars and cents to the farmers and ranchers across North Dakota not only because of the pounds of meat that goes across the borders, the kinds of beef that those foreign consumers are purchasing - things that don't have as much value here in the United States. YDSTIE: Cuts like tongue, liver and kidneys are more valuable in Mexico, which buys $800 million worth of U. S. beef a year. Canada imports a billion dollars' worth a year, including a lot of middle cuts, like steaks and roasts. NAFTA pushed tariffs to zero, virtually eliminating the barriers to the beef trade between the U. S. and its two neighbors. The Trump administration has said its goal is to make sure U. S. farmers don't lose in the renegotiation of NAFTA. But back amid the cornfields of Maryland's Eastern Shore, Chip Councell says he's not sure how it will turn out. COUNCELL: I don't think anybody knows. We're optimistic. We're hopeful but a little bit nervous, as well. YDSTIE: John Ydstie, NPR News.

But the White House already has one of its main talking points. This week, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that American households would get what she called a $4,000 raise from the plan. NPR political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben has been digging into this number, what it means and how realistic it is. And she's here with us in the studio to tell us about what she's learned. Hi, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: So an extra $4,000 would be a big deal for a lot of American families. You report, though, that households should not count on this kind of a raise. Why not? KURTZLEBEN: Right. So we can't exactly fact-check a prediction. But here's what I can tell you. There are several reasons to doubt this figure. And this is tax policy. And that means it's complicated. SHAPIRO: Well, lay it out for us. KURTZLEBEN: All right. So in a recent report, the White House's Council of Economic Advisers said this - if we cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent - that it will help workers. The basic idea here is that when a company pays taxes, some of that burden gets passed on to workers, resulting in lower wages. So a higher tax bill ends up resulting in lower wages. Likewise, a lower tax bill would result in higher wages for workers. But here's the important thing. Economists disagree widely on how much of a business's corporate tax burden is eventually passed on to workers. SHAPIRO: So how'd the White House get this specific number, $4,000? KURTZLEBEN: Right. So to reach that $4,000 figure, the White House looked at a range of estimates but then relied on one particular one to do the math. And that ended up showing that the average household in one year would end up getting more than $4,000 in income. Incidentally, not only that, but the White House says that that $4,000 is a conservative estimate. They also said the actual figure could go as high as $9,000 per household. But there are other economists with other estimates. And, in fact, until very recently, the Treasury Department's website included a paper saying the corporations really don't pass all that much of their tax bills onto their workers, at least not as much as this White House says they do. And, incidentally, that paper recently disappeared from the Treasury Department's website. SHAPIRO: Well, can a corporate tax cut end up helping average workers? KURTZLEBEN: Yes, absolutely. That's not a stretch. But the question is how much. I mean, look, even some right-leaning economists would argue that the White House is being overly optimistic in its math here. One critique they have is about fiscal discipline - that a tax cut that grows the deficit in a big way, as this plan very well might, could eventually hurt overall economic growth. And, of course, there's some criticism from the left. Some economists there say, you know, look, if you really want to give working-class people more money, just give them a tax cut instead of hoping and assuming that corporations will pass, you know, more money on to workers. And, by the way, we don't know exactly yet who would pay what rate under a new GOP plan. But the important thing to remember here is this - we're only talking right now about the corporate part of the tax overhaul. That's what this $4,000 figure refers to. Whatever Congress ends up doing is going to be broader than that. It's going to be about individual rates, deductions - that sort of thing. SHAPIRO: And it seems like even when we do have a specific plan from Congress, the answer to this question - will the $4,000 raise be real? - won't be known until the bill ultimately passes, if it passes. KURTZLEBEN: Absolutely. And it will take some time. It's not going to happen immediately. These things take time to work into the system. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks a lot, Danielle. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  There's not yet a bill for the Republican plan to overhaul the tax code.

The story comes from a new survey of Americans of all races and ethnicities. It's being released this morning by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and it finds that a majority of people of all races, including white people, report that their group is discriminated against. This morning we focus on one particular finding, money may not shield people from bigotry. The survey included African-Americans, and it found that more prosperous black Americans, those making more than $75,000 a year, report more negative experiences than people who make less. NPR's Brakkton Booker reports. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Phillip Thompson is 55 years old and lives in an exclusive gated community with a golf course in one of the wealthiest excerpts of Washington, D. C. How you doing? PHILLIP THOMPSON: I'm all right, bro. How you doing? (SOUNDBITE OF KEY TURNING IN DOOR)THOMPSON: Come on in. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SHUTTING)BOOKER: Once inside, he gives me a tour of his home. African art decorates the walls. Framed pictures of his kids hang in the entrance. And. . . THOMPSON: Of course, an American flag. My wife and I both are military. This is my wife's, what they call a shadowbox. When you retire from the Air Force, they made her a nice shadowbox with all her medals and ribbons and ranks. BOOKER: Thompson is a retired lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, a Gulf War veteran and a lawyer with his own practice. He's also the president of his local NAACP chapter. But when Thompson moved to this Leesburg, Va. , neighborhood 12 years ago, he says many of his mostly white neighbors made assumptions about how he could afford this house. THOMPSON: You couldn't have gotten here on your guile, on your knowledge, on being capable. Had to be a football player. BOOKER: Well, he found that assumption deeply offensive. THOMPSON: So I just played to it and said, nah, I'm a rapper. Or, I'm a pimp. I'm a retired pimp. I'm a play to your stereotypes because then it makes you look even stupider. BOOKER: Thompson's wife, Tanja, is a former senior master sergeant in the Air Force and now works as a mediator for the federal government. She says discrimination plays out in subtle ways. TANJA: Even living here in a gated community, there's definitely racism. And you see it walking down the street.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This next story suggests how hard it can be to avoid racial discrimination. The story comes from a new survey of Americans of all races and ethnicities. It's being released this morning by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and it finds that a majority of people of all races, including white people, report that their group is discriminated against. This morning we focus on one particular finding, money may not shield people from bigotry. The survey included African-Americans, and it found that more prosperous black Americans, those making more than $75,000 a year, report more negative experiences than people who make less. NPR's Brakkton Booker reports. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Phillip Thompson is 55 years old and lives in an exclusive gated community with a golf course in one of the wealthiest excerpts of Washington, D. C. How you doing? PHILLIP THOMPSON: I'm all right, bro. How you doing? (SOUNDBITE OF KEY TURNING IN DOOR) THOMPSON: Come on in. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SHUTTING) BOOKER: Once inside, he gives me a tour of his home. African art decorates the walls. Framed pictures of his kids hang in the entrance. And. . . THOMPSON: Of course, an American flag. My wife and I both are military. This is my wife's, what they call a shadowbox. When you retire from the Air Force, they made her a nice shadowbox with all her medals and ribbons and ranks. BOOKER: Thompson is a retired lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, a Gulf War veteran and a lawyer with his own practice. He's also the president of his local NAACP chapter. But when Thompson moved to this Leesburg, Va. , neighborhood 12 years ago, he says many of his mostly white neighbors made assumptions about how he could afford this house. THOMPSON: You couldn't have gotten here on your guile, on your knowledge, on being capable. Had to be a football player. BOOKER: Well, he found that assumption deeply offensive. THOMPSON: So I just played to it and said, nah, I'm a rapper. Or, I'm a pimp. I'm a retired pimp. I'm a play to your stereotypes because then it makes you look even stupider. BOOKER: Thompson's wife, Tanja, is a former senior master sergeant in the Air Force and now works as a mediator for the federal government. She says discrimination plays out in subtle ways. TANJA: Even living here in a gated community, there's definitely racism. And you see it walking down the street. You see people, and you see them maybe in a professional setting, but when you see them out on the street, they turn the other direction. And then, too, they wonder, why are you here? Or, how did you get here? BOOKER: A new NPR poll finds a little more than half of all black respondents say they have been on the receiving end of negative comments.

Some have called the Fed chair the second-most powerful role in Washington after the president. And to review the candidates for the job, we are joined now by NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie. Hiya. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Robert. SIEGEL: First, why is being Fed chairman such a powerful thing? YDSTIE: Well, of course, it's about our pocketbooks. By steering interest rate policy, the Fed chair affects economic growth, job growth, inflation. And so the Fed can have a huge effect on our economic well-being. SIEGEL: Who's thought to be under consideration for the chairman's job? YDSTIE: Well, most recently, in an interview on Sunday on Fox Business News, Trump mentioned three names - John Taylor, an economist currently at Stanford University, Jerome Powell, a current Federal Reserve governor, and the current chair, Janet Yellen. SIEGEL: Let's take them one at a time then. First, John Taylor - what might we expect if he were leading the Fed? YDSTIE: Well, actually, Taylor is probably the easiest candidate to contrast with Yellen. He's an economist and the author of something called the Taylor rule. It's essentially an equation that takes the current growth rate and the level of inflation and determines where the Fed should set interest rates. If implemented, it could put Fed decisions on interest rates on autopilot. Some conservatives in Congress have advocated for it, but critics, including Yellen, say it's not sensitive enough to what's happening in the real world. Now, Taylor says he would be flexible, but he has criticized the Fed for holding interest rates too low after the financial crisis, and a Taylor Fed would no doubt raise rates faster than the Yellen Fed. SIEGEL: OK. That's Taylor. We can remember him. He's got algorithm. YDSTIE: He does. SIEGEL: And now we'll go on to Mr. Powell. YDSTIE: Yeah. Powell is a former investment banker and a conservative appointed by Barack Obama, though. Many analysts suggest he would be inclined to raise rates faster than Yellen but probably not a lot faster. Powell is a former investment banker and had a top Treasury post under the first President Bush. Of all the candidates, I would say Powell would probably provide the greatest level of continuity with the Yellen Fed. SIEGEL: Unless Janet Yellen herself, who would be the third possibility, were named to another term. YDSTIE: Well, that could happen. Trump was critical of her during the presidential campaign, but several times since, he said he thought Yellen had done a good job. And during the - that interview last Sunday, he had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot. I really like her a lot. YDSTIE: And in some ways, that's not very surprising. The president, after all, is a real estate developer, and real estate developers love low interest rates, and that's been the hallmark of the Yellen Fed. SIEGEL: Couple of other names have been in the mix, including Gary Cohn, who heads Trump's National Economic Council at the White House, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor. Are they seen as being out of the running now? YDSTIE: Well, with President Trump, you never know, but there are multiple reports today that, according to sources, Trump says Cohn is out of the running and that Trump wants him to stay at the White House working on the tax overhaul. Warsh was once considered the front-runner, but he too has advocated for higher interest rates. In fact, during the response of the financial crisis, when he was a Fed governor, he criticized the Bernanke Fed for holding rates too low, warning that it would likely lead to runaway inflation. That didn't happen. Inflation stayed extremely low. So he called it wrong and yet he continues to advocate for higher interest rates, which, as we said, Trump doesn't favor. SIEGEL: One thing that we know about Donald Trump and economic policy is that he watches the Dow very closely. I mean, he's constantly mentioning the markets and how well - his spokeswoman at the White House is always telling us, why aren't you talking about how well the market is doing? Do we know what Wall Street, what the market would like to see in the way of a new Fed chair? YDSTIE: Well I think the market would be happy for a continuation of Yellen because she's kept rates low, and low rates are good for stocks. SIEGEL: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thanks.

We saw deadly fires here in California, hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas and Florida. Across the U. S. , people are rebuilding homes and businesses and schools. But let's talk about a different kind of damage, to people's sense that they can plan for the future. A study suggests, after disasters, a kind of psychic shock can be even more lasting. Here's NPR's Nurith Aizenman. NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: Marcia Bauer owns a feed and gear store serving cattle ranchers around the rural Texas town of Winnie. Before Hurricane Harvey hit this summer, she was investing a lot of money to attract more customers, getting involved in horse competitions, agricultural festivals. . . MARCIA BAUER: And then I just had an electronic sign installed to help boost my business. It hadn't been up a month before the hurricane hit. AIZENMAN: Bauer's business ground to a halt, but she thinks eventually things will pick up. For her, long term, the biggest casualty could be her ambition for her business. Bauer says from now on her focus will probably just be on building up emergency reserves. BAUER: Like I told my husband, I said I just - I've given up on setting goals because you take one step forward, three steps backwards. AIZENMAN: A new study suggests this kind of reaction by people, scaling back their aspirations and the economic choices they make as a result, could be a common effect of natural disasters. The evidence comes from Pakistan, which in 2010 went through a sort of Harvey of its own. KATRINA KOSEC: There was a massive flood that was larger than any flood the country had seen in about 80 years. AIZENMAN: Katrina Kosec is an economist at the International Food Policy Research Institute and one of the authors of the study. KOSEC: You literally had a fifth of the country under water. AIZENMAN: And as with so many of the recent disasters in the U. S. , the floods in Pakistan felt out of the blue. KOSEC: Communities got a shock that they couldn't have anticipated. AIZENMAN: A year and a half after the flood, Kosec and her collaborator surveyed about a thousand households in those communities and a virtually identical group of households that had not gone through the flood. KOSEC: So you're comparing individuals with the same amount of income, the same amount of assets that might fuel their future hopes and dreams. AIZENMAN: And they asked them about those hopes and dreams. How much annual income do they eventually hope to make? How many years of schooling do they want for their kids? The results, recently published in the journal World Development, the flood survivors had much lower aspirations. What's more, says Kosec. . . KOSEC: A fatalism really took hold. AIZENMAN: The flood survivors were less likely to do things that might expand their businesses, like taking loans. But the study also found that there's something that can counter the fatalism, and here's how this applies to the U. S. KOSEC: All of the negative effects of the floods in Pakistan on people's aspirations are coming from those communities in which the government did not come in to support people. AIZENMAN: People who had the cushion of even just a little government aid, they held on to their aspirations. Nurith Aizenman, NPR News.

NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a poll.

And he found that when faced with those obstacles, many people choose to get out and strike out on their own. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: It's an October heat wave in Los Angeles, and Dennis Jackson is making the best of it selling solar panels. Jackson has essentially always been an entrepreneur. He started in landscaping and moved to solar panel installation. DENNIS JACKSON: Both the reason I chose landscape and solar - there's not many black people in the industry. There are some black guys that are landscapers, and we look at each other as unicorns because there's not many of us. GLINTON: Jackson is 40. He moved to LA in his teens from Detroit. Now, there have only been a few brief times when he's had a boss. JACKSON: When I first started, I did have a boss. And I didn't like having a boss. It's harder this way. GLINTON: Jackson has a very small operation - five employees and some independent contractors. And in many ways, he says he's always had the entrepreneurial spirit. It's his way of avoiding the glass ceiling. JACKSON: You know, so a piece of me says, yeah, I'm not going to have to go through that because I'm going to write my own ticket. I'm going to write my own ticket to not have to face, you know, discrimination. GLINTON: NPR and Harvard have published a survey that says 56 percent of African-Americans say they've been discriminated against in the workplace. Now, this is when they're being considered for promotion, applying for jobs and raises. Marc Morial heads the National Urban League, and he says discrimination can deter African-Americans from applying for certain jobs. MARC MORIAL: I'm not going over there to apply for a job because I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to go over there and apply for a job because I heard they don't like blacks. I'm not going to go over there and apply for a job 'cause after all, I've applied for five jobs in the last two months, and I haven't gotten one. There's a lot of that that goes on in the real world, particularly among younger workers. GLINTON: Now, the unemployment picture for black men has improved significantly since the Great Recession. But Marc Morial says what's hidden in these low jobless numbers is that many black men have simply fallen out of the workforce. Now, there's a whole menu of problems that lead to giving up. Race affects networking, education, mobility. STEVEN PITTS: First thing is the issue isn't really perception. It's reality. GLINTON: Steven Pitts studies labor at UC Berkeley, and his expertise is employment in black men. Pitts says there's real evidence of discrimination against African-American men in the workplace. And in response, black men especially look for alternatives outside of the traditional job market. PITTS: It can be simply the hustling - right? - where I need somebody to fix my car and I call a friend of mine to fix my car - right? - or someone who's painting my house or those sort of things. So the employment economy is not so much just the idea of on-the-corner drug stuff. It's a vast array of economic activity that simply isn't governed by traditional labor laws. GLINTON: Pitts says many black men face real barriers, whether it's a criminal record or the need for a license to get a particular job. But there's been a shift overall, including for white workers. The idea of getting one job and working for 35 years is a thing of the past for almost everyone. PITTS: For the last 30 years or so, we've seen a rise in informal economic activity. And we've seen a rise in kind of the shift in labor market activity away from an old model to a newer model. GLINTON: Pitts says the hustle which has been vital to the survival of black men for centuries - this is a shift the nation is going to have to embrace eventually.

Across the country and the border, Jim Zarroli visited Buffalo, N. Y. , where NAFTA has created jobs in areas that were economically depressed. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: At Speed Global Services, workers carry goods around the vast warehouse floor using motorized hand trucks. The company started out in trucking more than 70 years ago, carrying goods around western New York. As manufacturing slowed, it turned to warehousing. Today, Speed Global stores and transports products such as bras and lighting fixtures around North America, products made in China and Mexico. Company President Carl Savarino says it mostly works for Canadian companies. CARL SAVARINO: We send now probably around eight trucks a day to Canada. And that's just going in the greater Toronto Area. It's the largest population in Canada. And it's 90 miles away. So there's a lot of goods moving back and forth. ZARROLI: Savarino says it wouldn't be possible without NAFTA. Buffalo was once filled with great, hulking manufacturing plants. Richard Lipsitz of the Buffalo AFL-CIO says many of the jobs are now gone. RICHARD LIPSITZ: We've lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in the industrial workforce. This was the third-largest manufacturing city in North America - Buffalo, N. Y. , was. ZARROLI: Lipsitz says many of the jobs fled to low-wage countries decades ago. And NAFTA accelerated the process. Buffalo has adjusted by taking advantage of its border location. NAFTA has connected Buffalo to a web of international commerce. John Manzella heads the World Trade Center Buffalo Niagara. JOHN MANZELLA: You can be a buyer or a seller right here in western New York. You can jump in your car, visit a facility or a supplier or buyer in Hamilton, work out a deal and be back here for dinner. And that's the beauty of this relationship. ZARROLI: And that's been a lifeline for companies such as Niagara Transformer. The company makes large devices that help regulate the flow of electricity. They take months to build. CEO John Darby says, before NAFTA, Canadian companies didn't like to do business with U. S. companies like his. JOHN DARBY: Many customers would be worried, for example, that maybe the duties would change. Maybe the taxes would change at the border. So the economic calculation that they did perhaps might not be in effect when that transformer arrives at the border. ZARROLI: NAFTA has changed that. Darby now has large Canadian energy companies and utilities as customers. He buys specialty steel from an Ontario mill, and he employs Canadians under a special visa program. Mechanical engineer Eric Pelzer (ph) commutes from Ontario every day. ERIC PELZER: When I first started working over here, they all - you know, I said, well, yeah, I work in the States. They go, work in the States? How can you do that? But now everybody - there's so many more people that work over here. So they commute back and forth and work in different places. ZARROLI: For companies such as Niagara Transformer, the prospect that NAFTA could be renegotiated is a huge concern. Fifty-six-year-old Craig Duncan has worked at one manufacturing plant after another. One company moved to Ohio. Another was sold. Today, Duncan operates a computerized machine that customizes steel parts at Niagara Transformer. He's been there 15 years. CRAIG DUNCAN: I've been put out of work before by other factories. Hopefully, you know, we don't lose business because of change in trade agreements. Something like that would affect me directly. ZARROLI: But the AFL-CIO's Richard Lipsitz sees rewriting NAFTA as a chance to reverse some of the worst trends in manufacturing employment. LIPSITZ: We're concerned that the renegotiation of trade packages be done on a fair basis, not on the, quote, \"free\" basis. It isn't just a question of capital moving more easily, but it's also a question of labor rights. ZARROLI: Lipsitz says this is an especially big problem with Mexico. After NAFTA, many of the best jobs fled south of the border, where pay is much lower and worker rights are limited. The question is whether those concerns can be addressed without also hurting the Canadian trade that keeps Buffalo going. Jim Zarroli, NPR News. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The NAFTA negotiations will continue into next year. And Canada is now talking tough and continues to eye other markets like China. Later in the show, we'll take a look at a planned pipeline expansion meant to increase Canada's oil exports to Asia.

But 31 percent of Latinos report experiencing discrimination when looking for a house or an apartment. That's according to a new poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: About a year ago, Gustavo Douaihi and Laura Smith were looking to find a house to rent. They live in Baton Rouge, La. He's a geologist, and he's from Venezuela. She's a high school English teacher and grew up in Alabama. And they'd just gotten married. GUSTAVO DOUAIHI: We were living in this super, super, super tiny house. We had all of our wedding presents and just too many things in it. ARNOLD: And one day they saw a bigger house in the neighborhood come up for rent. LAURA SMITH: And when we saw the for rent sign, I pushed Gustavo to call and look into it. DOUAIHI: I left a voicemail. I'd said my name is Gustavo. I live in the neighborhood, but I'm interested in moving into another home and that I was a young, married guy looking for a place to live. ARNOLD: But he didn't hear back. SMITH: He called her back a week later or something like that, and she didn't return his call. ARNOLD: So after not hearing back twice. . . DOUAIHI: I said, I don't want to make any assumptions here. But I was like, why don't you give them a call and see if you get a call back? And she left a message saying, you know, this is Laura; I live in the neighborhood - just kind of a similar message. SMITH: And when I called and said my name which sounds very white, the woman texted me back, like, within five minutes. DOUAIHI: And we just kind of looked at each other. And I kind of started, you know, laughing. Hey, this kind of stuff happens all the time. But she got really upset. SMITH: I had a much stronger reaction. I was livid. The only different information she had between the two voicemails were our names. His first name is Gustavo, which is a Hispanic name. And I was horrified. ARNOLD: According to our poll, about one-third of Latino respondents said they had experienced some form of housing discrimination at some point in their lives. That's a striking number, but. . . STEPHEN ROSS: This happens much less than it used to. ARNOLD: Stephen Ross is an economist at the University of Connecticut. He's done research where pairs of so-called testers - white, black, Latino researchers - pose as people looking for a home. He says in the year 2000, a study found that nearly 7 percent of the time, Latinos were told that apartments were not available to rent when in fact they were, and white people were shown the units. But 12 years later, that happened only 2 percent of the time - a big improvement. That's not to say that he thinks that discrimination isn't the problem anymore. ROSS: I know every month, the Fair - the Connecticut Fair Housing Center in Connecticut finds clear evidence of discrimination and takes those landlords to court. ARNOLD: But Ross says over the past 30 years, enforcement efforts like this around the country have made a real impact. Still, even if it's less common these days, when it does happen, housing discrimination can be damaging and in some ways that you might not expect. Dr. Megan Sandel is a pediatrician and researcher at Boston Medical Center. MEGAN SANDEL: A safe, decent, affordable apartment can act like a vaccine. It can keep you healthy now and in the future. ARNOLD: Sandel says she's not just talking about, is there a lead paint or toxins in the house? But is the neighborhood safe? Are the schools good? What are the norms expected of young people? Do they go to college? SANDEL: And that has huge implications for your income and ultimately your life expectancy. Your ZIP code may be more important to your health than your genetic code. ARNOLD: Sandel's hospital is in Roxbury. It's a lower-income neighborhood in Boston with a large minority population. SANDEL: Right outside of our door here at Boston Medical Center, the average life expectancy is 58 years. You travel three miles down to the Back Bay, and the life expectancy is 91 years. And so we know that that is based on your environment. ARNOLD: Likewise, kids are more likely to have higher stress and more health problems in lower-income neighborhoods like this. So Sandel says if Latinos and other ethnic groups are being discriminated against and more end up in troubled neighborhoods. . . SANDEL: That's wrong, and we need to think about ways in which to solve it. ARNOLD: For their part, Gustavo Douaihi and Laura Smith bought a bigger house this past spring. But Gustavo says when the topic comes up, Laura still gets upset about it even more than he does. DOUAIHI: She hasn't stopped telling her family and her friends about it. And she's on my side, which is great (laughter). ARNOLD: Chris Arnold, NPR News.

They say the plan could discourage home buying and also push down home prices. Here's NPR's Chris Arnold. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Republicans say the new tax plan will simplify the tax code and give the typical American family of four nearly $1,200 in their pocket. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAUL RYAN: That will help you put more money away for college. It will help you save for retirement. We're making things so simple that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard. ARNOLD: Speaker Paul Ryan had a tax form the size of a postcard and waved it before the cameras yesterday. But Jamie Gregory with the National Association of Realtors says it's not that simple. JAMIE GREGORY: It will be bad for middle-class homeowners all across the country. ARNOLD: Gregory says there are a lot of moving parts that make it not simple. The plan would block you from writing off your state and local income tax. Property tax write offs would also be capped. Meanwhile, the standard deduction would be bigger. And all that taken together would mean that it wouldn't make sense anymore for most homeowners to itemize, and so very few would get the mortgage deduction tax break. GREGORY: It takes away the incentive to own a home. For the vast majority of America, you're making no difference between renting and owning. ARNOLD: Gregory says his group is still crunching the numbers to figure out who the winners and losers would be. And he thinks while some homeowners will pay less taxes, some, he says, might pay more. Gerry Howard is the CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. He is not happy either. GERRY HOWARD: It is an assault on housing. ARNOLD: Howard says with smaller tax savings tied to homeownership, that will lower the demand for houses and prices will fall. So Howard says even if that family does save $1,200 on their taxes. . . HOWARD: The same American family also needs to look at its net worth. And if the value of your largest asset - your house - is declining, see if you're really better off. ARNOLD: OK. But would home prices actually drop? We ran this past Chris Mayer. He's a housing economist at Columbia University. CHRIS MAYER: In relatively high-income, high-tax-rate states, i. e. blue states, we're likely to see home prices drop a reasonable amount. ARNOLD: He says less so in the middle of the country. And as a policy shift, as far as the government promoting homeownership with the tax code. . . MAYER: This is a very big change for the country. The thing that had Presidents Clinton and Bush and Reagan all in the same camp was tax policy that had supported homeownership. ARNOLD: Still, Mayer and many other economists have long said that the mortgage interest deduction is problematic. It favors wealthier people who get to write off more money. Working-class or young families right on the edge of being able to afford a house - they don't save much, if anything. Len Burman is an economist with the Tax Policy Center. He says not many people buy homes because of the tax break. LEN BURMAN: People want to own their homes. They want to have something that is theirs that they can fix up that they don't worry about a landlord kicking them out of it. ARNOLD: Burman thinks that home prices probably would decline a bit under the plan. He says that might actually be good for some first-time homebuyers. But he and Mayer both say that if the government wanted to promote homeownership, it could do it with a better incentive than the mortgage deduction - say, a tax credit that didn't favor rich people. But that is not part of the Republican's tax plan. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

We're making things so simple that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard. ARNOLD: Speaker Paul Ryan had a tax form the size of a postcard and waved it before the cameras yesterday. But Jamie Gregory with the National Association of Realtors says it's not that simple. JAMIE GREGORY: It will be bad for middle-class homeowners all across the country. ARNOLD: Gregory says there are a lot of moving parts that make it not simple. The plan would block you from writing off your state and local income tax. Property tax write offs would also be capped. Meanwhile, the standard deduction would be bigger. And all that taken together would mean that it wouldn't make sense anymore for most homeowners to itemize, and so very few would get the mortgage deduction tax break. GREGORY: It takes away the incentive to own a home. For the vast majority of America, you're making no difference between renting and owning. ARNOLD: Gregory says his group is still crunching the numbers to figure out who the winners and losers would be. And he thinks while some homeowners will pay less taxes, some, he says, might pay more. Gerry Howard is the CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. He is not happy either. GERRY HOWARD: It is an assault on housing. ARNOLD: Howard says with smaller tax savings tied to homeownership, that will lower the demand for houses and prices will fall. So Howard says even if that family does save $1,200 on their taxes. . . HOWARD: The same American family also needs to look at its net worth. And if the value of your largest asset - your house - is declining, see if you're really better off. ARNOLD: OK. But would home prices actually drop? We ran this past Chris Mayer. He's a housing economist at Columbia University. CHRIS MAYER: In relatively high-income, high-tax-rate states, i. e. blue states, we're likely to see home prices drop a reasonable amount. ARNOLD: He says less so in the middle of the country. And as a policy shift, as far as the government promoting homeownership with the tax code. . . MAYER: This is a very big change for the country. The thing that had Presidents Clinton and Bush and Reagan all in the same camp was tax policy that had supported homeownership. ARNOLD: Still, Mayer and many other economists have long said that the mortgage interest deduction is problematic. It favors wealthier people who get to write off more money. Working-class or young families right on the edge of being able to afford a house - they don't save much, if anything. Len Burman is an economist with the Tax Policy Center. He says not many people buy homes because of the tax break. LEN BURMAN: People want to own their homes. They want to have something that is theirs that they can fix up that they don't worry about a landlord kicking them out of it. ARNOLD: Burman thinks that home prices probably would decline a bit under the plan. He says that might actually be good for some first-time homebuyers. But he and Mayer both say that if the government wanted to promote homeownership, it could do it with a better incentive than the mortgage deduction - say, a tax credit that didn't favor rich people. But that is not part of the Republican's tax plan. Chris Arnold, NPR News.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

On Monday, they begin the markup of the bill. President Trump says he wants to sign the legislation by Christmas, which is just a little more than seven weeks away. And that's quick work for a Congress that's not known for that. Jim Tankersley is the economics and tax reporter for The New York Times. He joins us from the Washington, D. C. , bureau of the Times. Mr. Tankersley, thanks so much for being with us. JIM TANKERSLEY: Thank you so much for having me. SIMON: Let's try and understand this item by item, if we can. What portion of the tax cut goes to corporations? TANKERSLEY: About two thirds. So let's back up for a second. The net tax cut here is about $1. 5 trillion over 10 years. And corporations get two thirds of that, corporations and business. Individuals get one third of that. SIMON: And what about the argument that this corporate tax cut will benefit middle-class families in terms of higher wages and creating more jobs? TANKERSLEY: That's going to be, I think, the central fight of this bill, the question of will big tax cuts - and it's a very big tax cut for corporations - turn into higher wages for middle-class families? The argument on the Republican side of that is that if you give companies more money and higher profits, they will invest it. They'll invest it in their workers, and their workers will see wage gains. The argument against that is that, no, corporations will pass most of that money on to their shareholders in terms of dividends, or they'll just pocket the money - sit on the profits. And that, I think, will be one of the big debate points as we move forward here. SIMON: What are the changes proposed to the tax code you see that could most affect individuals and families? TANKERSLEY: Well, there's a lot. It's a big, sweeping change. This is not a simple tax cut like we saw in the previous decade. So on the one hand, it collapses the number of brackets on the income tax side. And so most people would see lower tax rates on their income. Exception there is millionaires. But most everyone would see lower tax rates. On the other hand, it changes a lot of tax deductions - gets rid of some popular deductions like capping the state and local tax deduction and restricting it to property taxes not income taxes anymore. It gets rid of the medical expense deduction for high out-of-pocket medical costs. And perhaps most importantly for a lot of families, it changes the way in which you can deduct your kids, yourself. And so a lot of families - it replaces that with a child tax credit. And for a lot of families in the middle class, that could end up with a tax hike, several million families per our calculations. SIMON: A lot of that sounds potentially quite unpopular. TANKERSLEY: Well, it's always unpopular to go after deductions. This is the thing about the tax code. Everyone wants it to be more efficient and simpler, but you don't want to lose the things that benefit you personally. The argument Republicans are going to make to try to counter that is that it's much simpler - that 90 percent of families now will be able to file their taxes on a postcard because it doubles the standard deduction and they're not going to take itemized deductions anymore. It's going to be easy and hopefully - and for the bulk of American families, I should say, a tax cut. The argument on the Democratic side is going to be, yes, these are very popular things. There's all sorts of stuff getting rid of that people really like. Student loan interest deductions, for example, also are gone here. SIMON: Mr. Tankersley, with all of the getting rid of so many proposed deductions which have been popular for decades, how likely is this legislation to pass as it's been proposed? Or is this just a negotiating point to start with? TANKERSLEY: I think it's very unlikely that this particular package exactly as it's proposed will pass. We know it's going to change to some degree. But will it change dramatically where a lot of the popular deductions end up staying? Will it change and scale back the rate cuts because Republicans, particularly in the Senate, are worried about adding $1. 5 trillion to deficits? We don't know. This is a first discussion point and that there will be a lot of negotiations between Republicans with each other and with business lobbyists in particular over the next few weeks as they try to speed this through Congress.

Here in the United States, Congress passed a law cracking down on bribery decades ago. But President Trump says the law puts U. S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. And as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, a recent study raises questions about how his administration is enforcing the law. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In the 1970s, U. S. corporate bribery was a huge scandal. More than 400 corporations admitted they'd made questionable or illegal payoffs to gain business, including major companies such as Chiquita and Lockheed. Meredith McGehee is with the Campaign Legal Center. MEREDITH MCGEHEE: What was happening was that many companies were making routine bribes to the heads of governments and others in countries just to simply buy the business. ZARROLI: So in 1977, Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, which made paying bribes illegal even if it was done in another country. The law has always had its critics. They say if U. S. companies are barred from paying bribes in places where doing so is routine, then they can't compete. And among the critics has been President Trump. Here he was in a 2012 interview on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now every other country goes into these places, and they do what they have to do. It's a horrible law, and it should be changed. I mean, we're like the policemen for the world. It's ridiculous. ZARROLI: Fast forward to today, and Trump administration officials, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, say they're committed to enforcing the law. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF SESSIONS: I think that's a law that's on the books that should be enforced. And I expect it will do so and continue to do so. ZARROLI: But Sessions hedged his comments a bit adding. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SESSIONS: You simply can't have a situation in which your competitors are - pay bribes, and you don't. ZARROLI: That's a point that's been made by other U. S. officials, including some Democrats. So a lot of people in the white-collar law community are watching to see how the administration enforces the law. A recent article in The New York Law Journal said there's been a decline in bribery enforcement proceedings this year by the government. Attorney Steven Witzel co-wrote the article. STEVEN WITZEL: In general terms, there's been a dramatic drop off from the average over the previous 10 years to what we're seeing in the Trump administration. ZARROLI: Witzel cautions that nine months into the administration is probably too early to get a sense of what its record will be. There may be good reasons for the decline having to do with the transition between the Obama and Trump administrations. One former Justice Department lawyer says he's seen no sign the government is any less committed to the law. And the department has continued with major enforcement actions initiated under Obama. A Swedish company that does business in the U. S. recently paid a fine of nearly a billion dollars for paying bribes in Uzbekistan. But Witzel says it's important to monitor the way the law is enforced. WITZEL: If there is a continued sharp decline in FCPA enforcement proceedings, that has the potential to undermine the credibility of the United States' commitment to combating international corruption. ZARROLI: When the bribery law was passed, it was something of an outlier internationally. Today many countries no longer treat bribery as a necessary evil and often work with U. S. officials to pursue violators. President Trump may not love the law, but there's evidence it's made a difference in the effort to fight global corruption. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

Like the House bill that's already moving along, the Senate version is being touted as a way to keep more money in Americans' pockets. But for millions of middle-income earners in high-cost states, the changes could eliminate big tax deductions. From member station WSHU, Charles Lane reports. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Westfield, N. J. , is one of the highest-taxed places in the country, so a tax cut sounded great to Kassie Smith, but the House GOP plan instead hit with a thud. KASSIE SMITH: Well, I was hoping that they would give us more things to deduct on our tax returns honestly because that would make us be able to stay here. LANE: Smith is a bookkeeper, and her husband is an auto mechanic. Because of the high cost of living in northern New Jersey, They've often talked about moving. But right now, they're doing what they can to keep school taxes down by organizing this garage sale to raise money for the high school football team. SMITH: So they can get new helmets or new cleats or have breakfasts. LANE: The Smiths pay nearly $12,000 a year in property taxes. Because they live close to New York City, there's a lot of density and need for bridges and trains and police. Living near such an expensive big city also pushes incomes higher, even for blue collar workers, and puts them in a higher tax bracket. Being able to deduct local income and property taxes even things out, but reducing those deductions, as the House plan currently does, means no tax savings. In fact, the Smiths worry that their tax bill could go up. SMITH: I'm not going to tell my boss, oh, my taxes went up $600 this year, you need to give me $600 more in pay. LANE: Six-hundred dollars is probably on the low side. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a research group, suggests that while most Americans will see a tax cut, almost 10 percent of middle-class workers will see an immediate increase of more than $1,000. But the Smiths and others in high-cost states like New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts or Virginia could see higher increases. Libertarian Walter Luers says maybe that's a good thing in the long run. WALTER LUERS: Other states would say we have too much government here in New Jersey. LANE: Luers is with the New Jersey Taxpayers Association and has been pushing to lower property taxes in New Jersey. Some argue that losing these deductions just might finally push local tax rates down. Also, why should taxpayers in Wichita subsidize public pensions in New Jersey? LUERS: Someone from, say, Oklahoma or Texas or Kansas will say, well, look, your property taxes are much higher. And you have a higher level of service, so you're kind of getting what you pay for over there. LANE: This is exactly what worries left-leaning groups. Jon Whiten runs the New Jersey policy perspective and fears that without these deductions, voters will revolt against local taxes, depriving local governments of resources. JON WHITEN: It would be one thing if they were taking away this deduction and wrapping up investments that were going to come to state and local governments, but they're taking away this deduction and cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans and for large corporations. LANE: Under his analysis of the House Republican plan, the country's top 5 percent would net more than 60 percent of the tax cuts. However, another research group, the Tax Foundation, says that cutting the corporate tax rate will eventually increase GDP growth and boost stock prices and create almost a million new jobs.

The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed the House version would do that. NPR's John Ydstie reports that pushing up the debt is a big concern for many economists and for some lawmakers. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: When Republicans first began assembling their tax overhaul proposals, their aim was to make sure tax cuts did not lead to increased deficits and add to the already troubling $20 trillion federal debt. That's long been the goal of Republican deficit hawks. But that goal is now just a memory. Neither the House nor the Senate proposal to cut taxes by $1. 5 trillion is accompanied by a plan to offset that lost revenue with spending reductions or new revenues. Yesterday, longtime deficit hawk Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona said in a statement that the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt. And he said that could threaten the economy. Economist Len Burman agrees. LEN BURMAN: This is a ridiculous time to be thinking of additional borrowing. YDSTIE: Burman, who is co-founder of the Tax Policy Center, says the deficit is already expected to balloon as baby boomers retire and the cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid rise sharply. BURMAN: At some point, we accumulate so much debt that we could do serious harm to our economy. YDSTIE: Burman says the huge deficits could drive up interest rates and slow growth. And in an extreme case, the U. S. could fail to pay its debts and trigger a global financial crisis. Lawmakers flirt with that every time they fight over raising the debt limit. Burman says while the U. S. has avoided a crisis so far, at some point the government will have to limit its borrowing and pay its debts. BURMAN: The thing that bugs me about deficit financing is we really don't know who's going to bear the burden of the debt. YDSTIE: But he says we have a good idea who will get the benefit of the tax cuts that produce the additional $1. 5 trillion worth of debt. The vast majority will go to businesses and high-income individuals. And in fact, there are some clues about who might bear the burden of restraining deficit spending. It was a big theme in President Trump's 2018 budget proposal. BURMAN: A lot of social welfare programs that help low-income people would be cut dramatically. YDSTIE: Former CBO director and adviser to Republican candidates Douglas Holtz-Eakin is also concerned about the growing debt. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: So having a tax reform that allows for a trillion and a half of additional deficits over the next 10 years is in and of itself not very attractive. YDSTIE: But Holtz-Eakin says he believes there are enough positive elements in the tax bills to incentivize business investment that will boost growth and wages. And that's a big benefit for the middle class, he says. HOLTZ-EAKIN: If the tax reform is done well, they'll get the most out of it because there's nothing more important to the middle class than to have an economy where real wages are actually rising. YDSTIE: But what about that one and a half trillion dollars in additional debt? Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin says tax reform will pay for itself by boosting growth and producing more than that amount in added tax revenue. Holtz-Eakin disagrees. He says optimistically, successful tax reform might pay for half of what it costs. Len Burman says even that's too optimistic. He says mainstream economic models suggest the initial growth spurt from tax cuts is later offset by slower growth, so the negative debt effects remain. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  One thing the House and Senate tax proposals have in common is that over the next 10 years, they are both likely to add $1. 5 trillion to the national debt. The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed the House version would do that. NPR's John Ydstie reports that pushing up the debt is a big concern for many economists and for some lawmakers. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: When Republicans first began assembling their tax overhaul proposals, their aim was to make sure tax cuts did not lead to increased deficits and add to the already troubling $20 trillion federal debt. That's long been the goal of Republican deficit hawks. But that goal is now just a memory. Neither the House nor the Senate proposal to cut taxes by $1. 5 trillion is accompanied by a plan to offset that lost revenue with spending reductions or new revenues. Yesterday, longtime deficit hawk Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona said in a statement that the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt. And he said that could threaten the economy. Economist Len Burman agrees. LEN BURMAN: This is a ridiculous time to be thinking of additional borrowing. YDSTIE: Burman, who is co-founder of the Tax Policy Center, says the deficit is already expected to balloon as baby boomers retire and the cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid rise sharply. BURMAN: At some point, we accumulate so much debt that we could do serious harm to our economy. YDSTIE: Burman says the huge deficits could drive up interest rates and slow growth. And in an extreme case, the U. S. could fail to pay its debts and trigger a global financial crisis. Lawmakers flirt with that every time they fight over raising the debt limit. Burman says while the U. S. has avoided a crisis so far, at some point the government will have to limit its borrowing and pay its debts. BURMAN: The thing that bugs me about deficit financing is we really don't know who's going to bear the burden of the debt.

This week we asked you for your stories about living on a hundred-thousand dollars a year. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Hello. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Hello. KRIS WATERIS: Hi, my name is Kris Wateris (ph). JOAN OWENS: This is Joan Owens (ph), and I'm calling from DeLand, Fla. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I'm in Springfield, Ore. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I live in Chicago. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: And I'm calling in about living on a hundred-thousand. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Living off of a hundred-thousand dollars. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Hundred-thousand dollars. WATERIS: People making a $100,000. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We've been doing this segment for almost a year. And we were overwhelmed with your responses this time. So many of you were willing to open up and share how you try and make ends meet on what is ostensibly a lot of money. RICHARD RUBIN: A hundred-thousand dollars means something different if it's a single person living alone. Or is it $100,000 for a family of four, five or six? Is it someone who's making $100,000 in San Francisco or $100,000 in Kansas City? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Richard Rubin covers the economy for the Wall Street Journal. He told us that expectations have changed significantly over the years. RUBIN: I think we've seen costs go up for things that seem like core parts of the middle-class life. So that's access to higher education and health care to areas where we're seeing costs continue to grow beyond inflation. So even if food prices or electronic goods or other things have not gotten more expensive, those things - health care and education - have gotten more expensive. And so what it feels like to be middle class now can be different from what it felt like 25, 30, 40 years ago. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We spoke to a variety of people in different parts of the country with different circumstances about their lives on 100k. Now, the median income in this country is a lot less. It's $59,000 a year. But these stories paint a picture of economic life in America in 2017 that we think is important to hear. Over the next few weeks, we're going to bring you some of those conversations. First, we hear from Theresa Sahhar. She lives in Olathe, Kan. , just outside of Kansas City. Her husband is a mechanical engineer, and she works in sales part-time. THERESA SAHHAR: It used to be that my husband's income would cover all of our bills. And then my income would go for travel and any extracurricular things that we wanted to do. But now it's gotten to the point where my income actually has to go towards paying the bills. Our expenses are going up as our children are getting older and getting into college. And so I'm kind of struggling to make enough money to do all the things that we normally do. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me what you spend your money on. When you say that, you know, you have expenses, tell me what that looks like. SAHHAR: Well, we spend quite a lot on our children's education. We have some expenses in the arts because one of my son's is a flute player and really excels at that. And we want to give him every opportunity to really explore that. And he's also in the STEM science field in his high school. And that's something - everything that he participates in costs money. But I want him to really have the opportunity to develop everything that he possibly can. And so I struggle to provide that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say struggle, I mean, what does that look like? SAHHAR: Well, it kind of looks like - I - right now, I'm kind of part of the gig economy, where I do little bits of this and that in order to make money. I do sales over the phone from home, marketing that kind of thing. I will do odd jobs. I have chickens, so I sell eggs. And I'm a beekeeper, so I sell honey. I do a little bit of sewing, so that kind of thing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What's the cost of living like in where you live? SAHHAR: It's actually pretty reasonable. GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you look around your community, do you see a lot of people like you? I mean. . . SAHHAR: Oh, yes. Yes, I'm very active in my son's school so I get to know a lot of the parents that are involved in the marching band. And I talked to a lot of them about their struggles. And really, they're in the same boat as I am. And I was really surprised because from the outside, it looks like we're very - you know, that we have plenty of money. But then when you really look underneath it all, you see that people are working overtime. They're working second jobs and even third jobs to try to put together the money just to stay in the middle class where they've been in the past. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you worry about retirement? SAHHAR: I don't expect to ever retire. I expect to work until I'm dead. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Really? SAHHAR: Yes. I expect my husband to work that way, as well. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Did you think that $100,000 should provide more? SAHHAR: Oh, yes. But I'll tell you, when I had the children, I knew they would be expensive. I just had no idea that our income wasn't going to go up as we became more experienced as - and as we became more valuable employees. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You mean that your salaries haven't sort of kept pace with your experience? It sort of stagnated. SAHHAR: No, not at all. No, not at all. No. No, I had a recent job offer that was ridiculous. I was offered $9 an hour, and I have, you know, 25, 30 years of experience. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How did you grow up? SAHHAR: Well, the first nine years of my life, I lived in the south, and I had a very privileged life. I went to private schools. I had a nice home. And we lived a very middle-class life. And then my parents got divorced. And after the divorce, we moved to 12th and Central, which is in the middle of the city in a not very good area. And the schools were not terrific. And I was really surprised at the dramatic difference between living a middle-class life and living what was - we were on welfare. It was a poverty lifestyle that we then lived. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How did that inform what you wanted for yourself and for your children? SAHHAR: Well, having experience both privilege and poverty, I'd much rather live a privileged life - much rather. And that's what I want for my children. I want my children to be able to access a few of the better things in life. I don't expect them to be rich, but I would like them to not be poor. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you see happening for the next generation? SAHHAR: Oh, I don't see it getting any easier. I see that my daughter and her husband are also struggling. And their main struggle is that they have student loans. And those student loans are crippling. GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you sort of sit around and talk about things with the people that you know is money and cost of living a frequent topic of conversation? SAHHAR: No, not really. I think most people don't want other people to know how they struggle. I think people really try to keep that under wraps. It's embarrassing to say that you have to work overtime in order to make enough money to live on. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Theresa Sahhar of Olathe, Kan. As Theresa says, it can be embarrassing to talk about money in this country - embarrassing to admit you don't have enough. Next week we'll hear from the single guy in Seattle who makes a lot of money but also has a lot of debt. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: It's very scary when you don't have job security. I have this mounting pile of debt. And not knowing if I was ever going to pay it off, it was very, very scary. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA-NAVARRO: And next time on the Call-In, post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. We associate it mostly with our active duty military and veterans. But it can also affect people who've suffered a traumatic event like a robbery or a car crash. Do you suffer from PTSD? Have you recovered or do you still need help? Call-In at 202-216-9217 with your story and tell us about your experience. Be sure to include your full name, your contact info, where you're from. And we may use it on the air.

The centerpiece of the GOP plan is a tax cut for corporations, a rate that's now 35 percent and would fall to 20. Various tax deductions would go away to help finance the drop. Supporters insist the corporate tax cut would bring economic growth and jobs. So will it? Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: President Trump and other Republicans justify the corporate tax cut this way - they say, if you cut taxes, businesses will have more money to spend. Companies such as Apple will bring back some of the billions of dollars they've stashed overseas, and then they'll hire more. They'll invest in factories and equipment. Here was Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway speaking on Fox News last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLYANNE CONWAY: When our businesses pay less in taxes, they reinvest that money into their companies. They create new jobs. They save and secure the jobs that exist. They start paying more in benefits and different benefits, and they invest in inventory. ZARROLI: And Republicans say when companies invest more in their factories and infrastructure, they become more productive, and when companies become more productive, they pay higher wages, even to low-skilled employees. A recent report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers predicted that cutting corporate taxes would raise annual household incomes $4,000 on average and probably even more than that. Economist Kimberly Clausing of Reed College says, on the surface, the logic sounds airtight. KIMBERLY CLAUSING: The principle makes a lot of sense, the thought that you increase investment and that investment increases the productivity of your workers and then your workers get paid more in consequence. ZARROLI: But Clausing says the reality is a lot more complicated. She believes the relationship between tax cuts and growth is difficult to prove. CLAUSING: There's no evidence that corporate tax cuts unleash a big wave of economic growth or wage increases. ZARROLI: Clausing says an economy the size of the United States has too many moving parts. So when the economy accelerates, it could be because of tax cuts or it may be something else entirely. Clausing and other economists are skeptical about the promises Republicans are making for another reason. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute says tax cuts make a certain sense in a recession when business profits are falling and companies have trouble borrowing money. JOSH BIVENS: But that doesn't describe the U. S. economy today. We have very low interest rates and very high post-tax corporate profits. ZARROLI: In other words, he says most corporations have access to pretty much all the money they need right now, but they're not investing all that much, and they're not paying their workers much more. BIVENS: So we have exactly what the corporate tax cut is trying to engineer - really high post-tax profit rates. And yet, it has not resulted in more investment. And so the idea that we just want to do more of the same thing that has not spurred investment strikes me as not correct. ZARROLI: Bivens says all this points to a much larger and more formidable problem for the economy. After the longest post-war expansion on record, companies don't see a lot of opportunities out there to sell more. And in a world of tough global competition, they're not really raising wages all that much. So he says giving them even more money by cutting their taxes isn't going to address the real problems the economy faces. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

It's about time we found out, since the House votes this week and the Senate is working toward a vote of its own on a somewhat different bill. Peter Morici of the University of Maryland is with us once again. Good morning, sir. PETER MORICI: Good morning. INSKEEP: And Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Good morning to you. JARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning. INSKEEP: And Mr. Bernstein is on my left. Mr. Morici is on my right. And that is more than just. . . BERNSTEIN: It's appropriate. INSKEEP: It's appropriate. It fits their politics. So first off, I mean, the broad strokes here are this is a business tax cut. It's supposed to change the tax brackets, eliminate some deductions. But despite some early promises, some people's taxes, we've found, that are going to go up. Who loses here, Jared? BERNSTEIN: Forty-six percent of taxpayers with incomes below $100,000 will either get nothing from this or a higher tax rate. INSKEEP: Higher tax rate because what? Deductions that they used go away? BERNSTEIN: Exactly. Now, these might be people who live in states that lose the state and local tax deduction. They might be families with numerous kids. So the personal exemption, that's gone. So that hurts them. So it's an interesting wrinkle here because initially Republicans were selling the plan as if nobody was going to get dinged by a tax increase, but in fact, as I said, almost half of those with incomes under $100,000 will get either an increase or a very small change. INSKEEP: Peter Morici, do Republicans really want to raise taxes on so many people? MORICI: No, they don't, and they're not going to. The problem here is that a lot of these tax cuts, like the Bush tax cuts, have to expire after 10 years because of Senate rules about increasing the deficit. So in the early years most people, like, 90 percent of the people get a tax cut. But towards the end of the process, if left to expire just like the Bush taxes then a lot of people's taxes would go up. They're banking on the notion that this time around the Democrats won't let that happen, just like the last time around. They're basically making a political bet. But it's important to recognize. . . INSKEEP: Why does that make sense as public policy, if I could just ask? MORICI: Well, it doesn't make sense to me at all, but the Senate won't change its rules. Under the Senate rules, and they're in statute now, they can't implement any legislation with only a 51 Senate vote. . . INSKEEP: Yeah. MORICI: . . . That increases the deficit beyond 10 years. INSKEEP: Right. MORICI: And a tax cut is going to increase the deficit. Now, there are people in the White House that would tell you that's not the case. And I have a perpetual motion machine in the trunk of my car, which I'd be happy to show you. INSKEEP: That's good. We'll do that after the interview. MORICI: The point is that they are stuck in this box. If you cut taxes and you only do it with 51 votes, you have to repeal them in some form or other after 10 years. INSKEEP: Jared? BERNSTEIN: I think one of the big problems with this plan is it adds $1. 5 trillion to the debt over 10 years, and that's kind of what Peter's getting at there. This is the ninth year of an economic expansion. The unemployment rate's very low. It is not at all clear to me or, frankly, to the American public why we need a big, wasteful regressive tax cut at this point. It's actually a pretty unpopular piece of work. It's not very representative. It cuts the corporate rate dramatically. It gets rid of the estate tax, which helps literally almost no one, just the wealthiest of the states. It gets rid of the AMT, a tax that hits those with the very high incomes. So most of the benefits go to the top of the scale. It increases the deficit. And - I'm just starting to write about this now - it incentivizes offshoring of jobs. So on any level that a kind of working-class person would care about, this bill doesn't really do much for them. INSKEEP: What's good here, Peter? MORICI: Well, I don't have the same spin on it as Jared does. They're going to cut the corporate rate from 35 to 20 percent. What really matters is how much taxes people actually pay, what the effective rate is. INSKEEP: Right. MORICI: And the effective rate in the United States is much higher than in Europe and Japan. So companies are leaving. We - you have covered on this broadcast inversions where companies basically leave the United States or reincorporate in Ireland. In addition to that, in terms of choosing places to locate production, the actual factories, people choose other locations 'cause our taxes are so high. And this is supposed to correct that. That's very different than the personal tax cuts. Now, why do it in the eighth year of recovery? We've just had a recovery with only 2 percent growth, and we need to do something to increase growth. BERNSTEIN: So first of all, and by the way, it's the ninth year of the recovery, but. . . MORICI: Well, whatever it is. BERNSTEIN: Whatever it is. INSKEEP: Not that anybody's counting. BERNSTEIN: But look, you know, the thing you've got to wrap your head around is that this tax plan actually incentivizes more offshoring of production. It's exactly the opposite. INSKEEP: You've said that twice. How does it do that? BERNSTEIN: So it does that by moving to a system. It's called territoriality. But basically, what it means is that if you're a multinational firm, an affiliate of an American firm overseas, you no longer have to pay any domestic taxes on your foreign incomes. As it stands today, you're supposed to pay taxes when you bring that foreign earnings back. Under this plan, you will not have to do that anymore. INSKEEP: Well, you get to bring the foreign earnings back, which could be good for the economy, right? BERNSTEIN: It could be, but oftentimes it ends up being, you know, share buybacks or just dividends. So put that aside. My point is that - and this is not a question. This is widely agreed upon - this incentivizes more offshoring. INSKEEP: Peter Morici, I want to just ask one other question. MORICI: Well, can I address that? INSKEEP: In about 30 seconds. Go. MORICI: Well, the point is that's the way every other tax system in the world works. So we're just aligning ourselves so American companies don't feel discriminated. INSKEEP: Here's my question. Because you do eliminate a bunch of these deductions, of course the bills could change, the bills are different, but there's talk of eliminating deduction for state and local income taxes. There's talk of capping the deduction for mortgage interest. These are things that would primarily affect people on the East and West Coasts, where taxes are higher, where expenses are higher, people are paid more but they have more costs. I can't help but notice that the East and West Coasts are the, I don't know, the more Democratic voting parts of the country. Is this tax plan, Peter, skewed to shaft people who did not vote for Donald Trump? MORICI: No. I think it's to create greater equity. First of all, they're talking about capping interest deductions at $500,000 a year as opposed to a million. So a waitress in Mississippi making $35,000 a year pays higher taxes. . . BERNSTEIN: Yeah, and gets nothing. MORICI: . . . So a Wall Street banker - let me finish, Jared. BERNSTEIN: And gets nothing from this. INSKEEP: Let him finish. Let him finish. Let him finish. Ten seconds. MORICI: They do get something from this plan. BERNSTEIN: Virtually nothing. MORICI: They do get something from this plan. Those people will pay lower taxes in 2018 if this plan goes through. BERNSTEIN: The problem with the plan is not that it whacks people who didn't vote for Trump. It's that it whacks people who did. This plan does nothing for working-class people of the type Peter was just describing. Moreover, it actually ships, it incentivizes shipping their jobs overseas. INSKEEP: OK. Jared Bernstein and Peter Morici, thanks to you both for another civil discussion, spirited discussion of the Republican tax plan. Always a pleasure when you come by. MORICI: Take care. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In a previous version of this interview, it was incorrectly said that the proposed $500,000 cap on the home mortgage interest deduction applied to the annual interest payment. It actually applies to the size of the mortgage. ] STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  So what would a Republican tax plan really do?

Washington state doesn't have an income tax. Seattle's City Council approved the new tax this summer. Anna Boiko-Weyrauch reports. ANNA BOIKO-WEYRAUCH, BYLINE: Documentary filmmaker Christopher Rufo doesn't make enough money to have to pay the tax, but he wants to keep Seattle income-tax-free so much so he joined around 30 plaintiffs suing the city. That's because, Rufo says, he doesn't want Seattle to end up like Youngstown, Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF DEMOLITION)BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: A backhoe tears down a house on the screen in front of him. CHRISTOPHER RUFO: Pretty much the only economic activity that you'll see in some of these neighborhoods is the demolition industry. BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: Rufo is editing a PBS film about economically depressed American cities. RUFO: One thing that I was struck by having studied Youngstown and living here in Seattle is that we can't take the prosperity for granted. Eventually the tech industry will either slow down or shrink or, as we're seeing with Amazon, move somewhere else. BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: The company is considering proposals right now for a second headquarters. Seattle's new income tax targets individuals with total income over $250,000 a year and couples with over $500,000. Income above that gets taxed at 2. 25 percent. The tax is approved but isn't being collected yet. The city is going against a state Supreme Court precedent from the 1930s. Republican Rob McKenna served two terms as Washington's attorney general. Now he represents the plaintiffs in this lawsuit. ROB MCKENNA: The Constitution was amended to include an extremely broad definition of property that includes anything tangible or intangible subject to ownership. And the Supreme Court ruled that that definition, being as broad as it is, encompasses income. BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: Because of that, he says, all income in the state has to be taxed the same. And because an income tax is not allowed under state law, a city cannot impose one either. On the other side is Paul Laurence, an attorney litigating the case on behalf of the city of Seattle. PAUL LAWRENCE: There's no provision in the state constitution that says you can't have an income tax. BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: Lawrence says it's interpretations of the state constitution that have kept income taxes off the books here, like the interpretation of income as property. He says it's not and should be taxable. LAWRENCE: It comes to you. You then take it and turn it into property, whether it's a stock or a bond or a piece of property. But it's a very different type of thing. BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: Cream slowly freezes at an ice cream shop founded by Molly Moon Neitzel. She supports the income tax to fund the city's pressing needs like affordable housing. She doesn't earn enough to be taxed yet. MOLLY MOON NEITZEL: I'd like to be taxed more on the high incomes that I make over time so that my employees can have a better quality of life in the city of Seattle. BOIKO-WEYRAUCH: Washington state is often said to have one of the most regressive tax structures in the nation because of its reliance on property and sales taxes.

But something awkward happened when White House economic adviser Gary Cohn appeared before CEOs at a Wall Street Journal event this week. The CEOs were asked to raise a hand if they would in fact increase investment if they got a big corporate tax cut. Only a few hands went up, prompting this reaction from Cohn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GARY COHN: Why aren't the other hands up? HU: Why aren't the other hands up, he says. Well, we put that question to Kimberly Clausing. She's an economist at Reed College who studies the impact of tax cuts on economic growth. KIMBERLY CLAUSING: A lot of what's holding back investment right now has nothing to do with a scarcity of after-tax profits. In fact, if you look at multinational firms, most of them have record-high after-tax profits compared to earlier years or earlier decades. Instead, what seems to be holding back investment is lack of good investment opportunities. So for instance, if the middle class is struggling, that gives you fewer items that you could sell to the middle class and then less incentive to invest in factories to make those items. So I think most companies are not so much wanting for funds but wanting for things to invest in. HU: So if not a corporate tax cut as proposed, what would actually encourage new investments that you're talking about? CLAUSING: Yeah. I think what's interesting here is that if you look at the people who are marketing this tax plan, they're often marketing it as if it will help workers through a sort of a trickle-down mechanism. But if you went straight to the workers instead and gave them benefits from the tax cut - whatever tax cut you're going to have - that's I think more likely to trickle up and help corporate America by giving the middle class more money to spend on goods and services and by making those investments worthy opportunities for firms. HU: In terms of this current version of the overhaul as proposed in the House and Senate, if businesses get this cut, how do you think they would actually behave differently? CLAUSING: Yeah. I don't think there's going to be a big investment nirvana or big effects on workers through this. I think what's really going to happen is this bill is going to enrich those at the top of the distribution. It's a big gain to people who've already made investments. For instance, there are $3 trillion worth of offshore earnings that are going to be favorably taxed, and this is a huge windfall to those people who've aggressively moved income offshore in the past. The corporate rate itself is coming down a lot, and that also helps old capital investments that have already been made. So this is really of great benefit to the shareholders of America. HU: You mentioned the winners there. Who loses out if these passed? CLAUSING: The losers I would say are the middle-class Americans who will pay the future taxes due to these deficits. So there's about $1 and a half trillion worth of deficits, and those will eventually have to be paid for. There's also another group of people who lose, which are those who rely on either Medicare because there may be mandatory Medicare cuts in the wake of these deficits as soon as next year. And also, the combination of the individual mandate repeal and the Senate bill will also both cause some people to lose insurance because they'll choose not to insure and raise premiums for those who are left in the insurance pool. And the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 13 million people will be at risk of losing insurance under the Senate bill. HU: That's Reed College professor Kimberly Clausing. Kimberly, thanks for joining us. CLAUSING: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF THE BLOW'S \"TRUE AFFECTION\") ELISE HU, HOST:  As we just heard there, the Republican argument behind a very large and permanent corporate tax cut rests on the idea that it will spur investment and that in turn would boost the economy. But something awkward happened when White House economic adviser Gary Cohn appeared before CEOs at a Wall Street Journal event this week. The CEOs were asked to raise a hand if they would in fact increase investment if they got a big corporate tax cut. Only a few hands went up, prompting this reaction from Cohn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GARY COHN: Why aren't the other hands up? HU: Why aren't the other hands up, he says. Well, we put that question to Kimberly Clausing. She's an economist at Reed College who studies the impact of tax cuts on economic growth. KIMBERLY CLAUSING: A lot of what's holding back investment right now has nothing to do with a scarcity of after-tax profits. In fact, if you look at multinational firms, most of them have record-high after-tax profits compared to earlier years or earlier decades. Instead, what seems to be holding back investment is lack of good investment opportunities. So for instance, if the middle class is struggling, that gives you fewer items that you could sell to the middle class and then less incentive to invest in factories to make those items. So I think most companies are not so much wanting for funds but wanting for things to invest in. HU: So if not a corporate tax cut as proposed, what would actually encourage new investments that you're talking about? CLAUSING: Yeah. I think what's interesting here is that if you look at the people who are marketing this tax plan, they're often marketing it as if it will help workers through a sort of a trickle-down mechanism. But if you went straight to the workers instead and gave them benefits from the tax cut - whatever tax cut you're going to have - that's I think more likely to trickle up and help corporate America by giving the middle class more money to spend on goods and services and by making those investments worthy opportunities for firms. HU: In terms of this current version of the overhaul as proposed in the House and Senate, if businesses get this cut, how do you think they would actually behave differently? CLAUSING: Yeah. I don't think there's going to be a big investment nirvana or big effects on workers through this. I think what's really going to happen is this bill is going to enrich those at the top of the distribution. It's a big gain to people who've already made investments. For instance, there are $3 trillion worth of offshore earnings that are going to be favorably taxed, and this is a huge windfall to those people who've aggressively moved income offshore in the past. The corporate rate itself is coming down a lot, and that also helps old capital investments that have already been made. So this is really of great benefit to the shareholders of America. HU: You mentioned the winners there. Who loses out if these passed? CLAUSING: The losers I would say are the middle-class Americans who will pay the future taxes due to these deficits. So there's about $1 and a half trillion worth of deficits, and those will eventually have to be paid for. There's also another group of people who lose, which are those who rely on either Medicare because there may be mandatory Medicare cuts in the wake of these deficits as soon as next year. And also, the combination of the individual mandate repeal and the Senate bill will also both cause some people to lose insurance because they'll choose not to insure and raise premiums for those who are left in the insurance pool. And the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 13 million people will be at risk of losing insurance under the Senate bill. HU: That's Reed College professor Kimberly Clausing.

JAFFE: Well, they're more focused on helping older adults stay alive then on helping them live their lives. That's the way Joseph Coughlin puts it. He's the founder of the AgeLab at MIT. And he wrote a new book called \"The Longevity Economy. \" He says companies are relying on a story about who older consumers are - and the story's wrong. JOSEPH COUGHLIN: It's a narrative that says we're old, we're frail and, by the way, we don't like anything new. And as a result, we don't make things that excite and delight. SIMON: So give me an example of a product that might just be totally off. JAFFE: (Laughter) Well, there's one spectacular failure that Coughlin writes about. It was called Senior Foods, sort of like baby food for older folks. It was geared for people with tight budgets and bad teeth. Apparently, it tasted gross and looked gross.

(LAUGHTER)SIMON: All right. Are there examples of products that people have designed that have worked for older consumers? JAFFE: Sure. And if you want to see an example, go look in your kitchen drawer when you get home. I bet you find a can opener or a vegetable peeler or something by a company called OXO Good Grips. Now, these were originally developed to make it easier for someone with arthritis to use their kitchen gizmos. But it turns out these things are comfortable, and they've been appealing for everybody. There are also products that work for older adults even though they weren't necessarily the target audience. Coughlin says that his personal favorite is his tablet computer. COUGHLIN: Without my glasses, I can't even see my hand, let alone the text in front of me. But the tablet that I use allows me to use my fingers and to jack up that font so that I can see it. It is not a device that yells, old man who can't see. It is a device that is so profoundly personalized that it allows me to use it at any age. JAFFE: And Scott, you know, I have a new personal favorite thing designed for older people. It's called the ChampagnePopper. And it does what it says it does. And two cousins developed it for a Champagne-loving neighbor whose arthritis was preventing her from indulging in her favorite beverage because she couldn't get the cork out anymore. And so they developed this thing. It's sort of like a curvy wrench with a long handle. And here's the reason I like it.

The full House passed its tax bill, and the Senate Finance Committee approved its version. That'll be taken up by the full Senate after Thanksgiving. Republicans from President Trump to congressional leaders are selling the bill as a middle-class tax cut. Here's House Speaker Paul Ryan describing the House plan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAUL RYAN: This plan is for the middle-class families in this country who deserve a break. HU: But analysis by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation finds that's not the case. NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie joins us to talk about where the benefits of those tax cuts will really fall. So, John, are these plans focused on the middle class as Speaker Ryan suggests? JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Well, Elise, the short answer is no. In the case of both the House and Senate bills, the largest and most long-lasting tax cuts will go to businesses. HU: So break this down for us. YDSTIE: Well, let's talk about the House bill first. It is true that starting in 2018 the vast majority of American taxpayers will get a tax cut under the House bill. However, the middle class will get relatively modest tax breaks in dollar terms initially, and then over the next decade those modest cuts will shrink dramatically. HU: Can you give us an example of how this works? YDSTIE: Well, let's talk about the heart of the middle class. Households are earning between $46,000 a year and $86,000. . . HU: OK. YDSTIE: . . . A year. They'd initially get an average tax cut of about $800, according to the analysis by the Tax Policy Center. But by 2027, that tax cut will be worth less than half of that $800. HU: Why does the tax cut shrink? YDSTIE: A significant piece of the tax cut is a family credit, and that expires after five years. HU: So, John, let's talk about people at the top. Give us an example of how the wealthy would fare under the House bill. YDSTIE: Well, let's talk about the top 1 percent of households. HU: And real quick, what is the top 1 percent? YDSTIE: Those are households that make three-quarters of a million dollars and up. HU: OK. YDSTIE: And they would get an average $37,000 tax cut to start with. And by 2027, that would grow to around $62,000. HU: So the tax cut at the top increases while for folks in the middle it shrinks. Why? YDSTIE: Well, it's because lots of high-income people own their own businesses where the profits are taxed as individual income. And these new tax proposals would give special tax cuts to those business owners that aren't available to people who are just employees. And that's one reason Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation says that under the House plan almost 75 percent of tax benefits flow to businesses. HU: But we should point out one reason for the big discrepancy in the size of the tax breaks, those numbers that you were talking about, is that the wealthy pay far more in dollar terms in taxes to start with than the middle class does. YDSTIE: That's absolutely true. But even if you simply look at the percentage changes in after-tax incomes, the wealthy still do better there as well. HU: What about the Senate version? Who would benefit most from that bill? YDSTIE: Well, there again the short answer is businesses. As in the House bill, corporations get a reduction in their tax rate from 35 percent down to 20 percent. And it is permanent. Meanwhile, most individuals get a tax cut to start with, but by 2025, tax breaks for individuals expire, so taxes go up. So no question about it - both these tax bills are primarily focused on business tax cuts, not middle-class tax cuts. Now, Republicans would argue that the business tax cuts will boost growth and benefit everyone. However, claims like that for previous tax cuts under George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan did not materialize. HU: That's NPR's John Ydstie. Thanks, John. YDSTIE: You're welcome. ELISE HU, HOST:  Both the House and Senate advanced their tax overhaul plans last week.

And they are facing a lot of skepticism. One of the questions they're having to answer is what the tax cuts will mean for the federal budget deficit. Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The federal government already spends a lot more than it takes in every year. And the tax cut bills Congress is considering threaten to make the shortfall even bigger. The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, which is the nonpartisan federal agency that analyzes tax legislation, says a tax cut of the magnitude being talked about would reduce the money flowing into government coffers by $1. 4 trillion over the next decade. So unless Congress makes drastic cuts in spending, simple mathematics says the budget deficit will only grow. Or will it? Trump administration officials have lately been pushing back hard against the deficit doomsayers. Here was Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on CNN this weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICK MULVANEY: The CBO refuses to give any value at all to the dynamic effects of lowering taxes and letting people keep more of their own money. ZARROLI: Reducing taxes, he says, leads to growth, which means people make more money and they pay more in taxes. So cutting taxes may blow a hole in the federal budget for now, but the impact will be reversed, at least in part, over time by the fact that the economy will grow faster. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has even said tax cuts will pay for themselves. Economists don't exactly dismiss that argument out of hand. Douglas Holtz-Eakin was the director of the CBO during the George W. Bush administration. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: If the tax bills produce better economic growth, you can expect that to be beneficial with respect to the budget. ZARROLI: Holtz-Eakin says, yes, cutting taxes can make the economy grow faster. But he doesn't buy the argument that tax cuts can completely pay for themselves. HOLTZ-EAKIN: We don't have any experience that says that. We don't have any reason to believe that's true. It overstates the case. ZARROLI: Economists on the left go even further. They say the claim that tax cuts pay for themselves is just another version of an argument that Republicans have been making for decades. Jared Bernstein is with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. JARED BERNSTEIN: And at this point, it's remarkable that we're even arguing about it. It's just pure sales job, smokescreen, fairy dust. ZARROLI: Bernstein says there's no evidence tax cuts have ever paid for themselves. Cuts passed by Congress in the 1980s and the 2000s were followed by big increases in the deficit. He also says it's not always true that tax cuts lead to faster growth. In fact, he says, tax cuts can actually lead to higher interest rates and less investment in infrastructure. And in the long run, he says, that can be bad for the economy. BERNSTEIN: If you have a tax plan that is not revenue neutral - and this one is not by a long shot - one that adds to the deficit, that can actually hurt growth in the long run. ZARROLI: Bernstein says there really is a need for comprehensive tax reform right now. And a well-designed tax plan could be good for the economy.

GREENBERG: I think that there are a number of elements in both the House and Senate bills that could encourage both work and investment on the parts of households and businesses. The lower corporate rate, the 20 percent, will reduce the cost of investing in the United States. And we should expect a larger U. S. economy because of that. SIMON: But you have a concern about deficits at the same time? GREENBERG: Absolutely. Even when accounting for the increased economic growth under the Senate plan, there's reason to believe that it would indeed add to federal deficits. SIMON: And - I'm sorry if this sounds naive - but what's your concern about adding to the federal deficit? Because it does seem that a lot of Republicans, if I might put it this way, have gotten over that in the past couple of decades. GREENBERG: That's an interesting point. After all, there are two hypothesized downsides of adding to the federal deficit. The first downside is that because the government would need to borrow more, that could crowd out private savings and investment. And the second concern is that it could undermine the credit of the United States in the long run. It might be that these effects are not actually so serious. After all, we haven't seen so much evidence of crowding out from federal debts over the last decade or so. And there might not be so much reason to worry about the stability of the United States' credit in the long run, given that many people appear to continue to be very interested in U. S. debt as an investment. That being said, a number of Republicans do continue to be worried about the size of the U. S. debt. And as a result, it's worth paying attention to that number in order to see whether a bill will be able to assuage their concerns or not. SIMON: Mr. Greenberg, do you, at this moment, foresee a tax bill passing? GREENBERG: I think it's a very difficult road ahead of Republicans in Congress. There are a number of senators that have raised concerns about the Senate tax bill. Senator Corker, who was quoted earlier, as well as Senators Flake and Lankford have raised concerns that the tax plan would increase the U. S. debt too much. Meanwhile, other senators, like Senator Collins, have expressed concern that the Senate bill repeals the individual mandate, which is a health care provision that penalizes people for not buying health insurance. Overall, there's a very thin majority for Republicans in the Senate. And as a result, that makes passage of this bill a very difficult prospect. SIMON: Scott Greenberg is a senior analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation. Thanks so much for being with us, sir. GREENBERG: Thanks so much for having me. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   The Republican effort to change the federal tax code continues in the Senate after the House passed their version. Congressional Republicans have argued that the tax cuts in their plan will spur enough economic growth and that revenue will allow the cuts to pay for themselves. But a new survey finds that 38 of the country's top economic experts are unanimous in saying the cuts would not pay for themselves and would increase the national debt. That's a problem for many Republicans, including Bob Corker of Tennessee. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB CORKER: Unless this bill reduces deficits and does not add to deficits with reasonable and responsible growth models, I don't have any interest in it. SIMON: We're joined now by Scott Greenberg. He's a senior analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation. Mr. Greenberg, thanks so much for being with us. SCOTT GREENBERG: Thanks for having me. SIMON: Isn't it an article of conservative faith that tax cuts promote more spending - that creates growth, jobs and, ultimately, tax revenue? GREENBERG: I wouldn't say that's the article of conservative faith. I think that a number of conservatives believe that an appropriately designed tax bill could increase incentives for households and businesses to work and invest and that this could have a positive effect on the economy.

JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Jerome Powell has been a member of the Fed's Board of Governors since 2012. And today, he suggested again that he will generally continue the policies the Fed has pursued under Janet Yellen's leadership. Both Democrats and Republicans found things to like in Powell's testimony.

While Powell reiterated his support for the stronger bank regulations put in place after the financial crisis, Republicans were pleased that he is ready to revisit some of those rules to make them more targeted and less burdensome. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: We will continue to consider appropriate ways to ease regulatory burdens while preserving the core reforms. YDSTIE: Core reforms such as requiring banks to undergo regular stress tests and have more capital as a cushion against losses. The nominee for the Fed's top job also said he believes the financial system is much more stable now than it was before the housing bust and financial crisis. But he said he is concerned about cybersecurity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: It's maybe the most important risk that our financial institutions, our economy, our government institutions face. We're very focused on providing the resources to deal with it. YDSTIE: Both Republicans and Democrats tried to get Powell to weigh in on the tax bill that Republicans are pushing through Congress. Democrats asked whether he agrees with the Congressional Budget Office that the tax bill would add about $1. 5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.

On the other hand, it's not for us to be taking part in the discussion that you and your other elected colleagues are having.

I know, another acronym, but it's an important one. It stands for alternative minimum tax. It's for high-income earners who take a lot of deductions, people like President Trump, for example. Now, the tax bills under debate in Congress would eliminate the AMT altogether, and NPR's Jim Zarroli looks at what the consequences would be. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In the late '60s, federal officials revealed that more than 150 high-income households had paid no income tax. They took advantage of so many loopholes and deductions, they were able to whittle their tax bills down to nothing. In the uproar that followed, Congress passed what would later become the AMT. Frank Clemente is the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. FRANK CLEMENTE: The alternative minimum tax is a minimum tax. It's designed to make sure that wealthier people pay a reasonable level of tax. ZARROLI: The AMT amounts to a kind of floor on tax payment. It takes effect once you try to lower your tax bill too much. At first, the number of people who had to pay the AMT was small, but over time, more and more taxpayers have been swept up in it. William Gale is co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. WILLIAM GALE: The original purpose was to limit the overall amount of tax sheltering that a household could do, but as the AMT has been changed over time, it's tend to fallen more and more on big families and families in high-tax states. ZARROLI: That's because the AMT tends to kick in once you claim a lot of deductions. So people who have a lot of kids or live in high-tax jurisdictions are more likely to pay it. They're people such as Marilyn Molinaro (ph), who lives in Sonoma County, Calif. Her husband had a good job as well as a generous pension from an earlier government position. She says they came from modest means and didn't think of themselves as rich so it was a nasty surprise when they had to pay the AMT. MARILYN MOLINARO: All the sudden you're making, you know, really good money, and you think, wow, I should be able to really live it up now and buy nice things and put money in the bank and stuff. And then instead, you get a big tax. You get a shock when you do your taxes and go, I have to pay this all in taxes. ZARROLI: The AMT also tends to fall more on people who earn income of $200,000 to $500,000 a year. Super wealthy people are less affected. But eliminating the AMT would have a downside. William Gale of the Tax Policy Center says it would also remove some of the constraints on tax shelters, allowing more people to take advantage of loopholes. GALE: AMT repeal would increase significantly the number of high-income and wealthy people who would pay no income tax. ZARROLI: Among those who could benefit is President Trump. His 2005 tax return, part of which was leaked a few months ago, showed he paid $38 million on income of $150 million. Without the AMT, his tax bill that year would have been a little more than $5 million. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  And let's look at who pays the AMT.

A great big beautiful Christmas present for the American people - that's what President Trump is saying. So why, then, is it so unpopular? Polls are showing that between 25 and 33 percent of the country approves of the plan, meaning even some of those who would get a tax break are not even won over. Here's NPR's Chris Arnold. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: In pitching their tax plan to the country, Republicans say it would save the typical middle-class American family between $1,200 and $1,400 dollars. But it seems that that may not be enough to buy widespread support for this plan because, first, not everybody gets that and there's other unpopular stuff in these bills. DAVE LEWANDOWSKI: My name is Dave Lewandowski. I live in Grand Rapids, Mich. , so it's definitely the cold time of the year here, as it is in the East Coast. ARNOLD: Lewandowski's married, three kids. He works for a company selling vitamins and water filters and other health products. The family's household income is about $90,000 dollars. LEWANDOWSKI: So under the House plan, it looks like I'll save around $600 and under the Senate plan, closer to 1,800 when comparing the two. ARNOLD: Lewandowski says he'd definitely be happy to get a tax cut. LEWANDOWSKI: You know, we're receiving a bit of a benefit at a time where it really helps. Right? So we're trying to pay down some debt. We're looking forward to taking a vacation next year. This is a welcome benefit for me and my family. ARNOLD: Still, when it comes to the design of the overall tax plan itself, he's. . . LEWANDOWSKI: Conflicted. ARNOLD: Lewandowski says he votes for Republicans more often than Democrats, so it's not politics. But he says, for one thing, he's not sure the balance is right with this huge tax cut for corporations. LEWANDOWSKI: You know, it's the idea of something being spread a mile wide and an inch deep for the middle class. Right? So many people in the middle class will receive a benefit, but that benefit is going to be muted or small, whereas the bulk of the benefit is going to be felt by, you know, corporations and the wealthy. ARNOLD: According to nonpartisan numbers from Congress's own Joint Committee on Taxation, the wealthy and corporations do get a much bigger share of the benefits from the tax bills. And Lewandowski also doesn't like that people in other states will pay more, people like Ani McHugh. She's a high school English teacher in Delran, N. J. ANI MCHUGH: Well, New Jersey has always been, you know, a high-tax state. ARNOLD: And the Republican tax plans don't allow people to deduct state and local income taxes, so that can make a big difference for people in states with higher taxes, like California and New York and New Jersey. MCHUGH: This kind of tax plan that essentially punishes taxpayers who are already paying more in taxes - I don't see how that's a fair approach or a reasonable approach. ARNOLD: McHugh's married. Her husband's a police officer in the same town where they live. They have two kids. And she's checked with her tax guy, and the best that she can figure, depending on the House or the Senate version. . . MCHUGH: We're going to end up paying between $3,000 and $5,000 more. ARNOLD: Which the couple, of course, is not happy about. MCHUGH: My husband and I are both angry. It's - for, I'm assuming, lots of people like us, this is not going to be a tax cut by any means.

The bill still needs to be reconciled with the House version, but the GOP hopes to send a final bill to the president by the end of the year. There's been a lot of opposition from Senate Democrats to both the content of the bill and how it was crafted. And we will hear from them later in the program. But now we turn to Mark Meckler. He was co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots and is now president for Citizens for Self-Governance. Good morning, sir. MARK MECKLER: Good morning. Nice to be with you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're one of the early creators of the Tea Party movement, of which - one of the main tenets was fiscal responsibility, yet this tax bill is expected to add, I think, more than a trillion dollars to the national debt over 10 years and, if the tax cuts are extended, as it is hoped by the party, far more after that. Do you support the plan and why? MECKLER: Well, I do support the plan, but I don't disagree with you about the crazy levels of spending by the federal government. The reason I support the plan is because it is much better than the status quo. This is the boldest rewrite of the tax code since 1996. You have small businesses who are going to benefit greatly. You have corporate rate going down to something that's competitive internationally. That means you're going to see job growth. You have a repatriation rate pushed down to 14 percent for corporations, allowing them to bring back over $3 trillion. All of those things benefit the people who are most - my constituency, our constituency, which is the middle and lower classes, allowing job creation, job growth, real wage growth. We have a long history in America that when we lower rates, when we allow corporations to invest in America - that it grows jobs. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There is great debate about that, but I want to ask you if this is even tax reform. It certainly has measurable benefits for corporations and the very wealthy, but it's not a permanent tax cut for the middle class. Those reductions are temporary. MECKLER: When we say those reductions are temporary, we have to remember that they go until at least 2025. So for most of us out there, regular working folks, seven years of tax reductions is a big deal. We can have that fight again in seven years. I'm sure the Democrats will be promoting increasing taxes in seven years. That's what the Democrats always promote. The Democrat plan today was to increase taxes by over a trillion dollars. So we have to remember what our alternative option was with the other party. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But why make it temporary for individuals who might need that tax relief when corporations, who are doing very well, get a permanent. . . MECKLER: Yeah, you and I are on the same page. I think that's craziness. I don't like temporary tax reductions. I don't like temporary legislative fixes, generally. I want to see permanent legislative fixes. So I am against the fact that they are temporary, but I'd rather have, as a person who pays these taxes, as a middle-income person - I'd rather have seven years of tax reduction than what the Democrats were proposing, which was a trillion dollars in increased taxes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I'd like to talk about the political ramifications. By and large, polls show this isn't popular, and it pushes through some very substantial changes in the financial lives of Americans. Do you think that there will be a cost come 2018? MECKLER: No, I think what we're going to see is if the economic effects of this are positive, then it will have positive political ramifications. For the most part - and again, I'm just talking regular people. Regular people vote with their wallets. If the economy continues to improve, and we're seeing robust growth - the last growth number was 3. 3 percent, which is extraordinary higher than anything we saw in the Obama era. If that kind of growth continues, if real job growth continues, if real wage growth continues, we're going to see a wave election for Republicans. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how do you think the deficit problems will be resolved? How are you hoping that that will be addressed? MECKLER: Well, I can tell you that people like me and organizations like mine will be pushing for in the new year real spending reform, and there's real spending reform to - had across the board. That's from the military industrial complex all the way through the welfare system. Senator Tom Coburn, when he was in the Senate, demonstrated, according to the CBO, over $400 billion of waste and duplicative spending every year. We ought to start there. And I'm hoping that the country can get rational. Both parties can begin to address that stuff beginning in 2018. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think that Republicans will campaign on spending reform anymore? MECKLER: You know, I don't know whether they will or not. It depends on how hard the grassroots push them. And I hope the grassroots do continue to push them on that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is it important to the grassroots to have that still? MECKLER: Absolutely. I mean, fiscal responsibility is still a measure of what I would call conservative values. The problem is we just don't seem to see the Congress expressing those values any longer. The CBO and the GAO have both said that this kind of spending cannot be sustained. And what can't continue won't continue. So it's irresponsible for us not to deal with the spending issue. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mark Meckler is the president of Citizens for Self-Governance. Thank you so very much. MECKLER: Thanks for having me, Lulu. I appreciate it.

On paper, though, they're well off. They make about $100,000 a year. But it often takes just one major expense for things to get hard - student loans, child care or medical expenses. For Stephanie Culp and her husband, it was debt that just kept adding up. STEPHANIE CULP: The hot water heater went out. He needed new tires. The garbage disposal went out. And it was just, you know, once you get behind, and you have so much of your income going out, there was just no way to catch up. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The Culps declared bankruptcy, left their house and moved to Gaithersburg, Md. , so that her husband could take a better paying job. They live in an apartment there with their son and daughter - young adults who both have severe nonverbal autism. Stephanie is a stay-at-home mom. Her husband is a software programmer who earns $100,000. I asked her if they'd been able to get control of their debt, if his paychecks covered their many expenses. CULP: I'm going to say no, being as we don't have a single piece of furniture in this apartment (laughter). We just struggle to get it paycheck to paycheck. That's pretty much how we live. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How do you pay your bills? CULP: I'm in charge of the finances. So, sometimes, things have to wait. I have to make judgment calls on what we absolutely have to have, what I can maybe double up on next month because we can't afford to pay it all at once. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what are the choices that you're sometimes making? What things do you have to kind of delay? CULP: Sometimes, it's the cell phones. But I, you know, hate to do without those in case the school needs me or if my - you know, if my husband gets in a wreck, I'm not comfortable doing without those. Sometimes we push the electricity back. Sometimes, it's the insurance because it's either pay these bills, or it's we don't eat. So, you know, what do I cut back on? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is it so expensive because of where you're living? Or are there other additional costs to do with your children and other issues? CULP: It's partly because, you know, of where we're living. Gaithersburg is a booming area. It would honestly - we discovered it would be cheaper if we were able to buy a townhome. But because we have a recent bankruptcy, there's not going to be a bank to look at us sideways for years. So I'm grateful to be here. It's just that it's a lot more expensive than I ever thought it was going to be. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me about the bankruptcy. What happened? CULP: A myriad of things - too many credit cards, too many major hospitalizations. I was working at the time, but my hours continually got cut. And my husband's job cut out the overtime. We couldn't afford all the payments. And it just snowballed out of control. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Did you have any savings? CULP: No, we never have savings. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Tell me about your kids. CULP: They are 19 and 20. I have a boy and a girl. My son is the youngest. Along with the autism, he just has severe anger problems. He hits things. He hits himself. He hits me, his sister. And it doesn't take anything to set him off. We finally got him into a school that seems to be really helping him. But they also do not sleep at night. So he cannot ride the bus in the morning because he probably just went to sleep. So I have to take him every morning, and I have to pick him up every afternoon. It's stressful. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. Does your husband expect that he's going to retire? CULP: No. He has told me multiple times that he will work until he drops dead because we just - there's no affording it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How did you grow up? CULP: I grew up with both my parents. But, you know, we lived in a trailer with a one-room air conditioner. And I didn't really feel that we were poor. I mean, I knew I didn't have the best clothes like everybody, but we always had Christmas. With my husband and I now, we haven't been able to do Christmas in 10 years. We don't even have a tree. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does that surprise you when you grew up thinking that, you know, you might have better things, and you earn $100,000 now, and you can't have a Christmas tree? CULP: It's absolutely awful because I feel like we should. I mean, we're not homeless. We don't live out of our vehicles. We could save a lot of money if we did. We make $100,000 a year. So it's far from destitute. It's just not enough. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Stephanie Culp of Gaithersburg, Md. JIM TANKERSLEY: People feel like they haven't been getting ahead for a long time. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jim Tankersley covers taxes and the economy for The New York Times. He told us that the stories we've heard of people struggling to get by, even on six figures, often are a lingering result of the financial crisis of 2008. TANKERSLEY: The sort of raises they were used to, especially in the late 1990s, just haven't happened in the wake of the Great Recession. And so for a lot of people, whether they're making the median or just under 100,000, they feel like, hey, my quality of life is not advancing nearly as fast as I think it should be based on what I've seen in the past. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And people in America don't have a lot of savings, do they? TANKERSLEY: They don't. We've seen the savings rate drop over time. We see there are a large number of families who can't even get by if they've missed two paychecks. This is a problem that predates the recession. It's actually been a problem throughout the 2000s, where people borrowed, and they overspent, perhaps, relative to what they should have been saving just to keep pace with, again - with those quality-of-life improvements that they had been accustomed to in the past. GARCIA-NAVARRO: One of the things that these families talk about is the expenses that they can't really mitigate - child care, medical expenses. TANKERSLEY: And those are expenses that we see, in particular, policymakers now being more interested in trying to figure out solutions for, whether those are market-based solutions to get more competition or whether they're government solutions to help people, whether through subsidies or other ways of bringing down those costs. Education, child care - these are things that have been increasing faster than overall costs in the economy. And they are very visible costs to working families. And I think that's why policymakers are so tuned into them now. GARCIA-NAVARRO: How does this fit in with what we're seeing now? We see the stock market at record levels. The economy has picked up again. It's growing. We see unemployment at very low levels. What does that mean for the average family? TANKERSLEY: Well, I'm going to do something that economics reporters - and particularly, this economics reporter - don't often do and be a little bit optimistic here for a second. We know that things get better faster for families and working families when the economy is in what we call full employment, where unemployment is very low, when there's a lot of pressure on companies to raise wages to keep workers. And so if we can maintain that period for a while again, like we did in the late '90s, that would be great for these families. They might actually start to see faster and sustained wage increases in a way that really does start to feel like, hey, getting ahead again. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jim Tankersley, tax and economics reporter at The New York Times, thank you very much. TANKERSLEY: My pleasure.

They're hoping for final passage this month. They say the changes will lead to more jobs, more investment. Most economists, though, are questioning the timing. They say the U. S. economy is already at near-full employment, and pushing for faster growth in 2018 could backfire. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It sounds like an admirable goal. Grow the economy. Create more jobs. Surely no one could object to that. But in the opinion of some economists, a tax cut is the last thing the U. S. needs right now. For one thing, the economy has been growing steadily for years. Growth last quarter was a healthy 3. 3 percent. Unemployment is down to 4. 1 percent. Jared Bernstein of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (ph) says this isn't the time to be thinking about a tax cut. For one thing, there's the impact it will have on federal borrowing. JARED BERNSTEIN: I think the timing of this tax cut from the perspective of the deficit is completely upside down. ZARROLI: Bernstein says he no deficit hawk, but he says when the economy is growing, common sense says you should be paying off some of your debt. BERNSTEIN: It's that simple, you know? What are you supposed to do with your roof when the sun shines? Fix it, not put a hole in it. ZARROLI: Instead, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax overhaul could add a trillion dollars to the debt over the next decade even after taking extra growth into consideration. That means the government won't have as much money as it needs when the next recession comes around. On ABC \"This Week\" yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed deficit concerns. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\")MITCH MCCONNELL: So I'm confident this is not only revenue-neutral to the government but actually is very likely to be a revenue producer. ZARROLI: McConnell says the tax cuts will lead to faster growth, which will mean more revenue for the government, and that should keep the deficit in check. But there's another macroeconomic problem with cutting taxes right now. Former Fed Governor Randy Kroszner says if a tax cut is designed well, it can be a good thing. It can mean companies have more money to spend on new factories and equipment. RANDY KROSZNER: To the extent that the tax reform focuses on trying to increase the incentives for investment, increase productivity growth in the economy, that's always a plus. ZARROLI: Kroszner says the tax bill being considered by Congress appears to have some good features in it, but he says there's always a risk cutting taxes will lead to higher inflation. And if it looks like that's happening, the Federal Reserve will step in to cool down the economy. KROSZNER: If it's seen as something that's just short-term, the Fed is likely to offset that to make sure the economy doesn't overheat, and that is, inflation doesn't get too high. ZARROLI: The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is expected to do so again this month. Former Fed Vice President Alan Blinder says there's already a consensus on the Fed that the economy is at or near full employment. Increasing demand by cutting taxes could amount to more stimulus than the economy needs. ALAN BLINDER: I think they would say, we already have pretty much a fully employed economy. A boost to aggregate demand is not exactly what the doctor ordered. ZARROLI: So this is a strange situation. When the Great Recession began a decade ago, both Congress and the Fed tried to do whatever they could to bolster the economy, but now they're beginning to pull in opposite directions. Last weekend, the head of the New York Federal Reserve, William Dudley, seemed to question the need for a tax cut. He told the Wall Street Journal it's probably not the best time to be trying to stimulate the economy. So while Republicans say they want to make the economy grow faster, Fed policymakers could actually undercut that effort by raising interest rates. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. (SOUNDBITE OF TAKENOBU'S \"MOMOTARO\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Republicans are smoothing out the details of their tax overhaul legislation. They're hoping for final passage this month. They say the changes will lead to more jobs, more investment. Most economists, though, are questioning the timing. They say the U. S. economy is already at near-full employment, and pushing for faster growth in 2018 could backfire. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It sounds like an admirable goal. Grow the economy. Create more jobs. Surely no one could object to that. But in the opinion of some economists, a tax cut is the last thing the U. S. needs right now. For one thing, the economy has been growing steadily for years. Growth last quarter was a healthy 3. 3 percent. Unemployment is down to 4. 1 percent. Jared Bernstein of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (ph) says this isn't the time to be thinking about a tax cut. For one thing, there's the impact it will have on federal borrowing. JARED BERNSTEIN: I think the timing of this tax cut from the perspective of the deficit is completely upside down. ZARROLI: Bernstein says he no deficit hawk, but he says when the economy is growing, common sense says you should be paying off some of your debt. BERNSTEIN: It's that simple, you know? What are you supposed to do with your roof when the sun shines? Fix it, not put a hole in it. ZARROLI: Instead, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax overhaul could add a trillion dollars to the debt over the next decade even after taking extra growth into consideration.

The measure takes away a federal tax deduction for paying state and local income taxes. If you live in a city and state with no income taxes, you're not affected. But you are affected if you live in a state that has them, like New York state, where Andrew Cuomo is the Democratic governor - who is on the line on this day, his 60th birthday. Governor, happy birthday. ANDREW CUOMO: Thank you very much, Steve. Six-oh - it's serious now, Steve. INSKEEP: It's pretty serious. But why - well, let's talk about this tax bill. Why is this - losing this deduction so bad? CUOMO: Well, it cripples, economically, the states that are affected. Now, it's New York. It's California. It's 12 other states. They all happen to be blue states, Democratic states with no representation in the Senate and very little in the House. And what this is doing is basically hurting the economies of those states to finance the tax cut in other states. New York, California - Finance threw away property tax and then income tax. Right now, that is deductible from your federal taxations. When they eliminate that deduction, they, in essence, raise your income tax and property tax by 20, 25 percent, which puts. . . INSKEEP: But let me just ask you - and I should clarify, when you say that your states have no representation, what you mean is no Republican representation that was relevant, since Republicans are doing all the business here. CUOMO: Yes, yes. INSKEEP: But doesn't this - doesn't what you're saying just underline that New York is a high-tax state? Maybe you should be a lower-tax state. CUOMO: New York is a high-tax state, yes. And this is a Republican, conservative Congress that for many years argued states' rights, argued against redistribution. But yes, California, New York are high-tax states. We have governments. We believe in providing social services and free college tuition, et cetera. And that's a decision our states have made, and we balance that economically. I understand the competitiveness, and we've lowered taxes in New York while I've been governor because we compete with Florida and Texas, et cetera, but that is how we finance our government. Other states also raise revenue. They do it in different ways - value-added tax, real estate tax. We happen to have a property tax and then income tax. New York and California also, as a matter of equity, Steve, happen to be the largest donor states in the nation. INSKEEP: Sure. CUOMO: New York is the single largest donor state. We put in $48 billion more every year than we get back from Washington. INSKEEP: Goes to other states. CUOMO: So we are all. . . INSKEEP: I want to follow up on one thing about. . . CUOMO: Yeah, we are already subsidizing every other state. INSKEEP: Yeah, that's true. I want to follow up on one detail of this, though. The state and local tax deduction goes away, but at the same time, the standard deduction that a lot of people take goes up. And when analysts make the calculation, it seems that somebody who's on the lower end of the income scale - a New York City bus driver, cop, any number of people - they're actually going to be better off. It's really only the well-off people, people making over a couple hundred thousand dollars a year who are going to be paying more in taxes. Should we be that concerned? CUOMO: Well, you have to - your opening statement was right, Steve. First of all, this is a tax bill that doesn't treat everyone equally. In this tax bill, there are going to be differences by states, which is just another divisive tactic, in my opinion. This is a Congress that has consistently sought to divide the American people. In New York, where property taxes and income taxes will go up, in effect, 20, 25 percent, you're going to be hard-pressed to find a winner. And they're cutting the numbers many different ways, Steve. Just remember this. Nationwide, 50 percent of the benefit goes to the top 1 percent - 50 percent to the top 1 percent. This is the classic conservative theory - cut the taxes on the rich and the corporations, and the benefits will trickle down to the workers. INSKEEP: Governor. . . CUOMO: This is not what they said during the campaign. INSKEEP: Governor, one other thing - we've got about 40 seconds here. People who closely follow your career will know something distinctive about you, that you have mostly avoided national interviews like this one. You stay really focused on New York state issues and work with New York state Republicans as well as Democrats. But here you are doing a national interview, which we're happy about, but it makes me curious. You going to be speaking out more? CUOMO: My state is now faced with national issues. As you know, Steve, I spent eight years in Washington during the Clinton administration. And getting involved in national issues brings a different facet to the governor's position, and I've focused on my state, but my state is now virtually locked with national issues. This tax reform bill will be transformative in a negative way. New York, California, the 12 Democratic states are going to pay the highest price. INSKEEP: Governor, thanks very much, pleasure talking with you. CUOMO: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: Andrew Cuomo is the governor of New York State.

This is status granted to those whose home countries face war or disaster. The Trump administration has been eliminating some of these protections, meaning many could face deportation when their status expires. As NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, this could have an impact on an already short-staffed construction industry. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: When Pedro Cerritos was a young man, he left the poverty and aftermath of civil war in El Salvador to settle in Houston. Nearly 20 years later, he's a construction supervisor with a mortgage, a wife and three children. Because of his Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, he's worked legally for more than 16 years. PEDRO CERRITOS: We\u2019re paying the house, we\u2019re kind of established here right now, but if we lose status, that's - you know, I\u2019m going to lose my job. NOGUCHI: Cerritos' wife, a restaurant worker, is also in limbo as one of 57,000 Hondurans who may also lose their status. He says his wife worries. He tries to avoid thinking about it. CERRITOS: You know, I don't want to get depressed. NOGUCHI: For decades, bipartisan White House administrations routinely renewed TPS status. But last month, the Trump administration lifted protections for about 53,000 workers from Haiti and Nicaragua. It will decide the fate of many more workers early next year. This is a big deal for the construction industry, which stands to lose 50,000 workers in an already tight labor market. The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Home Builders, among others, have lobbied to keep the workers, many of whom work in Texas, Florida and California, which are rebuilding after hurricanes and wildfires. Royce Murray is policy director for the American Immigration Council. ROYCE MURRAY: You know, I have worked on TPS issues for a long time, and I have never known industry to come out in support of TPS workers really in these kind of numbers ever before. NOGUCHI: Alex Nowrasteh is immigration policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute. ALEX NOWRASTEH: There's no good economic justification for ending TPS. These workers are not competing with very many Americans in the labor force. The economy is growing very rapidly in the United States. American firms and consumers want to employ these folks. NOGUCHI: Nowrasteh says forcing workers to sell their homes or work underground would have knock-on business impacts. He also notes TPS workers pay taxes but aren't eligible for welfare and food stamps. NOWRASTEH: So they're leaving, and taking their production with them, taking their output with them, taking their work with them is a total net loss. And there is no kind of savings on the taxpayer side. NOGUCHI: He agrees with liberal-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, which estimates ending TPS would mean losing $164 billion in economic growth over a decade. Mike Holland is chief operating officer for Marek, a big construction firm in Houston. Pedro Cerritos is one of 30 Marek workers with protected status. MIKE HOLLAND: You know, as I looked at the list, I was shocked. Well, what happens if Pedro loses his status? And the truth is we both get hammered. I mean, the pipeline is pinched, and there's really just not access to more labor. NOGUCHI: Marek plays by the rules and verifies its employees' legal status. He says ending the status will benefit companies who don't. HOLLAND: What happens is we lose a valued resource, struggle to meet the expectations of our clients and then feed a resource to a competitor who will beat us with our own people and doing it illegitimately.

U. S. employers added 228,000 jobs last month. Manufacturing jobs in particular are bouncing back. Employers and President Trump now have a new challenge if they want to keep the economy growing, and that is finding enough workers. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The monthly job number from the Labor Department was somewhat better than forecasters had been expecting. But it was no surprise to Tom Maher. He runs the Manpower temporary firm in Dayton, Ohio, where factories have been buzzing. TOM MAHER: Virtually every manufacturer in the area has a help wanted sign outside their window. HORSLEY: Nationwide, factories have added 189,000 jobs in the last 12 months. But even though the national unemployment rate is a low 4. 1 percent, Maher says workers' paychecks are barely outpacing inflation. MAHER: Wages are rising, but they're not rising as fast as I believe they really should in order to attract the workers that they need. HORSLEY: White House economist Kevin Hassett suspects that's partly because many of the new hires have been entry-level workers. They don't make as much as more experienced colleagues. But those entry-level openings do spell opportunity for people who haven't worked in a long time or ever. KEVIN HASSETT: We're at that point in the cycle where the market is tight enough that it's really rewarding everybody. HORSLEY: Hassett notes the jobless rate among people without a high school diploma fell by half a percentage point last month and unemployment among Hispanics fell to its lowest level ever. HASSETT: If we could sustain growth at this level for another couple of years, then the amount of progress we would make on income inequality and wage growth for middle America would be maybe even unprecedented. HORSLEY: But sustaining that level of growth or even accelerating it as the president has promised could be difficult without a larger workforce. Chief economist Constance Hunter of the KPMG accounting firm warns within the next year or two, a lack of workers could become a drag on growth. CONSTANCE HUNTER: What I expect is that we will start seeing increasing labor shortages. And at some point those labor shortages are going to really limit the ability we have to continue expanding. HORSLEY: In the past, the U. S. has relied on immigration to help fill labor shortages, but the Trump administration wants to sharply restrict that. The president believes the U. S. can lure additional homegrown workers into the job market. His plan includes both carrots in the form of tax cuts to make work more attractive and sticks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Welfare reform. Does anybody want welfare reform? HORSLEY: In Missouri last week, Trump hinted that limiting welfare programs will be one of his next priorities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all. And the person who's not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his and her ass off. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen. (CHEERING)HORSLEY: Just this week, the Agriculture Department launched a push to limit the food stamp program that serves more than 41 million Americans. Secretary Sonny Perdue says he wants to promote self-sufficiency and help recipients transition from government programs back to work. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney telegraphed that initiative last spring when he called for cutting the food stamp budget by $191 billion over the next decade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICK MULVANEY: We need folks to work. We do. There's a dignity to work, and there's a necessity to work to help the country succeed. And we need everybody to pull in the same direction. HORSLEY: The government already requires most able-bodied adults on food stamps to work at least 20 hours a week. The administration is encouraging states to attach additional work requirements to this and other programs, including Medicaid, so employers in the growing economy can find the workers they need. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF THE BEAT MECHANICS' \"SURVIVING THE TIMES (INSTRUMENTAL COVER)\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The White House is celebrating what it calls a great month for American workers. U. S. employers added 228,000 jobs last month. Manufacturing jobs in particular are bouncing back. Employers and President Trump now have a new challenge if they want to keep the economy growing, and that is finding enough workers. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The monthly job number from the Labor Department was somewhat better than forecasters had been expecting. But it was no surprise to Tom Maher. He runs the Manpower temporary firm in Dayton, Ohio, where factories have been buzzing. TOM MAHER: Virtually every manufacturer in the area has a help wanted sign outside their window. HORSLEY: Nationwide, factories have added 189,000 jobs in the last 12 months. But even though the national unemployment rate is a low 4. 1 percent, Maher says workers' paychecks are barely outpacing inflation. MAHER: Wages are rising, but they're not rising as fast as I believe they really should in order to attract the workers that they need.

It's more than 400 pages. And we're going to look at two parts of it. First, Republicans call the bill the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Critics say maybe it should be called the Tax Cut and Robots Act. That's because it doesn't create any new tax incentives that encourage companies specifically to hire workers and create jobs, but it does expand incentives for companies to buy robots and machines that replace workers. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Republicans say that lowering taxes will boost the economy and create jobs. But critics say there's this really basic imbalance. The tax bill favors buying machines over hiring workers. That doesn't seem right to Carl Pasciuto. He's the president of a high-tech manufacturing company in Woburn, Mass. CARL PASCIUTO: I think they really need to relook at the name and add the missing component of the worker. ARNOLD: Pasciuto's company is called the Custom Group. The factory floor here is full of machines that look kind of like enclosed ski gondolas. Inside them, oil is being sprayed on blocks of metal as automated cutting tools zip around, shaping them into precision parts for nuclear submarines, jet planes, all kinds of stuff. PASCIUTO: There's servos that drag the table to the position that it needs to be in. There's a robotic tool change mechanism. ARNOLD: There are many more machines here than actual workers, and under the emerging tax bill companies would have incentives to buy more. For one thing, they could write the full value of the equipment off their taxes right away. Pasciuto says he's definitely OK with that. PASCIUTO: Absolutely. We're always happy to get any break we can get. ARNOLD: But he says he actually needs well-trained workers more than he needs equipment. PASCIUTO: We do. The equipment is readily available. The workforce isn't. ARNOLD: Pasciuto says he has open positions that he can't fill because he can't find the skilled workers, so he says he sometimes has to buy machines to do the work. But he says if there were a tax incentive for training workers, he and other companies would definitely take advantage of it. And he says that would create more jobs. PASCIUTO: I think that the federal government really needs to look at what they've put in the bill and even it out from an equipment side to a training side as well. ARNOLD: And some labor economists agree with Pasciuto. Daron Acemoglu is an economist at MIT who researches automation and robots. He says first, automation is not a bad thing. It can increase productivity and be an important part of keeping the U. S. economy competitive. But. . . DARON ACEMOGLU: The problem is when you subsidize heavily the adoption of machines instead of people. ARNOLD: Then, he says, you're putting your thumb on the scale against workers. And he says these tax bills do that. He says, let's say that a business could buy a machine to replace three workers, but there's no great cost savings. ACEMOGLU: That means that machine is not a great machine. It's fine. But it's marginal. ARNOLD: So if tax policy was neutral, the business probably wouldn't buy it. But he says even the current law favors machines, and the Republican tax bills tip the scales even more. So if you buy the machine. . . ACEMOGLU: You're going to get a huge handout from the government. ARNOLD: And he says these subsidies kill jobs when there's no good economic reason to replace workers with machines. So like Carl Pasciuto, Acemoglu would like to see incentives for hiring and training. ACEMOGLU: To balance the scales it would be good to encourage firms to invest in their workers. ARNOLD: Gavin Ekins is with the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. He says it's OK that the scales are tipped towards machines. GAVIN EKINS: In the long run, it's better for the economy. ARNOLD: Ekins says, look. Some machines kill jobs, but some create jobs. If you buy a backhoe, for instance, people have to build it and someone has to drive it. Also, he says, there wasn't time to devise good incentives for training workers in this legislation. But he does agree with Acemoglu on one thing. The House version of the tax bill would drastically raise taxes on many graduate students and workers who get free tuition. And in an economy that needs a better skilled workforce. . . EKINS: Taxing the benefit of getting a free education, this is something that really shouldn't be taxed. ARNOLD: Ekins hopes the Senate version wins out on that point. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

Those of you who were around in the 1980s might be feeling a sense of deja vu, especially when you hear this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: We presented a complete program of reduction in tax rates. Again, our purpose was to provide incentive for the individual, incentives for business to encourage production and hiring of the unemployed and to free up money for investment. MARTIN: That, of course, the voice of President Ronald Reagan speaking there in a televised address back in 1981, shortly before signing those very tax cuts into law. We wanted to talk about what kind of impact those tax cuts actually had, so we called our regular economic commentator David Wessel. He is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. MARTIN: Just like President Donald Trump, one of Reagan's first moves in the White House was a big tax cut, the one in 1981. And there was supposed to be no loss in tax revenues because of all the economic growth these cuts were going to bring about. So David, how deep were those tax cuts, and did they blow up the deficit? WESSEL: Well, when Reagan arrived here in 1981, things were very different. Inflation was nearly 10 percent. The Fed had pushed up interest rates. The debt was much smaller as a share of the economy. The Reagan tax cut was huge. The top tax rate was 70 percent. He cut it to 50 percent. Now, most people in the Reagan administration didn't really think it would pay for itself, and it didn't. It blew up the deficit. They were counting on some spending cuts that never quite materialized to avoid that. And so they - it didn't pay for itself. MARTIN: Yeah. So the spending cuts never materialized, as you note, and the deficit increased. And then what happened? WESSEL: Well, it quickly became clear from the deficit projections that they had a problem. So what they did is raise taxes. With Reagan's signature, Congress undid a good chunk of the 1981 tax cut. It raised taxes a lot in '82, '83, '84 and '87. So what the history of the '80s tells us is if tax cuts are too big - if they overpromise what they're going to do, they seem to lead to tax increases. MARTIN: But wasn't there a big economic boom in the '80s? That was like a great time, right? WESSEL: Well, what the '80s tell us is you can't look at taxes in isolation. I mean, the Fed's war on inflation pushed interest rates to nearly 20 percent. It's hard to believe. We had a really deep recession. Unemployment rose above 10 percent. And then the Fed cut interest rates. The economy took off. The tax cuts definitely helped but so did the spending increases on defense and highways that Ronald Reagan approved. MARTIN: Yeah. So current Republicans in Congress have compared the tax bill of today - of 2017 - to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. What do you think? Is that a fair comparison? WESSEL: It really isn't. This is very different. That tax reform was preceded by a couple of years of really hard and public groundwork by the experts. It was bipartisan. And importantly, it was designed to improve the tax code but to raise just as much money as the then-existing tax code did - no more and no less. It did clean up the tax code. It didn't produce all the growth that people had hoped for, though. It didn't have all the effects. It's a reminder that, at times like this, we focus on how important taxes are to the economy, but there are so many other things going on that they sometimes swamp the effect of these reforms or tax cuts.

Generation Z is the generation after millennials. Their oldest members are just starting college. They have tons of buying power - in the billions of dollars - but also different tastes. Natalie Bettendorf of Youth Radio reports on how big corporations are planning for Generation Z. NATALIE BETTENDORF, BYLINE: Sheryl Connelly has a crazy job. She's in charge of looking into the future for Ford Motor Company. They're trying to predict how people my age, from Generation Z, will use cars. SHERYL CONNELLY: I have two Gen Zers at home. BETTENDORF: She's in Detroit. CONNELLY: My 16-year-old daughter is thrilled. We, actually - her car is ready to go. BETTENDORF: Yeah, that's definitely not me. CONNELLY: Well, I think it's context. It depends on where you live. BETTENDORF: A couple of decades ago, you would not have heard someone from Ford saying that owning a car is about context. Things are definitely changing. I'm 18, and I don't want a car. I'm from the Bay Area. I take buses. And when I need a car, I use Lyft. Ford's Connelly says Gen Z is a game changer. CONNELLY: They don't really care about ownership. They don't necessarily see that their vehicle is going to be a status symbol. In fact, they're really savvy customers and can be quite frugal. BETTENDORF: Does this scare you at Ford - that we're frugal? CONNELLY: No, I don't think so at all. We're ready for you. If you want to buy a car, we got it for you. If you don't want to buy a car, we can still help you there. BETTENDORF: The top three automakers in the United States are Ford, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors. They say they are no longer just automakers. Every major car company is trying to make a move, whether it's car-sharing or ride-hailing or self-driving. Even General Motors has a new app for car-sharing that it's betting billions on. It's called Maven. And Peter Kosak is the executive director of urban mobility. PETER KOSAK: We needed to create a new brand because this is really about access and not necessarily ownership. CONNELLY: Ownership? Well, whatever. Me and people my age are redefining what it means to travel by car. Susan Shaheen is at UC Berkeley and has been studying ride-sharing since the '90s - before it was a real thing. She says this isn't all bad news for car companies. SUSAN SHAHEEN: They're going to know you. If you are using their mobility services, chances are they going to have a lot of data about your preferences. They're going to know a lot about where you travel and how you travel. They're going to be in a very good position to market to you. BETTENDORF: Even if you haven't thought about owning a car, car companies have already kind of got you. Car-sharing apps essentially place you on the road to ownership. And using these services is essentially test driving, which is the first step in purchasing a car. I recently came to Los Angeles for college. Before I moved, I told people that I wouldn't have a car, and they'd say, oh, good luck. But I didn't need luck because I got here and there's Lyft and there's Uber. And right now, for people who are selling cars, I'm a problem. So is the rest of my generation. That is what is sending car companies into their own identity crisis. For NPR News, I'm Natalie Bettendorf.

Even General Motors has a new app for car-sharing that it's betting billions on. It's called Maven. And Peter Kosak is the executive director of urban mobility. PETER KOSAK: We needed to create a new brand because this is really about access and not necessarily ownership. CONNELLY: Ownership? Well, whatever. Me and people my age are redefining what it means to travel by car. Susan Shaheen is at UC Berkeley and has been studying ride-sharing since the '90s - before it was a real thing. She says this isn't all bad news for car companies. SUSAN SHAHEEN: They're going to know you. If you are using their mobility services, chances are they going to have a lot of data about your preferences. They're going to know a lot about where you travel and how you travel. They're going to be in a very good position to market to you. BETTENDORF: Even if you haven't thought about owning a car, car companies have already kind of got you. Car-sharing apps essentially place you on the road to ownership. And using these services is essentially test driving, which is the first step in purchasing a car. I recently came to Los Angeles for college. Before I moved, I told people that I wouldn't have a car, and they'd say, oh, good luck. But I didn't need luck because I got here and there's Lyft and there's Uber. And right now, for people who are selling cars, I'm a problem. So is the rest of my generation. That is what is sending car companies into their own identity crisis. For NPR News, I'm Natalie Bettendorf.

A what? - a coin, a bit? The digital currency has fluctuated since it was introduced in 2009. And just talking about bitcoin right now, here on NPR, could affect its value according to Timothy Lee, a senior tech reporter at Ars Technica. He joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. TIMOTHY LEE: Hi. Thanks for inviting me. SIMON: So merely you and me uttering - talking about bitcoin could affect its value? LEE: I think so. I mean, what you see - you've seen the price go up very quickly over the last few weeks. And you see this feedback loop where the price goes up, the media talks about it. New people hear about it. This is kind of the classic bubble psychology. People hear about it. And they say - oh, maybe I should get in 'cause this is an opportunity. And then the cycle repeats. The price goes up some more, and so it gets more coverage. SIMON: Get into what? I mean, what is it? I'm afraid, after all this time and all these stories, I'm not sure I know what a bitcoin is. LEE: So a bitcoin is just a - it's a form of electronic money. And with the traditional payment network like PayPal, the payments are made in dollars. But bitcoin is a completely autonomous, decentralized payment network, and so it's not based in dollars. Instead, it has its own currency just called the bitcoin. And its value floats against other currencies the same way the dollar and the euro float against each other. And over the last six years, it's gone up quite a lot. It was worth less than a dollar in 2011. And now, as you said, it's worth more than $15,000. SIMON: Could you buy a pack of gum, a car, a shoe factory with bitcoin? LEE: Yeah, absolutely. There's a number of companies now that will accept bitcoin as payment. Overstock. com is probably one of the better-known ones. And you can also pretty easily cash in bitcoins for dollars and buy things that way. But yeah, it's a pretty widely used currency on the Internet. SIMON: Is there a black market? LEE: One of the things you can buy with bitcoins is illicit products, like drugs, for example. And it has proven to be a particularly attractive application for bitcoin because if you tried to set up a black market for drugs and accept credit card payments, the credit card networks would shut you down right away. But there's nobody who runs the bitcoin network, and so there's nobody the authorities can go to and say, shut down this network or reverse that payment. SIMON: I gather bitcoin's created through mining but not, like, chisel and cloud of dust mining. Right? LEE: Yeah. So mining is the term that bitcoin people use for the process that computers use to kind of run the bitcoin network. There's a global shared record of who has made which payments to whom. And the computers that participate in this process get a reward of new bitcoins. Right now, every block, which happens about 10 minutes, you get a reward of 12. 5 bitcoins, which is worth more than $100,000. And they call it mining because you're creating new bitcoins in the process of running the network. SIMON: And that takes a lot of energy, I gather. LEE: It does. One recent estimate said that the bitcoin network as a whole consumes about as much energy as the nation of Denmark. SIMON: Who seems to be betting on bitcoin? LEE: I think, in the very early days, it was computer nerds - I mean, you know, technologists - people who were really interested in the technology. And now it's, I think, more just ordinary people who hear about bitcoin, obviously do some reading - have some understanding of how the technology works but, I think, see more of either profit opportunity or just like the idea of it. I think there's a significant political strain behind the appeal of bitcoin - people who don't like the Federal Reserve, don't like big banks, don't like conventional financial institutions. SIMON: Don't like taxes? LEE: Don't like taxes - exactly - kind of libertarian-minded people. SIMON: Well, what do you think it's going to do? LEE: I think it's going to continue to be volatile. I think it will probably go up more, but I don't know how much more. And then I think it will probably crash. But I don't know how much - you know, how far down it will decline.

The legislation promises to be enormously complicated. Some tax experts say it presents huge opportunities to game the tax system. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: All over the country, business owners are trying to figure out what the Republican tax overhaul means for them - people such as Emily Kerkstra (ph), who has a cafe and coffee shop in Oregon. EMILY KERKSTRA: As far as I know, like, there's two different bills. Nothing's been settled. Nothing's been passed. And the information just isn't out there. ZARROLI: Kerkstra wants to know whether she'll be able to deduct expenses. KERKSTRA: Last year, I bought a computer for my business. And now I'm hearing that if I needed to replace that computer, that would have to come straight out of my personal pocket, and I couldn't run it through my business. ZARROLI: The questions are arising because of the sheer scope of the tax bills. Jonathan Traub is managing principal at Deloitte Tax. JONATHAN TRAUB: What's going on here is an attempt to essentially rewrite the entire tax code in a space of about two months from the time we first saw the bill to the time it will get to the president's desk. ZARROLI: And the vastness of the bills has created lots of opportunities for gaming the tax code, says NYU Law School professor David Kamin. For instance there's a much lower tax rate for so-called pass-through entities, which include a lot of small business owners like doctors, architects and consultants. Kamin says the lower rates will tempt people who now earn a salary to incorporate as businesses. DAVID KAMIN: You can see immediately in the Senate bill a pretty big hole so that, potentially, many people would just be able to turn themselves into pass-throughs and get the lower rate. ZARROLI: Kamin says the same thing happened in Kansas. The state cut business taxes so sharply, it led to huge budget problems. And Kansas later had to backtrack and reverse some of those cuts. The bills passed by Congress contain other potential loopholes, as well. The Senate bill allows a partial deduction of property taxes but not state income taxes, which means states over time may lower their income taxes and raise more money through property taxes. KAMIN: There are hundreds of billions of dollars on the table over a decade. States and localities are going to have a lot of incentive to try to figure out ways to preserve tax deductibility. ZARROLI: Kamin says the legislation includes stopgap measures to prevent abuses, but a good lawyer can get around them. In fact, Kamin says the tax overhaul is a kind of full employment act for lawyers and accountants. And he says if enough people pay less taxes, the federal debt will get that much bigger. KAMIN: I am deeply concerned that the current estimates are not reflecting the kinds of games that will be played and will undercut federal revenues and lead to unfair windfalls, potentially, throughout the system. ZARROLI: There's nothing new about people gaming the tax code. They always have.

It turns out that you might be getting a Charlie Brown tree this year - you know, that sparse and limp thing that Charlie rescued? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS\")KAREN MENDELSON: (As Patty) What kind of a tree is that? TRACY STRATFORD: (As Lucy Van Pelt) You were supposed to get a good tree. Can't you even tell a good true from a poor tree? MARTIN: Or you're going to wind up paying a bit more. That's because there is a Christmas tree shortage. Here to tell us about all of this is Valerie Bauerlein. She is a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, and she looked into all of this. Hi, Valerie. VALERIE BAUERLEIN: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So at first when I read your story, I thought, what is she talking about? I see trees everywhere. Every Boy Scout on the city is selling a tree. But you tell us there really is a shortage. BAUERLEIN: There really is a shortage. And the economic definition of a shortage is that there's a lack and that it has affected the supply. So there are trees on lots. You go around town, like you said, and you'll see plenty in D. C. and in New York and some places like that. But the further you get from the tree-producing states, which are Oregon and North Carolina, the less selection you have, the higher price you pay, and the more likely it is that your Boy Scout lot or your church lot that you've gone to for a number of years - it's probably running out by now. MARTIN: And why is that? BAUERLEIN: You know, it's funny. You have to remember that Christmas trees are an agricultural crop, so they go in cycles. Trees grow a foot a year. I want an eight-foot tree. What was happening eight years ago? We were in a global economic malaise, and Christmas tree growers couldn't sell the trees that they had cut and - for the price that they had in them. So then, they planted less. So eight, 10 years later, there's a shortage. There's more demand because the economy is prospering, and there are fewer trees to meet that demand. MARTIN: How big of a decline, say, in acreage under production have we seen over, say, the last decade? BAUERLEIN: Sure, it's acreage in production has dropped about 30 percent since the early 2000s - maybe a little bit more. And you're also seeing - you saw a lot of drop-out of growers themselves, especially smaller growers in western North Carolina, one of the main producers of crops. And you know, it's funny. You're also seeing fewer growers and fewer acreage in Oregon, which is the biggest producer. They account for about 30 percent of the market. And you know, a lot of growers in Oregon have gone to grapes. The wine industry is really booming. And then, also, growers there - a smaller number - have gone to cannabis and medical marijuana since it has become legal in some western states. MARTIN: So are all types of trees affected equally - Douglas fir, Scotch pine? If you happen to have a preference, are you more or less likely to be disappointed? BAUERLEIN: It's the high-end trees that are really coveted - the Fraser firs, you know, the firs out of Oregon that are tougher to find, especially at the height of eight feet or above. That's where the real pressure point is. MARTIN: OK, Valerie, you know I'm going to put you on the spot now. BAUERLEIN: OK. MARTIN: Have you gotten your tree, or do you have one of those, like, white aluminum things? BAUERLEIN: (Laughter) You know, as a Wall Street Journal reporter, I'm not sure I'm allowed to venture an opinion on this. MARTIN: (Laughter). BAUERLEIN: I will say that I did get a live tree. I did pay about 10 percent more than last year, which was what was expected. And I did talk with the folks at the lot that I went to and have, you know, a number of friends on Facebook and elsewhere who have said, you know, it's a tight market this year.

And there could be some problems to work out. Many major laws are tweaked after they're passed to work out technical kinks. But because of the haste around this bill in particular, some are worried that there will be more unforeseen issues than usual on a bill that will affect the pocketbooks of millions of Americans. I'm joined now by Greg Jenner. He's a partner at Stoel Rives law firm and a former top tax official under President George W. Bush. Thank you so much for joining me. GREG JENNER: My pleasure, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You say this may create more problems than past efforts. Why? JENNER: Well, I think you mentioned it before. It's moving through with incredible speed. And with speed comes mistakes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say mistakes, what are you talking about? JENNER: Well, you know, a lot of this is mind-numbingly complex tax rules that only a tax lawyer would love. But, for example, one of the signature proposals in the bill is a lower rate for what are called pass-through entities, and that's never been done before. The theory is that when you have, you know, small businesses that operate in, like, partnerships or sole proprietorships, you want to give them a break. The problem, however, is that that rule can be manipulated and gamed by very smart people. And so what they've done is they put in a lot of complexity to prevent some of that gaming. And with that complexity are going to come rules that are going to get bent, that are going to get avoided, that are going to get jumped over. That's just an example. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to get your opinion right now from what you know of the bill. You know, Republicans have long wanted to simplify the tax code. It's almost an article of faith in the party now. Do you think this plan will achieve that? JENNER: The answer is yes and no (laughter). There are certainly some simplifications in this bill that are well worthwhile. For example, raising the standard deduction for individuals is going to result in incredible simplification because it will mean that fewer people have to itemize. On the other hand, as I mentioned, you know, the pastorate provision, which is a signature piece of this bill, is incredibly complicated. So I would say that there are some very, very good simplifications in here and some provisions that are not too simple. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So we're going to have congressional Republicans now meet to try and hash out the differences between the House and the Senate plans. Can't some of these problems be resolved then? JENNER: They can, and they will. But, you know, I've described this process - it's like peeling an onion. There's going to be layer after layer after layer of nuance that are - that's only discovered over time and with multiple readings. So those - and those nuances tend to be discovered as you have time to work on the bill. But this is going into law immediately and will take effect on January 1. So there are going to be a lot of things that are not discovered in time and can only be worked out over time. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is there any hope of a legislative fix, a second piece of legislation that might remedy these issues further down the line? JENNER: Yes, absolutely. In fact, technical corrections, as they're referred to, are inevitable in any tax bill. The interesting thing, though, is that technical corrections can't be pushed through with a 51-vote majority in the Senate like this bill is being put through. So it becomes - technical corrections would become a tax bill that's subject to amendment and all of the add-ons that the - that Congress is going to try and avoid. So what that means is that it's going to be very, very difficult to fix the bill once it gets enacted. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Greg Jenner. He's a partner at Stoel Rives law firm and a former tax official under President George W. Bush. Thank you so much. JENNER: My pleasure - thank you, Lulu. (SOUNDBITE OF GEOTIC'S \"NAV\") LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  As congressional Republicans work to reconcile the difference between the House and the Senate tax bills, the public has gotten its first look at the substance of that bill. And there could be some problems to work out. Many major laws are tweaked after they're passed to work out technical kinks. But because of the haste around this bill in particular, some are worried that there will be more unforeseen issues than usual on a bill that will affect the pocketbooks of millions of Americans. I'm joined now by Greg Jenner. He's a partner at Stoel Rives law firm and a former top tax official under President George W. Bush. Thank you so much for joining me. GREG JENNER: My pleasure, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: You say this may create more problems than past efforts. Why? JENNER: Well, I think you mentioned it before. It's moving through with incredible speed. And with speed comes mistakes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say mistakes, what are you talking about? JENNER: Well, you know, a lot of this is mind-numbingly complex tax rules that only a tax lawyer would love. But, for example, one of the signature proposals in the bill is a lower rate for what are called pass-through entities, and that's never been done before. The theory is that when you have, you know, small businesses that operate in, like, partnerships or sole proprietorships, you want to give them a break. The problem, however, is that that rule can be manipulated and gamed by very smart people. And so what they've done is they put in a lot of complexity to prevent some of that gaming. And with that complexity are going to come rules that are going to get bent, that are going to get avoided, that are going to get jumped over. That's just an example. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to get your opinion right now from what you know of the bill. You know, Republicans have long wanted to simplify the tax code. It's almost an article of faith in the party now. Do you think this plan will achieve that? JENNER: The answer is yes and no (laughter). There are certainly some simplifications in this bill that are well worthwhile. For example, raising the standard deduction for individuals is going to result in incredible simplification because it will mean that fewer people have to itemize. On the other hand, as I mentioned, you know, the pastorate provision, which is a signature piece of this bill, is incredibly complicated. So I would say that there are some very, very good simplifications in here and some provisions that are not too simple. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So we're going to have congressional Republicans now meet to try and hash out the differences between the House and the Senate plans. Can't some of these problems be resolved then? JENNER: They can, and they will. But, you know, I've described this process - it's like peeling an onion. There's going to be layer after layer after layer of nuance that are - that's only discovered over time and with multiple readings. So those - and those nuances tend to be discovered as you have time to work on the bill. But this is going into law immediately and will take effect on January 1.

Now we're going to talk about another economic indicator as part of our series Highly Specific Superlatives, in which we nerd out about the best, the worst, the least, the most of 2017. NPR's Cardiff Garcia co-hosts NPR's newest podcast The Indicator. It's about the big ideas behind business news. And he is with us now. Hey. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: So hit me. What is your highly specific superlative from 2017? GARCIA: My highly specific and also highly nerdy superlative is the most ignored indicator that actually says a lot about the economy - the global economy. It's the pace of growth in global trade, the pace of growth in how much we buy and sell goods and services across borders to and from other countries. MCEVERS: OK, global trade, yeah. GARCIA: Yep. MCEVERS: Tell me about it. Like, what's - give me a little snapshot of what that indicator tells us. GARCIA: I love this indicator. And the snapshot is that it's growing a lot. The IMF projects that by the end of this year it will have grown 4. 2 percent. That is a big acceleration on last year. And I think what I love most about this superlative is that it contrasts so starkly with the headlines that we've seen all year about the world turning inward and about protectionism and about countries becoming more self-reliant. I love that this just kind of goes so starkly against that narrative. MCEVERS: Well, yeah so - OK, explain that because, I mean, you know, I think a lot of people think, like, we're pulling out of trade deals. We're tightening borders. We've you know, scrapped deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and threatened to tear up NAFTA and all of that stuff. So, like, how does this square with all that? GARCIA: Yeah. So I guess the simple answer here is that so far at least, there's been more talk than action. So yeah, we've threatened to pull out of NAFTA, but NAFTA is still in place. We did leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but keep in mind that the other 11 countries are still going ahead. And so what we've learned is also that the U. S. isn't the only country that matters here, that this is global trade, not just U. S. trade with everybody else - and so. . . MCEVERS: Right. GARCIA: . . . More talk than action. And also, we're learning that maybe the U. S. isn't the only place that that counts here. MCEVERS: OK. How do we want to think about this going forward? GARCIA: Yeah. I mean, this is a - it's a complicated narrative. If you think about it, it's not like right now if you make a product in another country and then you send it to a country to be bought and sold, that that's the way things still work. That's sort of the old world, right? Now the way it works is that as a product gets made, it passes through a bunch of different countries, and each country has a process or a factory that adds a component or a new way of making it by the time it gets to its final destination to be sold. And so even if you make it hard to do business with, say, Mexico, well, OK then, the factory and that process just shifts somewhere else. It's like this big supply chain gets redirected. And so what we're seeing now is that it's just really, really hard to deconstruct that process. The world is very closely integrated, and it's not easy for any one or two places to just turn that away. MCEVERS: NPR's Cardiff Garcia co-hosts The Indicator.

And people who build affordable housing are desperate to see what is in this bill. That's because the House version would scrap a tax incentive that underpins about half of the affordable housing units that get built across the country. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Since the House version of the tax bill was first passed, housing advocates have been scared. They say that a provision in it would mean that a lot of working families - people on lower incomes and the elderly - would lose out on the chance to get a place that they could afford to live. DIANE YENTEL: The effect would be devastating. It would mean a loss of around 800,000 affordable rental homes over the next 10 years. ARNOLD: Diane Yentel heads up the National Low Income Housing Coalition. She says for decades, there's been this bedrock funding mechanism that's helped millions of affordable housing units to get built. It's called a private activity bond. And it allows banks and other companies to get a tax break if they invest in affordable housing construction. But in the House version, Yentel says this funding mechanism gets destroyed. YENTEL: This essentially eliminates nearly half of the affordable homes that can be developed or preserved throughout the country through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. ARNOLD: Now, lawmakers say that they've reached a deal on the tax bill, but they're not talking about this provision publicly yet. A senior congressional aide tells NPR that the Senate version has won out on this score. That would be great, say the advocates, since it didn't have this poison pill. But other reports disagree with that and say that lawmakers still have been negotiating over these private activity bonds. So until the final language is unveiled later today, there's a lot of confusion. BARBARA THOMPSON: The waiting is torture. So much is at stake. ARNOLD: Barbara Thompson is the executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies. She's hearing that the framework for these crucial housing bonds will survive. THOMPSON: We are cautiously optimistic. ARNOLD: But she's also worried by reports that lawmakers have been making changes to the program that still might mean fewer of these bonds get used for affordable housing. THOMPSON: Changes that will severely limit the resources available. And we're talking about billions of dollars potentially being at stake. ARNOLD: The reason that this system of tax credits and subsidies has been so crucial is that it reduces the cost of construction, so that the developers, who are often nonprofits, can charge less money for the units, which makes them affordable. OK. So why would Republicans in the House want to throw a grenade into this system if it's been working? Scott Greenberg is an analyst with the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. SCOTT GREENBERG: Tax exempt bonds are probably a relatively inefficient way of subsidizing projects meant to benefit the public. ARNOLD: Basically, Greenberg's saying that you could get more bang for your buck subsidizing affordable housing in other ways. So he's been in favor of scrapping this tax break. Chris Mayer is a housing economist with Columbia Business School. He hopes that Congress does not scrap these housing subsidies because he says if it does, he worries. . . CHRISTOPHER MAYER: We're not going to replace them with a more efficient program. And that means - what we're doing on that is cutting the subsidies for low-income people. We're making it more expensive for them to live. We end up with more people being homeless. And we end up with more families struggling in this country. ARNOLD: Yentel says this affordable housing program has had bipartisan support for decades. Liberals get the housing that they want built. Corporations get tax credits. It creates public-private partnerships. So she's hoping that all of that will help keep the entire program intact when we see the compromise-tax-bill language later today. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: The Trump administration is promising that most taxpayers will notice a difference in their paystubs early next year. Here's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on CBS's \"Face The Nation. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")STEVEN MNUCHIN: We're already working at the IRS to update the tax forms and update the tax charts, and they're going to see this in their paychecks in February. NAYLOR: It sounds relatively simple to change withholding tables. Just plug some new numbers into the computer. But former IRS commissioner John Koskinen says even simple changes are complex thanks to Kennedy-era computer programs the agency uses. JOHN KOSKINEN: For the IRS, providing new forms is often a challenge because a lot of our forums are hard-coded. So you don't just enter a little thing in your computer. You actually have to go into the code and change the date or change the forms. NAYLOR: Making the job more difficult, since 2010, the IRS's budget has been slashed by $900 million, resulting in 21,000 fewer employees. Koskinen, an Obama appointee who stepped down from the agency just last month, worries the IRS could find itself in a disastrous spiral. KOSKINEN: My concern has been that if the budget continues to be cut - and that's what the House and Senate are proposing to do even with this massive tax overhaul. If you continue to cut the budget, you're actually at some point going to make the IRS dysfunctional. NAYLOR: The last time a major tax overhaul was approved in 1986, Congress actually appropriated more money for the IRS to hire additional personnel. This time the president and House and Senate leaders have all proposed deeper cuts in the agency's budget. Tony Reardon heads up the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents IRS employees. TONY REARDON: Congress is adding massive, massive new responsibilities to the IRS and expecting them to handle it with less money and even fewer employees. NAYLOR: He says that makes for a very difficult situation for the agency and for its employees and of course for taxpayers. One place where the lack of IRS personnel might be most apparent is the agency's taxpayer help line. JENNIFER MACMILLAN: Yes (laughter). Yeah, it's going to be a nightmare. NAYLOR: Jennifer MacMillan is with the National Association of Enrolled Agents, which represents tax preparers. She says the IRS couldn't keep up with all the calls from taxpayers seeking help with their returns last year. Many were kept waiting on hold for over an hour. Next year, MacMillan expects lots of confusion with the new law. MACMILLAN: People are going to be calling them. Lots and lots of people are going to be calling not only to find out what the implications to them might be. I think a lot of people are going to be under the - you know, have a misunderstanding and think that it's going to affect their filing of 2017 tax returns. NAYLOR: And that's important to note. Many taxpayers won't notice all the new changes until they go to file their 2018 taxes due in April 2019. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

NAYLOR: He says that makes for a very difficult situation for the agency and for its employees and of course for taxpayers. One place where the lack of IRS personnel might be most apparent is the agency's taxpayer help line. JENNIFER MACMILLAN: Yes (laughter). Yeah, it's going to be a nightmare. NAYLOR: Jennifer MacMillan is with the National Association of Enrolled Agents, which represents tax preparers. She says the IRS couldn't keep up with all the calls from taxpayers seeking help with their returns last year. Many were kept waiting on hold for over an hour. Next year, MacMillan expects lots of confusion with the new law. MACMILLAN: People are going to be calling them. Lots and lots of people are going to be calling not only to find out what the implications to them might be. I think a lot of people are going to be under the - you know, have a misunderstanding and think that it's going to affect their filing of 2017 tax returns. NAYLOR: And that's important to note. Many taxpayers won't notice all the new changes until they go to file their 2018 taxes due in April 2019.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's been an amazing experience. I have to tell you - hasn't been done in 34 years but actually really hasn't been done because we broke every record. It's the largest - I always say the most massive, but it's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. SUAREZ: A political win for the president and a financial win for many U. S. businesses. Corporations will see their tax rate fall from 35 to 21 percent. Small businesses and privately held companies also will see their taxes cut. Of course some businesses make out better than others, and NPR's Jim Zarroli is here to break that down for us. Hi, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. SUAREZ: Let's start with the big winners - multinational corporations. Other than the sharp drop in the tax rate we just mentioned, are there other things in this bill for them to like? ZARROLI: Oh, yes. Big companies like Microsoft and Ford and Caterpillar that sell a lot of products overseas - they will have a lower tax rate, as you point out. But the bill also does something else. Right now the government charges U. S. companies taxes on profits they make overseas. So, like, if Apple sells an iPhone in France, it's supposed to pay taxes on the profits it makes to the U. S. government once it brings those profits back into the United States. Now, in practice, what this has meant is a lot of companies just basically keep their profits overseas because they don't want to pay taxes. So the bill does basically two things. It creates this one-time-only, low tax rate for these companies to bring money back into the United States. And then second, in the future, they will no longer have to pay U. S. taxes on the money they make overseas. SUAREZ: The president came to office promising to help companies that make things, manufacturers. Does this bill make good on his promise? ZARROLI: Well, yes. Take one example. One thing the bill does is it changes the way companies can deduct large purchases of equipment. Right now if a factory buys a new piece of machinery, the company has to deduct that over a long period of time. But the new bill allows them to do that all upfront. I mean, you can take the deduction in a single year. So that will be really good for capital-intensive industries like, you know, auto makers and machine tool companies, companies that buy a lot of equipment. They will see their tax bills lowered. SUAREZ: President Trump when he was still candidate Trump campaigned against something that's popular on Wall Street, what's called the carried interest loophole. What is it exactly, and is it now gone? ZARROLI: It is not gone. Just to explain, if you get income from a hedge fund or a private equity fund, it's treated as capital gains, and it's taxed at a much lower rate than regular income. So the upshot is a hedge fund executive may - pays a lower rate than someone like a teacher or a postal worker. And this has been very controversial for a long time, and President Trump repeatedly talked about how unfair it was, promised to do something about it. Now the White House says it tried really hard to get rid of this, but it encountered too much opposition from Congress. SUAREZ: The president has often said in the past few weeks that he and his rich friends will be hurt by this tax bill, that there's not really that much in it for them. The president made much of his fortune in real estate. Will real estate companies really be hurt by this bill? ZARROLI: Oh, on the contrary. I mean, real estate does well. To give you just one example, the bill for the first time caps the amount of money that companies can deduct when they borrow. And this cap will hurt a lot of companies, but the cap does not apply to real estate firms. And real estate companies borrow a lot. You know, President Trump has called himself the king of debt. So he will benefit, and so will a lot of the big real estate investment firms that he partners with. SUAREZ: NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York. Thanks, Jim. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

S. economy. The bill has passed both houses of Congress and is just one procedural vote away from heading to President Trump's desk. And he's expected to sign the measure this week. Let's talk about the impact of this bill with NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner, who's with us. Hey, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So one way Republicans are selling this plan sounds great. They're saying this - you know, the tax code is monstrously complicated. This is going to simplify it. Is that true? BERLINER: True simplification? No. You know, under current law, there are seven individual tax brackets in the GOP plan. Guess what? We still have seven brackets. That. . . GREENE: Not much of a reduction in brackets. (LAUGHTER)BERLINER: . . . That hasn't changed. And, in some ways, the tax system's about to get way more complicated. You know, accountants in the IRS are going to really have their hands full, especially dealing with these big changes in how businesses are taxed. But there's at least one way taxes - filing taxes will get simpler. Fewer people are going to itemize - you know, take deductions for things like charitable contributions and mortgage interest. Right now, about 30 percent of households do that. That's expected to fall to 10 percent or even lower, so more people are going to use those shorter forms. GREENE: So what are the big changes here in store for, you know, average taxpayers in the country? BERLINER: So for people, tax rates will go down, at least for the time being, though it's going to be a larger standard deduction. That's the amount you can automatically take off your tax bill. But a lot of people will no longer be able to pare down their tax bill by taking these big deductions for state, local and property taxes. GREENE: And that's where we pick up the argument the Democrats are making - that, you know, sure, many - most Americans will see something, but if you lose those deductions and you start looking at the details, you know, this is really favoring the wealthy and businesses more than regular taxpayers. And let me ask you to fact-check that. I mean, are these cuts mostly going to companies, as critics are saying? BERLINER: The cuts are mostly going to companies. The cuts for individuals, they're slated to end after 2025. And the business tax cuts are supposed to be permanent. And beyond that, you know, there are these big changes for companies like a big cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. So what we're about to see is this real-world test of this core Republican and conservative idea - the idea that cutting taxes for a company isn't just good for the companies themselves, that it's going to be better for workers and their families. If you lower taxes, companies will invest more. They'll hire new workers. Wages will rise. And the economy will grow faster than it has since the recession. GREENE: Yeah. I think even Stephen Moore, the Republican economist, has said that it's a gamble, I mean, to see if their argument actually works out in the way that they want it to and hope it will. BERLINER: Yeah. We're about to see in the real world whether it's true or not. GREENE: Republicans also have suggested these tax cuts will more or less pay for themselves and not increase deficits. What do you - what about that argument? BERLINER: The evidence for that is very thin. Virtually all independent analysts say the tax cuts will increase deficits even if the economy grows a little bit faster than expected. So now you have a situation where Republicans, they're supposed to be the party of fiscal responsibility, they - basically gone silent about the deficit. And Democrats are talking about it a lot. It's something they haven't really done in the past. GREENE: NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner. Uri, thanks. BERLINER: You're welcome, David. GREENE: And later this afternoon on All Things Considered, we'll hear how the tax overhaul will affect the IRS.

But there's also the question of who will win the economic debate at the heart of this bill, whether it's going to work out the way President Trump and GOP lawmakers have been selling it - that huge tax cuts for people and corporations will drive huge economic growth for the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The economy now has hit 3 percent. Nobody thought it would be anywhere close. I think we could go to 4, 5 and maybe even 6 percent ultimately. MARTIN: That of course was President Trump talking last week as he left for Camp David. A lot of experts say, though, that they see a different outcome. To explain why, we're joined now by Princeton economist and former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder. Professor Blinder, thanks so much for speaking with us. ALAN BLINDER: Nice to be with you. MARTIN: So history obviously is going to tell us who was right here, whether President Trump. . . BLINDER: Right. MARTIN: . . . And Republican lawmakers will get the results they're promising, whether it's the economists who are raising concerns. You are one of those economists. BLINDER: I am. And I can guarantee you, at least at the upper end - when the president went to 6 percent, I can guarantee you what history will say about that. MARTIN: Which is what? BLINDER: That it was wildly crazy. Three percent is not wildly crazy. It's just super optimistic. Six percent is wildly crazy. MARTIN: Could you tell us a little bit more about why you say that? BLINDER: Sure - because we have a modest growth of the labor force that's less than a half a percent a year. So to get to 6, that means you have to get to 5 and a half percent per annum productivity growth for a sustained period, which has never happened in the history of the U. S. data ever. MARTIN: But we've heard that clip - we heard that clip from President Trump earlier. I mean, would it be fair to say that the economy is at 3 percent and that that was not expected either? BLINDER: I think that's probably fair. But you want to remember he's talking about quarterly growth rates annualized. We have had any number of 3 percent-plus quarterly growth rates during the eight years that Obama was president, but the average was not 3 percent. So a 3 percent quarter now and again is not exactly a shocking development. Although I think it is fair to say that when President Trump got elected, most people would have predicted 3 percent for the recent quarter. MARTIN: So before we let you go, could you just walk us through your baseline concern for people who are not familiar with what you've been saying? And I understand that you're still continuing to write about this. What is your biggest concern walking through the next year and then perhaps in the out years after that? BLINDER: Yes. First of all, it blows a hole in the budget at a time when we don't really need this. We're at full employment. We don't need stimulus. It's not 2009. Secondly, while the president has claimed this is the biggest tax cut in history, which is blatantly false, it probably is the most regressive tax cut in history. Thirdly or fourthly or whatever I'm up to, under the guise of achieving greater simplification - remember; it was going to be on a postcard. The law opens up a number of new and pretty egregious loopholes while closing very few. So we're going to get a more complex, more loophole-ridden tax code that's regressive and unbalances the budget. Now you can ask me, what's the good side? (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: Is there one? BLINDER: I don't think is. No, there is a good side actually. I think it was a good move both on simplicity grounds and on distributional grounds to raise the standard deduction. That is mainly for lower- and middle-income people. The rich are itemizing their deductions. So that is a good thing and does achieve some simplification in the code.

Maybe you did more of it online this year. Easy for you but bad for your local mall - brick-and-mortar stores are losing jobs. And it turns out some workers are hit harder than others. A new analysis shows that last year women in retail lost jobs while men actually gained them. Heidi Hartmann is an author on the study. She's with the Institute for Women's Policy Research. And she joins us in studio to explain. Hi, Heidi. Thank you for coming in. HEIDI HARTMANN: Oh, It's a pleasure to be with you. FRAYER: So what exactly did your analysis find? HARTMANN: Well, we found that women lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in retail over the last year, and men gained more than 100,000 jobs. And we were quite surprised because we think of retail trade as a women's industry. FRAYER: Right. HARTMANN: And the biggest losses for women were in general merchandise stores. And the biggest gains for men were in the same kind of stores. And that's the hugest part of retail. FRAYER: So this was not a positive holiday gift to women? HARTMANN: (Laughter) No. I'd characterize it as women getting coal in their stocking this Christmas season. FRAYER: So what exactly do you think is behind this trend? HARTMANN: Well, I think it is the consumer durables. We know that just like in other industries. . . FRAYER: Durables are - what? - washing machines, cars, big-ticket items. HARTMANN: . . . Furniture - things that last a long time as compared to clothing, cosmetics, things like that. FRAYER: And this year we saw a rise in sales of these items? HARTMANN: We did. We saw hiring anyway. And that's interesting. I think it's a longtime recovery from that very deep and long recession we had in 2007 and 2009. They're finally catching up. FRAYER: People finally decided it was time to invest in a new washing machine after holding off for a couple of years. HARTMANN: Yeah. FRAYER: So we're talking about men selling more of these big appliances, women selling clothes and cosmetics. What's the wage disparity there? I imagine that the commission is higher if you sell a car than if you sell a T-shirt. HARTMANN: Well, definitely. Men make more in retail just the way they make more in almost every industry and every occupation. But, you know, women have tried for years to get these jobs. Sears actually won a case in the '70s saying that it wasn't enough to just show a statistical disparity, that there were no women in the jobs. That wasn't enough (laughter). And the judge ruled that the plaintiffs hadn't shown intention that Sears didn't. . . FRAYER: So this was women suing because they were denied access to those high-commission sales jobs. HARTMANN: Absolutely. FRAYER: We've broken this down by gender. But are there also disparities when it comes to race or age in the retail industry? HARTMANN: Well, there probably are. This data set doesn't have it. And we vowed that this is so interesting we're going to take a look in the spring when we can get a different data set that will have all of those demographic variables. FRAYER: Let's talk again then. Yeah. HARTMANN: I'd love to. FRAYER: Heidi Hartmann - an economist and president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research here in Washington. Thanks for coming in. HARTMANN: Thank you so much. LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  By now, you'd better have your holiday shopping done. Maybe you did more of it online this year. Easy for you but bad for your local mall - brick-and-mortar stores are losing jobs. And it turns out some workers are hit harder than others. A new analysis shows that last year women in retail lost jobs while men actually gained them. Heidi Hartmann is an author on the study. She's with the Institute for Women's Policy Research. And she joins us in studio to explain. Hi, Heidi. Thank you for coming in. HEIDI HARTMANN: Oh, It's a pleasure to be with you. FRAYER: So what exactly did your analysis find? HARTMANN: Well, we found that women lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in retail over the last year, and men gained more than 100,000 jobs. And we were quite surprised because we think of retail trade as a women's industry. FRAYER: Right. HARTMANN: And the biggest losses for women were in general merchandise stores. And the biggest gains for men were in the same kind of stores. And that's the hugest part of retail. FRAYER: So this was not a positive holiday gift to women? HARTMANN: (Laughter) No. I'd characterize it as women getting coal in their stocking this Christmas season. FRAYER: So what exactly do you think is behind this trend? HARTMANN: Well, I think it is the consumer durables. We know that just like in other industries. . . FRAYER: Durables are - what? - washing machines, cars, big-ticket items. HARTMANN: . . . Furniture - things that last a long time as compared to clothing, cosmetics, things like that. FRAYER: And this year we saw a rise in sales of these items? HARTMANN: We did. We saw hiring anyway. And that's interesting. I think it's a longtime recovery from that very deep and long recession we had in 2007 and 2009. They're finally catching up. FRAYER: People finally decided it was time to invest in a new washing machine after holding off for a couple of years. HARTMANN: Yeah. FRAYER: So we're talking about men selling more of these big appliances, women selling clothes and cosmetics. What's the wage disparity there? I imagine that the commission is higher if you sell a car than if you sell a T-shirt. HARTMANN: Well, definitely. Men make more in retail just the way they make more in almost every industry and every occupation. But, you know, women have tried for years to get these jobs.

The Dow Jones has risen by more than 25 percent this year, and the other major indexes saw huge gains as well. NPR's Jim Zarroli explains why. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It was a year in which the Dow marched past one milestone after another - blowing through 21,000, 22,000 and then. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"AFTER THE BELL\")LIZ CLAMAN: Claman Countdown. DAVID ASMAN: There we go. It is a record day as the Dow comes even close. We're only like 30, 40 points away from 23,000. We. . . ZARROLI: By yesterday, the Dow was at nearly 25,000. The surge in stock prices was great news for anyone with a retirement account and for a lot of other people as well. Josh Peters (ph) of Charlotte, N. C. saw his stock portfolio climb by 27 percent. He's about to quit working and enter a Ph. D. program. So he says, the money will come in handy. JOHN PETERS: It just gave me a lot more financial freedom to try different things and not be so concerned about my financial well-being. ZARROLI: No one seemed to talk about the stock market boom as much as President Trump. Before his election, Trump sometimes warned that stock prices were inflated. But this year, he used stock prices to vindicate his economic agenda. Here he was last summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The stock market hit an all-time record high today - over 22,000. We've picked up, substantially now, more than $4 trillion in net worth in terms of our country, our stocks, our companies. ZARROLI: In fact, many stock analysts say Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation probably contributed to the boom. But the main reason for the surge has to do with global economic conditions. Stocks were up in much of the world. Paul Christopher is head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. PAUL CHRISTOPHER: The U. S. , Europe, Japan, China - they're all growing together now for the first time since 2007. And what that's done is to really boost confidence all around the world. And that's really brought more money into equity markets. ZARROLI: Christopher says U. S. corporate profits were unexpectedly strong this year, and consumers were buying a lot. Credit card debt is growing. But Wharton School finance professor Jeremy Siegel says, regardless of what the stock market has done, there's not a lot of evidence yet that overall economic growth is increasing as much. JEREMY SIEGEL: I mean, I see some encouraging signs the last two quarters, these last three quarters. But I'm not ready to say that a new trend has really been established. ZARROLI: And Siegel says he doesn't expect Washington to do much to change that. Now that the tax bill has been signed into law, the benefits of the cuts have already been priced into the market. Siegel says given the sharp partisan divide in Washington, Congress is unlikely to accomplish anything else of real economic significance. And that means 2018 is unlikely to be as good a year for stocks as 2017 has been. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.
