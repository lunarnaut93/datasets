"author": "No author found", "published_date": "2005-05-02", "content": "     ED GORDON, host:      From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.  I'm Ed Gordon.      President Bush has put overhauling Social Security at the top of his      priority list, and Congress has been busy itself--busying itself with a      number of hot-button issues from filibusters to bankruptcy, Terri Schiavo      to Tom DeLay. But according to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll,      it's the economy that's worrying the average American.  With gas prices      high, consumer confidence low and wages sluggish, 57 percent of Americans      disapprove of the president's handling of the economy.  That's the      highest spike in more than a year.      Joining us for a closer look at the numbers in our Washington, DC,      studios: Julianne Malveaux, economist and author of \"Unfinished Business:      A Democrat and Republican Take on the Most Important Issues Women Face,\"      and Tim Kane, Bradley Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation.      He's also a former senior economist with the Joint Economic Committee of      the US Congress, and he joins us from the nation's capital as well.      Thank you both for joining us.  Julianne, let me start with you.  We saw      the president and his news conference just days ago, mentioning some of      the issues in the economy.  Tell me a thumbnail sketch of you see the      economy right now.      Ms. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist; Author, \"Unfinished Business\"):  I      think the economy is sluggish.  We don't have the growth rates that we      thought we would; our first quarter was 3. 1 percent.  We haven't been      generating jobs in the way that we think we should.  Last month 110,000      jobs with--against a projection of about 300,000.  The gas prices being      up I think is a real negative, especially as we go into the summer      season.  A lot of families will be cutting back on what they're going to      be doing this summer.  And, of course, our travel and tourism industry is      likely to be cut because of that.      This is a sluggish economy, and, Ed, you're absolutely on point when you      talk about the fact that people are paying attention to it.  The fact      that while this is happening the Congress would spend this time on Terri      Schiavo--this man has not left Crawford, Texas, for real--rain nor snow      nor, you know, sleet, hail, you know, or Iraq.  But he comes back in his      PJs to keep a woman alive for another day or so.  It's really kind of      disgraceful.      What--this is an interesting week, though, and this is a good week to be      having this conversation because tomorrow, of course, the Fed will meet,      make a decision about interest rates, will be looking at inflation, and      at the end of the week we'll have the new employment numbers.  So a      perfect week to be focusing on the economy.      GORDON:  Tim Kane, I'm curious.  It seems to me that you don't hear a      huge cry, though, from the public about the economy right now.  We hear      about the gas prices and individual items and issues, but not the economy      as a whole. Why is that?      Mr. TIM KANE (The Heritage Foundation; Former Senior Economist, Joint      Economic Committee):  Well, I think Americans are very attuned to the      strength of their economy, both in historical terms--I mean, even though      we've only grown at 3. 1 percent at an annualized pace, that's still      growth.  And we also look across at the Atlantic and we Germany's growing      at 0. 7 percent.  Germany and France both have unemployment rates that are      double ours.  So, you know, America--I think a good metaphor is we're      like the Shaquille O'Neal of economies.  We're the biggest and we're      still growing.  So there's just not too much to complain about on the      macro level.  But you hit it.  It's things like gas prices.  It's those      day-to-day pocketbook issues that are really nagging to Americans.  But      the overall economy's absolutely healthy.      GORDON:  Julianne, what would. . .      Ms. MALVEAUX:  Tim, you know, it depends on who you are.  I mean, why are      you talking about the overall economy being healthy?  The fact is that      African-American people experience those same unemployment rates that      they're experiencing in Germany.  Our unemployment rate is 10. 4 percent.      In addition, if you look at the bottom--if you look at the very bottom,      Ed, what you're going to find is that people at the bottom have not seen      their wages grow at all.  So some people are doing very well in the      United States, and many are doing very poorly.  And these are the people      who've been sidelined by the Bush administration.      GORDON:  Tim, you wanna take up on that?      Mr. KANE:  Well, that's the--yeah, sure.  It's just--it's really an      unfortunate notion that wages are stagnant.  They may have been stagnant      for the last year, but take a look at the last five years or 10 years.      They've been growing at every level:  for African-Americans, for      Asian-Americans.  One thing we need to look at, though, is what are the      right policies for the future?  And this is where the president has said,      `Let's stimulate investment.  Let's lower taxes. '  Everybody can      appreciate a tax cut, and that's really given the economy a great boost.      As far as wage growth, absolutely not.  Everybody benefits when we have      an economy that's free of regulation.  France, Germany have way too much      regulation, way too many taxes. It's a failed policy.      GORDON:  Let me ask this.  When you. . .      Ms. MALVEAUX:  Tim, I was waiting for you to start beating on that.      It. . .      GORDON:  Let me ask this, Julianne, before you pick up on that.      Ms. MALVEAUX:  I just have to answer that, though.  OK.      GORDON:  Wait just one second and you can follow up on that.  But I'm      curious--for the layperson who hears the idea that wages are up, personal      income up--but how does that fare with things that impact that, like      consumer spending or consumer pricing?      Ms. MALVEAUX:  Well, we have not had a lot of inflation.  It's been up a      little bit lately.  But people actually are--this tax-cut nonsense that      Tim is putting out there has translated into tax increases at the state      level.  So while the federal government may be taking less out of your      paycheck, states are taking more and they're providing fewer services.      Again, people on the bottom are really getting hit.      I knew that Tim, coming from The Heritage Foundation, wasn't going to      give us three minutes before he started pulling out that right-wing      claptrap about the president's policies.  The fact is that these policies      have not at all stimulated investment, and even had they, they have not      stimulated employment growth at the numbers that we see.  With 3. 1      percent increase in growth, why are we only generating 110,000 jobs in a      month?  That's ridiculous, Tim.  You can't reconcile those numbers.      Mr. KANE:  Well, I can reconcile the fact that we have an unemployment      rate of 5. 2 percent.  That's what economists call a natural rate.  It's      lower than the average of the '80s.  It's lower than the average of the      '90s, the Clinton years.  This is a really solid unemployment rate.  And      I think, again, come back to the policies.  We don't have a perfect      society, but how do we make it better?  We make it better by giving      people more choices:  choices in education, for example.  But I'd really      point out the wealth of America--one place you can see it is--anybody      that visits a toy store and sees the kind of toys that kids can get--or      anybody that visits a mall or a Wal-Mart and sees how far a dollar goes.      Americans are buying things that didn't exist 20 years ago--the computing      power, the iPods--and that's all levels of people.  We see dollars in the      hands of the lower. . .      GORDON:  Tim, let me. . .      Mr. KANE:  . . . classes, the middle class.  It's stronger than ever before.      GORDON:  Tim, let me ask you this, as relates to that kind of spending.      We're also seeing, at a record pace, Americans going into debt, and much      of these--many of these purchases happen by means of plastic.  We are      seeing Americans not being able, or choosing not to--perhaps this is our      ignorance--to save.  What does this mean in the long run?      Mr. KANE:  Yeah, good point.  There's always a concern about Americans,      you know, using their credit cards a little bit too heavily.  But      the--again, another fact.  Not only are there more Americans working than      ever before, there's a higher percentage of home ownership than ever      before.  So--now Americans have real wealth out there.  Unfortunately,      they're tapping some of that home ownership wealth probably a little bit      too much.      Ms. MALVEAUX:  In fact, I think--I'd say. . .      GORDON:  Julianne, let me take that to you.      Ms. MALVEAUX:  Yes, I'd say it's even more than that.  The fact is that      economic growth has partially been a function of people borrowing against      their home equity.  And when Tim, you know, rails off this list of      products--oh, how wonderful, oh, how wonderful--the fact is that the      American consumer is being barraged with credit card applications at the      same time the president wants to do bankruptcy--barraged with this notion      of buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.  And unless the housing market remains      strong, unless we continue to see the same kind of growth and property      values, we're cruising for a bruising, I think.      GORDON:  Tim, do you believe that that is a possibility?  And ofttimes we      hear from people who suggest that the White House and Washington does not      look that far down the line.      Mr. KANE:  You know, I think actually it's just human nature.  There are      basically two politically correct ways to look at the economy.  One is      we're in a recession and two is we're heading for a recession.  So I      actually take that politically incorrect view that we need to appreciate      how strong our economy is and recognize the things we're doing right.      There are always risk factors, absolutely.  But the Federal Reserve, Alan      Greenspan, they have studied that issue of are--is there a housing      bubble?  And they've come up with the conclusion that there's not.  Now      prices, again, may stagnate for a year or two.  We don't know what's      going to happen.  But I don't look for any sort of a collapse.  I don't      really believe there's a bubble out there.  In fact, I think we're poised      for even more strength in the future.      GORDON:  Julianne, take that notion of the idea that every boat will not      rise with the tide, and, you know, you gotta get with what you have to      get with--and that is reducing your personal debt, saving more, if you      wanna grow with the economy.      Ms. MALVEAUX:  Well, certainly people have to be personally responsible      for their own finances, and there's no argument there at all.  But I      think this notion of sugarcoating, you know, some of the economic      weaknesses that exist are--it's ridiculous.  I think that's what Tim's      done here when he's talked about the strength.  Certainly our economy is      larger, and certainly it has more strength than some of our Western      European counterparts, but at the same time there are major unevenness in      our economy.  Alan Greenspan is not the wizard.  He doesn't have all the      answers, and he's admitted that himself. He's raised questions about some      of the things that he hadn't questioned before--raised questions even      about the so-called Social Security reform.  And this notion of `choice,'      I mean, in the--under the guise of talking about the economy, Tim has      tried to sneak in here school choice and other kind of choice.  The fact      is that our social service structure is one that deserves to be repaired,      not torn down by this nonsensical notion of doing tax cuts.      GORDON:  Tim, let me ask you.  Let me put you on the other side, and I'll      do the same to Julianne.  If you were to point to one issue that you have      that you take issue with, with the economy--you see as the biggest      concern and/or problem, what would it be?      Mr. KANE:  Well, I think long-term I think we're gonna face a more and      more competitive world.  And we all see the growth of China.  I think      part of that is good news:  We see a very poor country getting wealthier.      But they've definitely put the pressure on our US education system.  Are      we going to educate the engineers of the future?  Are we going to include      all Americans and make sure everyone has basic literacy?  And that's      where I see the real danger--that we're leaving behind inner-city kids.      Our schools just aren't strong enough there, and I don't see the      willpower at the state level to really empower parents with choice there.      GORDON:  All right, Julianne Malveaux, take the other side.  What's the      most positive thing you see about this economy?      Ms. MALVEAUX:  This is gonna take a while.  Actually, Ed, I think that,      you know, the fact that we have been able to contain inflation for such a      long time is a great positive.  I think that it's made investors feel      more confident, and I think that consumers are more confident.  But in      the past six months we've seen more inflation than we've seen before, and      in seeing that increasing inflation it's made a lot of people feel      insecure.  You can talk about gas prices.  Gas prices are a much smaller      part of the index, of what's inflationary--or the CPI--than it was 10      years ago.  But those gas prices, when you're going to fill up your tank      or going to make a decision about how far out you're gonna drive on      vacation, those are gonna have an influence. And so this does affect the      economy.  We've seen a little more inflation than I think is healthy in      the last six months.      GORDON:  And, Julianne, you mentioned African-Americans and the      unemployment rate being above 10 percent.  With about a minute left, do      you believe that the whole of the African-American community in the      immediate future is going to be able to sustain itself and perhaps relish      some of what is seen in this--if you are to believe it--booming economy?      Ms. MALVEAUX:  I think just a slice of the African-American population      will be able to sustain itself.  Tim made a point when he talked about      weaknesses that I'd like to piggyback on, and that's the whole issue of      the quality of education in inner cities.  If we talk--and the notion of      who's gonna educate the engineers--if we. . .      Mr. KANE:  Look for them.      Ms. MALVEAUX:  . . . look to the next generation of African-Americans, we've      got to look to access to college, and the fact is that this president has      not kept his promises about education--about higher education,      especially.  So a slice of the African-American community, I think, will      continue to do well.  We're looking at about a third that will not.      Mr. KANE:  All right.  Julianne Malveaux is an economist and author of      \"Unfinished Business:  A Democrat and Republican Take on the most      Important Issues Women Face. \"  You can also hear her here from time to      time on our Point-Counterpoint segment.  And Tim Kane is Bradley Fellow      in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation and former senior economist      with the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress.      I thank you both for joining us.  Appreciate it.      Ms. MALVEAUX:  Thanks, Ed.      Mr. KANE:  Thanks so much.      GORDON:  Coming up, a bride on the run, and pregnant and crossing state      lines. That's coming up next on our roundtable.      (Soundbite of music)      GORDON:  This is NPR News.       ED GORDON, host:       From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.  I'm Ed Gordon.       President Bush has put overhauling Social Security at the top of his      priority list, and Congress has been busy itself--busying itself with a      number of hot-button issues from filibusters to bankruptcy, Terri Schiavo      to Tom DeLay. But according to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll,      it's the economy that's worrying the average American.  With gas prices      high, consumer confidence low and wages sluggish, 57 percent of Americans      disapprove of the president's handling of the economy.  That's the      highest spike in more than a year.       Joining us for a closer look at the numbers in our Washington, DC,      studios: Julianne Malveaux, economist and author of \"Unfinished Business:      A Democrat and Republican Take on the Most Important Issues Women Face,\"      and Tim Kane, Bradley Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation.      He's also a former senior economist with the Joint Economic Committee of      the US Congress, and he joins us from the nation's capital as well.       Thank you both for joining us.  Julianne, let me start with you.  We saw      the president and his news conference just days ago, mentioning some of      the issues in the economy.  Tell me a thumbnail sketch of you see the      economy right now.       Ms. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist; Author, \"Unfinished Business\"):  I      think the economy is sluggish.  We don't have the growth rates that we      thought we would; our first quarter was 3. 1 percent.  We haven't been      generating jobs in the way that we think we should.  Last month 110,000      jobs with--against a projection of about 300,000.  The gas prices being      up I think is a real negative, especially as we go into the summer      season.  A lot of families will be cutting back on what they're going to      be doing this summer.  And, of course, our travel and tourism industry is      likely to be cut because of that.       This is a sluggish economy, and, Ed, you're absolutely on point when you      talk about the fact that people are paying attention to it.  The fact      that while this is happening the Congress would spend this time on Terri      Schiavo--this man has not left Crawford, Texas, for real--rain nor snow      nor, you know, sleet, hail, you know, or Iraq.  But he comes back in his      PJs to keep a woman alive for another day or so.  It's really kind of      disgraceful.       What--this is an interesting week, though, and this is a good week to be      having this conversation because tomorrow, of course, the Fed will meet,      make a decision about interest rates, will be looking at inflation, and      at the end of the week we'll have the new employment numbers.  So a      perfect week to be focusing on the economy.       GORDON:  Tim Kane, I'm curious.  It seems to me that you don't hear a      huge cry, though, from the public about the economy right now.  We hear      about the gas prices and individual items and issues, but not the economy      as a whole. Why is that?       Mr. TIM KANE (The Heritage Foundation; Former Senior Economist, Joint      Economic Committee):  Well, I think Americans are very attuned to the      strength of their economy, both in historical terms--I mean, even though      we've only grown at 3. 1 percent at an annualized pace, that's still      growth.  And we also look across at the Atlantic and we Germany's growing      at 0. 7 percent.  Germany and France both have unemployment rates that are      double ours.  So, you know, America--I think a good metaphor is we're      like the Shaquille O'Neal of economies.  We're the biggest and we're      still growing.  So there's just not too much to complain about on the      macro level.  But you hit it.  It's things like gas prices.  It's those      day-to-day pocketbook issues that are really nagging to Americans.  But      the overall economy's absolutely healthy.       GORDON:  Julianne, what would. . .       Ms. MALVEAUX:  Tim, you know, it depends on who you are.  I mean, why are      you talking about the overall economy being healthy?  The fact is that      African-American people experience those same unemployment rates that      they're experiencing in Germany.  Our unemployment rate is 10. 4 percent.      In addition, if you look at the bottom--if you look at the very bottom,      Ed, what you're going to find is that people at the bottom have not seen      their wages grow at all.  So some people are doing very well in the      United States, and many are doing very poorly.  And these are the people      who've been sidelined by the Bush administration.       GORDON:  Tim, you wanna take up on that?       Mr. KANE:  Well, that's the--yeah, sure.  It's just--it's really an      unfortunate notion that wages are stagnant.  They may have been stagnant      for the last year, but take a look at the last five years or 10 years.      They've been growing at every level:  for African-Americans, for      Asian-Americans.  One thing we need to look at, though, is what are the      right policies for the future?  And this is where the president has said,      `Let's stimulate investment.  Let's lower taxes. '  Everybody can      appreciate a tax cut, and that's really given the economy a great boost.      As far as wage growth, absolutely not.  Everybody benefits when we have      an economy that's free of regulation.  France, Germany have way too much      regulation, way too many taxes. It's a failed policy.       GORDON:  Let me ask this.  When you. . .       Ms. MALVEAUX:  Tim, I was waiting for you to start beating on that.      It. . .       GORDON:  Let me ask this, Julianne, before you pick up on that.       Ms. MALVEAUX:  I just have to answer that, though.  OK.       GORDON:  Wait just one second and you can follow up on that.  But I'm      curious--for the layperson who hears the idea that wages are up, personal      income up--but how does that fare with things that impact that, like      consumer spending or consumer pricing?

So while the federal government may be taking less out of your      paycheck, states are taking more and they're providing fewer services.      Again, people on the bottom are really getting hit.       I knew that Tim, coming from The Heritage Foundation, wasn't going to      give us three minutes before he started pulling out that right-wing      claptrap about the president's policies.  The fact is that these policies      have not at all stimulated investment, and even had they, they have not      stimulated employment growth at the numbers that we see.  With 3. 1      percent increase in growth, why are we only generating 110,000 jobs in a      month?  That's ridiculous, Tim.  You can't reconcile those numbers.       Mr. KANE:  Well, I can reconcile the fact that we have an unemployment      rate of 5. 2 percent.  That's what economists call a natural rate.  It's      lower than the average of the '80s.  It's lower than the average of the      '90s, the Clinton years.  This is a really solid unemployment rate.  And      I think, again, come back to the policies.  We don't have a perfect      society, but how do we make it better?  We make it better by giving      people more choices:  choices in education, for example.  But I'd really      point out the wealth of America--one place you can see it is--anybody      that visits a toy store and sees the kind of toys that kids can get--or      anybody that visits a mall or a Wal-Mart and sees how far a dollar goes.

GORDON:  Tim, let me. . .       Mr. KANE:  . . . classes, the middle class.  It's stronger than ever before.       GORDON:  Tim, let me ask you this, as relates to that kind of spending.      We're also seeing, at a record pace, Americans going into debt, and much      of these--many of these purchases happen by means of plastic.  We are      seeing Americans not being able, or choosing not to--perhaps this is our      ignorance--to save.  What does this mean in the long run?       Mr. KANE:  Yeah, good point.  There's always a concern about Americans,      you know, using their credit cards a little bit too heavily.  But      the--again, another fact.  Not only are there more Americans working than      ever before, there's a higher percentage of home ownership than ever      before.  So--now Americans have real wealth out there.  Unfortunately,      they're tapping some of that home ownership wealth probably a little bit      too much.       Ms. MALVEAUX:  In fact, I think--I'd say. . .       GORDON:  Julianne, let me take that to you.       Ms. MALVEAUX:  Yes, I'd say it's even more than that.  The fact is that      economic growth has partially been a function of people borrowing against      their home equity.  And when Tim, you know, rails off this list of      products--oh, how wonderful, oh, how wonderful--the fact is that the      American consumer is being barraged with credit card applications at the      same time the president wants to do bankruptcy--barraged with this notion      of buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.  And unless the housing market remains      strong, unless we continue to see the same kind of growth and property      values, we're cruising for a bruising, I think.       GORDON:  Tim, do you believe that that is a possibility?  And ofttimes we      hear from people who suggest that the White House and Washington does not      look that far down the line.       Mr. KANE:  You know, I think actually it's just human nature.  There are      basically two politically correct ways to look at the economy.  One is      we're in a recession and two is we're heading for a recession.  So I      actually take that politically incorrect view that we need to appreciate      how strong our economy is and recognize the things we're doing right.      There are always risk factors, absolutely.  But the Federal Reserve, Alan      Greenspan, they have studied that issue of are--is there a housing      bubble?  And they've come up with the conclusion that there's not.  Now      prices, again, may stagnate for a year or two.  We don't know what's      going to happen.  But I don't look for any sort of a collapse.  I don't      really believe there's a bubble out there.  In fact, I think we're poised      for even more strength in the future.       GORDON:  Julianne, take that notion of the idea that every boat will not      rise with the tide, and, you know, you gotta get with what you have to      get with--and that is reducing your personal debt, saving more, if you      wanna grow with the economy.       Ms. MALVEAUX:  Well, certainly people have to be personally responsible      for their own finances, and there's no argument there at all.

The fact      is that our social service structure is one that deserves to be repaired,      not torn down by this nonsensical notion of doing tax cuts.       GORDON:  Tim, let me ask you.  Let me put you on the other side, and I'll      do the same to Julianne.  If you were to point to one issue that you have      that you take issue with, with the economy--you see as the biggest      concern and/or problem, what would it be?       Mr. KANE:  Well, I think long-term I think we're gonna face a more and      more competitive world.  And we all see the growth of China.  I think      part of that is good news:  We see a very poor country getting wealthier.      But they've definitely put the pressure on our US education system.

And that's      where I see the real danger--that we're leaving behind inner-city kids.      Our schools just aren't strong enough there, and I don't see the      willpower at the state level to really empower parents with choice there.       GORDON:  All right, Julianne Malveaux, take the other side.  What's the      most positive thing you see about this economy?       Ms. MALVEAUX:  This is gonna take a while.  Actually, Ed, I think that,      you know, the fact that we have been able to contain inflation for such a      long time is a great positive.  I think that it's made investors feel      more confident, and I think that consumers are more confident.  But in      the past six months we've seen more inflation than we've seen before, and      in seeing that increasing inflation it's made a lot of people feel      insecure.  You can talk about gas prices.  Gas prices are a much smaller      part of the index, of what's inflationary--or the CPI--than it was 10      years ago.  But those gas prices, when you're going to fill up your tank      or going to make a decision about how far out you're gonna drive on      vacation, those are gonna have an influence. And so this does affect the      economy.  We've seen a little more inflation than I think is healthy in      the last six months.       GORDON:  And, Julianne, you mentioned African-Americans and the      unemployment rate being above 10 percent.  With about a minute left, do      you believe that the whole of the African-American community in the      immediate future is going to be able to sustain itself and perhaps relish      some of what is seen in this--if you are to believe it--booming economy?       Ms. MALVEAUX:  I think just a slice of the African-American population      will be able to sustain itself.  Tim made a point when he talked about      weaknesses that I'd like to piggyback on, and that's the whole issue of      the quality of education in inner cities.  If we talk--and the notion of      who's gonna educate the engineers--if we. . .       Mr. KANE:  Look for them.       Ms. MALVEAUX:  . . . look to the next generation of African-Americans, we've      got to look to access to college, and the fact is that this president has      not kept his promises about education--about higher education,      especially.  So a slice of the African-American community, I think, will      continue to do well.  We're looking at about a third that will not.       Mr. KANE:  All right.  Julianne Malveaux is an economist and author of      \"Unfinished Business:  A Democrat and Republican Take on the most      Important Issues Women Face. \"  You can also hear her here from time to      time on our Point-Counterpoint segment.  And Tim Kane is Bradley Fellow      in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation and former senior economist      with the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress.       I thank you both for joining us.  Appreciate it.       Ms. MALVEAUX:  Thanks, Ed.       Mr. KANE:  Thanks so much.

There's been negative news.  The stock market is volatile.  Energy prices      are high. In the positive, real estate prices continue to soar.      Unemployment is still pretty low.  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan      Greenspan meets with his colleagues today to try to sort this out and      decide whether to raise interest rates again.  In a moment, we'll talk to      The Wall Street Journal's David Wessel. First, what four people are      saying about what's behind all this economic news in their communities.      Ms. ROBIN BARRETT(ph) (Business Owner):  For every day business people,      you know, you're more concerned about what's going on in your world.  So      I guess I'm more concerned with reading my local business section and      knowing what's going on there.      MONTAGNE:  Robin Barrett lives in Phoenix, Arizona.  She's 41 and runs a      company she founded, loaning money to small businesses.  She describes      the economy in her backyard as thriving.      Ms. BARRETT:  It just happens to be that my office is attached to one of      the biggest shopping centers in Arizona.  And I'll tell you what.  That      mall is never not busy, and there's a lot of people buying things there.      I mean, it's constantly busy.  It amazes me that these people have this      much money to spend, and this much time to spend at these malls.      Mr. VICTOR PERRY(ph) (Retired):  The economy is good.  It's--I wouldn't      say exceptionally strong, but it's good.      MONTAGNE:  That's Victor Perry.  He's 73 years old and lives with his      wife, Nell(ph), in Deridder, Louisiana.  Victor Perry is retired, though      he still works from time to time at his old timber job.      Mr. PERRY:  This is timber country--plywood plants, sawmills, paper      mills--and there's a good demand for timber right now, so everyone's      working. There's oil and gas activity.  There's some road construction      going on, which is really needed.  We see a lot of new-home construction      just in the 75-mile radius of us.  People can live in the country and      drive into the towns to work.      MONTAGNE:  The last community we take you to is Portland, Oregon.  There,      Brian(ph) and Chris Higgins(ph) live with their eight-month-old daughter.      He's an architect; she's a civil engineer.  The thirty-somethings say      business in the construction industry there has been slow the last two      years. But this couple is thinking most about having enough money set      aside for the future.      Mr. BRIAN HIGGINS (Architect):  We've already set up a college fund and      we're just going to try really hard to contribute to that every month.      Mrs. CHRIS HIGGINS (Civil Engineer):  Honestly, I try not to worry on a      daily basis about what the stock market is doing because I know, you      know, it goes up and down.  I just hope when we retire it's up.      MONTAGNE:  So that's how the economy looks to some Americans in different      parts of the country.  For more, Steve Inskeep spoke with David Wessel,      who is Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal.      STEVE INSKEEP (Host):  So when you turn those impressions of Americans      into statistics, what's the impression that Alan Greenspan likely has of      the economy right now?      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street Journal):  I      think he has a similar impression to a number of those people.  Consumer      spending has been strong, although there's some signs that retailing is      getting a little soft.  There's a huge boom in the housing market which      accounts for the timber increase that the gentleman from Louisiana      mentioned.  And, of course, the stock market has been like a roller      coaster lately, up and down, and that's got people a little bit anxious.      Basically, the economy is showing some signs of slowing down, not a      recession. But last week's report on economic growth in the first quarter      found a 3. 1 percent annual rate.  That was less than we've seen in      previous quarters and a little disappointing.      INSKEEP:  In some recent public statements Alan Greenspan has expressed      concern about the direction of the economy.      Mr. WESSEL:  Yes.  Being the chairman of the Fed is a little bit like      steering an ocean liner, and you can't control the wind or the waves.      You can't even control the engine.  And basically, what you do is you      hold the steering wheel and you want to avoid hitting icebergs.      Now in the last few years, there hasn't been any inflation iceberg on the      horizon.  But now there is, and so the Fed is trying to steer away from      inflation and that's why it's raising interest rates now.  And Mr.      Greenspan is trying to convey in his public statements that that is, at      the moment, his number-one worry.      INSKEEP:  Two obvious sources of inflation that Americans are familiar      with on a daily basis, one is high gas prices, another one--we heard from      one of our people there in Louisiana--a strong housing market; very high      home prices.      Mr. WESSEL:  That's right.  Energy prices are definitely up.  So far, the      pace of overall price increases in the economy hasn't been infected by      high oil prices, but there are signs that that's beginning to happen.  I      mean, last week in The Journal we reported that prices of Folgers coffee,      Charmin's toilet paper, Kellogg's Rice Krispies and Kellogg's Pop Tarts      all were up enough to give more profits to the companies that make them.      Mr. Greenspan sees that and he doesn't want inflation to get out of hand,      and he knows that that's a risk at a time when the economy is operating a      little closer to full capacity than it has been.  And we see all these      energy prices which, of course, feed into the prices of other things.      INSKEEP:  So we see the Fed a little more willing to raise interest rates      and all--in order to hold down the price of Pop Tarts?      Mr. WESSEL:  Absolutely.  Mr. Greenspan wants to make sure that your kids      can buy Pop Tarts at the same price that you can if he can do anything      about it. He wants to avoid price gouging by the Kellogg folks.      INSKEEP:  If you're the Fed chairman, would you be willing to risk a      recession in order to avoid too much inflation?      Mr. WESSEL:  Fortunately, I'm not the Fed chairman.  I don't think that      Mr. Greenspan thinks there's a great risk of recession.  What he says is      `What is the bigger danger right now?  That we have interest rates too      low and we get inflation, or we have interest rates too high and we get a      recession? '  And when he looks at that calculus, he sees inflation as a      bigger worry and he's willing to settle for slightly slower growth as a      consequence.      INSKEEP:  Is there a comparison between this period and, say, the late      1980s, sluggish growth for an extended period of time?      Mr. WESSEL:  There are often comparisons made to the 1970s when we had      what was called `stagflation,' the twin evils of slow growth and high      inflation. But really the conditions are quite different.  We do have an      increase in energy prices, but the US economy seems to be much less      dependent on energy, especially imported oil, than it was back then.  And      also, the Fed and other central banks around the world are determined not      to let inflation get out of control, and people seem to accept that.      INSKEEP:  The Fed chairman made some of his most dire recent statements      about the federal budget deficit.  Do the people we just heard from in      different parts of the country need to worry about the federal budget      deficit?      Mr. WESSEL:  Yes.  Mr. Greenspan is now returning to those old warnings;      that the prospect for very big spending increases as the baby boom      retires are very great, and taxes aren't sufficient to cover those.  So      we need to do something, either raise taxes or restrain spending or both.      INSKEEP:  Greenspan himself is not long for the job after having been      there as long as many people can remember.  He'll be replaced in January.      Does that matter?      Mr. WESSEL:  I think it does matter.  Mr. Greenspan is 79 years old.      He's finishing his 18th year at the Fed.  He has a remarkable record.  In      18 years we've had only two recessions and inflation is lower now than      it's been in a generation.  And I doubt he wants his legacy to be he was      the guy who got inflation into the bottle and then let the cork out just      as he was retiring.

I'm Melissa Block.      ROBERT SIEGEL, host:      And I'm Robert Siegel.      It was a unanimous vote at the Federal Reserve today.  The Fed agreed to      raise short-term interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point;      that is the eighth quarter-point move in the past 10 months.  The      nation's central bank is trying to keep inflation in check, even as there      are signs that the economy is cooling off.  NPR's Jack Speer reports.      JACK SPEER reporting:      Today's move by the Federal Reserve takes the closely watched federal      funds rate up to 3 percent; that's up 2 full percentage points from      historic lows. Stuart Hoffman is chief economist at PNC Financial      Services Group and also a former Federal Reserve Board economist.  He      says based on what Alan Greenspan and other Fed board members said today,      there are probably more interest rate hikes to come.      Mr. STUART HOFFMAN (Chief Economist, PNC Financial Services Group):  In      terms of what the Fed said is they said that they still thought policy      was accommodative, which is their way of saying they still think interest      rates are probably a bit lower than they should be.  But they did      include, again, that any increases in interest rates in the future would      be at a, quote, \"measured pace,\" and that's the Fed's sort of code for      saying, `We're going to raise rates again--more than likely--in June, but      we're still not going to deviate from these quarter-of-a-percent      increases at any one time. '      SPEER:  Shortly after today's announcement, Wells Fargo, National City      and a number of other banks immediately boosted their prime lending      rates.  That's the rate banks charge their best customers to borrow.      Greg McBride is with Bankrate. com.  He says increases in the prime rate      ripple through the economy quickly.      Mr. GREG McBRIDE (Bankrate. com):  Credit cards and home equity lines of      credit are often pegged to the prime rate, and the prime rate has moved      from 4 percent last summer to now 6 percent with the latest interest rate      hike.      SPEER:  In a statement, the Fed acknowledged the US economy has cooled.      It said higher energy prices are starting to weigh on the economy, and as      a result, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months, though      the Fed said longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.      But PNC economist Stuart Hoffman says the Fed still must strike a      delicate balance.      Mr. HOFFMAN:  I think what the Fed is saying is they worry about growth      being too slow, and at the same time, they worry about inflation being      too fast. And if they have to sort of choose between the two of them      right now, they're still a bit more worried that inflation doesn't become      a bigger problem.      SPEER:  Today's Fed move will raise borrowing costs for many consumers,      though one area seems to be so far largely immune to the string of      interest rate hikes.  Mortgage rates actually came down a bit last week      and remain near their historic lows.  Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.

But they did      include, again, that any increases in interest rates in the future would      be at a, quote, \"measured pace,\" and that's the Fed's sort of code for      saying, `We're going to raise rates again--more than likely--in June, but      we're still not going to deviate from these quarter-of-a-percent      increases at any one time. '       SPEER:  Shortly after today's announcement, Wells Fargo, National City      and a number of other banks immediately boosted their prime lending      rates.  That's the rate banks charge their best customers to borrow.      Greg McBride is with Bankrate. com.  He says increases in the prime rate      ripple through the economy quickly.       Mr. GREG McBRIDE (Bankrate. com):  Credit cards and home equity lines of      credit are often pegged to the prime rate, and the prime rate has moved      from 4 percent last summer to now 6 percent with the latest interest rate      hike.       SPEER:  In a statement, the Fed acknowledged the US economy has cooled.      It said higher energy prices are starting to weigh on the economy, and as      a result, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months, though      the Fed said longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.      But PNC economist Stuart Hoffman says the Fed still must strike a      delicate balance.       Mr. HOFFMAN:  I think what the Fed is saying is they worry about growth      being too slow, and at the same time, they worry about inflation being      too fast. And if they have to sort of choose between the two of them      right now, they're still a bit more worried that inflation doesn't become      a bigger problem.       SPEER:  Today's Fed move will raise borrowing costs for many consumers,      though one area seems to be so far largely immune to the string of      interest rate hikes.  Mortgage rates actually came down a bit last week      and remain near their historic lows.  Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington. ", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2005 NPR.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      I used to drive junkers.  Now General Motors and Ford are junk.  That's      the bond rating firm Standard & Poor's judgment about the automakers'      bonds yesterday, downgrading them to junk status.  GM did report its      biggest quarterly loss in 13 years last month.  Ford says it's not going      to do so well this year.  There are reasons for this financial slump that      have to do with the general overall manufacturing climate and the history      of these companies, but there's also the question of:  Can they still      make cars that Americans want?  Joining us is Dan Neil, the Pulitzer      Prize-winning automotive writer for the Los Angeles Times.      Dan, Ford and GM--what's gone wrong here?      Mr. DAN NEIL (Automotive Columnist, Los Angeles Times):  Well, the short      answer is that in North America--their biggest market--the world's      biggest car market--their profitability has relied for almost a decade on      big and midsized SUVs.  Suddenly, with the face of gas prices, consumers      are walking away from SUVs.  Sales of big SUVs are down double digits      across the board.  And so this market turned out to be pretty fragile,      and it's not clear that General Motors and Ford were well-positioned to      respond.      CHADWICK:  You look at the overall automotive market.  You see that      Japanese automakers like Toyota are doing well, selling a variety of      range of vehicles. You see someone like the Koreans, like Hyundai, making      cars now that get better satisfaction ratings than even German cars, so      somebody's doing all right.      Mr. NEIL:  Yeah, this is a very dynamic industry, and the people that are      down today are going to be up tomorrow.  That's one reason that I think      people should be cautious about writing General Motors' obituary.      There's--this is a company that has tremendous capital--intellectual and      financial.  But that doesn't mean that, you know, it's immortal.  It can      be run into the ground. But, sure, the Koreans have done quite well in      the past two or three years by focusing on quality and product--and, by      the way, the Chinese are coming over the hill 38th-parallel style, so      look for that in the next five years as well.      CHADWICK:  What should American carmakers be doing?  I mean, what is the      answer for them?  Build better cars?      Mr. NEIL:  That's a huge part of it.  They've got to build better cars.      They've got to build cars that people want.  You know, a lot of this      business is expressive and emotional, so there's a phrase, `gotta-have      product. '  They need to build gotta-have product.      CHADWICK:  Well, that's it.  I mean, what is coming that people are going      to open up their newspapers and the car magazines, say, `I gotta have      that one! '?      Mr. NEIL:  Well, next week Chrysler is introducing the Dodge Charger,      which is a four-door riff on its 300C sedan platform, and it looks very,      very cool. This summer, General Motors will be introducing something      called the HHR, the Heritage High Roof.  This will really tell the tale,      I think.  This is a kind of a nostalgia-themed, crossover family      wagon--small.  If this is a hit--they have to sell about 60,000 of these.      If it comes anywhere near that, that will be a very good sign.  But I      don't know if it'll sell.      CHADWICK:  All right.  Well, we're going on to a story about one person      who is buying GM these days.  Dan Neil writes the Rumble Seat column for      the LA Times.      Dan, thank you.      Mr. NEIL:  Thank you.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Maybe the boss is smiling a little more these days.  Maybe the boss is a      little more confident about the economy.  The Labor Department reports      that employers created a surprisingly large number of jobs last month:      274,000. That's very good.  Joining us now is \"Marketplace\" New York      bureau chief Bob Moon.      Bob, was this--well, it was much better news that the economists were      expecting.      BOB MOON reporting:      Indeed it was.  The consensus of Wall Street economists was for somewhere      around 170,000 new jobs, but employers ramped up their hiring by more      than 100,000 beyond that.  At the same time the Labor Department revised      its numbers for each of the two prior months, and it now estimates      employers added more workers than first thought in February and March as      well.  This news was received well on Wall Street because it eases fears      that the economy might be losing steam.  What these numbers suggest is      that the economy is gaining traction and that the rough patch that so      many economists have been talking about lately will be just that--a      temporary patch.  These numbers, by the way, were enough to hold the      country's jobless rate steady at 5. 2 percent, unchanged from the rate in      March.      CHADWICK:  So what part of the economy saw the most new jobs last month?      MOON:  Well, actually, these payroll gains were widespread pretty much      across the board.  There were more jobs added in the retail sector, by      health-care providers, by construction companies and by financial      services.  The one gray cloud with this silver lining comes again from      the manufacturing industry, which lost jobs for the second straight      month.  And there was another sign of a growing economy.  Average hourly      earnings in the private sector rose by about a nickel last month to a      record $16 for the month.  And not only were employers adding more jobs,      they were adding more hours.  The average workweek grew fractionally to      almost 34 hours.  That's a signal that even more hiring might be in store      in the months ahead.      CHADWICK:  More hiring.  How about interest rates?  Is this going to      affect interest rates?  We saw a boost this month.  What about next      month?      MOON:  Well, the Fed has been very sensitive to keeping inflation from      overheating.  This certainly doesn't suggest that the economy is in      danger of stalling or stagnating.  Of course, the Fed, as you mentioned,      just boosted interest rates again earlier this week by a quarter percent      to 3 percent. Economists are telling us today that this news is likely to      keep the Fed on its so-called measured course of pushing interest rates      gradually higher throughout much of the remainder of the year.  As one      economist said today, it shows that the economy has a lot of underlying      strength.      And today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we'll be looking further into      the way the employment picture is developing.  Alex.      CHADWICK:  Thanks, Bob.

Both automakers have ample cash reserves, so the builders of the      legendary Corvair and Edsel will keep turning out Impalas and Mustangs.      But the road ahead is pitted with potholes.  Sales are worse than      sluggish, costs are rising, especially for health care and pensions, and      with gasoline prices well over $2 a gallon, consumers are not expected to      be lining up any time soon to buy profit-making SUVs.  Gerald Meyers is      adjunct professor of organizational behavior at the University of      Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor.  He worked in the auto industry      for decades and served as chairman and CEO of American Motors      Corporation, or AMC, from 1977 to 1982.      Welcome to the show, Professor Meyers.      Professor GERALD MEYERS (University of Michigan Business School):  Oh,      hi, Liane.  Nice to be back.      HANSEN:  Good to have you.  Are General Motors and Ford facing identical      or even similar problems here?      Prof. MEYERS:  They're very similar.  All the forces that are working on      one are working on the other, and neither one of them are out of cash,      but they are suffering on the bottom line.  They've got vehicles that      aren't selling very well.  The top end of the sport utility market is      dwindling.  And they've got the health-care problem.  The onslaught of      the Asian brands are coming up at them and the rigidity of the labor      contracts.  Ordinarily, each auto company, and sometimes other      industries, gets in trouble one at a time.  But the unusual thing that's      going on here is that both Ford and GM are in trouble--in deep trouble,      and there doesn't seem to be a way out, at least not a fast way out.      There's no silver bullet available.      HANSEN:  Could you see a time in the future when there might not be a      General Motors or a Ford Motor Company?      Prof. MEYERS:  Oh, not in our lifetime, not anytime soon.  They're both      huge corporations, and big companies don't die quickly.  I don't see      these companies dying at all, but I do see them going through a very      rough period and probably ending up being smaller and different kind of      companies than we're accustomed to.      HANSEN:  What about mergers?  I mean, there's been considerable      consolidation in the industry in recent years.  Have the mergers helped      or hurt?      Prof. MEYERS:  Well, I think what mergers there were have helped because      it reduces the capacity of the industry, and that's important.  There's      just too much capacity in the auto industry.  I think the numbers are      truly astounding that there may be something like 70 million units of      capacity in the world industry and we're only selling about 50 or 60.  So      you can see what the problem is.      HANSEN:  Now the marketplace is pretty volatile.  Gas prices are going      up, the sales of the SUVs going down.  Demand for hybrid cars is going      up.  Do you think the big automakers actually have that kind of internal,      cultural agility to respond to these kinds of market trends?      Prof. MEYERS:  Not in the usual sense.  When you say agility, you think      of, well, could they respond overnight or could they respond in a matter      of months?  And the answer to that is just a clear no.  This is a      high-tech industry, but it doesn't have the attribute of being high-tech      fast on its feet.  The need to tool and the need to change production      facilities is something that you have to bear in mind when you're in the      business.  It takes probably six months to nine months to change the mix      considerably in what you're producing, and it takes a year or two or      three to change what products you're producing as it will take maybe five      years, believe it or not, to actually come up with a new vehicle from      scratch and get it tooled.      HANSEN:  So what's your vision of the future of the automobile business      here in the United States and around the world?      Prof. MEYERS:  Even more fragmented.  I think the United States will look      much like Europe in about four or five years from an automobile point of      view.  No auto company in Europe has more than 15 percent of the market.      There are more producers than we have here in the United States, and they      struggle on pricing and they struggle on getting their production mix      right.  And I think that's what the United States will probably look like      here in five, 10 years.  And, of course, in saying that, I'm saying that      GM and Ford will be smaller companies and that other makers, particularly      the transplants of the Asians, will become more and more of a force.      HANSEN:  Gerald Meyers was chairman of American Motors Corporation, or      AMC. He is now adjunct professor of organizational behavior at the      University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor.  I thank you so much      for your time.      Prof. MEYERS:  Thank you, Liane.

Demand for hybrid cars is going      up.  Do you think the big automakers actually have that kind of internal,      cultural agility to respond to these kinds of market trends?       Prof. MEYERS:  Not in the usual sense.  When you say agility, you think      of, well, could they respond overnight or could they respond in a matter      of months?  And the answer to that is just a clear no.  This is a      high-tech industry, but it doesn't have the attribute of being high-tech      fast on its feet.  The need to tool and the need to change production      facilities is something that you have to bear in mind when you're in the      business.  It takes probably six months to nine months to change the mix      considerably in what you're producing, and it takes a year or two or      three to change what products you're producing as it will take maybe five      years, believe it or not, to actually come up with a new vehicle from      scratch and get it tooled.       HANSEN:  So what's your vision of the future of the automobile business      here in the United States and around the world?       Prof. MEYERS:  Even more fragmented.  I think the United States will look      much like Europe in about four or five years from an automobile point of      view.  No auto company in Europe has more than 15 percent of the market.      There are more producers than we have here in the United States, and they      struggle on pricing and they struggle on getting their production mix      right.  And I think that's what the United States will probably look like      here in five, 10 years.  And, of course, in saying that, I'm saying that      GM and Ford will be smaller companies and that other makers, particularly      the transplants of the Asians, will become more and more of a force.       HANSEN:  Gerald Meyers was chairman of American Motors Corporation, or      AMC. He is now adjunct professor of organizational behavior at the      University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor.  I thank you so much      for your time.       Prof. MEYERS:  Thank you, Liane.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      A pleasant surprise in business news today.  The government reports the      US trade gap fell by more than 9 percent in March.  That's the sharpest      decline in three years.  We're joined now by Bob Moon, New York bureau      chief for MARKETPLACE.      Bob, didn't we get word just a month ago that imports hit a record high      in February?  This is quite a dramatic shift, isn't it?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  It is, indeed, and the question then becomes:      Is this temporary or something more?  That very quickly became the      subject for debate among the experts who watch the trade deficit, and it      does come on the heels of a record high for US imports just a month      before.  Now we have US exports climbing to an all-time high, and there      are some skeptical economists who see this as temporary.  The say the      demand for goods here at home remains more robust than economic growth      around the world.  And they also point out that the overall trade deficit      is so huge that it will be extremely difficult to close the gap on a      consistent basis.      CHADWICK:  But it looks as though the gap is shrinking or at least it is      for a month.  That's got to be somewhat encouraging, wouldn't you think?      MOON:  Well, there's a little good news and a little bad news in these      numbers.  What should we do first, the good news or the bad news?  The      good news is while just a month before the deficit was a record $60      billion, the gap between what the US imports and what it sells to foreign      countries narrowed to around 55 billion in March.  Now that reflects a 1      1/2 percent increase in US exports, and that covered a wide range of      goods from commercial aircraft and telecommunications equipment to farm      products and even works of art.  The bad news--even with this big      improvement in March, the deficit throughout just the first three months      of this year is still running at an annual rate of 696 billion, and that      is 12 percent-plus higher than the 617 billion record that was set for      all of 2004.      CHADWICK:  A lot of people on Capitol Hill blame China for this.  I      wonder if these new numbers are going to make them feel a little bit      better about China.      MOON:  It's not likely.  The deficit with China did decline by 7 percent      to about $7. 83 billion.  That narrowing gap reflects in part a 21 percent      drop in imports of clothing and textiles in March, but overall, the      imbalance does continue.  Imports of these Chinese products are still      running at 54 percent higher in the first three months of this year when      compared to the same period a year ago, and that reflects a surge that      occurred after global import quotas were lifted back on January 1st.  So      this problem isn't likely to go away anytime soon.      And today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're looking at some of the      unexpected criticisms of a proposed free-trade agreement with Central      America.      CHADWICK:  Thank you, Bob.

US consumers spent more money last month than economists thought      they would.  Retail sales rose 1. 4 percent.  At the same time, though,      the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart reported quarterly profits that      were slightly less than Wall Street analysts had predicted.  NPR's Wendy      Kaufman reports.      WENDY KAUFMAN reporting:      Retail sales had their strongest showing in seven months and the 1. 4      percent rise was double what many experts were predicting.  Christopher      Low, chief economist at FTN Financial, suggests the number is      particularly impressive because many economists thought that the high      cost of gasoline would put a damper on other retail sales.      Mr. CHRISTOPHER LOW (FTN Financial):  As it turns out consumer spending,      even excluding gasoline, was up a full percentage point.  Now to put that      into perspective, consumer spending is the lifeblood of the economy.      It's basically what drives economic growth.  Three to 4 percent economic      growth in a year is considered strong.      KAUFMAN:  Some economists caution, however, that the April figures may be      artificially high because of the way the government adjusted its data to      account for the early Easter holiday.  In any case, 11 of the 13 retail      industries tracked by the government showed sales gains last month.      High-end specialty retailers continued to do well and yesterday Target      Corporation posted a 26 percent jump in quarterly profits.  But      Wal-Mart's earnings fell short of analysts' expectations.  Retail      industry analyst Jeffrey Klinefelter of Piper Jaffray says there's a      striking disparity on how well various retailers are doing.      Mr. JEFFREY KLEINFELTER (Piper Jaffray):  Clearly there is a have and      have-not situation out there with consumers.  The higher end demographic,      higher average income or household income, clearly outperforming the      lower income at this point.      KAUFMAN:  He says it's not just that higher income consumers have more      money to spend, it's also that higher income shoppers are buying things      such as apparel that carry relatively high profit margins.

I'm Alex      Chadwick.      Coming up, a first year fully legal marriage for a lesbian couple in      Massachusetts.  First, the lead.  Married or not, many workers are now      worrying about their retirement.  Last week, United Airlines defaulted on      pensions for 120,000 workers and there are other companies with pension      plans in trouble.  Many workers are worrying and wondering if they could      be next. DAY TO DAY's Madeleine Brand reports.      MADELEINE BRAND reporting:      United isn't the first company to default on its pensions.  Over the last      five years, nearly 800 pension plans have gone bust.  When the LTV Steel      Mining Company in Minnesota went bankrupt several years, its workers      received a nasty surprise.  Jerry Falis(ph) worked at LTV for 35 years.      Mr. JERRY FALIS:  Well, you know, it was a shock basically because it      came without any warning at all.  You know, we were always led to believe      that once we retired, we'd have good pensions and good health care for      the rest of our lives, and that's one of the things that we negotiated.      I was part of the negotiating team.  So we actually, you know, waived a      lot of raises just to keep good health care and good pensions.      BRAND:  Falis was 55 years old.  He thought he'd be able to retire on      $2,600 a month.  When the company defaulted, the federal government      stepped in with about half that.      Mr. FALIS:  A lot of people have told me, `You know, well, that happened      three years ago.  You know, forget about it. '  Well, in three years, I've      lost over $36,000 just in pension money.  Now if I live another 20 years,      it's going to be a quarter of a million dollars that I should have gotten      and I didn't.      BRAND:  He also has advice to workers worried that they'll face the same      problems.      Mr. FALIS:  People nowadays are going to have to, you know, have another      game plan so--you know, have money set aside just in the case of      something like this happening.      BRAND:  And here's another piece of advice from Boston University finance      Professor Zvi Bodie.  If possible, try to get your pension out now.      Professor ZVI BODIE (Boston University):  So the first thing I would      advise people do is find out if they do have the option of taking a lump      sum settlement.  And if they do, you know, then invest that lump sum on      your own if you're concerned that your company is going to go broke.      BRAND:  So you should take the money and run basically.      Prof. BODIE:  Basically.      BRAND:  But the catch is you'd have to take a steep loss.  The other      problem, he says, is that few people have the skill and knowledge      required to create a secure retirement income.      Prof. BODIE:  Where they have to decide how much to save on their own,      how to invest it, and the current state of affairs is that you are pretty      much on your own.      BRAND:  The reason companies are getting rid of these old-fashioned      pension plans, Bodie says, is that they are too expensive in today's      dog-eat-dog business world.  Low interest rates mean the employer has to      sock away more now to provide future benefits.      Prof. BODIE:  And on top of that, many pension plans were heavily      invested in the stock market but alas stocks are risky.      BRAND:  And so employers are trying to minimize their risk by offering      401(k) plans instead, says Sanford Jacoby, professor of management at      UCLA.      Professor SANFORD JACOBY (UCLA):  Now what employers are trying to do is      shift this risk increasingly on to the shoulders of employees.  The same      thing is happening with health insurance and other employee benefit      programs that are provided by employers who in today's competitive      environment companies are much more reluctant to shoulder risk for      employees than they were, say, 30 years ago.      BRAND:  That hot potato is also being tossed to the federal government      which underwrites traditional pensions.  The money comes from premiums      companies pay into the federal fund.  So when a company goes bankrupt and      defaults on its pensions, this fund provides a maximum of around $45,000      a year to a retiree, but with all the defaults, the government program is      itself in trouble and may not be able to pay out to all the workers in      need, says Boston University finance Professor Zvi Bodie.      Prof. BODIE:  My guess is the handwriting is on the wall, and in another      couple of years, there'll be very few defined benefit plans still active.      BRAND:  And if you think all this is pretty bad news, consider another      looming problem.  Not only are companies canceling their pension plans,      they are also curtailing their health insurance plans.  Remember      steelworker Jerry Falis who had to retire on half of what he expected?      Well, the kicker, says Falis, is that his company also dropped its      health-care plan.      Mr. FALIS:  We were to get retirement health care until--for the rest of      our lives.  You know, we would pay a small monthly supplement, but once      we lost our health care, those premiums are about $900 a month for a      family plan.      BRAND:  And so at age 58, Falis now has another full-time job.      Madeleine Brand, NPR News.       ALEX CHADWICK, host:       From NPR West and Slate magazine online, this is DAY TO DAY.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Come next year, the new boss at the Federal Reserve may be the same as      the old boss.  There's a report today that Alan Greenspan might be      staying on the job awhile longer.  And joining us with more now is Bob      Moon, the New York bureau chief for \"Marketplace. \"      And, Bob, hasn't Greenspan been talking about leaving the Fed when his      term is up early next year?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Indeed, Madeleine, he has.  Just last weekend,      as a matter of fact, he told graduates at the University of      Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business that he had something in common      with them, that he'd be looking for a job, too, after his term comes to      an end at the Fed.  That term is set to expire next January 31st.  Well,      today, The Washington Post is reporting that the Bush administration is      considering whether to ask Greenspan to stay on at least a few months      past that.  Just a few extra months on the job would give Greenspan--who      is now 79 years old, by the way--the longest tenure ever for a Fed chief,      exceeding roughly 18 years and 10 months.      But that's not why the White House is considering this.  The newspaper is      reporting an extension would give the White House more time to look      beyond the academic and policy worlds and follow the urging of some      financial analysts to find a successor with experience in the corporate      world.      BRAND:  And so what kind of qualifications would the White House be      looking for?      MOON:  So far the names that have been mentioned in the media as being on      a list of likely successors have all been prominent academic economists.      But as I mentioned, analysts have pointed out that those candidates have      had little or no business background, and they're suggesting that one of      the keys to Greenspan's success over the past 18 years has been the fact      that he worked for decades as a business consultant, which they say gave      him the intuitive background to break with economic convention, if you      will, and anticipate how the economy evolves in the real world.  So these      analysts are hoping that the White House will go beyond economists who      could get beyond economic theory and use some real-world experience      instead.      BRAND:  And, Bob, what are the drawbacks in delaying the appointment of a      new Federal Reserve chief?      MOON:  Well, there are some drawbacks.  Some economic experts point out      that the financial markets have really come to see Greenspan as something      of an oracle on the economy, and they say the White House could end up      sending a signal that Greenspan is just irreplaceable and that without      him things might fall apart.      There are also some political implications here.  Greenspan has been a      supporter of some of the Bush administration's programs, including, you      might recall, tax cuts and private Social Security accounts.  And some      Fed watchers say keeping him on could create an appearance that Greenspan      is being rewarded by the White House.      Irrespective of that, the Bush administration doesn't seem to be in any      hurry to name a replacement.  A few weeks ago, Bush's deputy chief of      staff, Karl Rove, told Bloomberg News that announcing a nominee this year      would be premature.

Stock prices are rising thanks to a leveling off of other prices      including oil.  Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 130      points as NPR's Scott Horsley reports.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      The Dow has jumped more than 300 points in the first three days this      week, closing yesterday above 10,464.  Yesterday's rally came after an      encouraging report that showed inflation in check.  The Labor Department      found no increase in core prices during the month of April.  That core      measure of inflation does not include volatile food and energy prices,      which jumped by half a percentage point last month, but so far this      month, energy prices are falling.  Oil prices dropped to a three-month      low yesterday of $47. 25 a barrel.  A weekly report from the Energy      Department says stockpiles of oil are bulging at near a six-year high.      Analyst Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading in Chicago says that cushion, plus a      healthy flow of imported oil, have helped to cool off the market.      Mr. PHIL FLYNN (Analyst, Alaron Trading):  We have seen oil imports at      the fourth highest level ever.  It's sort of like the Statue of Liberty      is calling for oil from around the world, and it's answering the call.      We're getting oil from all over the place.  And it's put our oil      inventories in the best situation they've been in years.      HORSLEY:  Even so, Flynn warns that global supplies of oil remain tight      and seasonable demand is likely to pick up.      Mr. FLYNN:  We're not using a lot of oil yet.  This is the time of year      where we're turning off our heaters, we haven't turned on our air      conditioners and we really haven't started to enjoy the summer driving      season just yet.  But obviously the summer driving season is just around      the corner.  So even though the market may be under a bit more pressure,      I think there's a possibility that we could start the rally all over      again, and I think the prices could star moving up.      HORSLEY:  Even though oil prices have fallen more than $10 a barrel from      their peak in early April, they've remained relatively high, about 17      percent higher than at this time last year.

I'm Alex      Chadwick.      Coming up, can Americans compete with China?  A question for the Bush      administration.      First, a little background.  Trade with China is in the news this week      because the US is demanding China cut back somehow on a huge increase in      clothing that China is selling in this country, one aspect--and a very      public one--of the trade imbalance we have with China.  It's gotten much      worse since the beginning of this year when previous barriers to cheap      Chinese imports were dropped.  There are many elements of this problem.      Working with our partners at Slate, DAY TO DAY's crack editorial staff      has reduced the complications to the essentials, which we're going to      deliver to you in the next two minutes. So listen.  Here it is.      The most fundamental problem may be currency:  our dollar and the Chinese      yuan.  The most important world currencies, like the dollar and the euro,      float up and down against one another with their relative value      determined by the market.  But China sets the value of the yuan.  And by      keeping its currency artificially cheap against the dollar, China can      sell its exports for lower prices in the US and expand this enormous US      trade deficit with China.      Earlier this week the Treasury Department reported to Congress that      China's current policy distorts world trade.  But it did not accuse China      of manipulating its currency, and for some in Congress, that report did      not go far enough.  Here's New York Senator Charles Schumer.  He's a      Democrat.      Senator CHARLES SCHUMER (Democrat, New York):  If it quacks like a duck      and walks like a duck and swims like a duck, it's a duck.  They are      manipulating their currency.  And for the report not to find that is sort      of strange.      CHADWICK:  Peking duck maybe.  Anyway, here to explain how the Chinese      keep their currency artificially cheap is Slate's Daniel Gross.  We asked      him for an explainer on the question:  Do the Chinese manipulate their      currency?  The answer, he said, is yes.      DANIEL GROSS reporting:      The Chinese renminbi, which means `the people's currency,' comes in units      known as yuan.  Since 1994, China has effectively linked the yuan to the      dollar.  It does so by continuing offering to swap dollars into yuan at      about 8. 3 yuan per dollar.  Chinese companies and individuals are      constantly accumulating lots of dollars, which they get from selling lots      of clothes, toys and electronics to Americans.  But the locals have to      turn all those dollars into yuan in order to pay employees or to buy      goods and services.  In a market system, this dynamic of supply and      demand would drive the yuan higher against the dollar.  But China's      government doesn't want to let the yuan strengthen since that would erode      China's cost advantage vis-a-vis the US.      So China's central bank, the Bank of China, is the buyer of first and      last resort of dollars.  It's constantly in the market, every day,      offering to buy dollars and sell yuan at a more or less fixed price,      regardless of demand. Whether it buys dollars or sells the yuan directly      to Chinese companies or does so through intermediaries, like local banks,      the Bank of China determines the market price.      By keeping the yuan tightly aligned with the dollar, China perpetuates      the cost advantage it has over the United States as a manufacturing      center.  When the dollar weakens against the euro and the yen, the yuan      weakens by roughly the same proportion.  As a result, Chinese-produced      goods remain cheap in this country.  And perhaps more significantly, even      if a sinking dollar makes US-produced dishwashers cheaper in Europe or      Japan, it makes Chinese-produced dishwashers cheaper still.      CHADWICK:  That explainer from Daniel Gross.  He writes the Moneybox      column for Slate.       ALEX CHADWICK, host:       From NPR West and Slate magazine online, this is DAY TO DAY.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      United Airlines and its Machinists union worked through the night trying      to come to terms on contract concessions.  This may actually wind up with      a federal bankruptcy judge, and the union could strike against the      financially ailing airline.  Joining us is Bob Moon from the      \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.      Bob, is there much of a chance the airline and the union are going to      work out their differences?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  That's a good question, Alex.  As you      mentioned, they were bargaining all night long and into this morning, but      there's no word on any agreement.  They were hoping to workout their      differences before this federal bankruptcy judge in Chicago rules,      possibly later today, on unilaterally imposing the cuts that United is      seeking.  A trial on the issue is wrapping up with closing arguments      today, and the judge could rule immediately or he could wait a few days.      But the Machinists union, which represents about 20,000 ramp and customer      service workers, says if he rules against the union that would      immediately trigger a strike, which could, of course, wreck the bankrupt      carrier.  United contends such a strike would be illegal.  The union says      it would be permitted.      CHADWICK:  If you were running United Airlines, wouldn't you like to get      through a week without having your company's name in the papers?  I mean,      last week it was this pension plans that they've defaulted on.  It's just      a lot of problems there.      MOON:  Yeah.  It has been a very long road for United.  And in fact, the      pension issue does appear to be a major stumbling block in these talks      with the Machinists union.  In place of the old pension plan, United      wants to offer a defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k), but the      Machinists union is promoting its national pension plan and wants United      to contribute to that.      The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is the      only union that hasn't reached a deal with the airline.  It also contends      that its members are being asked to shoulder a disproportionate share of      the total labor-related cuts that are being sought by United.  The      carrier says it needs to come up with $700 million in labor-related      savings to win exit financing and successfully emerge from bankruptcy      protection.  The Machinists union says its members are the lowest-paid,      and yet are being asked to take the largest cuts.  United wants them to      agree to wage and other concessions that would amount to about $176      million a year in savings.      CHADWICK:  Bob, what else in airline news today?      MOON:  Well, America West, as you may have heard just yesterday, agreed      to buy US Airways.  That should help USAir emerge from bankruptcy      protection.  Delta Air Lines, meantime, says it will keep making      contributions to its employee pension plans as long as possible.  Delta      is the third-largest US carrier. It's been working with the Airline      Pilots Association and Northwest Airlines to win passage of legislation      that would let the company spread its pension contributions over 25      years.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're looking at a new chain of      Latin-themed coffee shops that plan to pick off customers at Starbucks.      CHADWICK:  All right.  Thank you, Bob.

This may actually wind up with      a federal bankruptcy judge, and the union could strike against the      financially ailing airline.  Joining us is Bob Moon from the      \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.       Bob, is there much of a chance the airline and the union are going to      work out their differences?       BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  That's a good question, Alex.  As you      mentioned, they were bargaining all night long and into this morning, but      there's no word on any agreement.  They were hoping to workout their      differences before this federal bankruptcy judge in Chicago rules,      possibly later today, on unilaterally imposing the cuts that United is      seeking.  A trial on the issue is wrapping up with closing arguments      today, and the judge could rule immediately or he could wait a few days.      But the Machinists union, which represents about 20,000 ramp and customer      service workers, says if he rules against the union that would      immediately trigger a strike, which could, of course, wreck the bankrupt      carrier.  United contends such a strike would be illegal.  The union says      it would be permitted.       CHADWICK:  If you were running United Airlines, wouldn't you like to get      through a week without having your company's name in the papers?  I mean,      last week it was this pension plans that they've defaulted on.  It's just      a lot of problems there.       MOON:  Yeah.  It has been a very long road for United.  And in fact, the      pension issue does appear to be a major stumbling block in these talks      with the Machinists union.  In place of the old pension plan, United      wants to offer a defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k), but the      Machinists union is promoting its national pension plan and wants United      to contribute to that.       The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is the      only union that hasn't reached a deal with the airline.  It also contends      that its members are being asked to shoulder a disproportionate share of      the total labor-related cuts that are being sought by United.  The      carrier says it needs to come up with $700 million in labor-related      savings to win exit financing and successfully emerge from bankruptcy      protection.  The Machinists union says its members are the lowest-paid,      and yet are being asked to take the largest cuts.  United wants them to      agree to wage and other concessions that would amount to about $176      million a year in savings.       CHADWICK:  Bob, what else in airline news today?       MOON:  Well, America West, as you may have heard just yesterday, agreed      to buy US Airways.  That should help USAir emerge from bankruptcy      protection.  Delta Air Lines, meantime, says it will keep making      contributions to its employee pension plans as long as possible.  Delta      is the third-largest US carrier. It's been working with the Airline      Pilots Association and Northwest Airlines to win passage of legislation      that would let the company spread its pension contributions over 25      years.       Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're looking at a new chain of      Latin-themed coffee shops that plan to pick off customers at Starbucks.       CHADWICK:  All right.  Thank you, Bob.

It's the politics, too.  Here's NPR's China correspondent Rob Gifford.      ROB GIFFORD reporting:      China's peg to the dollar has been good to me.  I live in Beijing, and      that peg has protected my salary from what would have been a substantial      depreciation over the last couple of years.  That, however, is probably      not the reason why China's economic gurus have kept the Chinese yen      pegged to the dollar.  Perhaps it's more to do with intense national      pride and the survival of the Communist Party.      First of all, no country in the early 21st century wants to be seen to be      doing the bidding of big, bad America.  Asian analysts say that      Washington's turning the issue from an economic one into a very public,      political one is not a smart way to deal with the Chinese.  They say      China knows it needs to revalue, but from here in Beijing it seems      blindingly obvious that if US politicians would just stop talking about      Chinese revaluation for a few minutes, the Chinese might do it right      away.      Secondly, export growth creates jobs.  As long as China's currency is      undervalued, its products remain cheaper than those made in other      countries. This means more orders and more Chinese jobs created.  This,      in turn, absorbs some of the workers laid off from the old, inefficient,      state-run factories as well as some of the tens of millions of peasants      who are moving to the cities in search of work.  If Beijing revalues its      currency, it fears there will be fewer orders because its products will      be relatively more expensive.  This might mean layoffs, which in turn      might mean more risk of social instability. There are already regular      demonstrations around China by workers and peasants alike.      The third problem is exactly how to do it.  In one fell swoop revalue as      much as is needed or gradually, in stages?  One of the problems here is      that currency speculators hoping to make a quick buck have poured money      into China as the expectation of a revaluation has risen.  This has      boosted the Chinese economy for now, and the government is loath to give      that up.  But if, as expected, Beijing does revalue in stages, even more      speculative money might pour in after the first tweak in expectation of      the further tweaks down the road.      Truth is all that money has already created something of a bubble in      sectors like real estate.  And if there's one thing Beijing needs less      than a bunch of angry, unemployed factory workers, it's a bunch of angry,      middle-class homeowners whose bubbles have burst.  So hold on to your      hats for the likely economic and political showdown of coming weeks or      months, as I hold on to mine and prepare, sadly, for that almost      inevitable revaluation of my salary.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      The housing market is still hot.  That's according to new surveys out      this week.  That's got some experts sounding the alarm even louder that      housing prices in some local markets could be bubbles waiting to burst.      Bob Moon joins us now from the \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.      And, Bob, the government reports today that new home sales increased in      the last month, and normally that's greeted with a lot of enthusiasm.      What's the problem?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, in some ways, Madeleine, it depends on      your vantage point.  The fact that new home sales increased in April to a      record pace is a sign that low mortgage rates and job gains keep powering      housing, but prices are up, especially for the purchases of more      expensive homes.  The housing market has ridden a roller coaster in the      past few months.  This increase in new home sales followed reports just      yesterday that showed housing starts and existing home sales rose in      April.  Housing starts climbed 11 percent while existing home sales rose      4. 5 percent.      Well, the National Association of Realtors reported that across the      country, the average price for existing homes is now $206,000.  That's up      15 percent over the last year, and it's broken the 200,000 level for the      first time. Today's figures show more higher-priced homes were sold in      April while the number of cheaper houses declined.  So that could be bad      news.      BRAND:  And what's behind the strong housing market overall?  Hasn't the      Federal Reserve been acting to raise interest rates?      MOON:  Well, yes, but it hasn't affected mortgage rates so far, at least      not in the long term.  The chief economist at the National Association of      Realtors, David Lereah, says that there's really the best of both worlds      right now for the housing sector, because rates have stayed low, and the      job market is gaining momentum, so people are more apt to buy houses.      BRAND:  And is there anything to this concern that there are some bubbles      around the country about to burst?      MOON:  Well, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan weighed in on this      at a luncheon at the Economic Club of New York just last week.  You may      remember that he said the dot-com and the tech boom were marked by      irrational exuberance.  Well, now he says the housing market is showing      signs of excesses.  He says there are a number of things which he thinks      suggests, at a minimum, there is what he calls a little froth in the      market.  And he also said, `We don't perceive that there's a national      bubble, but it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles. '      And some economists say that they think home prices are going to slow      down, at least in some markets, and they say that that may not happen      until interest rates go up, but it will happen.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're looking at what happens if      French voters turn down the new European constitution.

Ms. SUSAN TERRY (Director, University of Washington's Center for Career      Services):  At our career fair in the spring, we had 120 companies.  Last      year, we had 85.  The year before that, we had 70.      KAUFMAN:  Terry says after the dot-com bust, which hit the Pacific      Northwest especially hard, many students became disillusioned.  They kept      their barista jobs, applied to the Peace Corps or grad school because      they didn't see many other options.  But that, she says, has changed.

And according to a survey by      the National Association of Colleges and Employers, or NACE, starting      salaries for accounting graduates will average nearly $44,000 a year.      Computer science and computer engineering graduates will fair even      better.  Their average salary:  more than $51,000.      KAUFMAN:  Computer science graduate Casey Huggins(ph) landed a job at      Electronic Arts, the world's largest computer gaming company.      Mr. CASEY HUGGINS (Computer Science Graduate):  It was just a      phenomenally lucky match to my skill set, and so I had to take it.      KAUFMAN:  In addition to his salary of $60,000, Huggins will get stock      options, a throwback to the dot-com era.  Twenty-five percent of      employers who responded to the NACE survey said they plan to offer them.      But Huggins, citing the already high price of Electronic Arts shares,      knows his options might not be worth all that much.      Mr. HUGGINS:  I talked to guys at EA who got in when the price was low,      and they were riding pretty high when they were talking to me.  But I      won't be expecting that sort of payoff.

Their target      hiring figure is 10 percent more than last year, 31 percent more than two      years ago. But Kristin Roby, the company's director of college and MBA      recruiting, says Microsoft is facing stiffer competition from other      employers.      Ms. KRISTIN ROBY (Recruiting Director, Microsoft):  We may have students      who have two or three competitive offers.  And in past years, maybe they      would have one other competitive offer.      KAUFMAN:  What's more, she says, students are taking longer to say yes to      job offers.      Ms. ROBY:  When there weren't as many employers out there, it was easier      to close a candidate quickly, whereas now we're finding that it may take      a little bit longer for the offer to be accepted.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      New employment figures are out today, and they're not exactly blowing the      socks off economists.  The Labor Department says the economy created      78,000 jobs in May, a lot less than expected, the slowest payroll      expansion in nearly two years.  We're joined by \"Marketplace's\" John      Dimsdale in Washington.      And, John, what are the details?      JOHN DIMSDALE (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, you know, Madeleine, the economy's      been such a good performer so far this year, with strong growth and      companies reporting good earnings, that the experts had predicted that      recent improvements in employment would continue and we'd see maybe      175,000 new jobs last month.  So 78,000 was a real disappointment, the      smallest job growth since August of 2003.  Several parts of the      economy--manufacturing and the hospitality industry, for example--even      lost jobs in May.  Salary gains were also disappointing, up only 2/10ths      of 1 percent, which means average paychecks are rising more slowly than      inflation.      BRAND:  Well, John, why were the experts so far off?      DIMSDALE:  Well, for one thing, productivity continues to increase.      Improvements in technology and efficiencies allow companies to produce      more goods and services without having to hire as many workers.  Plus,      these stubbornly high oil prices are a real drag on the economy, and it's      hard to measure that in the short term.      BRAND:  So if this is a sign of a slowing economy, what does that mean      for the all-important interest rates?      DIMSDALE:  Yeah, as you know, the Fed's been gradually increasing those      short-term rates for a year now.  And if, indeed, the economy has      stumbled, the Fed may be inclined to hold off on more increases.  That      would be a welcome sign for the stock market since higher interest rates      make borrowing more expensive.  The view that the Fed may be just about      finished with its tightening was reinforced this week when one Fed member      said during an interview the Fed was in the `eight inning' of rate      increases, giving the impression there would only be one more ratchet up      in the current cycle.  And that, you know, could mean this next meeting,      which is the end of this month.      BRAND:  But, John, there were statistics out earlier this week pointing      to higher inflation, and usually, if I'm not mistaken, that does put more      pressure on the Fed to keep raising rates, right?      DIMSDALE:  You're right.  You're thinking of the government's survey of      labor costs, which showed a hefty increase during the first quarter of      the year, 3. 3 percent, which was revised up from an earlier estimate of      only 2. 2 percent. That's an important gauge of inflation, and it prompted      speculation that the Fed still has a ways to go on increasing interest      rates.      So, you know, as usual the economy is sending conflicting signals.  More      proof of that:  There was some good news in today's unemployment report.      Construction companies, retailers continued to produce impressive numbers      of new jobs.  And a separate survey of households found that the      unemployment rate actually slipped 1/10th of 1 point to 5. 1 percent.      We'll look more closely at these numbers later today on \"Marketplace. \"      Plus, our series on think tanks and the money behind them continues.

Well, that hasn't dissuaded one group of people      here in Los Angeles from jumping into the market.  Emily Meehan reports.      EMILY MEEHAN reporting:      House flipping, cash-out refinancing and no-money-down loans are real      estate techniques that have become popular in the past four years thanks      to a booming real estate market and low interest rates.  Market analysts      and even the Federal Reserve say that people are taking big risks, but      that hasn't gotten in the way of a few aspiring celebrities who are      quitting their night jobs to strike it big in the housing market.      Unidentified Man #1:  Gentlemen, Tamara Davis.      Unidentified Group of People:  Yea!      (Soundbite of clapping)      MEEHAN:  Tamara Davis is a young actress.  Her fellow investors club      members are cheering her on for her achievement in placing her third      renovated house on the market in two years.      Ms. TAMARA DAVIS:  I can tell you that when I first started I had an      investor that was helping me.  I used somebody else's credit.      MEEHAN:  Tamara and roughly 60 other investors meet once a month in a      house that one of them has placed on the market where they discuss      strategy, eat snacks and drink wine.      Unidentified Man #2:  And then when you bought it for 400, you sold it      for. . .      Ms. GRAY:  I bought it--I sold it for 600,000.      Unidentified Man #2:  Six hundred.      Unidentified Woman:  What'd you put into it?      Ms. GRAY:  Thirty-five thousand.      MEEHAN:  She didn't have the credit or the capital to purchase her first      house.  So she paid someone to use their credit and she had an investor      who put the money down and paid for the $35,000 worth of renovations.      She and her investors made $165,000 from the sale of the house.  It's not      unusual for people trying to flip houses to use rather unorthodox methods      like this to finance their first purchase.  For those who are concerned      that this might be rather reckless financial behavior, meet Brock Harris.      He's a real estate agent in Los Angeles and the creator of      realestateforactors. com, a Web site where he claims to put all those      pesky anxieties to rest.  He writes. . .      Mr. BROCK HARRIS (Realestateforactors. com):  But overcoming fear is the      lifeblood of acting as an art and a job.  That's why you'll make a great      investor.      MEEHAN:  His client John Durler agrees that risk is an integral part of      both professions.      Mr. JOHN DURLER:  You've got people here that are trying to pursue a      career in acting.  And that is the biggest challenge ever to do anything.      You know? They've left their homes.  They left their families.  They're      out here trying to make it, and that--there is a huge risk.      MEEHAN:  John has amassed $2. 8 million in real estate in the past two      years. When he started he had just enough money for one duplex.  He hopes      to earn $10,000 a month in the next 10 years from renting out his      properties to tenants, otherwise known as a passive income.  Since the      possibility of such wealth is one that seems universally appealing, you      might wonder why this trend is so hot in the community of actors      specifically.  Well, they have a lot of free time on their hands.      They're accustomed to unreliable sources of income because they already      get paid in huge chunks and only occasionally. And apparently they make      great salesmen.      Mr. HARRIS:  They're used to hitting the pavement, they're used to      rejection, they're used to, you know, writing offers, getting them      rejected, all the ingredients that constitute, you know, a successful      real estate investor.      Mr. GREGORY COLLINS (Actor):  They say you have to go on a hundred      commercial auditions to get one commercial.  You know, you're constantly      trying to get auditions.  You're getting pictures done, you're sending      mailers out.  You're just like a real estate person would be, calling      people, making cold calls, computer Web sites.      MEEHAN:  That was Brock Harris and actor Gregory Collins.  Gregory was a      bouncer for six years.  But now, thanks to his real estate, he doesn't      need a second job, and he can spend his spare time with his wife and two      twin babies. This exuberance for investing could be what Alan Greenspan      warned about in his speech several weeks ago when he cited that some      local markets are in a state of froth.  Froth or not, compared to the      alternative of working for tips in the service industry, it's a chance      these actors are still willing to take. For NPR News, I'm Emily Meehan.

His      comments came in testimony on the state of the economy before Congress'      Joint Economic Committee.  NPR's John Ydstie reports.      JOHN YDSTIE reporting:      Chairman Greenspan told lawmakers despite a recent soft patch, the US      economy now seems to be on reasonably firm footing.  But he also      discussed some areas of concern; among them, the double-digit rise in      home prices in recent years in several areas of the country.  Some      economists have suggested that's producing a housing bubble similar to      the stock market bubble that led to big losses for investors around the      country when it burst.  Greenspan doesn't envision that scenario in      housing, but, still, he expressed concerns.      Mr. ALAN GREENSPAN (Federal Reserve Chair):  Although a bubble in home      prices for the nation as a whole does not appear likely, there do appear      to be, at a minimum, signs of froth in some local markets where home      prices seem to have risen to unsustainable levels.      YDSTIE:  The chairman didn't say where in the country housing prices      might be getting dangerously high.  However, analysts point most often to      areas like New York City, southern Florida and California.  Greenspan      said even if price declines do occur in some local markets, he doesn't      think there would be much impact on the national economy.  He did say the      froth in some housing markets appeared to be spilling over into the      mortgage market with the growing popularity of exotic adjustable-rate and      interest-only mortgages.      Mr. GREENSPAN:  To be sure, these financing vehicles have their      appropriate uses.  But to the extent that some households may be      employing these instruments to purchase a home that would otherwise be      unaffordable, their use is beginning to add to the pressures in the      marketplace.      YDSTIE:  Greenspan said that surprisingly low mortgage rates are helping      to fuel the surge in home prices.  Most analysts had expected that      long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, would head higher      when the Fed began steadily raising short-term rates a year ago, but they      haven't.  And mortgage rates fell again today and stand at a 14-month      low.  In fact, around the world long-term interest rates have remained      very low.  In past testimony Greenspan called the phenomenon a      `conundrum. '  Today he offered some possible explanations.  One is the      effect of globalization; it has brought millions of low-cost, educated      workers from China, India and the former Soviet republics into the global      economy.      Mr. GREENSPAN:  There are vast numbers of people who are skilled,      educated and very significant interest in working hard, and they've all      come on the market at the same time.      YDSTIE:  That pool of cheap labor may have reduced the cost structure of      global businesses so much that investors now see little danger of      inflationary price hikes, so they've bid long-term interest rates lower.      In the past, falling long-term rates have often signaled looming economic      problems and an eventual slowdown in growth, but Greenspan said he      doesn't think that's the case this time, partly because rates were      already falling in 2004 when the world economy experienced its best      growth in recent memory.

Most analysts had expected that      long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, would head higher      when the Fed began steadily raising short-term rates a year ago, but they      haven't.  And mortgage rates fell again today and stand at a 14-month      low.  In fact, around the world long-term interest rates have remained      very low.  In past testimony Greenspan called the phenomenon a      `conundrum. '  Today he offered some possible explanations.  One is the      effect of globalization; it has brought millions of low-cost, educated      workers from China, India and the former Soviet republics into the global      economy.       Mr. GREENSPAN:  There are vast numbers of people who are skilled,      educated and very significant interest in working hard, and they've all      come on the market at the same time.       YDSTIE:  That pool of cheap labor may have reduced the cost structure of      global businesses so much that investors now see little danger of      inflationary price hikes, so they've bid long-term interest rates lower.      In the past, falling long-term rates have often signaled looming economic      problems and an eventual slowdown in growth, but Greenspan said he      doesn't think that's the case this time, partly because rates were      already falling in 2004 when the world economy experienced its best      growth in recent memory.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      The Congressional Budget Office is painting a bleak picture of the      country's pension system.  The CBO says the federal agency that insures      private pension funds is likely to run a deficit of some $70 billion over      the next decade. \"Marketplace's\" John Dimsdale joins us from Washington.      And, John, how serious is this deficit?      JOHN DIMSDALE (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, remember, we're talking here about      traditional defined benefit pensions, the ones that guarantee retirees a      set amount each month, not the 401(k)s where employer and employee pay      into a retirement fund over the course of a career.  The traditional      pensions are found mostly in older industries, like steel and autos and      airlines.      Now earlier this week, government watchdogs reported loopholes in the      rules have allowed some companies to paint their traditional pension      funds as more solvent than they really are, and when a company defaults      on a traditional retirement fund, as US Airways and United have done      recently or the big steel companies did a few years back, the government      insurance fund, called the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, takes      over the pension assets and liabilities and continues to pay the benefits      to retired workers.  Now because of so many defaults recently, the PBGC      is already $23 billion in the red, and today's report predicts the      deficit will triple by 2015.      BRAND:  So what does this all mean for people's pensions?      DIMSDALE:  Well, they're not necessarily at risk immediately.  The PBGC      can and will cover most promised benefits for the foreseeable future.      There are some exceptions.  The government insurance program guarantees      only $45,600 in payments every year.  Now that's fine for more than 90      percent of the individual pensions run by the government, but some      higher-income people get more plush benefits, and they stand to lose      payments when the government takes over.  For example, airline pilots      take a double hit; they're forced to retire early by law, and the      government reduces payments for early retirement.  I talked to one      recently retired pilot.  His name is Robert Rhinehart(ph).  He flew for      United for 34 years, and now that United has abandoned its pension      program, Rhinehart could see nearly 80 percent of his pension, which he      thought was guaranteed for life, disappear--and soon.      Mr. ROBERT RHINEHART (Retired Pilot):  I'm kind of planning on July being      the last month that I'm going to get these checks, so of course, we've      been pulling in our financial horns for the last six months, anticipating      this, 'cause it's not like, you know, we aren't seeing this coming, and      we just don't want to be caught out there saying, `Oh, we got all these      bills now. What are we going to do? '      BRAND:  And, John, what is Congress going to do about these threats to      the pension system?      DIMSDALE:  House members unveiled a plan today to increase the premiums      that companies have to pay into the PBGC.  Now it'll take some big      increases to make the insurance fund whole.  The worry is that the higher      premiums will force many companies to drop their traditional pension      plans.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington.      From Benjamin Franklin to Donald Trump, we've always believed in America      as the land of opportunity, a nation in which the children of      hard-working immigrants lift themselves into the middle-class and then      send their kids onto college and an even better life.  Last month, The      Wall Street Journal began a series called Moving Up, which concluded that      we are not quite as upwardly mobile as we thought.  After a reexamination      of data, many economists now say that people on the lowest economic rung      in the United States have a worse chance at climbing the social ladder      than their counterparts in western Europe and Canada.      But social mobility is a complex equation.  Our society as a hole is ever      more prosperous and the most economically dynamic group in the country,      recent immigrants, rarely are included in the calculations.  Even so,      these conclusions raise troubling issues.  It turns out that your      parents' status, even your grandparents', matters more than we once      thought, that we're less of a meritocracy than we'd like to believe.      Later in the program, mixed tapes, those homemade soundtracks--Do you      still make them?  Thurston Moore of the art rock group Sonic Youth does,      and he'll join us to say why.      But, first, economic mobility.  Are you better off than your parents?  Do      you expect your kids will have a better future than you?  If you've left      the economic class you were born into, how?  And did you move up or down?      Our number here in Washington is (800) 989-8255.  That's (800) 989-TALK.      E-mail us:  totn@npr. O-R-G.      And joining us now is David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for      The Wall Street Journal, one of the lead reporters on The Journal's      series Moving Up:  Challenges to the American Dream.  He's been nice      enough to join us here in Studio 3A.      Thanks very much for coming in.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street      Journal): You're welcome.      CONAN:  What does it mean if the economic escalator doesn't run as well      as we thought?      Mr. WESSEL:  It means that there's a difference between the myth of      mobility in America and the reality.  As you pointed out, Benjamin      Franklin stands for this great American story that anybody can come from      any class and become president of the United States or wealthy.  After      all, Franklin started out penniless, and was so rich that he could retire      to diplomacy and politics at age 42.  America still delivers that--on      that myth for many people, but it doesn't do it for as many people as we      used to think.  And I think that's interesting because it allows--it may      inform our politics.  It may explain why Americans have tolerated a      society that has become increasingly unequal over the last 35 years.      CONAN:  There's been a growing divide between the very rich and the very      poor, but most people thought, Americans thought, that was OK as long as      they thought they, too, has a chance at the brass ring.      Mr. WESSEL:  They, or their children, yes.      CONAN:  Yeah.  And that is less true than we thought?      Mr. WESSEL:  Yes.  It's important to say it's not getting in--from      what--my reading of the data, it's not getting worse.  That's not the      point of our series.  Our point is that it's not getting better, and      that's a problem at a time when the distance from the economic cellar to      the economic penthouse is rising.  And it requires some thought about      what are the escalators of social mobility, which ones do we want to do      something about, which ones do we have to accept as facts of life, and      which ones are operating in--so far in the background we don't even see      them?      CONAN:  And the one that I think makes a lot of Americans uncomfortable      is the legacy that we get from our parents.  Beyond whatever money we may      inherit, the idea that we're born into their--whatever group we're born      into, whatever group they were in when we were born, that's the group      that we're going to get the benefit or the lack of benefit from that.      Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  Sandy Jencks, who's a sociologist at Harvard,      pointed out to me that nobody is comfortable with a society in which the      only thing that matters is who your parents are.  We're not happy with a      kind of old caricature of Europe where you are permanently in the working      class or permanently in the royalty, but we're also not comfortable with      a society where it makes no difference, because, after all, we want      parents to spend time, energy, inspiration, even their money, on their      kids, and if we don't give them some incentive to do that, they won't do      it, so the question is: Where in the middle is the right balance?  I      don't know the answer to that. But that's the way I like to think of the      question.  How much are we willing to say it's OK if you do well because      your parents gave you a lot of stuff, and how much are--we want to say      that we want to try and make the game more fair so that if you happen to      be born to a single mom in a poor part of Philadelphia, or Los Angeles,      you, too, have a shot at going to a good college and getting a      middle-class job?      CONAN:  We're talking about American's economic escalator.  Our guest is      David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal.  If you'd like to join us, our      number is (800) 989-8255.  Our e-mail address:  totn@npr. O-R-G.  And      let's talk with Monica.  Monica's calling from Milford, Indiana.      MONICA (Caller):  Hi.      CONAN:  Hi.      MONICA:  Thanks for taking my call.      CONAN:  Sure.      MONICA:  My comment would be I think it does make a difference, actually      what kind of a background you lived in, whether it be lower class, middle      class, whatever.  My mother was divorced and--yeah, she was raising two      girls and she had no extras.  So now I'm married and we have four      children and my husband, on a good year, will make maybe $45,000.  But      I'm a stay-at-home mother, I have my own garden, I can all my own fruit,      we butcher our own beef, our own hogs.  I realize that there's people      that can't do that.  But I think it makes a difference how accepting we      are of the situation that we're in, and also how we manage what we do      have.  In fact, my husband is actually the one that taught me how to      manage, because he grew up in a very conservative home where the children      gave their money home to the parents when they worked away until they      were a certain age.  And it helped them to learn how to manage their      money correctly.  And we're really not wanting for anything.  We have a      new home in 2000 and we have a mortgage.  We have used vehicles.  No, we      will not go out and buy brand-new SUVs.  $3,000 vehicle that we cashed      off.  We don't need that prestige of having this $30,000 SUV.  And I      think that makes a big difference sometimes in how fast we can move up.      And I guess that would be my comment.      And my question would be:  Do you think that sometimes we don't make it      so much as this credit card--I get like six or seven credit card mailings      in the mail every day.  And I am just continuously running them through      the shredder and I wonder how many people actually take advantage of all      these and I think that's a detriment.  That's all.      CONAN:  Monica, before I let you go, let me ask you a question and we'll      get an answer to your question.  But do you expect your children to do      better than you're doing?      MONICA:  Well, you know what?  I think--How do I describe that?  You know      what?  I think I'm very happy where I'm at and if my children can reach      where I'm at right now, I would be satisfied with that.  And if they      choose to go further, then that would be up to them.      CONAN:  So as your question about credit cards indicates, you're not      talking strictly about monetary achievements?      All right.  David Wessel, let's get an answer to that question.      Mr. WESSEL:  There are two important things to remember.  One is that our      kids will probably do better than we do, on average, because America is a      growing country with a rising standard of living.  And that's one way to      think about the question.  The other is to think about how we divide the      slices of the pie of that prosperity and that's where the mobility issues      come in.  I think the caller's absolutely right to pick up on the      question of debt.  One of my colleagues, Bob Davis, did a story in our      series that looked just at that and observed that there are a lot of      people in America who want to have more stuff, more goods and services,      better trips and so forth than their parents did, don't have the income      to do it, but are able to an extraordinary degree in America today, to      borrow and to buy that stuff, and many of them do get into trouble and      there's--it's good reason to worry about it.  His piece was set in Utah      and the lead example was a guy whose name was Benjamin Franklin Baggett,      who was named by his father, who was an admirer for Benjamin Franklin,      and gave him all that stuff that Franklin talked about thrift, and then      promptly proceeded to ignore it all.      CONAN:  Yeah, that thrift part turns out to matter.  Monica, good luck.      Thanks very much for the call.      MONICA:  Thank you.      CONAN:  Appreciate it.  As we mentioned earlier, not long ago, most      economists believe the US was an economically mobile society.  Some began      to rethink that conventional wisdom.  To help us understand, we turn to      Gary Solon, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.  He's      with us by phone from his office in Ann Arbor.      Nice of you to be with us today.      Professor GARY SOLON (University of Michigan):  Well, thank you for      inviting me.      CONAN:  So, as I understand it, there are two basic long-running studies      that economists turn to for this information.  What did they get wrong?      Prof. SOLON:  Oh, well, where we went wrong, it was really both      economists and sociologists, was before we had access to these new better      data sets, until about 15 years ago, it was very, very difficult to get      any data on incomes of both generations from the same family.  So      researchers were sort of forced to work with whatever they could get and      what they could get wasn't very good. They were odd data sets with not      such good measurements of income and on--very unrepresentative samples,      and we've come to understand since then that the data deficiencies led      systematically to underestimation of how strong the link is between      parents' income and children's income.  And what helps us figure this out      was much better data sets.      One of those, as a Michigan prof, I'm proud to say, is a University of      Michigan survey called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which since      the late 1960s has been following a nationally--a national probability      sample of thousands of American families, and going back to them year      after year, and asking them, `Well, how much money did you make last      year? ' along with a battery of many other questions.  And in addition to      having pretty good income measures from this year after year on the same      folks, this survey has followed the kids from the original families as      they've grown up to become adults and formed their own households so that      for some years now there has been an intergenerational span to the data      set so that we're able to look at how strong is the relationship between      the kids' incomes and the incomes of their parents.      Around the same time, the late '60s, there was also another data set,      fairly similar, although different in certain respects, called the      National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience.  Interestingly,      it's partly operated by Ohio State so Michigan and Ohio State are      competing in the intergenerational data field as well as the football      field.  And so quite a bit of the research has been done with that data      set also.  And these data sets have given us a lot better information,      first, because they're working with nationally representative samples,      and, secondly, because their so-called longitudinal surveys, which go      back and collect the income information repeatedly over the years.  We      now have a much better handle on the longer run income of the people in      those surveys.      CONAN:  Well, hang with us, and we'll get to what that means when we get      to more of our calls from our listeners.  And the question, again, is:      Are you doing better than your parents did?  Do you expect your children      to do better than you did?  Is the engine, the economic escalator in      America, is it working for you and your family?  Has it stuttered?  Our      number:  (800) 989-8255, (800) 989-TALK.  The e-mail address:      totn@npr. org.      We'll be back after a short break.  I'm Neal Conan.  It's TALK OF THE      NATION from NPR News.      (Soundbite of music)      CONAN:  This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Neal Conan in Washington.      We're talking about economic mobility in American society.  On new data,      economists have downgraded Horatio Alger's American Dream.  It turns out,      well, if you've read those books, you know this, too, the social ladder      has always been hard to climb.  What's your experience?  Are you better      or worse off than your parents?  If you're an immigrant or the child of      immigrants, have you made it to the ranks of the middle class?  What did      it take?  (800) 989-8255, (800) 989-TALK.  The e-mail address is      totn@npr. org.      Our guest in Studio 3A is David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief      for The Wall Street Journal, one of the lead reporters on The Journal      series Moving Up:  Challenges to the American Dream.  And still with us      is Gary Solon, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.      And let's get another caller on the line.  And this is Ken.  Ken's with      us from Owensboro, Kentucky.      KEN (Caller):  Yeah, I was listening to you.  It was interesting when he      mentioned legacy because when you posed the question--I--my--I'm a--much      better off now than my parents and I come from a divorced mama in the      '60s. She was a single parent before it became fashionable.  But the--I      think part of the issue is, too, when you look at family legacy, is I      started at the bottom rung of the ladder and was able to climb to the      top, shall we say, and since I'm so high, will my kids be better off than      me, I'm not sure that that's going to be all that easy for them.  I think      the legacy I left them is that I hope they at least break even, stay at      . . . (technical difficulties).      CONAN:  OK, Ken.  Again, your phone's breaking up so I'm going to let you      go but I think we got your point.  Appreciate the phone call.      KEN:  Sure.      CONAN:  Did you run across that in--as you talked to people around the      country, David?      Mr. WESSEL:  I think that there are two--as I said earlier, there's two      different ways to think about this.  One is:  Will our kids live better      than we do?  Depends a lot on what happens to the whole level of living      standards in the United States.  And there's always a surprising amount      of doubt in America about that but the evidence is, given what's happened      to productivity and wages over time, that our kids, on average, will live      better than other people, than we did.  It is, of course, true, that if      you're at the top, your kids have nowhere to go but down.  The facts are,      though, that not a lot of kids fall out of that top tier into the bottom.      Maybe Gary can shed some light on that, but I don't think there's--I      don't think that that's--there's not--there's surprisingly little of      that, as I look at the data.      CONAN:  They may not fall to the bottom, but, Gary Solon, do they fall to      the middle sometimes?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well. . .      Prof. SOLON:  Well, on average, though, they'll go somewhat in that      direction. As David's been reporting in this series of articles, one      thing, you know, that we academic researchers have been finding is that      the connection between parents' relative income status and kids' relative      income status when they grow up is stronger than we used to realize.  But      another thing we've looked at, which I think he was just referring to, is      whether there's any asymmetry in that.  That is, whether rags to riches      is more or less common than riches to rags.  And there seems to be some      indication in the data, not just in the United States but in some other      countries as well, that riches to rags is less common.  In a sense,      there's--in some way, a fairly well-developed safety net for the      offspring of the rich.  It's pretty unusual for them to fall a huge      amount.      CONAN:  Here's an e-mail question from Bradford in Portland, Oregon.      `Why does the US still have the reputation for its so-called American      Dream? Social and economic mobility is considerably easier in countries      that combine a market economy, as well as a robust social safety net.      Why have we allowed allegedly stagnant old European countries to outpace      us in these areas? '  Is that comparison to old Europe, if you will--Is      that accurate, Gary Solon?      Prof. SOLON:  Yeah, as we start to get good intergenerational income data      from other countries, one of the maybe surprising and maybe not so      surprising finding is that connection between the generations and      relative income status is relatively high in the United States compared      to many other developed countries.  Maybe that shouldn't be so surprising      because it's been apparent for a long time that there's relatively high      income inequality in the United States and these two things do tend to go      together.  But I think Bradford started off by asking why do we even have      this belief that this is a highly mobile society, relatively speaking.      And I think, Neal, you mentioned what's probably a reason for that, which      is immigration.  The statistical evidence we're talking about relating      income between generations is about families where the parents are      already in the United States.  And this in no way denies that when      somebody immigrates to America from a very poor country or they were poor      and are probably going to stay poor, they're doing it in the hope of      having a better economic level of living in the United States.  And in      many cases their hopes are realized to some extent for themselves and      probably often for their children also.  So I think the idea of America      as the land of opportunity is very tied up with the immigrants'      experience and, you know, that's a valid aspect of thinking of America as      the land of opportunity.      CONAN:  Well, Gary Solon, we're going to explore that with somebody else      in a moment, but thank you very much for being with us today.      Prof. SOLON:  Well, thank you very much.      CONAN:  Gary Solon, professor of economics at the University of Michigan.      And he joined us from his office in Ann Arbor.      Well, joining us now is Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic      Center. He's with us by phone from Ronald Reagan National Airport, right      across the river, in Virginia.      Nice of you to be with us today.      Mr. ROBERTO SURO (Director, Pew Hispanic Center):  Good to be with you.      CONAN:  And you're the group that has been measuring economic mobility      amongst immigrants but it's a difficult thing to measure.      Mr. SURO:  Yeah, because you have to measure it over time, and it takes a      while for any immigrant to catch up because of lack of familiarity with      the labor markets and lack of familiarity with the language and then      there are characteristics, particularly among Hispanic immigrants, that      land them at the bottom of the labor force, particularly their lack of      education.      CONAN:  Now, of course, you mentioned the largest and newest immigrants.      Many of them are Latinos.  What do we know about first generation success      compared to the second and so on?      Mr. SURO:  Well, the--we really only have two generations to look at in      the current wave of immigration that began in the 1970s and '80s.  The      third generation, the people who've traced their roots here as far back      as their grandparents or more really came before this big runup which      really has accelerated in the last 10 years.  And so we know that it can      often take 20 years for an immigrant to catch up to the level of      native-borns who have the same levels of education, for example.  And the      early returns are that the second generation does significantly better      than the first, but you would expect that because we're talking about      people who are born here.  They don't have immigration issues.  They      speak English as a native language and they're the products of US      schools.  But they don't do all that well.  At least in the early      returns, there's a wide spread, and there are a lot of second-generation      Latinos who are sort of on the front edge of a big cohort that's still      very young but the front edge is--there are a great many who are ending      up at the low end of the labor force.      CONAN:  And have not found ways for them or their children to move ahead.      Mr. SURO:  That's right.  I mean, which is not to say that there aren't a      lot of success stories, because there are.  And there are people who are      kind of ending up in the middle.  But it's--the US labor force is very      bifurcated now between people who've got a college education or more and      those who don't and it's very hard to jump from one side to the other of      that educational divide.      CONAN:  Thanks very much, Roberto.  Appreciate it.      Mr. SURO:  You're welcome; thank you.      CONAN:  Roberto Suro, have a good flight.      Mr. SURO:  Thank you very much.  Goodbye.      CONAN:  Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, and he joined      us by phone from Ronald Reagan Airport in northern Virginia.      And, David Wessel, reading some of the stuff in your series, your do run      across the difficulty of trying to figure out what this huge group of      immigrants is doing in this country and how it would affect the economic      escalator, but you do see indictors, if you will, that the graduating      class of the University of California at Berkeley--half the students had      both parents born somewhere else.      Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  I think we do know a few things and we don't know a      lot of things.  One thing we know is that millions of immigrants prefer      the United States to their home country and it looks like, despite all      that we've been through, 9/11, the war in Iraq, and everything, that an      awful lot of immigrants, if they had a choice, would come here rather      than go to some other country.  So that tells you--and they're--these      immigrants are very much in touch with their relatives and friends who      have come already, so they may expect the streets to be paved with gold      and not find them, but they choose to come here, and that tells us      something about our society.      Then the second question is the one that Roberto was talking about is:      So is their experience here as Americans similar to the experience of      people who were born in this country like I was?  And there, because it      takes so long to get a good set of numbers that shows parents and      children, even grandparents and grandchildren, it's really hard to tell,      and it clearly, clearly differs by ethnic group.  We have lots of      evidence of how successful some Asians are in the US but you wouldn't      want to generalize to that--for all immigrants who come to the United      States, so it's--we all have this intuitive sense that there are a lot of      immigrants climbing the ladder.  We all have this intuitive sense that      there are a lot of immigrants, particularly those who don't speak      English, or who have darker skins, that are not somehow able to find the      escalator, and we're trying to figure out which one is the predominant      story.      CONAN:  Let's get another caller on the line.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff's      calling from Detroit.      JEFF (Caller):  Yes, hi.  Well, I just wanted to add some comments      regarding what you guys have been saying.  I'm French here.  I moved to      Detroit.  I've been here for five months.  I got my engineering degree in      France, and I've always been a very conservative French person, always      wanted to stay there, never leave the country.  But at some point with my      degree I had a very hard time finding an interesting job in France, and,      you know, by pure coincidence, I just applied for the US and I got a job      extremely rapidly.  And I just noticed to which extent this country's      extremely dynamic with a very dynamic market with a very motivated work      force.  And I have reached a position that I never would have dreamed of      back in France, even though France remains a very developed country.      CONAN:  In five months, in this country.      JEFF:  Indeed.  Well, I applied to my employer here five months--I moved      after I was hired, but I got an extreme--an excellent position I would      have gotten with 15 years of experience in France.      CONAN:  And you sound young enough, Jeff, that you don't necessarily have      to worry that if you lose your job, you might not have health insurance      coverage or much unemployment insurance.      JEFF:  Well, the thing is, I'm not really worrying about it, maybe      because I'm young, too.  I just got into the work force.  But no, I'm not      really worried about it.  I mean, this country--just seeing the amounts      of opportunities, losing my job here isn't really worrying me, for I'm      always thinking I can always find something just as easily, maybe.  Or      maybe it was a lucky shot, but I just wanted to add that this country is      really extraordinary regarding its market, its--the way people are      desperately searching for talent.      CONAN:  Well, there's a Benjamin Franklin for you.      Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  And I think that one of the things we know is that,      for all the problems of the US economy today, two things stand out.  One      is the dynamism that he refers to.  I mean, like it or not, we're      dynamic.  Sometimes you're on the losing end of the dynamic.  And the      other thing is that having skills and education in the US is a real      necessity; that immigrants who come here and who don't speak English and      don't have much education are competing with lots of other people like      them and a lot of native-born Americans for jobs that simply don't pay      very well.  And there's a lot more people there than there are jobs.  But      at the top end, the kind of engineerlike--the French fellow who just      phoned in. . .      CONAN:  Jeff.  Yeah.      Mr. WESSEL:  . . . Jeff--there's still an enormous demand--despite all the      stories about outsourcing to India and China and all that--there's still      an an enormous demand for these skilled workers.      CONAN:  Jeff, bonne chance.  Appreciate the phone call.  Thanks very      much.      JEFF:  Thank you.  Thank you.      CONAN:  We're talking with David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal about      his series Moving Up:  Challenges to the American Dream.  You're      listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.      And here's an e-mail from Kieran Dooley in Cleveland:  `I'm still      middle-class, like my parents; however, middle-class has improved from a      generation ago.  So class inflation exists.  My middle-class parents      would never have expected to travel so much and have multiple cars and      retire healthy and comfortable, as I do.  Those expectations were      reserved for the wealthy 50 years ago.  What do you think about the idea      of class inflation? '      Mr. WESSEL:  I think it's absolutely true that the standard of living in      the United States today, in 2005, is much better than it was in 1955, and      for most people, much better than it was in 1975.  If you live at the      middle of the middle class, particularly beginning about the mid-'90s,      things really started to get better.  And there's no arguing that.      There--it's clear that there was, during the '70s and '80s, some kind of      stalling in that progress as productivity growth slowed, as more people      had to have two spouses in the work force to have the kind of lifestyle      that one of their parents managed to deliver.  But when you think about      health care and air quality and the devices that we have and the trips we      can take and the deregulation of airlines allowing us to fly to      Disneyland, which didn't even exist in 1950, there's no denying that.      But that doesn't--that's not--that's one question and that's one answer.      That doesn't tell you that the game is being played fairly and that black      kids growing up in inner-city Detroit have the same chances for success      as upper-middle-class white kids in Bethesda, Maryland.  And it's      important to ask both questions, not just one of them.      CONAN:  And you mentioned race; education, obviously, is another factor.      And the other predictor is what your parents made and. . .      Mr. WESSEL:  Right.      CONAN:  . . . how they did.      Mr. WESSEL:  How much money they had, whether--if they went to college,      you're much more likely to go to college.  And Larry Summers, the      president of Harvard, is giving a lot of speeches about this, and one of      the points he makes--that at selective institutions like Harvard, only 10      percent of the kids, only 10 percent of the students, come from the      bottom half of the income scale.  That's just--and going to Harvard or a      college like that is an important way that people pass along the status      to their kids.      CONAN:  Let's see if we can get one more caller in.  Ford--Ford's with us      from Trumansburg in New York, is that right?      FORD (Caller):  Yes, that's correct.      CONAN:  Go ahead, then.      FORD:  Hi.  I think that one of the things--one of the questions that      we're asking is kind of the wrong question.  My wife and I, when we      started, were off to a very good financial beginning and we got way ahead      of where our parents would have been, and then we re-evaluated our life      and realized that, you know, the pursuit of wealth was not--we kind of      slowed down our pace.  We have a very happy and very comfortable life.      We're going to stay in the middle class; I mean, we're not going to move      beyond that.  And we're not disturbed by that at all.      CONAN:  So the pursuit of wealth not equal to the pursuit of happiness.      FORD:  Yes.      CONAN:  OK.      FORD:  I think it's a valid question to say that with the rising standard      of living, is it necessary to have this increased wealth with a--when the      standard of living has raised anyway?      CONAN:  David?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, I think it's a very good point that money doesn't buy      happiness, but it does help, and it's one thing to make a choice that you      want to live a simpler lifestyle with less material goods because you've      opted not to do it, and it's another thing to be a welfare mom,      struggling to get by, and wishing you could move up and not being able      to.  So whether you choose to do it or whether you're forced to do it, it      seems to me, is a pretty big issue.      FORD:  OK.      CONAN:  Ford, thanks, and good luck.      FORD:  Well, thank you very much.      CONAN:  Appreciate the phone call.      FORD:  Thank you.  Bye-bye.      CONAN:  David Wessel, we appreciate your time today as well.  It's an      interesting series.      Mr. WESSEL:  Thank you.      CONAN:  David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street      Journal, one of the lead reporters on The Journal's series Moving Up:      Challenges to the American Dream.  And he was kind enough to join us here      in Studio 3A.      When we come back from our break, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore wants you      to fire up the stereo, press record-play and mix up your tapes.  If      you've ever made a mix tape, give us a phone call:  (800) 989-8255; (800)      989-TALK. E-mail us:  totn@npr. org.  Who did you make the tape for, and      what was the message?  Back after the break.  I'm Neal Conan.  It's TALK      OF THE NATION from NPR News.      (Announcements)      This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Neal Conan in Washington.      And here are the headlines from some of the stories NPR News is following      today.  The House Ethics Committee has finally agreed to meet, but      squabbling continues because Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay insists      on having his top aide run the committee staff, a move which Democrats      say violates panel rules.  And in Cape Town, President Thabo Mbeki has      fired his deputy after his involvement in a corruption scandal, which      throws open the question of who will be the next leader of South Africa.      You can hear details on those stories and much more later today on \"All      Things Considered\" from NPR news.      Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, NPR's ombudsman, Jeffrey Dvorkin, joins      us to answer your questions and take your complaints.  Who knows--maybe      even a compliment or two.  If you'd like to get your comment, question or      complaint in, send us an e-mail:  totn@npr. org.  And if you would, put      `Ombudsman' in the subject line.  But you can also join us tomorrow and      call in to talk about NPR's coverage and other issues involving public      broadcasting with ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin.       NEAL CONAN, host:       This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Neal Conan in Washington.       From Benjamin Franklin to Donald Trump, we've always believed in America      as the land of opportunity, a nation in which the children of      hard-working immigrants lift themselves into the middle-class and then      send their kids onto college and an even better life.  Last month, The      Wall Street Journal began a series called Moving Up, which concluded that      we are not quite as upwardly mobile as we thought.  After a reexamination      of data, many economists now say that people on the lowest economic rung      in the United States have a worse chance at climbing the social ladder      than their counterparts in western Europe and Canada.       But social mobility is a complex equation.  Our society as a hole is ever      more prosperous and the most economically dynamic group in the country,      recent immigrants, rarely are included in the calculations.  Even so,      these conclusions raise troubling issues.  It turns out that your      parents' status, even your grandparents', matters more than we once      thought, that we're less of a meritocracy than we'd like to believe.       Later in the program, mixed tapes, those homemade soundtracks--Do you      still make them?  Thurston Moore of the art rock group Sonic Youth does,      and he'll join us to say why.       But, first, economic mobility.  Are you better off than your parents?  Do      you expect your kids will have a better future than you?  If you've left      the economic class you were born into, how?  And did you move up or down?      Our number here in Washington is (800) 989-8255.  That's (800) 989-TALK.      E-mail us:  totn@npr. O-R-G.       And joining us now is David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for      The Wall Street Journal, one of the lead reporters on The Journal's      series Moving Up:  Challenges to the American Dream.  He's been nice      enough to join us here in Studio 3A.       Thanks very much for coming in.       Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street      Journal): You're welcome.       CONAN:  What does it mean if the economic escalator doesn't run as well      as we thought?       Mr. WESSEL:  It means that there's a difference between the myth of      mobility in America and the reality.  As you pointed out, Benjamin      Franklin stands for this great American story that anybody can come from      any class and become president of the United States or wealthy.  After      all, Franklin started out penniless, and was so rich that he could retire      to diplomacy and politics at age 42.  America still delivers that--on      that myth for many people, but it doesn't do it for as many people as we      used to think.  And I think that's interesting because it allows--it may      inform our politics.  It may explain why Americans have tolerated a      society that has become increasingly unequal over the last 35 years.       CONAN:  There's been a growing divide between the very rich and the very      poor, but most people thought, Americans thought, that was OK as long as      they thought they, too, has a chance at the brass ring.       Mr. WESSEL:  They, or their children, yes.       CONAN:  Yeah.  And that is less true than we thought?       Mr. WESSEL:  Yes.  It's important to say it's not getting in--from      what--my reading of the data, it's not getting worse.  That's not the      point of our series.  Our point is that it's not getting better, and      that's a problem at a time when the distance from the economic cellar to      the economic penthouse is rising.  And it requires some thought about      what are the escalators of social mobility, which ones do we want to do      something about, which ones do we have to accept as facts of life, and      which ones are operating in--so far in the background we don't even see      them?       CONAN:  And the one that I think makes a lot of Americans uncomfortable      is the legacy that we get from our parents.  Beyond whatever money we may      inherit, the idea that we're born into their--whatever group we're born      into, whatever group they were in when we were born, that's the group      that we're going to get the benefit or the lack of benefit from that.       Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  Sandy Jencks, who's a sociologist at Harvard,      pointed out to me that nobody is comfortable with a society in which the      only thing that matters is who your parents are.  We're not happy with a      kind of old caricature of Europe where you are permanently in the working      class or permanently in the royalty, but we're also not comfortable with      a society where it makes no difference, because, after all, we want      parents to spend time, energy, inspiration, even their money, on their      kids, and if we don't give them some incentive to do that, they won't do      it, so the question is: Where in the middle is the right balance?  I      don't know the answer to that. But that's the way I like to think of the      question.  How much are we willing to say it's OK if you do well because      your parents gave you a lot of stuff, and how much are--we want to say      that we want to try and make the game more fair so that if you happen to      be born to a single mom in a poor part of Philadelphia, or Los Angeles,      you, too, have a shot at going to a good college and getting a      middle-class job?       CONAN:  We're talking about American's economic escalator.  Our guest is      David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal.  If you'd like to join us, our      number is (800) 989-8255.  Our e-mail address:  totn@npr. O-R-G.  And      let's talk with Monica.  Monica's calling from Milford, Indiana.       MONICA (Caller):  Hi.       CONAN:  Hi.       MONICA:  Thanks for taking my call.       CONAN:  Sure.       MONICA:  My comment would be I think it does make a difference, actually      what kind of a background you lived in, whether it be lower class, middle      class, whatever.  My mother was divorced and--yeah, she was raising two      girls and she had no extras.  So now I'm married and we have four      children and my husband, on a good year, will make maybe $45,000.  But      I'm a stay-at-home mother, I have my own garden, I can all my own fruit,      we butcher our own beef, our own hogs.  I realize that there's people      that can't do that.  But I think it makes a difference how accepting we      are of the situation that we're in, and also how we manage what we do      have.  In fact, my husband is actually the one that taught me how to      manage, because he grew up in a very conservative home where the children      gave their money home to the parents when they worked away until they      were a certain age.  And it helped them to learn how to manage their      money correctly.  And we're really not wanting for anything.  We have a      new home in 2000 and we have a mortgage.  We have used vehicles.  No, we      will not go out and buy brand-new SUVs.  $3,000 vehicle that we cashed      off.  We don't need that prestige of having this $30,000 SUV.  And I      think that makes a big difference sometimes in how fast we can move up.      And I guess that would be my comment.       And my question would be:  Do you think that sometimes we don't make it      so much as this credit card--I get like six or seven credit card mailings      in the mail every day.  And I am just continuously running them through      the shredder and I wonder how many people actually take advantage of all      these and I think that's a detriment.  That's all.       CONAN:  Monica, before I let you go, let me ask you a question and we'll      get an answer to your question.  But do you expect your children to do      better than you're doing?       MONICA:  Well, you know what?  I think--How do I describe that?  You know      what?  I think I'm very happy where I'm at and if my children can reach      where I'm at right now, I would be satisfied with that.  And if they      choose to go further, then that would be up to them.       CONAN:  So as your question about credit cards indicates, you're not      talking strictly about monetary achievements?       All right.  David Wessel, let's get an answer to that question.       Mr. WESSEL:  There are two important things to remember.  One is that our      kids will probably do better than we do, on average, because America is a      growing country with a rising standard of living.  And that's one way to      think about the question.  The other is to think about how we divide the      slices of the pie of that prosperity and that's where the mobility issues      come in.  I think the caller's absolutely right to pick up on the      question of debt.  One of my colleagues, Bob Davis, did a story in our      series that looked just at that and observed that there are a lot of      people in America who want to have more stuff, more goods and services,      better trips and so forth than their parents did, don't have the income      to do it, but are able to an extraordinary degree in America today, to      borrow and to buy that stuff, and many of them do get into trouble and      there's--it's good reason to worry about it.  His piece was set in Utah      and the lead example was a guy whose name was Benjamin Franklin Baggett,      who was named by his father, who was an admirer for Benjamin Franklin,      and gave him all that stuff that Franklin talked about thrift, and then      promptly proceeded to ignore it all.       CONAN:  Yeah, that thrift part turns out to matter.  Monica, good luck.      Thanks very much for the call.       MONICA:  Thank you.       CONAN:  Appreciate it.  As we mentioned earlier, not long ago, most      economists believe the US was an economically mobile society.  Some began      to rethink that conventional wisdom.  To help us understand, we turn to      Gary Solon, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.  He's      with us by phone from his office in Ann Arbor.       Nice of you to be with us today.       Professor GARY SOLON (University of Michigan):  Well, thank you for      inviting me.       CONAN:  So, as I understand it, there are two basic long-running studies      that economists turn to for this information.  What did they get wrong?       Prof. SOLON:  Oh, well, where we went wrong, it was really both      economists and sociologists, was before we had access to these new better      data sets, until about 15 years ago, it was very, very difficult to get      any data on incomes of both generations from the same family.  So      researchers were sort of forced to work with whatever they could get and      what they could get wasn't very good. They were odd data sets with not      such good measurements of income and on--very unrepresentative samples,      and we've come to understand since then that the data deficiencies led      systematically to underestimation of how strong the link is between      parents' income and children's income.  And what helps us figure this out      was much better data sets.       One of those, as a Michigan prof, I'm proud to say, is a University of      Michigan survey called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which since      the late 1960s has been following a nationally--a national probability      sample of thousands of American families, and going back to them year      after year, and asking them, `Well, how much money did you make last      year? ' along with a battery of many other questions.  And in addition to      having pretty good income measures from this year after year on the same      folks, this survey has followed the kids from the original families as      they've grown up to become adults and formed their own households so that      for some years now there has been an intergenerational span to the data      set so that we're able to look at how strong is the relationship between      the kids' incomes and the incomes of their parents.       Around the same time, the late '60s, there was also another data set,      fairly similar, although different in certain respects, called the      National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience.  Interestingly,      it's partly operated by Ohio State so Michigan and Ohio State are      competing in the intergenerational data field as well as the football      field.  And so quite a bit of the research has been done with that data      set also.  And these data sets have given us a lot better information,      first, because they're working with nationally representative samples,      and, secondly, because their so-called longitudinal surveys, which go      back and collect the income information repeatedly over the years.  We      now have a much better handle on the longer run income of the people in      those surveys.       CONAN:  Well, hang with us, and we'll get to what that means when we get      to more of our calls from our listeners.  And the question, again, is:      Are you doing better than your parents did?  Do you expect your children      to do better than you did?  Is the engine, the economic escalator in      America, is it working for you and your family?  Has it stuttered?

(Soundbite of music)       CONAN:  This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Neal Conan in Washington.       We're talking about economic mobility in American society.  On new data,      economists have downgraded Horatio Alger's American Dream.  It turns out,      well, if you've read those books, you know this, too, the social ladder      has always been hard to climb.  What's your experience?  Are you better      or worse off than your parents?  If you're an immigrant or the child of      immigrants, have you made it to the ranks of the middle class?  What did      it take?  (800) 989-8255, (800) 989-TALK.  The e-mail address is      totn@npr. org.       Our guest in Studio 3A is David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief      for The Wall Street Journal, one of the lead reporters on The Journal      series Moving Up:  Challenges to the American Dream.  And still with us      is Gary Solon, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.      And let's get another caller on the line.  And this is Ken.  Ken's with      us from Owensboro, Kentucky.       KEN (Caller):  Yeah, I was listening to you.  It was interesting when he      mentioned legacy because when you posed the question--I--my--I'm a--much      better off now than my parents and I come from a divorced mama in the      '60s. She was a single parent before it became fashionable.  But the--I      think part of the issue is, too, when you look at family legacy, is I      started at the bottom rung of the ladder and was able to climb to the      top, shall we say, and since I'm so high, will my kids be better off than      me, I'm not sure that that's going to be all that easy for them.  I think      the legacy I left them is that I hope they at least break even, stay at      . . . (technical difficulties).       CONAN:  OK, Ken.  Again, your phone's breaking up so I'm going to let you      go but I think we got your point.  Appreciate the phone call.       KEN:  Sure.       CONAN:  Did you run across that in--as you talked to people around the      country, David?       Mr. WESSEL:  I think that there are two--as I said earlier, there's two      different ways to think about this.  One is:  Will our kids live better      than we do?  Depends a lot on what happens to the whole level of living      standards in the United States.  And there's always a surprising amount      of doubt in America about that but the evidence is, given what's happened      to productivity and wages over time, that our kids, on average, will live      better than other people, than we did.  It is, of course, true, that if      you're at the top, your kids have nowhere to go but down.  The facts are,      though, that not a lot of kids fall out of that top tier into the bottom.      Maybe Gary can shed some light on that, but I don't think there's--I      don't think that that's--there's not--there's surprisingly little of      that, as I look at the data.       CONAN:  They may not fall to the bottom, but, Gary Solon, do they fall to      the middle sometimes?       Mr. WESSEL:  Well. . .       Prof. SOLON:  Well, on average, though, they'll go somewhat in that      direction. As David's been reporting in this series of articles, one      thing, you know, that we academic researchers have been finding is that      the connection between parents' relative income status and kids' relative      income status when they grow up is stronger than we used to realize.  But      another thing we've looked at, which I think he was just referring to, is      whether there's any asymmetry in that.  That is, whether rags to riches      is more or less common than riches to rags.  And there seems to be some      indication in the data, not just in the United States but in some other      countries as well, that riches to rags is less common.  In a sense,      there's--in some way, a fairly well-developed safety net for the      offspring of the rich.  It's pretty unusual for them to fall a huge      amount.       CONAN:  Here's an e-mail question from Bradford in Portland, Oregon.      `Why does the US still have the reputation for its so-called American      Dream? Social and economic mobility is considerably easier in countries      that combine a market economy, as well as a robust social safety net.      Why have we allowed allegedly stagnant old European countries to outpace      us in these areas? '  Is that comparison to old Europe, if you will--Is      that accurate, Gary Solon?       Prof. SOLON:  Yeah, as we start to get good intergenerational income data      from other countries, one of the maybe surprising and maybe not so      surprising finding is that connection between the generations and      relative income status is relatively high in the United States compared      to many other developed countries.  Maybe that shouldn't be so surprising      because it's been apparent for a long time that there's relatively high      income inequality in the United States and these two things do tend to go      together.  But I think Bradford started off by asking why do we even have      this belief that this is a highly mobile society, relatively speaking.       And I think, Neal, you mentioned what's probably a reason for that, which      is immigration.  The statistical evidence we're talking about relating      income between generations is about families where the parents are      already in the United States.  And this in no way denies that when      somebody immigrates to America from a very poor country or they were poor      and are probably going to stay poor, they're doing it in the hope of      having a better economic level of living in the United States.  And in      many cases their hopes are realized to some extent for themselves and      probably often for their children also.  So I think the idea of America      as the land of opportunity is very tied up with the immigrants'      experience and, you know, that's a valid aspect of thinking of America as      the land of opportunity.       CONAN:  Well, Gary Solon, we're going to explore that with somebody else      in a moment, but thank you very much for being with us today.       Prof. SOLON:  Well, thank you very much.       CONAN:  Gary Solon, professor of economics at the University of Michigan.      And he joined us from his office in Ann Arbor.       Well, joining us now is Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic      Center. He's with us by phone from Ronald Reagan National Airport, right      across the river, in Virginia.       Nice of you to be with us today.       Mr. ROBERTO SURO (Director, Pew Hispanic Center):  Good to be with you.       CONAN:  And you're the group that has been measuring economic mobility      amongst immigrants but it's a difficult thing to measure.       Mr. SURO:  Yeah, because you have to measure it over time, and it takes a      while for any immigrant to catch up because of lack of familiarity with      the labor markets and lack of familiarity with the language and then      there are characteristics, particularly among Hispanic immigrants, that      land them at the bottom of the labor force, particularly their lack of      education.       CONAN:  Now, of course, you mentioned the largest and newest immigrants.      Many of them are Latinos.  What do we know about first generation success      compared to the second and so on?       Mr. SURO:  Well, the--we really only have two generations to look at in      the current wave of immigration that began in the 1970s and '80s.  The      third generation, the people who've traced their roots here as far back      as their grandparents or more really came before this big runup which      really has accelerated in the last 10 years.  And so we know that it can      often take 20 years for an immigrant to catch up to the level of      native-borns who have the same levels of education, for example.  And the      early returns are that the second generation does significantly better      than the first, but you would expect that because we're talking about      people who are born here.  They don't have immigration issues.  They      speak English as a native language and they're the products of US      schools.  But they don't do all that well.  At least in the early      returns, there's a wide spread, and there are a lot of second-generation      Latinos who are sort of on the front edge of a big cohort that's still      very young but the front edge is--there are a great many who are ending      up at the low end of the labor force.       CONAN:  And have not found ways for them or their children to move ahead.       Mr. SURO:  That's right.  I mean, which is not to say that there aren't a      lot of success stories, because there are.  And there are people who are      kind of ending up in the middle.  But it's--the US labor force is very      bifurcated now between people who've got a college education or more and      those who don't and it's very hard to jump from one side to the other of      that educational divide.       CONAN:  Thanks very much, Roberto.  Appreciate it.       Mr. SURO:  You're welcome; thank you.       CONAN:  Roberto Suro, have a good flight.       Mr. SURO:  Thank you very much.  Goodbye.       CONAN:  Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center, and he joined      us by phone from Ronald Reagan Airport in northern Virginia.       And, David Wessel, reading some of the stuff in your series, your do run      across the difficulty of trying to figure out what this huge group of      immigrants is doing in this country and how it would affect the economic      escalator, but you do see indictors, if you will, that the graduating      class of the University of California at Berkeley--half the students had      both parents born somewhere else.       Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  I think we do know a few things and we don't know a      lot of things.  One thing we know is that millions of immigrants prefer      the United States to their home country and it looks like, despite all      that we've been through, 9/11, the war in Iraq, and everything, that an      awful lot of immigrants, if they had a choice, would come here rather      than go to some other country.  So that tells you--and they're--these      immigrants are very much in touch with their relatives and friends who      have come already, so they may expect the streets to be paved with gold      and not find them, but they choose to come here, and that tells us      something about our society.       Then the second question is the one that Roberto was talking about is:      So is their experience here as Americans similar to the experience of      people who were born in this country like I was?  And there, because it      takes so long to get a good set of numbers that shows parents and      children, even grandparents and grandchildren, it's really hard to tell,      and it clearly, clearly differs by ethnic group.  We have lots of      evidence of how successful some Asians are in the US but you wouldn't      want to generalize to that--for all immigrants who come to the United      States, so it's--we all have this intuitive sense that there are a lot of      immigrants climbing the ladder.  We all have this intuitive sense that      there are a lot of immigrants, particularly those who don't speak      English, or who have darker skins, that are not somehow able to find the      escalator, and we're trying to figure out which one is the predominant      story.       CONAN:  Let's get another caller on the line.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff's      calling from Detroit.       JEFF (Caller):  Yes, hi.  Well, I just wanted to add some comments      regarding what you guys have been saying.  I'm French here.  I moved to      Detroit.  I've been here for five months.  I got my engineering degree in      France, and I've always been a very conservative French person, always      wanted to stay there, never leave the country.  But at some point with my      degree I had a very hard time finding an interesting job in France, and,      you know, by pure coincidence, I just applied for the US and I got a job      extremely rapidly.  And I just noticed to which extent this country's      extremely dynamic with a very dynamic market with a very motivated work      force.  And I have reached a position that I never would have dreamed of      back in France, even though France remains a very developed country.       CONAN:  In five months, in this country.       JEFF:  Indeed.  Well, I applied to my employer here five months--I moved      after I was hired, but I got an extreme--an excellent position I would      have gotten with 15 years of experience in France.       CONAN:  And you sound young enough, Jeff, that you don't necessarily have      to worry that if you lose your job, you might not have health insurance      coverage or much unemployment insurance.       JEFF:  Well, the thing is, I'm not really worrying about it, maybe      because I'm young, too.  I just got into the work force.  But no, I'm not      really worried about it.  I mean, this country--just seeing the amounts      of opportunities, losing my job here isn't really worrying me, for I'm      always thinking I can always find something just as easily, maybe.  Or      maybe it was a lucky shot, but I just wanted to add that this country is      really extraordinary regarding its market, its--the way people are      desperately searching for talent.       CONAN:  Well, there's a Benjamin Franklin for you.       Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  And I think that one of the things we know is that,      for all the problems of the US economy today, two things stand out.  One      is the dynamism that he refers to.  I mean, like it or not, we're      dynamic.  Sometimes you're on the losing end of the dynamic.  And the      other thing is that having skills and education in the US is a real      necessity; that immigrants who come here and who don't speak English and      don't have much education are competing with lots of other people like      them and a lot of native-born Americans for jobs that simply don't pay      very well.  And there's a lot more people there than there are jobs.  But      at the top end, the kind of engineerlike--the French fellow who just      phoned in. . .       CONAN:  Jeff.  Yeah.       Mr. WESSEL:  . . . Jeff--there's still an enormous demand--despite all the      stories about outsourcing to India and China and all that--there's still      an an enormous demand for these skilled workers.       CONAN:  Jeff, bonne chance.  Appreciate the phone call.  Thanks very      much.       JEFF:  Thank you.  Thank you.       CONAN:  We're talking with David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal about      his series Moving Up:  Challenges to the American Dream.  You're      listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.       And here's an e-mail from Kieran Dooley in Cleveland:  `I'm still      middle-class, like my parents; however, middle-class has improved from a      generation ago.  So class inflation exists.  My middle-class parents      would never have expected to travel so much and have multiple cars and      retire healthy and comfortable, as I do.  Those expectations were      reserved for the wealthy 50 years ago.  What do you think about the idea      of class inflation? '       Mr. WESSEL:  I think it's absolutely true that the standard of living in      the United States today, in 2005, is much better than it was in 1955, and      for most people, much better than it was in 1975.  If you live at the      middle of the middle class, particularly beginning about the mid-'90s,      things really started to get better.  And there's no arguing that.      There--it's clear that there was, during the '70s and '80s, some kind of      stalling in that progress as productivity growth slowed, as more people      had to have two spouses in the work force to have the kind of lifestyle      that one of their parents managed to deliver.  But when you think about      health care and air quality and the devices that we have and the trips we      can take and the deregulation of airlines allowing us to fly to      Disneyland, which didn't even exist in 1950, there's no denying that.       But that doesn't--that's not--that's one question and that's one answer.      That doesn't tell you that the game is being played fairly and that black      kids growing up in inner-city Detroit have the same chances for success      as upper-middle-class white kids in Bethesda, Maryland.  And it's      important to ask both questions, not just one of them.       CONAN:  And you mentioned race; education, obviously, is another factor.      And the other predictor is what your parents made and. . .       Mr. WESSEL:  Right.       CONAN:  . . . how they did.       Mr. WESSEL:  How much money they had, whether--if they went to college,      you're much more likely to go to college.  And Larry Summers, the      president of Harvard, is giving a lot of speeches about this, and one of      the points he makes--that at selective institutions like Harvard, only 10      percent of the kids, only 10 percent of the students, come from the      bottom half of the income scale.  That's just--and going to Harvard or a      college like that is an important way that people pass along the status      to their kids.       CONAN:  Let's see if we can get one more caller in.  Ford--Ford's with us      from Trumansburg in New York, is that right?       FORD (Caller):  Yes, that's correct.       CONAN:  Go ahead, then.       FORD:  Hi.  I think that one of the things--one of the questions that      we're asking is kind of the wrong question.  My wife and I, when we      started, were off to a very good financial beginning and we got way ahead      of where our parents would have been, and then we re-evaluated our life      and realized that, you know, the pursuit of wealth was not--we kind of      slowed down our pace.  We have a very happy and very comfortable life.      We're going to stay in the middle class; I mean, we're not going to move      beyond that.  And we're not disturbed by that at all.       CONAN:  So the pursuit of wealth not equal to the pursuit of happiness.       FORD:  Yes.       CONAN:  OK.       FORD:  I think it's a valid question to say that with the rising standard      of living, is it necessary to have this increased wealth with a--when the      standard of living has raised anyway?       CONAN:  David?       Mr. WESSEL:  Well, I think it's a very good point that money doesn't buy      happiness, but it does help, and it's one thing to make a choice that you      want to live a simpler lifestyle with less material goods because you've      opted not to do it, and it's another thing to be a welfare mom,      struggling to get by, and wishing you could move up and not being able      to.  So whether you choose to do it or whether you're forced to do it, it      seems to me, is a pretty big issue.       FORD:  OK.       CONAN:  Ford, thanks, and good luck.       FORD:  Well, thank you very much.       CONAN:  Appreciate the phone call.       FORD:  Thank you.  Bye-bye.       CONAN:  David Wessel, we appreciate your time today as well.  It's an      interesting series.       Mr. WESSEL:  Thank you.       CONAN:  David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street      Journal, one of the lead reporters on The Journal's series Moving Up:      Challenges to the American Dream.  And he was kind enough to join us here      in Studio 3A.       When we come back from our break, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore wants you      to fire up the stereo, press record-play and mix up your tapes.  If      you've ever made a mix tape, give us a phone call:  (800) 989-8255; (800)      989-TALK. E-mail us:  totn@npr. org.  Who did you make the tape for, and      what was the message?  Back after the break.  I'm Neal Conan.  It's TALK      OF THE NATION from NPR News.       (Announcements)       This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Neal Conan in Washington.       And here are the headlines from some of the stories NPR News is following      today.  The House Ethics Committee has finally agreed to meet, but      squabbling continues because Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay insists      on having his top aide run the committee staff, a move which Democrats      say violates panel rules.  And in Cape Town, President Thabo Mbeki has      fired his deputy after his involvement in a corruption scandal, which      throws open the question of who will be the next leader of South Africa.      You can hear details on those stories and much more later today on \"All      Things Considered\" from NPR news.       Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, NPR's ombudsman, Jeffrey Dvorkin, joins      us to answer your questions and take your complaints.  Who knows--maybe      even a compliment or two.  If you'd like to get your comment, question or      complaint in, send us an e-mail:  totn@npr. org.  And if you would, put      `Ombudsman' in the subject line.  But you can also join us tomorrow and      call in to talk about NPR's coverage and other issues involving public      broadcasting with ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Mixed news on the US economy today from two government reports.      Wholesale prices dropped a lot in May, the most in two years, but store      sales have sagged, their sharpest fall in a year.  \"Marketplace's\" John      Dimsdale joins us from Washington.      John, what are the details here?      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      first, producer prices--what factories and shops pay for commodities and      goods and services before they sell things to consumers; it's also known      as wholesale prices--they dropped six-tenths of a percent, and that's a      lot more than the two-tenths drop that the experts had been predicting.      Oil prices dropped dramatically in May, and that's the main reason.  If      you take out the volatile factors of food and fuel, wholesale prices      dropped a much less radical one-tenth of a percent.      Now in retail sales, their drop was largely due to cutbacks in car and      clothing purchases.  You take out autos and the drop was only two-tenths      of a percent.      Another thing that takes the sting out of the sales decline today was a      separate report on more recent activity at big chain stores.  In the      first week of June, there was a hefty increase thanks largely to a spurt      in summer clothes and air conditioner sales.  You go outside in      Washington today and you'll instantly understand the sudden demand for      that.      CHADWICK:  Well, so you have a report that clothing sales are down and      clothing sales are up.  How does one interpret this information?      DIMSDALE:  Well, the glass is half full.  I mean, that was more recent      June sales.  May--the clothing sales sagged in May, but they looked      better in June. I guess that was the signal from the economy.  You know,      consumer spending is two-thirds of the US economy, so a drop in store      activity is always a sobering thing.  It could give the Fed pause about      raising short-term interest rates too high since that's a brake on the      economy.  That other report, producer prices going down, that indicates      no inflation, which should give the Fed room to slow down raising rates.      Still, many observers, including economist Gary Shilling of Shilling &      Company, expect the Fed to continue gradually increasing rates at the      next meeting at the end of June.  He says short-term rates are still      historically low.      Mr. GARY SHILLING (Shilling & Company):  They also want to have rates      high enough that whenever the economy weakens next, and it will sooner or      later, that they've got room to cut.  And they still worry that there      could be deflation out there and they want to be able to cut      substantially.  So I think they have two reasons to keep going.      CHADWICK:  John, what about new jobs?      DIMSDALE:  Well, there was this morning a survey of 16,000 employers--it      came out from Manpower Incorporated--and they find that businesses have      plans to increase the work force.  Thirty-one percent of employers expect      to increase their hiring in the third quarter of the year, and that's      really good news for construction jobs, the best in 25 years according to      the CEO of Manpower. Also good news for transportation, public utilities      and education.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we're going to take a look at one      of Iraq's other front lines, the country's hospital system.      CHADWICK:  Thank you, John.

I'm Farai Chideya.  Ed Gordon is      away.      Teens will have a tough time finding work this summer, so says a recent      report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University.      Last year, the teens with jobs hit its lowest point in more than 50      years.  A sluggish economy is just one factor.  NPR's Allison Keyes has      more.      ALLISON KEYES reporting:      Eighteen-year-old Chicagoan Nakia Carter(ph) says she and her friends      have spent several months pounding the pavement looking for a job.  But      she hasn't had much luck.      Ms. NAKIA CARTER:  I mean, because of the lack of experience, and also      because I still haven't graduated from high school, you know.  A lot of      employers aren't hiring for me right now.      KEYES:  Carter, an African-American high school senior, says she's tried      just about everything to catch the attention of a potential employer.      Ms.  CARTER:  I've gone based upon things like different help-wanted ads      in the Chicago Reader.  I've also put myself on the Illinois Skills Match      Web site where you can put your skills that you have in the computer and      they will match you to different employers that are hiring.  I've just      put on a suit and gone out to different places and asked if they were      hiring.  I've also gone to the mall early in the morning and just went      through every store, basically, asked them if they were hiring, if I can      have an application.  If they're not hiring, can I still have an      application to fill out?      KEYES:  Carter thinks companies are choosing to hire college students      home from the summer instead of high school-aged young people.  But      Teens4Hire founder Renee Ward says the problem is more complicated.  The      California-based Web site now matches teens looking for jobs with      potential employers.  Ward says the trend of young people being closed      out of the job market began back in 2001.  There were several      contributing factors, including a sluggish economy, accounting scandals      at huge companies, and, she says, the terror attacks on September 11.      Ms.  RENEE WARD (Teens4Hire Founder):  There were tons and tons of      layoffs, and lots of adults who could not find opportunities.  In      addition, you had a growing labor market in terms of age so you have many      more retirees or potential retirees who needed additional income that are      going back into or continuing to stay in the labor market.      KEYES:  Also, Ward says, employers often choose to hire older workers      over teen applicants.      Ms. WARD:  That's what some of the employers say to us is that, `You know      what?  Given the opportunity that we have an influx of other quality      talent in the marketplace, we want the best person for the job. '  And in      reality that might be that older, more experienced person that they don't      have to train, in terms of customer service skills and things of that      nature.      KEYES:  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national      unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds last month was 17. 9 percent,      the same as it was in May 2003.  For white teens, the rate last month was      15. 9 percent.  The rate for Hispanics was 19. 9 percent.  And for      African-Americans it was 36. 6 percent.  Ward thinks the racial disparity      may be partly because teens of color may not have access to the same      networking avenues through employee referral programs as other young      people.  And she questions whether discrimination may be a factor, but,      she says, the Web site study shows that teens that have trouble getting a      job now often have the same problem later in life.  Nakia Carter worries      about the same thing.      Ms. CARTER:  I think me not be able to work now and not having a lot of      skills in different areas will affect me getting a job in the future      because a lot of places are based upon skill and based upon experience.      KEYES:  Plus, there's a practical issue.      Ms. CARTER:  And especially it's hard for us, you know, high school      seniors because we're going off to college in the fall.  So we would like      to go off to college with some money.      KEYES:  Ward urges teens who cannot find a job to try creating their own      businesses, like deejaying, party planning or lawn mowing to make some      money. She also suggests that volunteering is a good alternative because      such activities look good on job and college applications.  Allison      Keyes, NPR News.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Some unusually good news on the trade deficit in the month of May.  More      on that in a moment.  First, other business news with \"Marketplace's\"      Tess Vigeland.      Tess, there's a sentence today for the former WorldCom chief executive      officer, Bernie Ebbers, in his trial.  What did he get, and when is he      going to prison?      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Well, this is quite extraordinary, Alex.  The judge today sentenced      Bernie Ebbers to 25 years in prison, though prosecutors had actually      asked for 85 years.  And, of course, this is a culmination of three years      of scandal that started with the $11 billion accounting fraud at      WorldCom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history.  Ebbers      is 63, so 25 years is potentially a life sentence for him, and he's been      ordered to report by October 12th.  The judge said that she will      recommend that he serve the time at a prison near his home in      Mississippi.      CHADWICK:  Twenty-five years still a long time.      VIGELAND:  Mm-hmm.      CHADWICK:  All right.  Back to the trade deficit.  What kind of      improvement did we see in May?      VIGELAND:  Well, according to numbers out from the Commerce Department      today, the trade deficit narrowed or fell by 2. 7 percent to just over $55      billion. Now economist Diane Swonk says this doesn't mean the deficit is      going to clear anytime soon for sure, but at least in terms of the      overall economy, it's not as much of a drag as it once was.      Ms. DIANE SWONK (Economist):  It's important to at least see, in general,      if you look over the last six months, the trend at least stabilizing, the      situation not getting markedly worse or getting as worse as it was as      rapidly in 2004.  It's kind of sad when the best you can hope for is to      slow down the deterioration.      VIGELAND:  And the best sign of that is that despite this improvement in      May, the trade deficit for the year so far is running 10 percent higher      than last year's, and last year's set a record.      CHADWICK:  How much of a role is oil playing in these numbers?      VIGELAND:  A pretty big role.  Oil prices actually went down in May,      almost 7 percent, but since then, they've skyrocketed again above $60 a      barrel.  So the May improvement is not going to carry through to the June      numbers.  But Swonk points to another factor that may be more lasting,      and that's the value of the dollar.      Ms. SWONK:  We've seen some--particularly some improvement in exports,      even though we have sort of an insatiable demand for imports in this      country, and that's really the effect of the dollar weakening over a year      ago.  It takes almost a year or two years for earlier dollar weakness to      show up in the form of better trade numbers.      VIGELAND:  And again, that dollar weakness was quite consistent over the      last year or so, so that will continue to reflect in future trade      numbers.      And, Alex, today on \"Marketplace,\" we will have more on today's      sentencing of former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers.      CHADWICK:  We'll listen for that.

Now economist Diane Swonk says this doesn't mean the deficit is      going to clear anytime soon for sure, but at least in terms of the      overall economy, it's not as much of a drag as it once was.       Ms. DIANE SWONK (Economist):  It's important to at least see, in general,      if you look over the last six months, the trend at least stabilizing, the      situation not getting markedly worse or getting as worse as it was as      rapidly in 2004.  It's kind of sad when the best you can hope for is to      slow down the deterioration.       VIGELAND:  And the best sign of that is that despite this improvement in      May, the trade deficit for the year so far is running 10 percent higher      than last year's, and last year's set a record.       CHADWICK:  How much of a role is oil playing in these numbers?       VIGELAND:  A pretty big role.  Oil prices actually went down in May,      almost 7 percent, but since then, they've skyrocketed again above $60 a      barrel.  So the May improvement is not going to carry through to the June      numbers.  But Swonk points to another factor that may be more lasting,      and that's the value of the dollar.       Ms. SWONK:  We've seen some--particularly some improvement in exports,      even though we have sort of an insatiable demand for imports in this      country, and that's really the effect of the dollar weakening over a year      ago.  It takes almost a year or two years for earlier dollar weakness to      show up in the form of better trade numbers.       VIGELAND:  And again, that dollar weakness was quite consistent over the      last year or so, so that will continue to reflect in future trade      numbers.       And, Alex, today on \"Marketplace,\" we will have more on today's      sentencing of former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers.       CHADWICK:  We'll listen for that.

We asked our two pollsters, Democrat Stan Greenberg and      Republican Glen Bolger, to examine how likely voters perceive the economy      and how those perceptions may affect the party's fortunes at the ballot      box 15 months from now.  NPR national political correspondent Mara      Liasson reports.      MARA LIASSON reporting:      The survey that Greenberg and Bolger did for MORNING EDITION shows that      likely voters are quite unhappy with the economy.  Only 43 percent of our      respondents approved of the way President Bush was handling the economy;      53 percent disapproved.  And after listening to a list of positive and      negative indicators, such as record home ownership, low inflation, low      unemployment but also high gas prices, rising health-care costs and three      million lost manufacturing jobs, 53 percent said the negative indicators      told a more accurate story about the economy.  Only 39 percent chose the      positive view. But then, says Republican pollster Glen Bolger, they asked      another question.      Mr. GLEN BOLGER (Republican Pollster):  Then we asked, `How about your      economic situation? ' and the numbers virtually flipped:  51 percent said,      oh, it's positive, 41 percent said that it's negative.  And that's      strange because people are saying, `You know, I'm in pretty good shape      but clearly the rest of the country is not. '  When you look at the      economic data, the facts, the arguments, well, the country is in pretty      good shape, but the perception is not there and that's clearly not      helping the president.      LIASSON:  Marti Cooper(ph), a homemaker from Alameda, California, is a      case in point.      Ms. MARTI COOPER:  Right now I think the economy is not as strong as it      could be.  I do look at the gas prices.  I do look at the number of      people I know that are either out of work or working multiple jobs to      maintain, you know, a level of income.      LIASSON:  But ask Cooper how the economy is affecting her own family and      you get a different story.      Ms. COOPER:  I'm fortunate in that my personal situation is good.      LIASSON:  Cooper is a registered Republican, but she voted for John Kerry      for president in 2004.  Could she be persuaded to vote Democratic for      Congress in 2006?   The Democratic half of our polling team, Stan      Greenberg, certainly hopes so.      Mr. STAN GREENBERG (Democratic Pollster):  The economy is a powerful      issue in any election.  We have at this point, you know, a year and a      half before the election.  We have a situation where people think the      economy's not going well, so if the election is about the economy, if      voters are able to express their feelings about their living standards,      about what's happening with prices, particularly for health care, their      worries about gas prices--if there is an election where they're able to      express those worries, it's one in which the Republicans go into it with      a considerable disadvantage.      LIASSON:  But that's a big if.  In the last two election cycles,      Democrats were not able to turn voters' concerns about the economy to      their advantage. One reason may be voters like Louis Jackson(ph), a      retiree from Calimesa, California.  He says he knows who's at fault for a      weak economy.      Mr. LOUIS JACKSON:  I blame the president's policies.  For example,      when--we were looking at a $5 trillion surplus when Clinton left office      and now we're looking at a $5 trillion deficit.  That's an obligation      that the country has to assume at some point.      LIASSON:  Sounds like a potential Democratic voter for 2006, but Jackson      plans to cast his ballot for his incumbent congressman, Republican Jerry      Lewis.      Mr. JACKSON:  I would vote for him, but other than that, I'd like to see      a Democratic control of Congress.      LIASSON:  Then there's Richard Paytrick(ph), a truck driver from      Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who thinks the economy is in poor shape.  Health      care and gas prices and good jobs are his top issues, and he says he      doesn't like to see college graduates working at McDonald's, but the      Democratic Party hasn't won him over.      Mr. RICHARD PAYTRICK:  You know, I'm a union member.  I go to union      meetings, and my particular union is very pro-Democrat, so I have a hard      time going to these union meetings because they bring in candidates and      they all seem so full of it, you know, I can't sit and listen to them.      They're trying to contradict their Republican candidate instead of      telling us what they're going to do.      LIASSON:  When our pollsters asked voters to rate their feelings on a      thermometer, with 1 meaning completely cold and unfavorable and with 100      meaning the warmest and most favorable, the Democratic Party scored      slightly lower than the Republicans and several points lower than      President Bush.  Stan Greenberg.      Mr. GREENBERG:  The fact is the Democrats are viewed less favorably than      the Republicans right now at a time when Republicans aren't very popular      and the president's not very popular.  And the economic battle here which      we wage in this survey and which I believe comes out to the advantage of      the Democrats is all theoretical.  It's waiting for the party and leaders      to take up the challenge.  There's a big opportunity for the Democrats.      They have not yet engaged on the economy.      LIASSON:  There is good news for Democrats in the survey.  By 47 to 40      percent, respondents said they would choose the Democrat for Congress      over the Republican.  But still, Democrats will have to come up with a      compelling message on the economy and find a way to keep it the focus of      the next campaign.  In the last two elections, the president and the GOP      have been skillful at making the debate about national security and      terrorism.  Will that happen again?  Greenberg thinks enough time has      passed since 9/11 to make the Republicans' task more difficult.      Mr. GREENBERG:  I'm sure the president will try, but I question whether      security alone will be able to drive these economic worries away.      LIASSON:  Glen Bolger.      Mr. BOLGER:  Well, keep in mind, for example, the Patriot Act is up for      renewal, and I think that helps put security issues back on the      forefront, and we know how uncomfortable the Democratic Party is with      that and with the Patriot Act, and yet we also know how strongly the      public supports the Patriot Act overall.  So, you know, that's a debate      that's going to accrue to Republicans' favor on security issues.      LIASSON:  For now, Democrats can hope the economy rises as a source of      public dissatisfaction, but as last week's bombings in London showed      again, events can change the mix of voters' emotions overnight.

The US insisted that China make the move, while      China said it would do so on its own schedule.  Well, China relented,      announcing a 2 percent increase in the value of the currency unit, the      yuan.  As NPR's Adam Davidson reports, the significance of China's move      is still being debated.      ADAM DAVIDSON reporting:      When talking about China, Treasury Secretary John Snow is usually      cautious.  A couple months ago, though, he said something that carried      with it an implied threat.      Secretary JOHN SNOW (Treasury Department):  And I'm confident that our      Congress seeing China move in the right direction here will be important      in warding off wrong-headed protectionist policies.      DAVIDSON:  With those words, the US Treasury secretary put the Chinese      government on notice they better revalue their currency soon, because      there's no telling what Congress might do.  Indeed, Congress was      threatening severe tariffs on all Chinese goods if the currency's value      wasn't changed.  Tim Ryan is an Ohio representative.      Representative TIM RYAN (Democrat, Ohio):  There was a real      good-cop-bad-cop scenario going on dealing with the Chinese on this one.      The administration kept pointing to the rabid dogs in Congress and      saying, you know, `Let us nibble at your ankle here, unless they're going      to come after you and bite off your leg. '      DAVIDSON:  This distance between a conciliatory administration and angry      Congress reflected real difference between US economic players.  Labor      unions and smaller domestic manufacturers have been the most vocal in      demanding that China revalue its currency.  They say China has unfairly      kept the yuan low so that Chinese companies can sell their products more      cheaply.  On the other side, retailers like Wal-Mart and US-based      multinational companies benefit from the old currency regime, and so      they've wanted the US to go easy on China. And then there's the Chinese      government itself.      Jason Kindopp is China analyst for the Eurasia Group.  He says some      Chinese officials were afraid that the US Congress would hurt business,      so they wanted to revalue.  Others fought against it.  So in both the US      and China, there are powerful forces for and against a revaluation.  And,      Kindopp says, yesterday's move gave everyone a little something.      Mr. JASON KINDOPP (China Analyst, Eurasia Group):  It's a very clever      move by Beijing.  What this does is it allows all of these actors to      declare victory.      DAVIDSON:  China did revalue the yuan, but only by 2 percent, far less      than the 10 to 40 percent many in Congress wanted.  Kindopp says such a      small move will make little economic difference, but it's a huge      political event. Congress can say China finally listened.  The      administration can declare a reasonable compromise.      The new system that China announced yesterday would allow the country's      central bank to revalue the currency every day if it wants to.  But the      bank is just as free not to make any more moves at all.  Congressman Ryan      calls China's new system brilliant.  He says they figured out a way to      appear to have responded to Congress' concerns without actually having to      do anything at all.      Rep. RYAN:  It looks like the Chinese have won, and they've deflated the      argument of Congress, at least in the short term.      DAVIDSON:  Ryan says the Chinese have only bought themselves a few      months' time.  If the currency doesn't move a lot more by the fall, he's      sure Congress will start applying pressure again.  Adam Davidson, NPR      News.

RYAN:  It looks like the Chinese have won, and they've deflated the      argument of Congress, at least in the short term.       DAVIDSON:  Ryan says the Chinese have only bought themselves a few      months' time.  If the currency doesn't move a lot more by the fall, he's      sure Congress will start applying pressure again.  Adam Davidson, NPR      News.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Coming up, what a new movie about a really dirty joke reveals about the      behind-the-scenes business of being funny.      First, though, a look at another kind of business, one that's succeeding      against all odds.      (Soundbite of machinery)      BRAND:  At a factory in Maysville, Kentucky, workers are manufacturing an      everyday product:  wire baskets for bicycles; an everyday product, but      still unusual because these days almost every part of every bicycle sold      in America is made in China.  So how is this little company in the Ohio      River Valley competing?  Well, NPR's Noah Adams traveled to Maysville to      find out how, and he joins us now.      So, Noah, how does it work?      NOAH ADAMS reporting:      Well, here's the deal.  This is company, Madeleine, called Wald, W-A-L-D.      The president's name is Ralph Pawsat.  He's a serious guy, a      conservative company. This is their 100th year in business.  He has this      operating credo; it's two items.      Mr. RALPH PAWSAT (President, Wald):  Number one is quality and number two      is customer service, and just repeat that three times.      ADAMS:  And as you can hear, Madeleine, he's serious about this.  The      Wald name is important to him.  They do not advertise.  And these are      mostly 20-dollar retail bike baskets.  And you go in some places, you can      see them stacked up to the ceiling, white and black and silver.      BRAND:  So, Noah, this sounds all very old-fashioned.  Is it, indeed, a      family owned business?      ADAMS:  A family owned, 1905, Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  Imagine this:  Ewald      Pawsat and his brother, Herman(ph)--they came as young men from Germany,      started a bike repair shop, started making products.  To get the      company's name, they dropped the E from Ewald, hence Wald.  In 1924, they      had a fire in the shop and they decided to move closer to the bike      manufacturers.  They got on a train, and here's how Ralph Pawsat, who's      Ewald's grandson, tells it.      Mr. R. PAWSAT:  When they got to Maysville, they just got off here and      decided, `This is good.  We got river transportation, rail      transportation. ' And then, you know, if you asked them anything further,      they always started talking in German.  You never could understand them      good.  So. . .      (Soundbite of machinery)      ADAMS:  Madeleine, let's go out to where they make the stuff.  Most      things here make noise.  It's just a huge machine shop and grand scale,      big machines. I love the sounds these things make.  And I talked with      another Pawsat--this is Keith Pawsat; he's a vice president--in front of      a ribbon press.      Mr. KEITH PAWSAT (Vice President, Wald):  This is what we call an      automatic feed press.  You have a coil of steel that comes in, it's put      in a coil cradle and then automatically fed into the press.      ADAMS:  This is just a ribbon of steel.  It's about how wide, an inch and      half wide?      Mr. K. PAWSAT:  It's about an inch and a half, yes.      ADAMS:  OK.  And it's just being uncoiled and running--and run through      the machine.      Mr. K. PAWSAT:  That's correct.  This is for an important automotive      part. It's called a bolt retainer assembly.  It goes in all the GM truck      steering columns.      (Soundbite of machinery)      Mr. K. PAWSAT:  We manufacture about three million a year.      BRAND:  Noah, did I hear the correctly, he's talking about parts for      General Motors' trucks?  What about the bike basket?      ADAMS:  Well, this is the way they survive the challenge of China.  They      have to adapt.  Ten years ago, they made only bike parts.  Sixty percent      of their work now is for automotive, appliance companies, parts for      conveyor belt companies.  Wald has 120 employees now.  Back in the      American bicycle boom years, 300 people worked here working to build      parts for Huffy, Roadmaster, Schwinn.  Ten million bikes a year were made      in this country; almost all of them had parts from this plant.  And then      the bike business went offshore, as they say, and Wald's business goes      down.  Now they're making replacement parts:  fenders, chain guards,      training wheels, kickstands, seat posts and the baskets.      BRAND:  So they're still selling the baskets.  How many do they sell?      ADAMS:  Well, Mr. Ralph Pawsat said that one the advantage of being a      private family company is that nobody gets to know your family business.      But they did say 250,000 bike baskets every year; 25 models, including      number 133.      Ms. EVA WHITE(ph) (Wald Employee):  The basket right here is the      best-seller.      ADAMS:  This is Eva White, and she's showing me this model.  It goes on      the front.  And it's got a handle, so you lift it off.  And when you go      into the grocery store or into work, you can take it inside.      Ms. WHITE:  I bought two or three of these, I have, for different kids in      town.      ADAMS:  How many of these will you see a year here?      Ms. WHITE:  Oh, my gosh.  A hundred thousand?      BRAND:  So, Noah, this is sort of a nice and rare opportunity to actually      meet people who make things that we use.      ADAMS:  Yeah, it was great to go there.  My wife's bike has a Wald basket      on the front, and it's hard to find anything more absolutely useful than      a bike basket these days.  And it's good to meet the workers.  Wald has a      lot of longtime employees.  Eva White we just heard; she's been there 16      years.  I talked to a man who's been there 44 and a half years; the      longest is 50 years. And, Madeleine, there's one more reason why Wald      competes so well with China.      BRAND:  And what's that?      ADAMS:  Well, wire baskets are hard to ship.  You can't really stack too      many inside each other; they bend out of shape.  So if you filled up one      of those cargo containers in China, you'd be paying to ship mostly air.      BRAND:  Hmm.  NPR's Noah Adams.  Thank you, Noah, for our visit to the      Wald company there in Kentucky.      ADAMS:  You're welcome, Madeleine.

I'm Renee Montagne.      Just after midnight last night, the House of Representatives passed the      Central American Free Trade Agreement.  Republicans prevailed, just      barely, 217-to-215.  President Bush and Vice President Cheney trekked to      Capitol Hill yesterday to give House Republicans the hard sell on CAFTA.      Still, many Republicans broke ranks to join the opposition.  Here's NPR's      Andrea Seabrook.      ANDREA SEABROOK reporting:      They came out fighting.  The top Republican on the Ways and Means      Committee Bill Thomas of California and the top Democrat Charlie Rangel      of New York came out of their corners with bitter words.  Thomas,      representing Republican leaders, said the argument that CAFTA could      weaken labor laws and could push more children to work is arrogant.      Representative BILL THOMAS (Republican, California):  The argument that      somehow these people down there don't love their children any more than      we do is in fact shameful.  It's disrespectful and it's arrogant.      SEABROOK:  Rangel, representing Democratic leaders, had a sarcastic      retort.      Representative CHARLIE RANGEL (Democrat, New York):  This attack against      arrogance has moved my heart.  And this conversation with the immigrants      and the newcomers to find out what should be in the trade bill, it      certainly would have worked out a heck of a lot better if he had talked      with some of the Democrats in the House.      SEABROOK:  But immediately following these sour opening notes, each side      called a succession of speakers from the other's party, members of      Congress who crossed the aisle to argue for or against CAFTA.  The      Central American Free Trade Agreement would tear down remaining trade      barriers between the US, the Dominican Republic and five Central American      countries.  Under an existing agreement, about 80 percent of Central      American goods imported to the US are already tariff-free.  The main      trade effect of CAFTA would be to open Central American markets to      US-made goods and services.  That's why many Republicans and some      Democrats, like Henry Cuellar of Texas, said it's a good deal.      Representative HENRY CUELLAR (Democrat, Texas):  CAFTA will also create      a--tremendous job opportunities for the 13,000 American small businesses      that are currently already exporting to those Central American countries.      The economic opportunities created will bring new jobs and the      possibility of a middle-class life to millions of Central Americans who      are currently living in poverty.      SEABROOK:  Cuellar and other CAFTA supporters argued that by improving      the economies of these nations and creating jobs, fewer Central Americans      will come north to the US to find ways to feed their families.  But at      what price to the United States economy? asked opponents of the trade      pact.  Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs have relocated      overseas in recent years.  Many Democrats and some Republicans, like      Howard Coble of North Carolina, worry CAFTA will cut that wound deeper.      Representative HOWARD COBLE (Republican, North Carolina):  I told      President Bush that my late mom was a textile worker.  She sewed pockets      in overalls and when textile workers, specifically female workers, plead      with me to vote against CAFTA, I said to the president, `It's my mama      talking to me. '      SEABROOK:  President Bush and Republicans like Pete Hoekstra of Michigan      also argued that Congress should match the loyalty Central American      countries have shown the US.      Representative PETE HOEKSTRA (Republican, Michigan):  In the war on      terror, they have been there with us.  Four of these countries have sent      troops to Iraq.  All six of these countries are part of the coalition to      defeat terrorism.      SEABROOK:  And the president also said creating stability in Central      American nations through free trade would enhance national security in      the US.  But Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi countered that.      Representative NANCY PELOSI (Democrat, California):  Trade alone, devoid      of a basic living and working standards, has not and will not promote      security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty.  Our      national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in Central      America.      SEABROOK:  At the end of the normal vote time of 15 minutes, it appeared      the Democrats and about two dozen Republicans had killed CAFTA.  But as      Republican leaders held the vote open, their number crept up until      reaching the critical majority just after midnight.  When it did, the      presiding officer jumped to his feet to gavel the vote closed before any      other members could switch their votes.  As CAFTA already won approval in      the Senate last month, it now needs only the president's signature.      Andrea Seabrook, NPR News, the Capitol.

Mr. WESSEL:  Well, companies usually borrow other people's savings in      order to invest and make more money in the future, but at the moment      they're extraordinarily thrifty.  Even companies that have lots of cash      flow, as you said, aren't investing nearly as much as you'd expect at      this point.  And there are a lot of different theories for that.  Maybe      it's because they're still shaken by the bubble hangover from the late      part of the last decade. Maybe they're feeling the pinch of having all      those regulators and Sarbanes-Oxley auditors and reporters looking over      their shoulders or maybe--I don't think so, but some people do--they just      don't see any profitable opportunities out there.      MONTAGNE:  Well, is what's happening unusual or do businesses act like      this for various reasons on a pretty regular basis?      Mr. WESSEL:  This is pretty unusual.  If you look at the history of the      last 40 years and measure the amount of corporate savings, the stuff      they're tucking away, against the size of the global economy, companies      haven't been this thrifty at any time in the past 40 years.  Even Alan      Greenspan, who seems to understand everything about the economy, has      pronounced it as something of a surprise.      MONTAGNE:  So is this something to worry about, David?  I mean, is it an      indicator of weakness in the economy?      Mr. WESSEL:  It's definitely something to worry about if it persists.      Perhaps we're just about to see businesses return to more normal      behavior, taking all this cash that's coming in and investing it in      plants and machinery and office buildings and computers.  And there are a      few hopeful signs.  This week, the government's report on the orders that      businesses have put in for what's called durable equipment and capital      goods was up quite a bit in June, up 3. 8 percent, and that's a hopeful      sign.  The reason to worry about it is that if businesses don't invest      now, we won't get the kind of economic growth and productivity gains in      the future that are essential if we're going to have rising living      standards and be able to afford the retirement of the baby boom and keep      pace with all our foreign competitors.      MONTAGNE:  Thanks for joining us, David.      Mr. WESSEL:  A pleasure.      MONTAGNE:  David Wessel is the deputy Washington bureau chief of The Wall      Street Journal.       RENEE MONTAGNE, host:       And in our Friday business news, we focus on your money.  The economy is      growing reasonably well.  Productivity is strong, profits are up and cash      is flowing into corporate coffers.  Business investment is up, too, but      it isn't up nearly as much as you might expect.  To find out what's going      on, we turn to David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall      Street Journal.       Good morning.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Business news now.  Retail sales were lower than expected last month, and      analysts are blaming the recent heat wave across the nation.  Joining me      is \"Marketplace\" New York bureau chief Bob Moon.      And, Bob, how did the heat end up affecting what Americans bought last      month?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, Madeleine, retailers are telling us that      the heat apparently adversely affected demand for fall back-to-school      fashions. It's a little hard to get yourself in the mood to buy a jacket      or a sweater when the mercury is into the triple digits.  The general      consensus among Wall Street forecasters had pointed to a 4. 2 percent      increase in July.  Instead, overall sales were up only 3. 7 percent from a      year earlier at stores open at least a year.  That year-to-year figure,      by the way, is a key measure known as same-store sales.  Some of the      biggest retail names missed analysts' forecasts, including Gap, Limited      Brands, Abercrombie & Fitch.  And stocks in the retail sector are      generally trading lower today.      BRAND:  OK, so it's bad news for clothing companies, but what about for      other businesses?      MOON:  Well, some stores did do better than others.  One example, it was      hit-or-miss among teen-oriented stores.  It seems those who had the right      fashions on the racks did better.  Those with paint-washed jeans, for      instance, for some reason reported huge July sales gains.  And sales at      Wal-Mart stores beat expectations.  The world's biggest retailer reports      that hot weather drove demand for air conditioners, as you might expect,      and it also points to the early start of the hurricane season, which      caused people in vulnerable areas to stock up on food and other supplies.      One other factor to consider last month, analysts say consumers were also      more interested in spending at auto dealers than malls, given those      wildly popular employee-discount offers from the big car makers.  Earlier      this week, you'll recall, the Detroit automakers reported their combined      results jumped 26. 5 percent in July.  Well, that's money that wasn't      being spent at the mall or Wal-Mart or other retailers.      BRAND:  So how much will this end up affecting the overall economy?  I've      heard stories about companies building up their inventories.      MOON:  Well, keep in mind, retail sales are still up, just not as much as      Wall Street was expecting.  And there are indications that improving      sales for the automakers and the retailers and manufacturers are causing      employers to hold on to workers, and that's good for all of us.  The      number of Americans who filed first-time claims for jobless benefits was      down last week, unexpectedly, to 312,000.  That's the second decline in      three weeks.  And as for the retail sector in particular, some analysts      say there's no cause for worry just yet. They say this weak showing      doesn't portend a disappointing fall season; it could just be getting off      to a slow start.      And today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're looking at how some      remnants of insidious racism in Japan are hindering business growth in      that country.

I'm Melissa Block.      Businesses picked up the pace of hiring in July, adding 207,000 jobs to      their payrolls.  A new report from the Labor Department also shows the      unemployment rate holding steady at 5 percent.  There was solid job      growth in just about every area of the economy last month except one,      manufacturing.  As NPR's Jack Speer reports, there were even optimistic      signs there.      JACK SPEER reporting:      This morning's report shows an economy that has remained resilient      despite high oil prices and large trade and budget deficits.  Through the      first seven months of the year, US businesses have added jobs at a rate      of 191,000 a month, something just about all economists agree is solid      growth.      Mr. BERNARD BAUMOHL (Executive Director, Economic Outlook Group):  Right      now the economy is clearly in a nice sweet spot.      SPEER:  Bernard Baumohl is executive director of the Economic Outlook      Group. He says in addition to strong jobs growth, worker wages were also      up in July. Average hourly earnings rose 4/10ths of 1 percent, another      sign things are picking up.      Mr. BAUMOHL:  This is really very good news.  You know, we're seeing      businesses continue to invest in labor.  They are investing in      inventories. They're investing in capital goods.      SPEER:  But while there were sizable job gains last month in retail,      health care and financial services, one area, manufacturing, continued to      disappoint. That sector lost 4,000 jobs in July.  David Huether is chief      economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.  He says that's      in large part because companies are still finding ways to produce more      with fewer workers.      Mr. DAVID HUETHER (National Association of Manufacturers):  The one thing      that has differentiated the manufacturing sector from a lot of the other      sectors is that there's been very, very strong growth in productivity in      the area of, you know, 5 percent a year.  There is not a demand or a need      to increase employment.      SPEER:  But there are some economists who believe the problems in      manufacturing go beyond just gains in productivity.  Jared Bernstein is      with the liberal Economic Policy Institute.  He thinks there are other      reasons for the downturn.      Mr. JARED BERNSTEIN (Economic Policy Institute):  It's not rocket      science. We're simply importing far more manufacturing goods than we      export and our manufacturing sector, which I would say has really been      ignored by policy-makers for years, is suffering competitively under      these kinds of international pressures.      SPEER:  But while that may be true for some manufacturing firms, it is      not true for all of them.  Construction equipment maker Caterpillar, for      example, reported a 34 percent jump in second-quarter profits, largely      due to strong demand in the US and abroad.  And in recent months factory      employment in some areas has started to rebound.  National Association of      Manufacturers economist David Huether thinks for that reason even the      manufacturing sector may start to see a hiring pickup in the months      ahead.      Mr. HUETHER:  Businesses are beginning again to invest in product and      equipment, and as a result we're going to see, I think, stronger      manufacturing production in the second half of the year.  I think that's      going to translate into some modest gains in employment.  I don't think      we're going to see enormous gains in manufacturing employment, but we      could see gains in the area of, say, 10 to 20,000 a month.      SPEER:  Much of the weakness in manufacturing last month was confined to      the automotive sector, which continues to grapple with excess capacity.      In addition the the fairly strong jobs numbers for July, the government      also revised upwards its job growth figures from May and June by a total      of 42,000.

I'm Michele Norris.      MELISSA BLOCK, host:      And I'm Melissa Block.      Around the country many public pension systems are in trouble.  The      situation is especially bad in Illinois, where the state pension system      has been underfunded for years.  Politicians and labor unions are trying      to figure out what to do about the problem.  Meanwhile, spiraling costs      and mounting debt are forcing state and local officials to make some hard      choices.  From Chicago Public Radio, Jay Field reports.      JAY FIELD reporting:      It's still morning, and it's already in the 90s as Carlos Azcoitia points      up at the brickwork on the outside of John Spry Community School just      west of downtown Chicago.  He's looking at several black safety nets      hugging the aging facade below the roof.      Mr. CARLOS AZCOITIA (Principal, John Spry Community School):  We've seen      falling brick from these areas, and it's all around the building.      FIELD:  Principal Azcoitia worries someone could get hurt.      Mr. AZCOITIA:  That has not happened, and we want to prevent that from      happening.  And, of course, outside renovation is needed, and we're not      on the list for this coming school year.      FIELD:  Neither are more than 50 other Chicago schools with decaying      windows, roofs, boilers and electrical wiring.  The district had to put      these projects on hold, in part, because payments to its teacher pension      plan jumped by $36 million this year.  And there's no state money for      building improvements.  The state is having its own financial problems,      and a big part of that is rising pension costs from Illinois' five      retirement plans.  State Representative Robert Molaro serves on a      commission recommending reforms to the system.      State Representative ROBERT MOLARO (Democrat, Illinois):  Here's what      happened.  We have what we call a defined benefit plan; most states do,      most cities do.  People weren't making a lot of money in government.      They're retiring at 65.  They would get a modest pension, and they were      dying at age 70.      FIELD:  But over time, says Molaro, people started retiring earlier and      living longer.      Rep. MOLARO:  They're living till 80, not 70, so they're retired for 20,      25 years.  Doesn't take a mathematician to figure out that that's big      money that we're paying out in these systems, but we never really changed      the funding policy.  And we're not taking more out of their checks.      FIELD:  That's caused the state's unfunded pension cost to grow to nearly      $35 billion.  That's the highest of any state.  But it's not just a      problem facing Illinois.  California, Michigan, New York, New Jersey,      Vermont, Colorado and others are also struggling.  Earlier this year      Illinois Governor Rob Blagojevich, Democrat, called for creating a      two-tiered system of benefits of the state's five retirement plans.  The      plans of existing state employees wouldn't change, but annual guaranteed      pension increases for new workers would drop while the retirement age      would rise to 65.      Mr. HENRY BAYER (American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees):  It's like the kid who kills his parents and then throws      himself on the mercy of the court because he's an orphan.      FIELD:  Henry Bayer runs the Illinois chapter of the American Federation      of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME.  He says for years      the state hasn't put enough money into these funds.      Mr. BAYER:  Now we have politicians who've shorted the pension fund and      now are whining because they have these big pension payments to make.      The only reason the pension payments are as large as they are is because      of the failure of the General Assembly and past governors to pay the debt      that they owed.      FIELD:  Opposition from AFSCME and other unions has forced Governor      Blagojevich to back off most of his reforms.  One solution Illinois and      other states are considering is a move to 401(k)-type accounts.  Under      these plans, workers contribute a percentage of each paycheck tax free to      a retirement fund.  Some employers match those contributions.  A state      commission in Illinois has called for more study of the option.  In      California this spring, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger fought to get a      measure onto the fall ballot that would implement a 401(k)-type plan for      all new state hires.  But opposition from firefighter and police unions      killed the proposal.  For NPR News, I'm Jay Field in Chicago.       MICHELE NORRIS, host:       This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  I'm Michele Norris.       MELISSA BLOCK, host:       And I'm Melissa Block.       Around the country many public pension systems are in trouble.  The      situation is especially bad in Illinois, where the state pension system      has been underfunded for years.  Politicians and labor unions are trying      to figure out what to do about the problem.  Meanwhile, spiraling costs      and mounting debt are forcing state and local officials to make some hard      choices.  From Chicago Public Radio, Jay Field reports.       JAY FIELD reporting:       It's still morning, and it's already in the 90s as Carlos Azcoitia points      up at the brickwork on the outside of John Spry Community School just      west of downtown Chicago.  He's looking at several black safety nets      hugging the aging facade below the roof.       Mr. CARLOS AZCOITIA (Principal, John Spry Community School):  We've seen      falling brick from these areas, and it's all around the building.       FIELD:  Principal Azcoitia worries someone could get hurt.       Mr. AZCOITIA:  That has not happened, and we want to prevent that from      happening.  And, of course, outside renovation is needed, and we're not      on the list for this coming school year.       FIELD:  Neither are more than 50 other Chicago schools with decaying      windows, roofs, boilers and electrical wiring.  The district had to put      these projects on hold, in part, because payments to its teacher pension      plan jumped by $36 million this year.  And there's no state money for      building improvements.  The state is having its own financial problems,      and a big part of that is rising pension costs from Illinois' five      retirement plans.  State Representative Robert Molaro serves on a      commission recommending reforms to the system.       State Representative ROBERT MOLARO (Democrat, Illinois):  Here's what      happened.  We have what we call a defined benefit plan; most states do,      most cities do.  People weren't making a lot of money in government.      They're retiring at 65.  They would get a modest pension, and they were      dying at age 70.       FIELD:  But over time, says Molaro, people started retiring earlier and      living longer.       Rep. MOLARO:  They're living till 80, not 70, so they're retired for 20,      25 years.  Doesn't take a mathematician to figure out that that's big      money that we're paying out in these systems, but we never really changed      the funding policy.  And we're not taking more out of their checks.       FIELD:  That's caused the state's unfunded pension cost to grow to nearly      $35 billion.  That's the highest of any state.  But it's not just a      problem facing Illinois.  California, Michigan, New York, New Jersey,      Vermont, Colorado and others are also struggling.  Earlier this year      Illinois Governor Rob Blagojevich, Democrat, called for creating a      two-tiered system of benefits of the state's five retirement plans.  The      plans of existing state employees wouldn't change, but annual guaranteed      pension increases for new workers would drop while the retirement age      would rise to 65.       Mr. HENRY BAYER (American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees):  It's like the kid who kills his parents and then throws      himself on the mercy of the court because he's an orphan.       FIELD:  Henry Bayer runs the Illinois chapter of the American Federation      of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME.  He says for years      the state hasn't put enough money into these funds.       Mr. BAYER:  Now we have politicians who've shorted the pension fund and      now are whining because they have these big pension payments to make.      The only reason the pension payments are as large as they are is because      of the failure of the General Assembly and past governors to pay the debt      that they owed.       FIELD:  Opposition from AFSCME and other unions has forced Governor      Blagojevich to back off most of his reforms.  One solution Illinois and      other states are considering is a move to 401(k)-type accounts.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      President Bush signs the new energy bill today.  What we didn't hear when      the measure was passed last week was that the bill could create some      problems for daylight-saving time.  The legislation's proposed changes to      the daylight-saving schedule could foul up numerous gadgets and computer      programs that are set for the old time schedule.  \"Marketplace\" New York      bureau chief Bob Moon joins us now with more.      And, Bob, first, what's the change in the daylight-saving time schedule?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, Madeleine, this legislation includes a      provision to start daylight time three weeks earlier and end it a week      later. It's billed as an energy-saving move.  But it's already led to      considerable debate about the wisdom of this change.  It'll put farmers      to work in the dark and send kids to school before dawn for an extended      time in addition to creating more daylight at the other end of the day.      And then we have these technical difficulties, you might say.      BRAND:  And tell us more about these technical difficulties.      MOON:  Well, if you're thinking back to all the hoopla about the threat      to computers when we made the big Y2K switch over, it shouldn't be      anything like that.  This is more like a minor nuisance if you happen to      have a gadget or a computer program that's affected.  This potential      problem was first brought to light last week by a technical publication      called Computerworld.      Today the Associated Press has weighed in on what it means, and it says      when this changeover happens a couple of years from now, in 2007, your      VCR or your DVD recorder might start recording shows an hour late.  And      there are some other interesting effects that might be possible that      might not come to mind at first.  The telecommunications industry, for      example, is going to have to make sure its computer schedule gets changed      so customers get billed properly, or else you might just get an extra      hour of free weekend calls.  And some electric companies use advanced      meters to distinguish between peak and non-peak times of demand.  The AP      suggests that's going to require new studies to figure out if any      modifications of those demand schedules are going to be needed and then      get that all programmed in.      BRAND:  And will these things just stop working, or will there be fixes      in time?      MOON:  Well, undoubtedly, a lot of fixes will be coming up, and if that      doesn't work, you'll just have to take things into your own hands, quite      literally.  If you've got a new model VCR, for example, they're      automatically programmed to adjust when switching over to DST based on      the way things have been since 1987.  Well, now that feature will be      essentially become obsolete. And an official at Panasonic says users      might have to manually increase or decrease the time.  Of course, I don't      have to worry about that because my VCR reads 12:00 and flashes that way      all the time anyway.  That'll never change.      In the computer world, the Windows operating system automatically      switches the time on your computer.  Microsoft provides automatic      updates, though, and it says it'll be taking care of that.

Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve meet today and      are expected to raise short-term interest rates again.  It'll be one of      the last times that Mr. Greenspan votes on interest rates because there      are only three or four Fed meetings scheduled before he retires.  Joining      us to talk about today's Fed meeting and the post-Greenspan era, as best      we can determine it, is David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief of      The Wall Street Journal, regular guest here.      Good morning, David.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (The Wall Street Journal):  Good morning.      INSKEEP:  So what is the Fed expected to do today?      Mr. WESSEL:  The Fed is expected to raise interest rates another quarter      percentage point from 3 1/4 percent to 3 1/2 percent.  There wasn't much      data about this, and the Friday's employment report, which was very      strong, just confirmed everybody's expectation that this is what they're      going to do.      INSKEEP:  The more there are signs of a growing economy, the more likely      the Fed is to raise interest rates to rein things in.      Mr. WESSEL:  That's right.  The Fed is sort of looking down the highway a      little bit, and it wants to make sure that it's put on the right mix of      the gas pedal and the brake pedal to avoid recession but also avoid      inflation.      INSKEEP:  How much higher can interest rates go?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, the markets are expecting the Fed to raise the      short-term interest rates it controls to maybe 4, 4 1/4 percent by year      end.  I think it's premature to think where they'll go after that because      you don't really know where the economy'll be then.      INSKEEP:  Now is there any connection between this rise in interest rates      and the fact that the chairman of the Federal Reserve will be leaving at      the end of next January?      Mr. WESSEL:  I think there is a small connection.  It's not the major      reason that rates are going up, but I suspect that chairman Greenspan      wants to make sure that inflation is well-controlled on the day he walks      out of office, both to protect his own legacy and to make life a little      easier for his successor, whoever that may be.      INSKEEP:  Who might that be?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, there've been three economists mentioned most      frequently--Ben Bernanke, who's now chairman of President Bush's Economic      Council; Marty Feldstein, who was chairman of Ronald Reagan's Economic      Council, a professor at Harvard; and Glenn Hubbard, who also served as      chairman of this President Bush's Economic Council, is now dean of the      Columbia Business School.  But lately a fourth name has popped onto the      list, that of Larry Lindsey, who worked both for the first President Bush      and the second President Bush, and did a stint at the Federal Reserve      Board.      Now there might be someone else out there.  There are all sorts of names      floating around, but at the moment that's the list that people in      Washington are talking about.      INSKEEP:  Is Lindsey less likely, because he was seen as being forced out      of the White House the last time he worked there in 2002?      Mr. WESSEL:  I think Lindsey is less likely for a couple of reasons.      You're right; there was some tension between him and some of his      colleagues in the White House both because of his organizational      shortcomings and because of some comments he made about the cost of the      war in Iraq, comments which turned out to be quite prescient, after all.      INSKEEP:  Lindsey predicted that the war would cost a couple hundred      billion dollars, which it turns out to have done.      Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  And that was a lot more than people were talking at      the time, and it was incredibly inconvenient for the administration, and      that definitely caused him some problems in-house.  But I think--remember      when he left the White House, it was part of a wholesale change in the      economic team. They got rid of Paul O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, at      the same time.  And I think Mr. Lindsey has mended a lot of fences at the      White House, so I think he's back in the tent.  But the other three      economists have somewhat more credibility, I think, both in academic      circles and perhaps in the bond market, and those are both important      places to look if you want to decide who is going to be a successful Fed      chairman.      INSKEEP:  Does anybody have the credibility to follow Alan Greenspan?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, today it looks like the answer is no, but it's really      worth thinking about what people said about Alan Greenspan when he became      Fed chairman in 1987.  After all, we had this big, physically big and      metaphorically big Fed chairman before him, Paul Volcker, who had broken      the back of inflation, and there were also stories written that said that      this nice little economist from New York could never fill Mr. Volcker's      shoes. And here 18 years later, Mr. Greenspan is seen as a kind of icon      of American economic stability.      INSKEEP:  David Wessel is the deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall      Street Journal.      David, thanks.      Mr. WESSEL:  Thank you.

Interest rates are going up again.  Federal Reserve policy-makers have      announced another quarter-percent increase in the interest rate they      charge the nation's bank.  That was no surprise.  But Wall Street      analysts are now carefully examining the language that the Fed chose to      use in this latest policy statement.  And Bob Moon joins us from the      \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.      Bob, first of all, where do interest rates now stand?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, in the language of the central bank,      rates are going up another 25 basis points, which, as you say, is another      way of saying they're being raised by a quarter percentage point.  So the      rate the Fed charges banks will now be 3. 5 percent.  This increase brings      the rate to more than triple what it was when the Fed started raising      rates back in June of last year.  At that point, the 1 percent rate was      the lowest it had been in 46 years.  As of today, the rate is up to its      highest level since August of 2001.  For the record, this is the 10th      straight meeting that these monetary policy-makers have decided to raise      rates.  And as you mentioned, that was expected, so much of the attention      is now focusing on what they're saying about what their future course      will be.      BRAND:  And so what are they saying?  Tell us more about that      post-meeting statement from the Fed.      MOON:  Well, that's the part that investors need to factor into the      market now.  It can come down to single words that are included or not      included in these statements.  And this time around, the statement is      pretty much the same as the one issued back at the end of June.  There      are two words in particular that Wall Street was watching to see if they      might be removed: `accommodative' and `measured. '  And today they're      still there.      Here's what the latest statement says.  `The committee believes that even      after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. '      In other words, we're satisfied we're on the right track.  And as for the      future, the statement says, `The committee believes that policy      accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. '      In other words, steady as she goes.      Now most economists seem to think that that could signal more of these      small quarter percentage point steps, maybe for the next four Fed      meetings, so the rate could be up to around 4 1/2 percent sometime after      the first of the year.      BRAND:  Well, Bob, what are the chances the Fed won't keep up these      quarter percent steps and just get more aggressive?      MOON:  There are some economists out there who think that the Fed should      indeed be more aggressive, particularly to start taking the wind out of      the sails when it comes to these ever-rising housing prices that we've      been seeing.  Now the Fed lets some time pass before it releases the      minutes of today's meeting, and Wall Street often reacts to what was      discussed behind closed doors, even if the Fed decided not to take action      on it.  So if there was any discussion today, say, of the possible need      to restrict economic growth to control inflation, that could yet cause      some anxiety among investors.  It'll be a few weeks, though, to get a      peek into what was discussed during today's meeting.      And today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're taking a look at a      Delaware law that closes off access to corporate records to out-of-state      residents, even though Delaware is a state where a lot of big companies      base their businesses.

MADELEINE BRAND, host:       Back now with DAY TO DAY, I'm Madeleine Brand.       Interest rates are going up again.  Federal Reserve policy-makers have      announced another quarter-percent increase in the interest rate they      charge the nation's bank.  That was no surprise.  But Wall Street      analysts are now carefully examining the language that the Fed chose to      use in this latest policy statement.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Signs today that the soaring housing market may be leveling off.  A      survey of lenders finds rising mortgage rates are making it less      attractive for homeowners to refinance.  And some analysts are suggesting      the higher rates could start driving off potential home buyers.      \"Marketplace\" New York bureau chief Bob Moon joins us now.      And, Bob, is this finally the sign that the housing bubble we've been      hearing so much about is starting to burst?      BOB MOON reporting:      Hi, Madeleine.  Well, there's still some debate inside and outside the      industry about whether there really is such a thing as a housing bubble.      But at the very least, there are growing indications that the hot housing      market might be starting to cool of.  The latest sign comes from the      Mortgage Bankers Association, which surveys lenders.  And mortgage      applications were down almost 1 percent last week to their lowest point      since the end of May, and refinancing applications dropped more than 3      percent.  Now those declines come as the survey finds rates are going up.      The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is higher than it's been      since April.  Perhaps more importantly, there may be a trend developing      here.  Mortgage rates have gone up in five of the last six weeks.      BRAND:  So what does that tell us about where the general housing market      may be headed?      MOON:  Well, it's low mortgage rates that have really kept the housing      market rolling for more than four years now.  And this is a sign that      those rates might be starting to head back up.  A report just yesterday      from the National Association of Realtors concluded that the housing      market--and I'll put quotes around this here--\"the housing market is      probably close to a peak right now in terms of sales activity. \"      This gets a little complicated because the Realtors group also points out      that there's still a tremendous amount of momentum in the marketplace.      And it's forecasting sales of existing homes will increase 2. 9 percent      this year to a record 6. 98 million.  You have to look at it this this      way, though.  It's the rate of increase that's beginning to slow down,      and sales should start to ease off these record levels in the second half      of the year.      Looking ahead to next year, the Realtors group sees a much different      picture. It says sales of previously owned homes will fall 3. 6 percent      and sales of new homes will drop 4. 5 percent.      BRAND:  And, Bob, you and I talked yesterday about the Federal Reserve      raising interest rates.  Will that affect the price of home loans?      MOON:  Well, you'd think that would be the result, but this is what Fed      Chairman Greenspan has called a conundrum because it almost hasn't      mattered that the Fed has raised its target for short-term rates;      yesterday was the 10th time since June of last year.  Despite that,      long-term interest rates have stayed relatively low.  So there's really      no way of saying whether this latest increase will start having an      effect.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're digging into Supreme Court      nominee John Roberts' past decisions to see how he might rule on business      cases.

I'm Michele Norris.      MELISSA BLOCK, host:      And I'm Melissa Block.      Another day, another record for oil prices.  For a time this afternoon a      barrel of oil was selling for more than $67.  The closing price was up      more than a dollar from yesterday's price, which also set a record, as      did Monday's price, Tuesday's and Wednesday's.  NPR's Scott Horsley      reports.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      You can take your pick of explanations for why the price of oil has      jumped $10 a barrel in the last three weeks:  refinery problems here in      the US, security threats in Saudi Arabia, Iran's renewed nuclear      ambitions or lingering worry about hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.      Vice President Mike Fitzpatrick of the trading firm Fimat says the real      answer is all of the above.      Mr. MIKE FITZPATRICK (Vice President, Fimat):  It's a confluence of      events leading up to these last couple of weeks and then one can almost      describe it as a perfect storm for energy prices.      HORSLEY:  Many speculative buyers are betting the price will go even      higher. After all, why sell oil for 50 or even $60 a barrel when buyers      snap up just as much at a price of nearly $70.      Mr. FITZPATRICK:  It's going to take, you know, a clear signal that it's      starting to weigh on economic activity.  Once you start seeing economic      numbers that show that the economy is clearly contracting specifically as      a result of higher and higher energy prices, then, I think, you're going      to see a lot of these speculative interests lightening their positions.      HORSLEY:  So far, those signs of weakening demand have been hard to come      by, but that could be changing.  In California, which has some of the      nation's most expensive gasoline, the Energy Commission reported this      week that gas consumption actually dropped in the first four months of      the year even as the population grew by more than half a million people.      Nationwide, demand for gasoline is still growing, albeit more slowly than      it was earlier in the year. Energy economist Stephen Brown of the Federal      Reserve Bank in Dallas says even though gas prices are now 49 cents a      gallon higher than this time last year, drivers are not able to cut back      too much.      Mr. STEPHEN BROWN (Energy Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas):      The way I use gasoline is determined by where I live, what kind of car I      drive, and I can't change that real quickly.      HORSLEY:  Brown adds that oil is still a relative bargain when adjusted      for inflation, especially compared to the early 1980s when it took twice      as much oil to generate a dollar of economic activity.      Mr. BROWN:  Well, all of the businesses that are in manufacturing use      much less energy than they used to use for any given product.  And then      we've also seen a change in the composition of our economy from kind of      heavy smokestack industries to lighter, more service-oriented industries.      HORSLEY:  There is still, of course, some limit to how high oil prices      can go, but as Fimat's Fitzpatrick says, that limit is a lot higher than      many people might have guessed.      Mr. FITZPATRICK:  Almost every one of these barriers has become a      self-fulfilling prophecy.  I mean, it was going to be Armageddon at $50.      The world was going to end at $60.  Now they're saying $70.  It wouldn't      surprise me.  I'm guessing we're going to have to get up there--only      because I hear so many people talking about it--70 to $72 before it      really falters precipitously.      HORSLEY:  At this rate, oil could hit that next so-called barrier as      early as next week.  Scott Horsley, NPR News.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      America's trade deficit continues to go up.  The Commerce Department      reports today that in June, the US imported almost $59 billion more in      goods than it exported.  This year's June trade gap is 11 percent higher      than last year's. Joining us is \"Marketplace's\" John Dimsdale in      Washington.      John, what's behind the big numbers?      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Well, on the one hand, US exports were better.  There were more sales of      telecommunications equipment, aircraft and fertilizers overseas.  But      that small increase was swamped by imports, especially from China.  The      US deficit with China broke a new monthly record of $17 billion, and so      far that one imbalance is running 30 percent higher than last year's      record.  This is the result of the end of those global quotas on clothing      and textiles that started at the first of the year. . .      CHADWICK:  Right.      DIMSDALE:  . . . bringing in a flood of T-shirts and socks and underwear.      In fact, next week, the US begins some negotiations with China to try to      find a way to slow down the flow of cheap clothing.  Those talks were a      promise that the Bush administration made to get votes for that Central      American Free Trade Agreement, which narrowly passed Congress last month.      This just shows how politically sensitive these trade deficits are, and      they're making it tough for the White House to find votes to approve      trade agreements.      CHADWICK:  What about the higher cost of imported oil, John?      DIMSDALE:  Well, that's the reason for half of the increase in the trade      deficit.  But there is another cause:  relatively strong growth in the US      economy.  Listen to Anthony Chan, the chief economist for Banc One      Investment Advisers.  He says if our economy was in a downturn, US      imports would be dropping.      Mr. ANTHONY CHAN (Chief Economist, Banc One Investment Advisers):  We      always think of a wider trade deficit as being a bad thing.  And not that      it is a great thing, but when you look at the breakdown of our trade      deficit, it certainly does suggest that we have an economic expansion      that appears to be sustainable and ongoing, and that's part of the reason      why our trade deficit is getting wider.  So in a sense, there is a silver      lining in this widening trade deficit.      CHADWICK:  So I thought that China had revalued its currency--I know it      has, and it was supposed to make Chinese products more expensive.  What      happened?      DIMSDALE:  Yeah.  Well, first of all, it was a very small revaluation,      just a little over 2 percent.  Most analysts say the yuan, the Chinese      currency, is undervalued by as much as 40 percent.  Plus, it takes a      while for currency changes to show up in trade figures, supposedly as      long as a year and a half. So even once the currency effects, slight as      they may be, start affecting trade flows, the experts don't anticipate      much of an impact, so far at least.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we talk to Israeli settlers on      the ground in Gaza ahead of their probable eviction from the land.      CHADWICK:  All right.  Thank you, John Dimsdale with \"Marketplace\" on      American Public Media.       ALEX CHADWICK, host:       Back now with DAY TO DAY.  I'm Alex Chadwick.       America's trade deficit continues to go up.  The Commerce Department      reports today that in June, the US imported almost $59 billion more in      goods than it exported.  This year's June trade gap is 11 percent higher      than last year's. Joining us is \"Marketplace's\" John Dimsdale in      Washington.       John, what's behind the big numbers?       JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:       Well, on the one hand, US exports were better.  There were more sales of      telecommunications equipment, aircraft and fertilizers overseas.  But      that small increase was swamped by imports, especially from China.  The      US deficit with China broke a new monthly record of $17 billion, and so      far that one imbalance is running 30 percent higher than last year's      record.  This is the result of the end of those global quotas on clothing      and textiles that started at the first of the year. . .       CHADWICK:  Right.       DIMSDALE:  . . . bringing in a flood of T-shirts and socks and underwear.      In fact, next week, the US begins some negotiations with China to try to      find a way to slow down the flow of cheap clothing.  Those talks were a      promise that the Bush administration made to get votes for that Central      American Free Trade Agreement, which narrowly passed Congress last month.      This just shows how politically sensitive these trade deficits are, and      they're making it tough for the White House to find votes to approve      trade agreements.       CHADWICK:  What about the higher cost of imported oil, John?       DIMSDALE:  Well, that's the reason for half of the increase in the trade      deficit.  But there is another cause:  relatively strong growth in the US      economy.  Listen to Anthony Chan, the chief economist for Banc One      Investment Advisers.  He says if our economy was in a downturn, US      imports would be dropping.       Mr. ANTHONY CHAN (Chief Economist, Banc One Investment Advisers):  We      always think of a wider trade deficit as being a bad thing.  And not that      it is a great thing, but when you look at the breakdown of our trade      deficit, it certainly does suggest that we have an economic expansion      that appears to be sustainable and ongoing, and that's part of the reason      why our trade deficit is getting wider.

And      before taking questions on his agency's newest numbers, he offered this      important warning.      Mr. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN (Director, Congressional Budget Office):  Let me      just say that everything that we've presented today is going to be wrong.      It's the nature of the business.  We're always trying to project the      future and can't do so perfectly.      GREENE:  But Holtz-Eakin did his best.  He said the federal deficit for      2005 will be $331 billion, down from 412 billion last year.  He said that      was good economic news, at least for now.  A big reason the deficit seems      to be shrinking, he said, is that corporations have been taking in bigger      and bigger revenues.  He said he's not sure how long that will last.      Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN:  This is the second year in a row that corporation      receipts have risen at above-40-percent rates.  That raises the very      difficult question of just how much of that surge in revenues one should      perceive to be permanent.      GREENE:  In Washington, of course, raising questions leaves room for      politicians to offer answers.  Republicans said the tax cuts of 2001 and      2003 have given families and businesses more money to spend, spurring      economic grown and pushing down the deficit.  House Majority Leader Tom      DeLay said in a statement that the CBO numbers show Americans are      `reaping the benefits of conservative economic stewardship. '  That echoed      President Bush last week.      President GEORGE W. BUSH:  It makes sense to trust people with their own      money.  I'm pleased to report that the strategy is working.      GREENE:  `Not so,' said Democrats and their allies.  They pointed to the      CBO's future projections, which were that if Mr. Bush and Republicans      fulfill their vows to make tax cuts permanent, the cumulative deficit in      the next 10 years would jump from $2. 1 trillion to 3. 4 trillion.  And      besides, said Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the      Senate Budget Committee, Americans should be looking deeper into the CBO      report and the fact that the nation's debt, the amount the nation has to      borrow, is ballooning.      Senator KENT CONRAD (Democrat, North Dakota):  I don't think we see an      improving deficit picture except in the very short term.  What the CBO is      saying is over the longer term, they don't see an improving deficit      picture. And again, I think, looking at the deficit, really, at this      point in our fiscal affairs, really misses the point of what's happening      to the debt.      GREENE:  Perhaps the only economic figure both parties agree on is that      gasoline prices are soaring.  At the CBO, Holtz-Eakin said if they stay      high, it won't change his deficit projections too much, though he made no      guarantees.  David Greene, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Ed Gordon.      Black women are shelling out cash and not just at the malls but also at      the computer.  That's one of the conclusions of a new survey exploring      African-American buying power.  Ken Smikle is president and founder of      Target Market News.  His company analyzes advertising, marketing and      media geared toward black consumers.  And Cheryl Mayberry McKissack is      president and CEO of the market research firm Nia Enterprises and      NiaOnline. com, a Web site catering to black women.  Both join us from      Chicago.      I thank you both for joining us.      Ken, let me start with you, if I may.  I know that you do a lot of      research by means of the black consumer market.  What are we seeing right      now in terms of the black dollar and trends?      Mr. KEN SMIKLE (President and Founder, Target Market News):  Well, I      think the dominant trend right now, Ed, is looking at how black consumers      are behaving at least a little differently from the general market.  That      tends to always be true, but when the economy is tight, African-Americans      have a tendency to not completely revert in their spending patterns.  So      we're not seeing a real retrenchment to being more frugal, if you will,      but making smarter investments on things that really matter most in their      lives.  You see people spending more money on basics for the home like      appliances and certainly for things that will give them an opportunity to      enjoy life but in ways that are more like investments, if you will.      Consumer electronics have always been popular with black households; that      trend has not changed.  Certainly, the latest technology like      large-screen televisions and digital audio equipment of all kinds are      still very much on the agenda for black households.      So I think that we're spending out money smarter.  There are certainly      things that we are giving up, and usually, I have to say, that it's the      woman in the household that tends to sacrifice more.  We see spending on      women's apparel, for example, going down while spending on children's      apparel goes up and almost in direct proportion to one another.      GORDON:  Cheryl, when we talk about just the kinds of dollars that is      generated within the black community and, as Ken has suggested, when you      talk about the movement of black dollar, it really is a black female that      does that.  In your surveys and results of tapping into online consumers,      what are you finding from the black female by virtue of dollars being      spent?      Ms. CHERYL MAYBERRY McKISSACK (President and CEO, Nia Enterprises):      Well, I think that, first of all, as Ken has said, the black female is a      very important part of spending in the black household.  We recently      finished our survey on the African-American household online, which      focuses on how important that black female is, and what we're seeing is      that that black female is using the Internet as a no-nonsense tool to be      able to help direct the dollars that they are spending on their      household.  So they basically look at it as a means to transact business      as opposed to just a means of recreation and social interaction.  And      they are more open to being influenced by online marketing for the      products and services that are coming into their household than their      white counterparts.      GORDON:  Ken, what about the big picture item here, if you will?  Taking      some stats from a survey you did in 2003, it's estimated that black      consumer power is about $656 billion.  And if we go back to what some 20      years ago Tony Brown was talking about, the famed journalist, in terms of      turning that dollar over and spending with each other, are we seeing that      done any better than we did some years ago?      Mr. SMIKLE:  Well, you know, I think that we're overly critical with      ourselves about how much we're spending with one another, how much of the      black dollar stays within the black community.  And I can tell you as a      matter of fact that there is no scientific way to calculate the movement      of that money in and out of our community.  I think that we are doing far      more just by virtue of the tremendous growth in black-owned businesses,      be they based in our community or elsewhere, but we are spending huge      amounts of money with one another.      But by our calculations, we're showing that 2004--that so-called buying      power or earned income is now approaching $700 billion, and I think that,      again, the most significant shifts in that have been the growth in income      for black women.  And we're also seeing that having this sense of      confidence, as we've monitored in a collaboration between the online and      Target Market News in a consumer survey, that we react differently to our      sense of confidence about the economy.  I mean, even as African-Americans      see unemployment becoming more of a threat to them individually, they are      still confident about doing the things that they've laid out for      themselves.  They are still planning on making those purchases that have      been in the planning stage for some time. Unlike their white      counterparts, we don't see as much pessimism about the future of the job      market.  So in a scenario where we're usually the last hired, first      fired, African-Americans have either been planning for a tight economy      all along, or they're reacting to it with less trepidation than their      white counterparts.      GORDON:  Cheryl, let me ask you one of the important questions in all of      this when we talk about consumer spending, and that is the idea of      saving.  We don't always see that in the same way we should in the black      community.  What of the idea and what are you finding out in terms of      your shoppers and people that you've been surveying by means of wanting      to put aside dollars for a rainy day, if you will?      Ms. McKISSACK:  One of the areas that's very important that a lot of      African-American women who are head of household use the Internet for is      to find out information involving financial decisions, information on      where to save, how to save and what are some of the ways that they can do      that with the income that they have.  So that if you take a look at why      African-American women are using the Internet today and what kinds of      things they're using it for, they're using it to get this type of      information so that they can make better decisions for themselves and for      their families.      I think the other thing that they're looking at is how they spend those      dollars.  They are still spending those dollars.  They do want to save      some of those dollars.  They're very concerned about their families.  In      a lot of the cases, they're head of households.  They're the only parent      in the family so they have to be concerned about that.  But they're also      looking at when they do spend their dollars so that have more dollars to      actually save, who do they spend those dollars with?  So they're looking      at companies and making sure those companies are supporting programs that      benefit African-Americans, that benefit women.  They're looking at      companies and making sure that they're giving them the right messages in      their advertising and their themes.  And they're also looking at going      and supporting companies that, in their mind, also give back and support      them and their communities.      So it's not just a question of saving, it's a question of taking those      dollars and making those dollars really go further, get more value out of      those dollars and then also having some of those dollars left to be able      to put into programs that protect themselves and their families in the      future.      GORDON:  Ken, finally, prognosticate, if you would, for me:  What would      you like to see by means of a consumer trend?  What would you like to see      the consumer do in the future?      Mr. SMIKLE:  Well, one of the things I think has absolutely--has always      been important is that black consumers need to leverage their power.  And      I'm not just talking about who they spend their money with, but actually      going beyond the relationship that they have with companies at the cash      register.  It is very, very important that we start letting corporations      know how we feel personally about the way in which they behave and that,      you know, we are spending our money on the basis of how we see      corporations hire African-Americans, bring them into senior management      positions, how they give money back to the black community in      philanthropic efforts and the like.  If we don't leverage that power, I      think corporate America will continue to take us for granted as consumers      with the notion that even as we get more money to spend with them, we      will not ask of anything in return.      GORDON:  All right.

But by our calculations, we're showing that 2004--that so-called buying      power or earned income is now approaching $700 billion, and I think that,      again, the most significant shifts in that have been the growth in income      for black women.  And we're also seeing that having this sense of      confidence, as we've monitored in a collaboration between the online and      Target Market News in a consumer survey, that we react differently to our      sense of confidence about the economy.  I mean, even as African-Americans      see unemployment becoming more of a threat to them individually, they are      still confident about doing the things that they've laid out for      themselves.  They are still planning on making those purchases that have      been in the planning stage for some time. Unlike their white      counterparts, we don't see as much pessimism about the future of the job      market.  So in a scenario where we're usually the last hired, first      fired, African-Americans have either been planning for a tight economy      all along, or they're reacting to it with less trepidation than their      white counterparts.       GORDON:  Cheryl, let me ask you one of the important questions in all of      this when we talk about consumer spending, and that is the idea of      saving.  We don't always see that in the same way we should in the black      community.  What of the idea and what are you finding out in terms of      your shoppers and people that you've been surveying by means of wanting      to put aside dollars for a rainy day, if you will?       Ms. McKISSACK:  One of the areas that's very important that a lot of      African-American women who are head of household use the Internet for is      to find out information involving financial decisions, information on      where to save, how to save and what are some of the ways that they can do      that with the income that they have.  So that if you take a look at why      African-American women are using the Internet today and what kinds of      things they're using it for, they're using it to get this type of      information so that they can make better decisions for themselves and for      their families.       I think the other thing that they're looking at is how they spend those      dollars.  They are still spending those dollars.  They do want to save      some of those dollars.  They're very concerned about their families.  In      a lot of the cases, they're head of households.  They're the only parent      in the family so they have to be concerned about that.  But they're also      looking at when they do spend their dollars so that have more dollars to      actually save, who do they spend those dollars with?  So they're looking      at companies and making sure those companies are supporting programs that      benefit African-Americans, that benefit women.  They're looking at      companies and making sure that they're giving them the right messages in      their advertising and their themes.  And they're also looking at going      and supporting companies that, in their mind, also give back and support      them and their communities.       So it's not just a question of saving, it's a question of taking those      dollars and making those dollars really go further, get more value out of      those dollars and then also having some of those dollars left to be able      to put into programs that protect themselves and their families in the      future.       GORDON:  Ken, finally, prognosticate, if you would, for me:  What would      you like to see by means of a consumer trend?  What would you like to see      the consumer do in the future?       Mr. SMIKLE:  Well, one of the things I think has absolutely--has always      been important is that black consumers need to leverage their power.  And      I'm not just talking about who they spend their money with, but actually      going beyond the relationship that they have with companies at the cash      register.  It is very, very important that we start letting corporations      know how we feel personally about the way in which they behave and that,      you know, we are spending our money on the basis of how we see      corporations hire African-Americans, bring them into senior management      positions, how they give money back to the black community in      philanthropic efforts and the like.  If we don't leverage that power, I      think corporate America will continue to take us for granted as consumers      with the notion that even as we get more money to spend with them, we      will not ask of anything in return.       GORDON:  All right.  Ken Smikle, president and founder of Target Market      News, and Cheryl Mayberry McKissack, president and CEO of the market      research firm Nia Enterprises and NiaOnline. com, I thank you both for      joining us.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      It's the third day of a strike by 4,400 aircraft mechanics, cleaners and      custodians at Northwest Airlines.  So far, the airline has been able to      avoid major service disruptions.  Today, the first day of the workweek,      is the first real test of how the airline will weather the strike.  And      joining us now in \"Marketplace's\" Washington bureau is John Dimsdale.      And, John, what's this strike all about?      JOHN DIMSDALE (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, as usual, it's about salaries, but      in this case it's not pay raises.  To avoid bankruptcy, Northwest is      demanding a 26 percent pay cut from the mechanics union.  Mechanics      countered with a 16 percent reduction in salaries and benefits.  Under      their expired contract the mechanics earn about $36. 40 a hour as a base      salary.  There's also a fight over what job categories are to be filled      by union members.  Unions claim Northwest's proposal would trim the      number of union job slots and they accuse the company of trying to bust      the union.      BRAND:  And, John, just over a week ago a relatively small strike by food      caterers for British Airways caused major disruptions for that airline      and for its passengers and travelers at Heathrow.  How has Northwest      managed to keep its flights on schedule?      DIMSDALE:  Well, the biggest difference is that none of Northwest's other      unions are honoring the mechanics' walkout and the cleaners' walkout.  In      the British Airways case, ticket counter workers and baggage handlers and      other unions supported the caterers' demands.  But in the Northwest case,      other powerful unions such as the pilots and flight attendants are trying      to protect their own wages and benefits, so they're staying on the job;      mechanics find themselves out on their own.      And also Northwest's management was ready with an elaborate contingency      plan. Over the past several months they've been hiring and training 1,500      substitute mechanics.  It shows how there really are plenty of available      workers after these many layoffs in the airline industry.  Unions warn      that these rookies are going to threaten safety, but Northwest claims      that 80 percent of the replacements have at least five years' experience.      This contingency plan really sticks in the craw of the mechanics union.      At the same time the company was asking for 176 million in concessions,      managers were spending 100 million to prepare for the strike and--more      proof, they say, that the company is out to get rid of the union.      BRAND:  Well, the company is one of the largest airlines.  How long could      this strike go on?      DIMSDALE:  One way to gauge that is to follow the money.  Standard &      Poor's this morning--that's the credit rating agency--issued a warning      about Northwest's debt.  And that means that the airline could pay more      to borrow in the future, and that's sort of ominous for the airline.  On      the other hand, Northwest stock is holding its own, and that probably      means that investors had anticipated more disruptions and are impressed      with how well the airline performed over the weekend.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we'll explain what orphaned      copyrights are and find out how they find their parents.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Today, the Bush administration proposed raising the minimum fuel economy      standards for sport utility vehicles and light trucks.  They're the      fastest-growing category of new auto sales in the country.  And joining      us from Washington is \"Marketplace's\" John Dimsdale.      And, John, so what are these new minimums they're proposing?      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Well, beginning with the 2008 models, the White House wants to raise the      current 21 miles per gallon to 23 and a half for light trucks.  That's      about a 6 percent increase.  Making the announcement today, the      Transportation secretary said the new minimums would improve air quality      and reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.  He said it would      save 10 billion gallons of gasoline.      The proposal divides light trucks into six categories, each with its own      standard depending on their size.  Bigger trucks and SUVs would be held      to a lower minimum miles per gallon.  That means that large SUVs like      Hummers and Expeditions wouldn't have to meet the same mileage standard      as smaller light trucks such as a Jeep or Explorer.      BRAND:  Well, with rising gas prices, that sounds like good news.  What's      the reaction so far?      DIMSDALE:  Well, carmakers are being kind of tentative so far.  They say      it's too early to tell whether these higher minimums will require more      expensive technology and, therefore, more expensive SUVs and trucks.      Charles Territo, with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, says the      public already has the choices to move to better fuel economy.      Mr. CHARLES TERRITO (Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers):  Currently,      there are more than a hundred models that achieve over 30 miles per      gallon.  And we are currently developing a wide range of advanced      technology vehicles, including more hybrids, more diesel engines,      hydrogen internal combustion engines and even fuel cells later on down      the road.      DIMSDALE:  That's Charles Territo with the auto manufacturers.      You know, Madeleine, some car manufacturers say fuel economy standards      aren't even necessary because they'll always be trumped by the      marketplace.  For example, even though SUVs and pickup trucks have been      very popular, there's already evidence that the gas prices, as you      mentioned, are driving down the demand for larger gas guzzlers and      increasing sales for more fuel-efficient cars.      BRAND:  And, John, what are environmental groups saying about this new      proposal?      DIMSDALE:  Well, they call them \"woefully inadequate\"--that's a quote.      With gasoline prices approaching $3 a gallon, they say a 6-percent notch      up in fuel economy standards is too little too late.  This proposal is      out for public comment, with a final standard required by next April.      Carmakers then have 18 months to build engines to meet the standards by      the 2008 model year.      Coming up later on \"Marketplace,\" we're going to see how some cities are      trying to fight high housing prices by requiring affordable housing for      the middle class.

Whenever Congress and the White House pass free      trade legislation, they include programs that they say will help workers      who lose their jobs when factory production moves overseas.  David      Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal has      been looking into one such program and has brought his findings here.      Good morning, David.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (The Wall Street Journal):  Good morning.      INSKEEP:  OK.  This program is called `wage insurance. '  How's it work?      Mr. WESSEL:  Basically the deal is if you're over 50 and you lose a job      because of imports or your production moved overseas and you get another      job that doesn't pay as well as the one you lost, the government will      give you a check for half the difference for a couple of years, up to      $10,000.      INSKEEP:  The idea is you won't be making the same, but you get a little      bit of assistance to make up for the fact that you're now working at      Wal-Mart instead of a factory.      Mr. WESSEL:  Exactly.  And the idea is that first of all, we want to give      workers some reason to go out and find a job rather than to go on      unemployment or go on disability or whatever, and secondly that since a      lot of us benefit from trade, whether it's cheaper imports or high-wage      export jobs, that the society ought to compensate those people who are      losers by giving them a little cushion, and that's what this program is      all about.      INSKEEP:  OK, sounds like a good concept.  Why doesn't it work?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, this program was stuck into a 2002 law that renewed      President Bush's authority to negotiate trade agreements.  It's one of      those things they stick in because they have to feel like they're doing      something for workers.  First, Congress made it very complicated.  They      dropped the wage insurance phrase and called it `alternative trade      adjustment assistance,' which is hardly a worker-friendly phrase.  And      they put a number of restrictions on it, like you have to be able to show      that your skills aren't easily transferable in order to get the money,      and then the paperwork is sort of complicated.  And then the Labor      Department didn't handle it very well at first.  In fact, initially they      forget to put a little box on the form you fill out if you are laid off      because of trade, and there was no way to check the box that you were      applying for this thing.      They fixed that, but still it's been sort of clunky, hasn't gotten much      attention, and between August of 2003, when it started, and the end of      2004, a total of 1,400 people qualified for this aid.      INSKEEP:  Fourteen hundred.      Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  And we know, from all the headlines and horror      stories, that there's more people over 50 who've lost jobs because of      trade--it just--the program hasn't gotten--barely gotten off the ground.      INSKEEP:  Is this just because of the requirements you mentioned, people      actually have to come in and prove that they're not competent to take      over another job, for example?      Mr. WESSEL:  I think that's part of it.  Mostly what happens is unions or      companies or state agencies involved when a plant closes fill out the      forms for groups of workers, and although the Labor secretary talks about      it in speeches, there was no effort to promote this.  There's not even a      simple flier that explains it to workers.  So it's basically put into law      to make people feel better, but there hasn't been very much      follow-through.      INSKEEP:  You alluded to the headlines.  Is it fair to say that there are      millions of people who could use some assistance, who are being shifted      into lower-paying jobs right now?      Mr. WESSEL:  One of the frustrating things about these trade adjustment      assistance programs is they require you to show that it was trade rather      than something else, like new technology, that displaced you.  So there      are lots of people who have been displaced, clearly, hundreds of      thousands of people who have been displaced and been forced to take      lower-paying jobs.  How many of them are actually able to pin that on      trade as opposed to something else is anybody's guess.      INSKEEP:  So have lawmakers recognized that this program they put in      place isn't helping very many people, and are they doing anything about      it?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, as far as I can tell, this has gotten very little      attention in Congress.  There are things that they could have done      legislatively when they passed the Central American Free Trade Act, for      instance, which was a logical place to do it.  But as far as I can tell,      it never came up in the discussions.  Within the Labor Department,      however, there is a sense that they could do better, and they've made      some steps to streamline the process and they tell me that they have some      new steps in the works to make it easier for people to apply for and get      something which Congress intends them to have.      INSKEEP:  David Wessel is deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall      Street Journal, not yet displaced.      Thanks, David.      Mr. WESSEL:  Thank you.

David      Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal has      been looking into one such program and has brought his findings here.       Good morning, David.       Mr. DAVID WESSEL (The Wall Street Journal):  Good morning.       INSKEEP:  OK.  This program is called `wage insurance. '  How's it work?       Mr. WESSEL:  Basically the deal is if you're over 50 and you lose a job      because of imports or your production moved overseas and you get another      job that doesn't pay as well as the one you lost, the government will      give you a check for half the difference for a couple of years, up to      $10,000.       INSKEEP:  The idea is you won't be making the same, but you get a little      bit of assistance to make up for the fact that you're now working at      Wal-Mart instead of a factory.       Mr. WESSEL:  Exactly.  And the idea is that first of all, we want to give      workers some reason to go out and find a job rather than to go on      unemployment or go on disability or whatever, and secondly that since a      lot of us benefit from trade, whether it's cheaper imports or high-wage      export jobs, that the society ought to compensate those people who are      losers by giving them a little cushion, and that's what this program is      all about.       INSKEEP:  OK, sounds like a good concept.  Why doesn't it work?       Mr. WESSEL:  Well, this program was stuck into a 2002 law that renewed      President Bush's authority to negotiate trade agreements.  It's one of      those things they stick in because they have to feel like they're doing      something for workers.  First, Congress made it very complicated.  They      dropped the wage insurance phrase and called it `alternative trade      adjustment assistance,' which is hardly a worker-friendly phrase.  And      they put a number of restrictions on it, like you have to be able to show      that your skills aren't easily transferable in order to get the money,      and then the paperwork is sort of complicated.  And then the Labor      Department didn't handle it very well at first.  In fact, initially they      forget to put a little box on the form you fill out if you are laid off      because of trade, and there was no way to check the box that you were      applying for this thing.       They fixed that, but still it's been sort of clunky, hasn't gotten much      attention, and between August of 2003, when it started, and the end of      2004, a total of 1,400 people qualified for this aid.       INSKEEP:  Fourteen hundred.       Mr. WESSEL:  Right.  And we know, from all the headlines and horror      stories, that there's more people over 50 who've lost jobs because of      trade--it just--the program hasn't gotten--barely gotten off the ground.       INSKEEP:  Is this just because of the requirements you mentioned, people      actually have to come in and prove that they're not competent to take      over another job, for example?       Mr. WESSEL:  I think that's part of it.  Mostly what happens is unions or      companies or state agencies involved when a plant closes fill out the      forms for groups of workers, and although the Labor secretary talks about      it in speeches, there was no effort to promote this.  There's not even a      simple flier that explains it to workers.  So it's basically put into law      to make people feel better, but there hasn't been very much      follow-through.       INSKEEP:  You alluded to the headlines.  Is it fair to say that there are      millions of people who could use some assistance, who are being shifted      into lower-paying jobs right now?       Mr. WESSEL:  One of the frustrating things about these trade adjustment      assistance programs is they require you to show that it was trade rather      than something else, like new technology, that displaced you.  So there      are lots of people who have been displaced, clearly, hundreds of      thousands of people who have been displaced and been forced to take      lower-paying jobs.  How many of them are actually able to pin that on      trade as opposed to something else is anybody's guess.       INSKEEP:  So have lawmakers recognized that this program they put in      place isn't helping very many people, and are they doing anything about      it?       Mr. WESSEL:  Well, as far as I can tell, this has gotten very little      attention in Congress.  There are things that they could have done      legislatively when they passed the Central American Free Trade Act, for      instance, which was a logical place to do it.  But as far as I can tell,      it never came up in the discussions.  Within the Labor Department,      however, there is a sense that they could do better, and they've made      some steps to streamline the process and they tell me that they have some      new steps in the works to make it easier for people to apply for and get      something which Congress intends them to have.       INSKEEP:  David Wessel is deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall      Street Journal, not yet displaced.       Thanks, David.       Mr. WESSEL:  Thank you.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      There's a place in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, called the Million Dollar      Cowboy Bar.  They'll need it tonight for the equivalent of the Oscars for      economists, an exclusive annual soiree for the business world.  Central      bankers, Wall Street economists, former Treasury secretaries; they'll all      be there for this meeting, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas      City.  Joining us is \"Marketplace's\" John Dimsdale in Washington.      John, this meeting is especially special for this annual meeting of the      Federal Reserve.      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      That's right.  It's most likely the last one for Alan Greenspan, who's      been chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for 18 years now.  His term      expires in January, so there's going to be lots of talk about his legacy      and whether he made the right calls when the economy was going up or      down.  In fact, the Greenspan era is the theme for this year's meeting.      As usual, there's panel discussions, symposiums about the state of the      economy and interest rate policies and all the topics that economists get      excited about.  Plus, this year, there's added buzz in the hallways      that's prompted by Greenspan's retirement, the speculation about who his      successor will be.  And, you know, most if not all of the contenders will      be in Jackson Hole over the next couple days.      CHADWICK:  This is a very exclusive meeting.      DIMSDALE:  It attracts some of the biggest names in the world of      economics. The president of the European Central Bank, the governor of      the Bank of England, Robert Rubin, Larry Summers from the Clinton      administration are there this year.  It's invitation only, and it's      limited to 100 people.  You've probably heard of the World Economic Forum      that's held in Davos, Switzerland, every winter.  Well, that's more than      2,000 movers and shakers, and it's been crashed recently by jet-setters      and rock stars and movie actors.  In Jackson Hole, it's much more      exclusive.  Even some of the most important economists who want to be      there can't get an invite.  It's held in a small lodge in Grand Teton      National Park.  There's plenty of time for hiking and fishing and      recreation.  I'd call it a hot ticket, but supposedly there aren't even      tickets.  If you have to ask, you can't get in.      CHADWICK:  How about speculation on Alan Greenspan's replacement?  This      must be really what people are talking about.      DIMSDALE:  Yes.  Martin Feldstein is on most people's list.  He's been      around a long time, former economic adviser for Ronald Reagan; he's now      the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Ben Bernanke      is the current chief economic adviser for George Bush; he's a former Fed      member.  And Lawrence Lindsey, who's a former Fed member who also worked      in the Bush administration.

Maybe not anymore.  A new law in Hawaii gave the      state's Public Utilities Commission the right to cap gas prices.  Next      week, the first limits will go into effect.  On the island of Oahu, the      wholesale price of regular will be set at about $2. 16 a gallon.  Joining      us is Philip Verleger. He's an energy economist based in Aspen, Colorado.      Philip, how about Hawaii's plan?  Is this going to work?      Mr. PHILIP VERLEGER (Energy Economist):  Regretfully for the consumers in      Hawaii, no.  We've had experience with price controls.  China's had      experience with price controls.  Europe's had experience with price      controls.  And every time price controls are tried, one of two results      occurs.  Either shortages appear or the controls essentially do no good.      CHADWICK:  This is a response to the highest gas prices in the country.      Why would Hawaiians be paying the highest gas prices in the country?      There are two oil refineries in Hawaii in the islands.      Mr. VERLEGER:  Well, Hawaii pays higher prices because they are removed      from the rest of the country.  It costs more money to bring product in      from California or from Singapore than it does to any other part of the      world.  And the refineries are both small because the market's not very      large.      CHADWICK:  Well, this plan is to cap the wholesale prices to say, `You,      energy supplier companies, can only charge so much for a gallon. '  Still,      it's $2. 16. Isn't that enough for them to make money?      Mr. VERLEGER:  Well, it may be enough for them to make money in Hawaii,      but they may have opportunities to make more money by taking product to      other parts of the world.  The refiners in Hawaii can export product to      other parts of the country.  There's nothing Hawaii can do to stop those      refiners selling gasoline to California or to China.      CHADWICK:  The Public Utilities Commission has adopted this formula      whereby they are pegging the price to an average of gasoline wholesale      prices in California, New York and the Gulf Coast.  So they're trying to      be fair about it and return to the Hawaiian companies about what other      companies are getting.      Mr. VERLEGER:  That's right.  And we tried that from 1971 to 1980 in the      United States, and the trouble is that pricing that's tied to prices      today deny a refiner the opportunity to make more money if there's a      sudden increase in prices.  And so what'll happen is, if there is a      sudden increase in prices, product will be diverted.  In the '70s, we saw      product get diverted from the United States to other countries and      imports, primarily of heating oil from Europe, not come to New England      when the opportunity suddenly created a greater margin someplace else.      The problem with relying on a price that prevails today in California to      set the price in Hawaii tomorrow is that that price tomorrow in      California could be a lot higher and the product will suddenly go      someplace else and create a shortage.      CHADWICK:  Don't you think this comes about because people read about the      oil companies making billions of dollars in profits now with the rising      price of gasoline and the consumers, the voters, who the politicians are      responding to, are saying, `There's something wrong here.  They're making      billions of dollars in profits.  They're getting away with something.      They're not just paying more for oil.  They're charging us a lot more for      it'?      Mr. VERLEGER:  Well, you're absolutely right.  These legislative efforts      come about because consumers feel they're, quote, \"gouged,\" unquote.  And      I have a good deal of sympathy with the consumers.  I buy gasoline.  The      problem is that it takes a long time to build new refineries.  EPA      regulations have discouraged it and nobody has told the consumer that      there are going to be problems.  Yet we've known about them.  So the      consumer goes out and buys these large SUVs or these Hummers so the      demand keeps going up.  Well, if demand rises and supply doesn't, the      economic theory predicts prices have to go up.  You know, this really is      the long-term consequence of our failure to deal with the worsening fuel      economy of the vehicles we drive.

Here in California, none of that      mattered when Oakland's first Wal-Mart started hiring.  More than 11,000      people showed up to apply for just 350 jobs.  As NPR's Richard Gonzales      reports, some say that has everything to do with the shape of the Bay      area's economy.      (Soundbite of people cheering)      Unidentified Man:  Gimme a W!      Group of Workers:  W!      Unidentified Man:  A!      Group of Workers:  A!      Unidentified Man:  L!      Group of Workers:  L!      RICHARD GONZALES reporting:      Economically depressed East Oakland doesn't often have much to celebrate,      but yesterday, Wal-Mart's newest employees turned the opening of the      first Oakland store into a party.      (Soundbite of people cheering)      Unidentified Man:  . . . (Unintelligible)      Group of Workers:  Low prices always!  Woo!      Unidentified Man:  . . . (Unintelligible)      GONZALES:  They were among the chosen few, picked from among 11,000      applicants, all hoping to get a Wal-Mart job that pays an average of      $10. 82 an hour.  Jerri Charles(ph) was one of the lucky ones.  After      almost three years of office temp work, she's now managing the fabric      department.      Ms. JERRI CHARLES (New Wal-Mart Employee):  I'm real excited that they      chose me, you know, and to know that people will be coming in, buying      their fabrics and crafts to make their things from scratch.  It makes me      feel good to know that I'm able to help them out, with a smile, you know.      GONZALES:  Many of the new workers are like 25-year-old Claudia Garcia, a      working mom with a two-year-old daughter who had been unemployed for      several months.      Ms. CLAUDIA GARCIA (New Wal-Mart Employee):  It's a job or no job.  I      make more here than I do sitting at home watching TV and soap operas and      stuff.  I make a lot more than I do watching soap operas.      GONZALES:  But Oakland's unions aren't cheering.  A little more than a      block away from the new Wal-Mart, Wendell Chin of the Alameda County      Central Labor Council calls the new store a slap in the face.      Mr.  WENDELL CHIN (Alameda County Central Labor Council):  We feel this      is an insult, that they just set up a couple blocks away from the      Teamsters, the Longshore Warehouse Union, the janitors, the laborers,      Building Trades Construction Council.  Most of the labor unions in      Alameda County, a lot of them, are right across the street.      GONZALES:  Even as unions fight a worldwide battle with Wal-Mart, Chin      says he isn't surprised that 11,000 Oaklanders wanted to work there.      Mr. CHIN:  They should be happy to have a job.  We should check back with      them in three months, six months, a year, and see if they're still there      and how they feel then.  Will they have health care?  Will they have job      security? Will the workers be allowed to organize?      GONZALES:  Some economists say the huge demand for Wal-Mart jobs means      the San Francisco Bay area still isn't over the dot-com crash.  Economist      Stephen Levy says the crash claimed 400,000 jobs and only 20,000 have      been recovered.      Mr. STEPHEN LEVY (Economist):  The story really has, you know, nothing to      do with Wal-Mart and everything to do with why would there be 11,000      people queueing up for those jobs?  And it has to be that those Wal-Mart      jobs are the best thing that they see available, and that's a commentary      on the overall economy.      (Soundbite of people cheering)      Unidentified Woman:  . . . (Unintelligible) you all have a great day.      GONZALES:  Back at the new Oakland Wal-Mart, workers are all revved up,      but many local officials shy away.  City Councilman Larry Reid is the      only elected official in the crowd.  Reid says he's taken some heat for      helping to bring Wal-Mart into his district, but he offers no apologies.      Mr. LARRY REID (Oakland City Council):  (To crowd gathered) This might      not be the most political correct thing for me to do, to stand up here,      but I tell you, it is the right thing to do in the city of Oakland.  Be      proud of the fact that you work for Wal-Mart, and let no one else tell      you any different.      GONZALES:  Not long ago, this was just an empty field, says Reid.  Now,      he foresees it reaping about a half-million dollars in sales tax revenues      for his cash-strapped city.  Richard Gonzales, NPR News, Oakland.      MONTAGNE:  This is NPR News.       RENEE MONTAGNE, host:       Wal-Mart gets plenty of criticism for offering what some regard as      low-paying jobs and poor benefits.  Here in California, none of that      mattered when Oakland's first Wal-Mart started hiring.  More than 11,000      people showed up to apply for just 350 jobs.  As NPR's Richard Gonzales      reports, some say that has everything to do with the shape of the Bay      area's economy.       (Soundbite of people cheering)       Unidentified Man:  Gimme a W!       Group of Workers:  W!       Unidentified Man:  A!       Group of Workers:  A!       Unidentified Man:  L!       Group of Workers:  L!       RICHARD GONZALES reporting:       Economically depressed East Oakland doesn't often have much to celebrate,      but yesterday, Wal-Mart's newest employees turned the opening of the      first Oakland store into a party.       (Soundbite of people cheering)       Unidentified Man:  . . . (Unintelligible)       Group of Workers:  Low prices always!  Woo!       Unidentified Man:  . . . (Unintelligible)       GONZALES:  They were among the chosen few, picked from among 11,000      applicants, all hoping to get a Wal-Mart job that pays an average of      $10. 82 an hour.  Jerri Charles(ph) was one of the lucky ones.  After      almost three years of office temp work, she's now managing the fabric      department.       Ms. JERRI CHARLES (New Wal-Mart Employee):  I'm real excited that they      chose me, you know, and to know that people will be coming in, buying      their fabrics and crafts to make their things from scratch.  It makes me      feel good to know that I'm able to help them out, with a smile, you know.       GONZALES:  Many of the new workers are like 25-year-old Claudia Garcia, a      working mom with a two-year-old daughter who had been unemployed for      several months.       Ms. CLAUDIA GARCIA (New Wal-Mart Employee):  It's a job or no job.  I      make more here than I do sitting at home watching TV and soap operas and      stuff.  I make a lot more than I do watching soap operas.       GONZALES:  But Oakland's unions aren't cheering.  A little more than a      block away from the new Wal-Mart, Wendell Chin of the Alameda County      Central Labor Council calls the new store a slap in the face.       Mr.  WENDELL CHIN (Alameda County Central Labor Council):  We feel this      is an insult, that they just set up a couple blocks away from the      Teamsters, the Longshore Warehouse Union, the janitors, the laborers,      Building Trades Construction Council.

The      huge storm threatens New Orleans.  The threat is not only of a storm      surge swamping the city, but also to the nation's oil supply.  Louisiana      hosts a large number of refineries.  Oil production companies have      evacuated rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.  The threat to an already tight oil      supply market has caused the price of crude to rise on oil markets.      Joining me now is NPR's economics correspondent Jim Zarroli.      And, Jim, what's the latest from the oil markets as traders digest the      potential implication of Hurricane Katrina?      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      Well, oil prices hit more than $70 a barrel as the hurricane began to      approach the mainland.  This was, of course, a record.  Later, after the      storm was downgraded, it--prices fell back a bit, under $70.  I think      they're just a little over $68 a barrel now.  We also saw a big spike in      home heating oil and gasoline futures.  Home heating oil prices rose      above $2 for the first time ever.  So we're seeing some record prices.      MONTAGNE:  Now oil production companies have closed lots of refineries in      Louisiana in the past.  How important are they to the nation's supply of      gas?      ZARROLI:  Oh, very, very important.  And this comes at a time when      refining capacity is already in very short supply in the United States.      Any disruption at all in refining capacity can threaten oil prices quite      a bit.  Traders are very nervous about the situation, so this is really      the worst-case scenario for them.  If there's significant damage to oil      refineries, it could cause a lot of problems.      MONTAGNE:  And the refineries are important, right?  Even if there's      plenty of oil, they've--it's got to be refined?      ZARROLI:  Right, exactly.  Yeah. . .      MONTAGNE:  Yeah--go ahead.      ZARROLI:  No.  No, exactly.  No matter how much oil we have in--no matter      what oil supplies are, there has been a shortage of oil refining capacity      for a long time.      MONTAGNE:  Of course, we all know gas prices at the pump have risen      sharply in the last few weeks.  What about after this hurricane, are they      going to go even higher?      ZARROLI:  They could.  I mean, the real big question is going to be:      What kind of damage, if any, there is--ar--is to the refining capacity in      that area.  And that's something we just can't know right now.  You can      bet that a lot of traders are watching the situation very carefully.      MONTAGNE:  And another big component to the nation's energy sector is      natural gas.  How are prices of natural gas affected, if they are, as of      this morning?      ZARROLI:  They're also going up.  Really, there's so much uncertainty at      this point and there's so much nervousness on the part of traders.  I      mean, I think people just don't know what to expect.  One of the      questions right now that people are asking is what the federal government      will do.  One of the options open to the Bush administration to release      some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves.  That's clearly an option      for them.  That might calm the markets down a little bit.  But, you know,      we'll just have to wait and see.      MONTAGNE:  NPR's Jim Zarroli speaking to us from New York.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Hurricane damage to oil production in the Gulf of Mexico may prompt the      Bush administration to tap the nation's strategic oil reserve.  The      Energy Department says it will consider requests from US refiners who      face shipment delays after the hurricane.  For more on this, we're joined      by Bob Moon from the \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.      Bob, welcome back.  And how much of an impact is the hurricane going to      have on energy supplies?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Hi, Alex.  Hurricane Katrina took aim at the      very heart of oil production off the Gulf Coast.  Normally about one and      a half million barrels of US crude are pumped out of the Gulf every      single day. That's a quarter of the nation's domestic oil output, and it      makes up almost 2 percent of global production.  Well, we know that more      than 40 percent of that production had to be shut down as Katrina      approached, and we could see that number go way up today as more      operators report to the government on how production has been affected.      There is some concern today that the storm may have made a direct hit on      a couple of key offshore ports where oil is loaded onto the ships.  Crews      are hoping to get out as soon as the worst of the storm passes for some      helicopter fly-bys to see just how bad the damage really has been to the      big oil platforms out in the Gulf.      On shore, there is at least some hope that some of the big refineries may      have been spared the worst damage by the storm's slight jog toward the      east.  Over the weekend, refinery operators have reported that at least      eight facilities with a combined capacity of 1. 8 million barrels a day      had been shut down. Those are refineries.  Remains to be seen just how      quickly they can be brought back online.      All this triggered a surge to a new all-time record high today in the      price of oil, above $70 a barrel.  That was briefly this morning here on      the New York Mercantile Exchange.  But those prices have eased off a bit      as the oil markets wait to hear how bad the damage really has been.      CHADWICK:  What about other possible effects, just general shipping along      the Mississippi River?  Is that being disrupted?      MOON:  Yeah, at least in the short term, you have the potential for      delays in, for example, grain shipments down the Mississippi from the      Midwest.  I remember back when Hurricane Andrew hit just to the west of      New Orleans back in 1992, I drove across miles and miles of a flattened      sugarcane crop in south Louisiana.  This time the hurricane hit to the      other side of New Orleans, so that damage won't be as bad.  But      hurricane-force winds did stretch out over a much wider area this time,      so that's another area that we'll be looking at.      CHADWICK:  And this is going to cost the insurance industry something,      isn't it?      MOON:  Yeah.  A company called Eqecat does computer modeling of the      possible damage, and it estimated that the storm could cost insurers as      much as $25 billion.  That would make it the costliest hurricane on      record here.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we'll be looking further into how      the hurricane will be affecting oil prices.      CHADWICK:  Thank you.      Bob Moon of public radio's daily business show \"Marketplace\" from      American Public Media.       ALEX CHADWICK, host:       Back now with DAY TO DAY.

Oil prices surged briefly above      $70 a barrel and natural gas rose 20 percent.  As NPR's Jim Zarroli      reports, the energy industry is waiting to find out whether the storm      caused lasting damage to the refineries and oil platforms in the Gulf.      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      As the storm approached the Gulf Coast this morning, economists were      already speculating about its potential impact.  Chris Varvares,      president of Macroeconomic Advisers, says the storm's reach could be even      greater than it appears.      Mr. CHRIS VARVARES (President, Macroeconomic Advisers):  It's likely to      have significant impacts, obviously, on the regional economy, but these      could be large enough even to have some impact on the national economy,      at least for a temporary period.      ZARROLI:  The reason is energy.  The importance of the Gulf to the      nation's energy industry can hardly be overestimated.  About 35 percent      of the oil produced in the United States comes out of the Gulf, as does      about a quarter of the natural gas consumed domestically.  The waters of      the Gulf are home to numerous drilling platforms.  Daniel Yergin is      president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.      Mr. DANIEL YERGIN (President, Cambridge Energy Research Associates):      These platforms are made to withstand huge pressure, huge waves--the sort      of onslaught of the elements.  But as we saw last year with Hurricane      Ivan, these really do test the integrity of the structures.      ZARROLI:  As the storm approached this weekend, many energy companies      shut down their facilities in the Gulf and evacuated their workers.  Mark      Stultz is a spokesman for the Natural Gas Supply Association.      Mr. MARK STULTZ (Spokesman, Natural Gas Supply Association):  We won't      know how much damage there actually is until we can get helicopters back      out there to do a survey and take a look at the structural integrity of      those platforms.      ZARROLI:  The Gulf Coast is also home to a large number of oil      refineries, and many of them are at risk of flooding or other damage.      The possibility that refineries could be shut down for an extended period      is a big concern in the oil industry.  Refining capacity is already      extremely tight around the world, and in recent months, any threat to a      major oil refinery has sent prices sharply higher.  Daniel Yergin says      that's one of the reasons the hurricane sent oil prices soaring.      Mr. YERGIN:  Depending on how bad it is in terms of damage, this could be      yet another major shock to an already fragile global oil supply system.      ZARROLI:  And that could be a blow to the nation's economy, especially at      a time when energy prices have already risen steadily, and fear about the      storm's impact sent stock prices down somewhat early in the day.  But as      the morning wore on and the storm was downgraded, oil prices finished the      day up a little more than a dollar.  That's still a record finish, but      many traders seemed to end the day a little less anxious than they began      it.  Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.       ROBERT SIEGEL, host:       A big part of the country's oil and gas production takes place in the      area hit by Hurricane Katrina, and the approach of the storm sent energy      prices to record levels this morning.  Oil prices surged briefly above      $70 a barrel and natural gas rose 20 percent.  As NPR's Jim Zarroli      reports, the energy industry is waiting to find out whether the storm      caused lasting damage to the refineries and oil platforms in the Gulf.       JIM ZARROLI reporting:       As the storm approached the Gulf Coast this morning, economists were      already speculating about its potential impact.  Chris Varvares,      president of Macroeconomic Advisers, says the storm's reach could be even      greater than it appears.       Mr. CHRIS VARVARES (President, Macroeconomic Advisers):  It's likely to      have significant impacts, obviously, on the regional economy, but these      could be large enough even to have some impact on the national economy,      at least for a temporary period.       ZARROLI:  The reason is energy.  The importance of the Gulf to the      nation's energy industry can hardly be overestimated.  About 35 percent      of the oil produced in the United States comes out of the Gulf, as does      about a quarter of the natural gas consumed domestically.  The waters of      the Gulf are home to numerous drilling platforms.  Daniel Yergin is      president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.       Mr. DANIEL YERGIN (President, Cambridge Energy Research Associates):      These platforms are made to withstand huge pressure, huge waves--the sort      of onslaught of the elements.  But as we saw last year with Hurricane      Ivan, these really do test the integrity of the structures.       ZARROLI:  As the storm approached this weekend, many energy companies      shut down their facilities in the Gulf and evacuated their workers.  Mark      Stultz is a spokesman for the Natural Gas Supply Association.       Mr. MARK STULTZ (Spokesman, Natural Gas Supply Association):  We won't      know how much damage there actually is until we can get helicopters back      out there to do a survey and take a look at the structural integrity of      those platforms.       ZARROLI:  The Gulf Coast is also home to a large number of oil      refineries, and many of them are at risk of flooding or other damage.      The possibility that refineries could be shut down for an extended period      is a big concern in the oil industry.  Refining capacity is already      extremely tight around the world, and in recent months, any threat to a      major oil refinery has sent prices sharply higher.  Daniel Yergin says      that's one of the reasons the hurricane sent oil prices soaring.       Mr. YERGIN:  Depending on how bad it is in terms of damage, this could be      yet another major shock to an already fragile global oil supply system.

At least eight refineries in the path      of Hurricane Katrina shut down or reduced operations.  David Purcell is a      partner at the research firm, Pickering Energy Partners.  He joins me on      the line from Houston.      Good morning.      Mr. DAVID PURCELL (Pickering Energy Partners):  Good morning.      MONTAGNE:  What can you tell us about the damage to the oil      infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico?      Mr. PURCELL:  Well, we've got a little daylight this morning so we're      starting to get back some preliminary news reports.  And what we do know,      we've got a couple drilling rigs that are missing.  We have a couple      other drilling rigs that are kind of where they weren't supposed to be,      so they've floated around and--which tells you that the wind and waves      were--confirmed what we knew, the wind and waves were strong.  This was a      big storm.      Now more specifically, we've been able to do some assessment of some      ports in southern Louisiana, right on the coast, and these are very      important staging areas when--after a hurricane, to get people back out      onto the platforms and get equipment back out there to repair any damage      and to restore production quickly.  So it doesn't mean production can't      be restored; it's just going to take longer to get production back on.      MONTAGNE:  Well, I think what--the question everybody will be thinking      right now is, how is that going to affect the oil prices and most      particularly in the short term?      Mr. PURCELL:  Yeah, I think in the short term, it's interesting; the      commodity prices are high today because yesterday it was uncertain what      the nature of the damage is, and as we get more confirmed reports in, it      looks like--you know, the initial reports show that there's a      considerable amount of damage.  And I think the market's been      extrapolating that to--saying, you know, `This could be as bad or worse      than Ivan from a production impact. '  In other words, it's going to take      awhile to get production back on.  And on top of that, we have      information from some refineries in the New Orleans area that they may be      down for as much as two weeks because of some light flooding and, more      importantly, power outages.  They're just not clear when they're going      to--when a reliable power supply will be restored back to the area.      MONTAGNE:  Well, to the question of oil prices going up, what about      retail gasoline prices?  Would they now. . .      Mr. PURCELL:  Well, when oil. . .      MONTAGNE:  . . . go up?      Mr. PURCELL:  Yeah, when oil prices go up, gasoline prices go up on the      wholesale level, and your local guy is going to--local gas station owner      is going to have to increase prices.  So look to pay more at the pump,      and not just a couple pennies more; it looks like you're going to be      paying 10 to 20 cents a gallon more here in the next week or two if this      scenario we just painted holds.      MONTAGNE:  And as we've just heard from our reporter, David Greene,      President Bush is considering whether to tap into the nation's emergency      petroleum reserve.  What effect would that have on the market?      Mr. PURCELL:  It probably has a little bit of a dampening impact on the      market, but we don't have necessarily a shortage of crude oil.  We have      more a shortage of gasoline and refined products.  A Strategic Petroleum      Reserve release, we just don't think, is going to do much.  But that      said, it's about the only thing Washington can do right now.      MONTAGNE:  Thank you very much for talking with us.      Mr. PURCELL:  You bet.

But the      shutdown of numerous refineries and drilling platforms in the region      appears likely to send retail gasoline prices sharply higher in the days      to come.  NPR's Jim Zarroli has that part of the story.      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      There were scattered reports today of damage to some of the oil- and      gas-drilling platforms that dot the Gulf.  Royal Dutch/Shell said the      upper deck of its huge Mars platform, which produces 147,000 barrels of      oil a day, had been damaged.  Rowan Companies said one of its 22 rigs was      missing and may have capsized.  The important Colonial Pipeline that runs      from Houston to New York is down.  But the critical Louisiana Offshore      Oil Port, which handles 1. 3 million barrels of imported oil each day,      appears to be in good shape.      Of more immediate concern is the condition of the many refineries along      the Gulf.  Nearly all of them are down because of power outages.  And      some big energy companies began warning their distributors today that      they wouldn't be able to provide all the gasoline they need.  As a      result, the price of unleaded gasoline shot up as much as 25 cents a      gallon on the spot market. Mary Welge, an analyst with the Oil Price      Information Service, said consumers could see increases of 10 to 30 cents      a gallon at the pumps within days.      Ms. MARY WELGE (Oil Price Information Service):  The reason I say that is      because, obviously, we've got many refineries and pipelines down, and      that creates an automatic shortage of product.  And yet we've got demand      that is still higher than it was last year.      ZARROLI:  Whether prices stay high will depend, in part, on whether any      lasting damage was done to the refineries, something no one knows yet.      Refining capacity is extremely tight in the world right now, and even the      loss of one facility for any extended period could send prices even      higher.  With prices rising, there was growing pressure on the Bush      administration to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but      that would do little to ease shortages if refineries and pipelines remain      offline.

I'm Robert Siegel.      Hurricane Katrina is leaving its mark at the gas pumps.  Gasoline was      selling for more than $3 a gallon in many parts of the country.  The      storm disrupted the vast energy production and distribution facilities      throughout the Gulf Coast.  And today the Bush administration said it      would open the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help address the      problem.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      Ninety-five percent of the oil refineries in the Gulf have been shut down      since Hurricane Katrina swept through the region.  Some are flooded and      may have sustained permanent damage, but even those that were spared are      offline because of power outages.  And with refineries down, many energy      traders are growing increasingly worried about gasoline supplies.  Dan      Pickering is head of Pickering Energy Partners.      Mr. DAN PICKERING (Pickering Energy Partners):  The issue here continues      to be that demand has not abated but supply has been reduced.  And so      you've seen wholesale prices move up 20 to 30 percent just in the last      few days.      ZARROLI:  As supplies have tightened, Katrina's impact is being felt in      parts of the country far from the Gulf.  At a gas station in downtown      Chicago today, regular unleaded gasoline was selling for 2. 99 a gallon.      Paul Popernack showed up at the station carrying a gasoline can.      Popernack said he had been trying to find a station selling inexpensive      gas when his car ran out of fuel.      Mr. PAUL POPERNACK:  I took a chance, and I gambled and I lost on how      much gas I could get by with, and now I have to go back.  So I'm paying      the price of being a penny-pincher with the gas, I guess.      ZARROLI:  With prices climbing, the Bush administration announced several      moves aimed at easing the shortage.  Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said the      government would lend crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to      energy companies that are having trouble finding enough oil.  Bodman      acknowledged this would do little to solve the problem of refining      capacity.      Secretary SAM BODMAN (Energy Department):  It will help, but it's not      going to solve the problem.  It's a little bit like the energy bill; no      one thing solves the problem.  We're going to need a lot of help in a lot      of different directions.      ZARROLI:  The government will also ease certain air quality standards      through September 15th in order to expedite gasoline production.  Bodman      noted that much of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure is located in      the Gulf and that it had been severely wounded by the storm.  He said the      industry would recover, but it will take time.      Sec. BODMAN:  We're doing everything we can do at the federal level and      at the state level, I know, to relieve the pressures there.  I wish I had      a magic wand that could solve the problem.  I don't.  So that consumers      ought to expect, I believe, prices they don't like to see.  I would hope      that we would find ways of people conserving their use of fuel, both for      economic reasons and for the common good.      ZARROLI:  Meanwhile, many big oil and gas companies continue to assess      the damage to their facilities.  At least one oil company said it was      having trouble finding helicopters so it could inspect its rigs.  Dan      Pickering says oil and gas companies will do what it takes to get their      facilities restarted.      Mr. PICKERING:  With commodity prices where they are, the energy industry      certainly has a big incentive to spend that money, to push as hard as      they can because they're obviously foregoing a lot of profitability with      shut-in production at current prices.      ZARROLI:  But it may be many days before these companies understand the      extent of the damage they've suffered and what they have to do to get      back online. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

It's sure to be costly for the nation's energy consumers, with oil and      gas prices rising sharply in Katrina's wake.  NPR's Scott Horsley      reports.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      The price of gasoline on the futures market soared more than 41 cents a      gallon yesterday amid fears that Hurricane Katrina may have done lasting      damage to Gulf Coast oil refineries.  So far, retail pump prices have not      shown that kind of increase, but Justin McNaull of AAA says drivers are      seeing more modest price jumps of a few pennies at a time.      Mr. JUSTIN McNAULL (AAA):  The question remains to be seen how much of      the frenzied bidding up that's going on at the futures level will      ultimately get passed across at the consumer side.  Or will the futures      market sort of correct itself without causing too much of a price      increase for us as motorists?      HORSLEY:  Much of that will depend on how quickly Gulf Coast refineries      shut down by the storm can be restarted.  Ordinarily, those refineries      produce about a million barrels of gasoline a day, or more than 10      percent of the nation's total.  Doug MacIntyre of the Energy Department's      information arm says there's no telling yet how long the country will      have to get by without that gas.      Mr. DOUG MacINTYRE (Energy Department):  First thing, you have to get the      employees back.  Then the second thing, then they have to do an      assessment of if there was any damage to the refineries.  And the third,      and what may be the most problematic, is they need to get the electrical      power systems in these refineries restored, 'cause without electricity,      they just are unable to produce.      HORSLEY:  None of those steps will happen overnight.  Several Louisiana      refineries were reported to be under water yesterday.  Chevron was doing      aerial inspections of its refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, wary of      putting people on the ground until their safety could be assured.      Marathon Oil was bringing in relief supplies for the skeleton crew at its      refinery in Garyville, Louisiana.  Spokeswoman Angelia Graves says with      some 400 workers to account for, employee safety is Marathon's biggest      concern.      Ms. ANGELIA GRAVES (Marathon Oil Spokeswoman):  We actually had employees      there that were in the facility during the storm, and they've been able      to get out into the refinery and they're the ones that are doing the      assessment. We've also brought some additional employees back into this      facility.      HORSLEY:  Graves could not predict how quickly that assessment might be      done or when the refinery might resume operation.  She adds the impact of      the hurricane is already being felt far beyond the Gulf region.      Ms. GRAVES:  We actually have seven refineries in our network throughout      the United States.  You know, we have been running those refineries all      out so that we could keep up with the supply, but they, too, have been      impacted because the oil port where they off-load crude oil was also shut      down.  So crude oil has not been coming up into some of those refineries      that are located in the Midwest.      HORSLEY:  One encouraging note:  An initial assessment of Louisiana's      offshore oil port found no apparent catastrophic damage.  Ordinarily,      that port handles about a million barrels of crude oil a day.  Crude oil      production in the Gulf is still at a virtual standstill and some      lawmakers are calling on President Bush to tap the Strategic Petroleum      Reserve to make up for the missing oil. AAA's Justin McNaull isn't sure      that would help.      Mr. McNAULL:  The real concern on the distribution side of things is the      refineries.  And depending on how well they've come through the storm, we      might not have the capacity to refine a lot more crude oil even if it      were made available.  And that really is the choke point or the hiccup      that we could be looking at in the distribution process.      HORSLEY:  McNaull's advice for drivers is go easy on the gas and resist      panic buying to avoid a run on filling stations.  Scott Horsley, NPR      News.

The hurricane has already      caused disruptions to oil production that temporarily pushed the price of      oil passed the $70 mark.  Yesterday, the Bush administration announced it      will release millions of barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic      Petroleum Reserve.  The question is:  Will that be enough to keep the      economy from falling into recession?  We turn now to David Wessel, deputy      Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal who joins us in our      studio.      Good morning.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (The Wall Street Journal):  Good morning      MONTAGNE:  Is this hurricane the last straw for the economy?      Mr. WESSEL:  Anybody who gives a firm yes or no to that question is      lying. The right answer is it depends and what it mostly depends on is      just how long all the energy production and refining capacity in the Gulf      of Mexico is out of commission.  If it's out for a long time, it really      could slow the economy so much that unemployment rises or even threatens      a recession.  It's not only energy that goes through New Orleans, of      course.  It's a very important Mississippi port for grain and for imports      and exports.  And if the ports are closed for a while, that'll just make      things even worse.      MONTAGNE:  Other hurricanes, Andrew in 1992, for instance, they caused a      lot of damage but it didn't have a big national impact.  What makes      Katrina different.      Mr. WESSEL:  The question here is whether this one is so disruptive to      the energy supplies of the nation at a time when they were already tight      that it makes the difference between an economy that's been growing at      better than 3 percent and one that slows so much that unemployment starts      to rise.  The answer to the question will that happen really depends on      how long does it take to get these energy facilities, particularly the      refineries in the Gulf, back in business, and it's going to be a while.      The question is:  Is it weeks and we have $70-a-barrel oil?  Or is it      months and we have $100-a-barrel oil?      MONTAGNE:  David, let's take a step back.  Oil prices have been soaring      for months, but the economy has been perking along.  How come?      Mr. WESSEL:  That's a very good question.  Basically, oil prices have      been going up largely because demand is so strong.  The economy was doing      so well here and in China and elsewhere that it was pushing up the price      of oil.  And you don't get recessions because there's too much demand in      the economy.  This is now different.  This is an interruption in the      supply of energy.  It has the same effect on the economy as if OPEC had      turned the spigot and started producing less, and that can have much more      serious economic effects.      MONTAGNE:  So in a way, Katrina changes everything.      Mr. WESSEL:  Katrina could change everything, yes.      MONTAGNE:  What about the notion that Katrina will result in a      reconstruction boom?  It happens after these natural disasters.  Could      jobs actually be added in this case?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, there will be some jobs that wouldn't have otherwise      been created, of course, all those reconstruction jobs and rescue workers      and all that stuff.  But, of course, there are a lot of jobs that will      never return or have been lost for a long period of time.  It's hard to      balance those out. But the important thing to remember is the way we      count the economy is sort of wacky.  You lose a whole city and it never      shows up in the government gross domestic product account.  That's just a      loss of wealth.  And so you sometimes see more of the positive effects in      the government indicators than you do see the downward effects.  But this      is not a net plus for the economy.      MONTAGNE:  David, thanks very much.      Mr. WESSEL:  You welcome.

This comes after Hurricane Katrina shut down      eight oil refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi, and power failures      from the storm slowed the flow of petroleum through several of the      nation's pipelines.  NPR's Adam Hochberg reports.      ADAM HOCHBERG reporting:      Chapel Hill, North Carolina, is far removed from the devastation of      Hurricane Katrina, but people here are feeling the storm's effects in a      different way.      (Soundbite of beeping)      HOCHBERG:  Like many North Carolina motorists, homemaker Jenny      McGlown(ph) spent part of this morning searching for gasoline.  She      finally found a station that had some, albeit at the price of $3. 19 a      gallon.      Ms. JENNY McGLOWN (Homemaker):  It's horrifying.  I'm horrified having to      pay this.  But all the other gas stations up and down this road are out      of gas. And this one, still having a supply, can afford to jack their      price up because we don't know where else to go.      HOCHBERG:  North Carolina is one of several states where gas is in short      supply, mostly in the Southeast, which is largely dependent on Gulf Coast      petroleum.  Many stations here are out of regular unleaded.  So at a Hess      station in Chapel Hill, customer Bill Masengale was filling his 1990 Audi      with more expensive premium gas.      Mr. BILL MASENGALE:  I've heard all sorts of scares, scares of no gas in      Asheville, no gas here, no gas there, eight-dollar-a-gallon gas.  So I      just paid $37. 79 so I can go to work.      HOCHBERG:  Even at those prices, stations are having a hard time meeting      demand.  Many have not received new gas shipments this week since Katrina      struck.  In some North Carolina counties, more than 20 percent of      stations are out of fuel entirely.  At a Chapel Hill Citgo station, owner      David Newton(ph) says his supplies ran dry early today.      Mr. DAVID NEWTON (Citgo Station Owner):  Oh, our competitors ran out of      gas last night, and we had a run on gas last night, and we eventually ran      out this morning.      HOCHBERG:  Around lunchtime, Newton was waiting for a tanker truck to      arrive and replenish his supply.  He hoped to be able to turn his pumps      back on by midafternoon.  Until then, all he could offer was apologies to      the steady line of motorists who pulled in to fill up their cars.  And as      a small businessman, Newton said it hurt his bottom line to turn      customers away.      Mr. NEWTON:  Especially since everyone's looking for gas, it's even more      of an impact.  If it was a normal day and we didn't have gas, it wouldn't      be such a big deal.  But because everyone actually is driving around      looking for gas, then it has more of an impact on the business.      HOCHBERG:  The petroleum industry blames the supply problems on      hurricane-related power failures that have crippled two Gulf Coast      pipelines. Those pipelines together provide about 90 percent of the      gasoline in the Southeast US.  Bill Weatherspoon heads the North Carolina      Petroleum Council.      Mr. BILL WEATHERSPOON (North Carolina Petroleum Council):  What has      happened is that those pipelines have pumping stations in Louisiana and      Mississippi, and the electric supply has not been available to the      pumping stations.  So we don't have a shortage of gasoline; we have a      delivery problem due to the electricity.      HOCHBERG:  Pipeline operators say they are making progress      re-establishing service.  Through the use of generators, one of the major      pipelines now is operating at partial capacity.  Still, people in the      Southeast are being encouraged to conserve fuel.  North Carolina Governor      Mike Easley has suspended non-essential travel by state employees and is      asking North Carolinians to car pool.  Meanwhile, in Georgia, Governor      Sonny Perdue is suggesting residents stay close to home this Labor Day      weekend.      Governor SONNY PERDUE (Republican, Georgia):  Just hang out with your      families, enjoy their comfort.  Any discretionary driving that you'd      planned, why don't you just relax and spend the time with your families      at home?      HOCHBERG:  Several gas stations in the Southeast have raised prices above      $4 a gallon.  One Atlanta station was selling premium unleaded for 5. 19.      Governor Perdue signed an executive order last night allowing Georgia to      fine stations that engage in price gouging, and governors in several      other states have promised to take similar action.

If it was a normal day and we didn't have gas, it wouldn't      be such a big deal.  But because everyone actually is driving around      looking for gas, then it has more of an impact on the business.       HOCHBERG:  The petroleum industry blames the supply problems on      hurricane-related power failures that have crippled two Gulf Coast      pipelines. Those pipelines together provide about 90 percent of the      gasoline in the Southeast US.  Bill Weatherspoon heads the North Carolina      Petroleum Council.       Mr. BILL WEATHERSPOON (North Carolina Petroleum Council):  What has      happened is that those pipelines have pumping stations in Louisiana and      Mississippi, and the electric supply has not been available to the      pumping stations.  So we don't have a shortage of gasoline; we have a      delivery problem due to the electricity.       HOCHBERG:  Pipeline operators say they are making progress      re-establishing service.  Through the use of generators, one of the major      pipelines now is operating at partial capacity.  Still, people in the      Southeast are being encouraged to conserve fuel.  North Carolina Governor      Mike Easley has suspended non-essential travel by state employees and is      asking North Carolinians to car pool.  Meanwhile, in Georgia, Governor      Sonny Perdue is suggesting residents stay close to home this Labor Day      weekend.       Governor SONNY PERDUE (Republican, Georgia):  Just hang out with your      families, enjoy their comfort.  Any discretionary driving that you'd      planned, why don't you just relax and spend the time with your families      at home?       HOCHBERG:  Several gas stations in the Southeast have raised prices above      $4 a gallon.  One Atlanta station was selling premium unleaded for 5. 19.      Governor Perdue signed an executive order last night allowing Georgia to      fine stations that engage in price gouging, and governors in several      other states have promised to take similar action.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Here's one measure of how badly oil and natural gas prices have been      disrupted by Hurricane Katrina.  In Atlanta, Georgia, today, gas was      going for more than $5 a gallon.  That's not all.  Seaports from Alabama      to Louisiana have suffered damage as well, and these are entry points for      things coming into the country and exit points for things that American      producers are trying to export:  chemicals and grains and agriculture.      Joining us is John Dimsdale, Washington bureau chief for \"Marketplace. \"      John, how about shipping and trade along the Gulf?      JOHN DIMSDALE (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, just about every port in the area      remains shut down, although just today officials were finally able to      open one.  The port of Mobile, Alabama, is now open to smaller boats.      But essentially, the docks that handle a quarter of the country's      waterborne trade are still clogged up.  Barges are backing up in the      Mississippi and Missouri and Ohio River systems.      Now the ships that are bringing in products from outside the US have a      few more options, and they're scrambling to find alternate ports to take      their goods.  But that means rerouting all sort of rail and trucking      systems on land, so there's going to be supply disruptions for a lot      products throughout the entire country for weeks and maybe months.      CHADWICK:  Well, oil and gas we know about, but what other kinds of      products?      DIMSDALE:  Well, first, there are the indigenous crops from the area:      oysters, crabs, sugar.  Ten percent of the country's chickens come      through Mississippi.  A lot of fruit imports come through the Gulf.  A      major Chiquita banana facility in Gulfport, Mississippi, has been really      damaged.  There's imported lumber for construction, rubber for tires.      Kurt Nagle, the president of the American Association of Port      Authorities, says there are 360 ports in the US, and others will      eventually be able to pick up the slack.      Mr. KURT NAGLE (President, American Association of Port Authorities):  In      the short term, things like coffee and bananas, fruit, etc. , that flow      very heavily through New Orleans and Gulfport--there may be limited      issues while that cargo is being diverted through other ports to      ultimately reach the shelves.  But the bottom line is that those cargos      will be able to find alternative ports to handle that in the short term      to help keep those commodities flowing.      CHADWICK:  And does that apply to exports as well, John?      DIMSDALE:  Absolutely.  I mean, a lot of farmers are worried about this      fall's harvest.  Half of the nation's grain shipments go through the      loading docks on the Gulf that are now shut down.  And while most of the      corn and soybeans and wheat is still in the ground, when the harvest      starts reaching those ports in October and November, there's a real      question whether the harbors will be able to handle the flow.  And there      aren't many alternative ways to get those shipments out, which raises the      specter of these grain silos just bursting at the seams with no place for      the surplus to go.      Coming up later on \"Marketplace,\" we're going to look at how all this      disruption will affect the availability of consumer products around the      country.      CHADWICK:  OK, good story.

On average, single-family home prices have risen 50 percent      nationwide over the past five years.  That run-up has many observers      concerned, but many home builders say they don't see a bubble bursting      anytime soon.  NPR's Jack Speer reports.      (Soundbite of construction)      JACK SPEER reporting:      In Olney, Maryland, a suburb near Washington, DC, builder Chuck Ellison      surveys the progress on a group of million-dollar homes going up in what      will soon be a new neighborhood.      Mr. CHUCK ELLISON (Builder):  We're standing behind two of our larger      model homes--two of Miller and Smith's larger model homes in a community      that's called Springview.  This is a 33-lot community that we started      probably three to four years ago.  It's actually probably been in the      works with the planning and all for almost six years.  You can see it's a      pretty nice setting with the park land and the open space around it.  So      it's turning out to be a great community.      (Soundbite of construction)      SPEER:  Inside, Ellison shows off the interior of the four-bedroom,      three-and-a-half-bath house.  As workers cut and hammer drywall into      place, he points out some of the special features this home will have,      including granite counter tops in the kitchen and crown molding      throughout the house which increases the time it takes to build the home.      (Soundbite of construction)      Mr. ELLISON:  Normally, it's between five to six months for a house this      size.  You know, it's a fairly big house.  It's got a lot of finish.  We      put a lot of options in them, so it takes a little bit longer to do this      kind of house than it does to do a town house or a smaller home.      (Soundbite of construction)      SPEER:  How many square feet is this roughly?      Mr. ELLISON:  I'd have to double check, but it's probably right around      4,500. Not counting the basement.      SPEER:  Ellison says the last few years have been good ones, and when he      gets together with other builders, they joke about their good fortune.      House prices in the Washington area have risen nearly 100 percent since      2000. Properties like this one are being sold even before they're      completed.  That's one reason Ellison is confident.      Mr. ELLISON:  I don't know of anybody in the industry that feels that      there's a housing bubble out there.      (Soundbite of construction)      SPEER:  Another reason builders say they aren't overly concerned is that      strong economic fundamentals continue to fuel demand for housing.  Along      with strong jobs growth and relatively low mortgage rates, there's just      not that many new homes on the market in many areas.  And even if that      situation were to change, Ellison says many builders and banks are      actually more cautious now than they were in the past.      Mr. ELLISON:  Before the last slump, which was in the late '80s or early      '90s, it was a lot easier for builders to borrow money.  You know,      nowadays, we have to put a lot more equity and personal income into      projects.  So, you know, you're going to be a lot more careful on a      project that's harder to get it under way.  So that's changed a lot.      The other big change is the slow-growth, the no-growth, approach of many      local governments, which is really a phenomena throughout the country      which has reduced supply of land.  And land is our raw product.      SPEER:  But even so, there is a growing chorus of those who think home      prices in some areas are headed for a fall.  Marco Van Akkeren is an      economist with PMI, a mortgage insurance company that protects lenders      and investors against possible defaults.  He says the picture could      change rapidly, especially if there's a major shift in housing      fundamentals.      Mr. MARCO VAN AKKEREN (PMI):  Builders tend to be somewhat, you know,      backward looking; see how the past several years have done.  And there's      a lot of construction activity at the same time, you know, all the job      growth that has occurred, you know.  Especially in Southern California      for example, a lot of that is associated with building construction,      which could be very sensitive to swings in mortgage rates.      SPEER:  After surveying the hottest housing markets, PMI came to the      conclusion there's a better than even chance of price declines in half a      dozen markets, places such as San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino,      Boston, and Nassau County in New York.  David Lereah is chief economist      at the National Association of Realtors.  He agrees there are areas of      the country where prices have probably risen too quickly, but he says he      is not in the bubble camp.      Mr. DAVID LEREAH (Chief Economist, National Association of Realtors):  I      would rather think of it as maybe overheating right now, rather than a      bubble, because I don't necessarily think that it can pop.  I do think      that if you want to use the imagery of bubbles, it's air coming out of a      balloon rather than balloons popping.      (Soundbite of construction)      SPEER:  At his latest development site, Chuck Ellison hopes the      economists who see a bubble popping are wrong.  As long as interest rates      remain low, home buying will hold up, he says, though he does expect the      housing market to cool.  As for the immediate future, he says his company      plans on building just as many new homes next year.      (Soundbite of construction)      Mr. ELLISON:  `06 we're--we think it'll be more of the same.  We have not      seen any fundamentals out there that would cause us to pull back or      change our strategies.  We think it's going to be a good solid market,      that there's certainly buyers there.  I think our biggest concern is the      availability of land and negotiating the land development regulations.      (Soundbite of construction)      SPEER:  After they finish work on this development, Ellison says, they      have 15 to 20 more projects lined up.  But Wall Street has been signaling      it's increasingly worried about the housing market in the future.      Despite the recent record earnings from many large home builders, a      number of building company stocks have moved lower in recent months.      Jack Speer, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Robert Siegel.      And joining us now from Baton Rouge is Charles Foti, who is the attorney      general of the state of Louisiana and, before becoming attorney general      in 2004, spent 30 years as the criminal sheriff of Orleans Parish that is      in New Orleans.      Mr. CHARLES FOTI (Louisiana State Attorney General):  It's a pleasure to      be here.      SIEGEL:  How long before law and order returns to New Orleans?      Mr. FOTI:  Well, actually it's returning right now.  In the process that      you've had--this is almost like a war zone, OK?  It's like that a city      has been shelled and there's only maybe one way out.  As we were rescuing      people that were trapped on their roofs or in their attics, everybody's      attention from the NOPD turned to the rescue effort, because most of the      time when you have these type of problems, the best in people comes out.      But in this case we have a small criminal element decided to take      advantage of the situation. From the public safety side, we had two jails      that were flooded.  They had no electricity.  They had no air.  They had      no food, no water.      SIEGEL:  Where are the inmates of those jails today?      Mr. FOTI:  They have been scattered through the state of Louisiana in      Department of Corrections facilities throughout the state.  In that      process we had to put them in small boats, transport them to an overpass      and then build scaffolding to get them down from the overpass because      that's how high the water is, to where the buses were and then transport      them out.      SIEGEL:  Attorney General Foti, let me ask you about a couple of      scenes. . .      Mr. FOTI:  Sure.      SIEGEL:  . . . that we've heard described out of New Orleans.  One of them      is a police precinct with police inside defending themselves from gunmen      outside. Another is--we've heard this from people via e-mail--police      officers getting out of their uniforms to try to get out of New Orleans      because they fear their safety would be at risk if they were seen in      their uniforms.  It seems. . .      Mr. FOTI:  Let me. . .      SIEGEL:  It seems that there's a pretty bad relationship between whoever      is left in the city and the police at this point.      Mr. FOTI:  You know, when you raise your hand and you swear to uphold the      constitutional laws of the United States of America and the      constitutional laws of the state of Louisiana, you have made a solemn      oath to serve and protect the public.  If that did happen, that's      despicable.  For 30 years we went through hurricanes and floods and as      much as I wanted to leave town, the only thing I could do was try to get      my family out of town because I had a duty.  I had a job.  In the process      of people shooting at police, those are criminals, not ordinary people.      They were taking advantage of the situation to try to get that.      SIEGEL:  But do you think that all of the uniformed law enforcement      officers have been honoring their oath to protect the citizenry over      these past few days, or have they deserted the field?      Mr. FOTI:  The majority of the law enforcement officers, the fire      department officers, the EMS people, the first responders have done acts      of heroism.      SIEGEL:  I'm just curious, that's your city, New Orleans. . .      Mr. FOTI:  Yes, sir.      SIEGEL:  . . . and I'm just wondering. . .      Mr. FOTI:  I--that's my home.  And I am also one of the homeless people,      but I am here working.      SIEGEL:  You mean, your home itself was. . .      Mr. FOTI:  My home, I haven't seen it, but, you know, your heart--you      face it--you feel that your heart says one thing and your mind says      another.  OK? Your heart says there's hope and your mind says it's      destroyed because it's under probably 10 or 20 feet of water.  But you      say, `We'll just have to go back and rebuild. '      SIEGEL:  So you have confidence in New Orleans and. . .      Mr. FOTI:  I have confidence. . .      SIEGEL:  . . . in the city leaders?      Mr. FOTI:  I have confidence in the people of New Orleans.  I have      confidence in the city of New Orleans.  I have confidence in the people      of the state of Louisiana, and our state will rise to the occasion.      Right now, the major role we have to do from the attorney general's      office standpoint--OK? --is put the criminal justice system back together,      put the civil justice system back together, make sure that everybody's      rights are protected, make sure that this is still a rule of law and      order.      SIEGEL:  Well, Attorney General Charles Foti in Baton Rouge, thanks a lot      for talking with us today.      Mr. FOTI:  It's been my pleasure.       ROBERT SIEGEL, host:       This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  I'm Robert Siegel.       And joining us now from Baton Rouge is Charles Foti, who is the attorney      general of the state of Louisiana and, before becoming attorney general      in 2004, spent 30 years as the criminal sheriff of Orleans Parish that is      in New Orleans.       Mr. CHARLES FOTI (Louisiana State Attorney General):  It's a pleasure to      be here.       SIEGEL:  How long before law and order returns to New Orleans?       Mr. FOTI:  Well, actually it's returning right now.  In the process that      you've had--this is almost like a war zone, OK?  It's like that a city      has been shelled and there's only maybe one way out.  As we were rescuing      people that were trapped on their roofs or in their attics, everybody's      attention from the NOPD turned to the rescue effort, because most of the      time when you have these type of problems, the best in people comes out.      But in this case we have a small criminal element decided to take      advantage of the situation. From the public safety side, we had two jails      that were flooded.  They had no electricity.  They had no air.  They had      no food, no water.       SIEGEL:  Where are the inmates of those jails today?       Mr. FOTI:  They have been scattered through the state of Louisiana in      Department of Corrections facilities throughout the state.  In that      process we had to put them in small boats, transport them to an overpass      and then build scaffolding to get them down from the overpass because      that's how high the water is, to where the buses were and then transport      them out.       SIEGEL:  Attorney General Foti, let me ask you about a couple of      scenes. . .       Mr. FOTI:  Sure.       SIEGEL:  . . . that we've heard described out of New Orleans.

Today an international energy consortium announced that it      would try to ease the crunch by releasing more than 60 million barrels of      oil from its stockpile.  NPR's Corey Flintoff reports.      COREY FLINTOFF reporting:      The US is one of 26 nations in the International Energy Agency which      stockpiles crude oil and refined products, such as gasoline and jet fuel,      for severe energy disruptions.      Mr. DANIEL YERGIN (Chair, Cambridge Energy Research Associates):  This is      one of the largest, if not the largest, energy shock since the energy      crisis of the 1970s.      FLINTOFF:  Daniel Yergin is the chairman of Cambridge Energy Resources.      He says previous energy shocks were about crude oil from the Middle East,      but this is more complicated.      Mr. YERGIN:  This is about not only crude oil, it's about refineries,      it's about electricity, it's about natural gas.  And so all of them have      been hit at the same time and they all depend upon each other.      FLINTOFF:  Yergin says supplies of gasoline from Europe could ease some      of the pain, but the problem is getting the fuel across the Atlantic.      Seth Kleinman is a market analyst at PFC Energy.      Mr. SETH KLEINMAN (Analyst, PFC Energy):  There simply aren't enough      tankers in the Atlantic basin for transporting petroleum products from      the continent to America.  There just wasn't enough slack in the system      so that now that you've increased demand, you're just seeing tank rates      skyrocket.      FLINTOFF:  Kleinman says that even at the higher prices, it'll be a      matter of some weeks before a significant amount of gasoline can be      shipped, and that will be costly.      Mr. KLEINMAN:  It may well add an extra 20 cents to the price of gasoline      here in America.  But given that prices could leap that much in the next      few days, I don't think that's really going to be the key issue for US      consumers.      FLINTOFF:  The US Energy Information Administration says there is some      good news in that pipelines are being quickly restored to service and      utility companies expect to be able to restore electricity to Gulf      refineries within the next 10 days.  Daniel Yergin says the toughest part      is just ahead.      Mr. YERGIN:  As long as nothing else happens and the refineries come      back, the production comes back, the imports--the additional imports from      Europe arrive, it will take the sting out of the prices we're seeing      right now.  The next week or two will be the most difficult time.  But      this is all conditioned on nothing else happening over the next couple of      months.

Joe, hi.      JOE NOCERA reporting:      Hi, Linda.      WERTHEIMER:  Now Joe, you've been watching the markets and talking with      people about the effects of Hurricane Katrina.  How far into the economy      are we feeling its effects?      NOCERA:  A lot more, I think, than people would have thought, given that      our impression of New Orleans is as a city fundamentally of tourism.  The      Gulf area and the New Orleans area is one of the great ports of the      United States. And so all of kinds of things that you wouldn't expect to      be affected are, in fact, affected.  So for instance, grain in Nebraska,      wheat in Nebraska, often is exported out of the United States through      those ports.  Guess what?  Grain prices are down substantially on the      commodities market.  Coffee comes into the country in no small amount in      those same ports.  Guess what?  The price of coffee has risen      dramatically on the commodities exchange.  So there's all kinds of things      like that.  And then, of course, there's the Big Kahuna, which is oil.      WERTHEIMER:  What are you hearing about how bad things are when it comes      to oil?      NOCERA:  Well, you're hearing a lot of rumors more than you're hearing      facts. I mean, the first fact is that even before this hurricane      happened, demand for oil was increasing and supply was not increasing.      So that's the reason prices had already run up even before this.  Supply      and demand are somewhat out of balance.  The refineries in the United      States are old, the infrastructures a little bit weak.  Everything was      running at, you know, beyond full capacity, and then we have the      hurricane.      And so now we have a situation where, you know, some refineries are      slightly damaged, some are badly damaged.  There's a lot of question as      to whether there's damage in the pipeline system itself.  I heard      reliably on Friday that oil was leaking into the Gulf from a ruptured      pipeline, that nobody knows for sure how big the rupture is.  And then      the giant oil tanker port in Venice, Louisiana, is down, and that's the      only place in the United States where the huge oil supertankers can      unload.      So the things you have to watch for is, you know, how quickly can they      reopen that oil tanker port?  How quickly can they get the refineries      that are down back up?  You know, how badly damaged are the pipelines?      And these are the questions that we don't know now but we'll have a much      clearer sense of in the next couple of weeks and possibly a month.      WERTHEIMER:  So this goes way beyond the price of gas, I gather.      NOCERA:  Well, yes.  I mean, the price of gas is--you know, in my little      neck of the woods it went up a buck between Tuesday and Friday, and it's      going to go up even more.  And that certainly does affect the way people      think and respond and act.  But think about, for instance, the airline      industry and the automobile industry.  You know, both industries right      now are very fragile. Delta is poised to go into bankruptcy.  Northwest      is fighting a strike.  They all have terrible costs.  Big jumps in the      price of fuel could actually be disastrous for the airline industry, and      it could cause widespread bankruptcy.      The auto industry in the United States has bet the rent on SUVs, which      are very fuel-inefficient.  And if we get to the point where people over      the long term think, `Oh, my God, I can no longer be driving an SUV      because they're too cost-inefficient,' suddenly, you know, Ford and      General Motors are in a lot more trouble than they are already.  So the      ultimate effect of this is going to ripple way past the gas station.      WERTHEIMER:  Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The New York Times.      Joe, thank you very much.

I'm Melissa Block.      While much of the focus has been on the catastrophe in New Orleans,      Mississippi's coastal towns are also struggling to right themselves after      Hurricane Katrina.  Many people are still seeking food, water and      shelter. The damage extends far inland where the eye of the storm moved      ashore, but the coast took the brunt of the blow.  If you drive along      Highway 10 in Biloxi these days, you will come across a remarkable sight:      two casino boats as big as office buildings lie tattered and twisted on      the far side of the road where the floodwaters of Katrina deposited them.      Casinos have been the mainstay of the Biloxi economy since they were      approved in the early 1990s.  Now all of them are shut down indefinitely      and residents are wondering how Biloxi will recover.  NPR's Jim Zarroli      reports.      (Soundbite of voices)      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      Patty Landry(ph) has come to a small garbage-strewn parking lot near      Biloxi's beach to pass out shoes and clothes to hurricane victims.      Landry is spending her time volunteering these days because the big      casino where she works as a dealer is closed and she doesn't know when it      will reopen.  But Landry is still being paid for now and she has faith      that she'll be back at work eventually.      Ms. PATTY LANDRY (Casino Worker):  It's going to be a while beyond--but      they're getting there.  And they're trying to help all the people.      They're really great like that.      ZARROLI:  Landry says she likes the casinos and thinks they've been good      for the city and a lot of people in Biloxi agree.  Before gambling was      legalized in Mississippi, Biloxi was a sleepy beach town popular with      military retirees, a place where high school graduates often had to leave      home to find work.  But the casinos brought good jobs with benefits to      the town.  William Lanham is Biloxi's comptroller.      Mr. WILLIAM LANHAM (Comptroller, Biloxi, Mississippi):  Well, I would      think that in the last 10 years, the economy here has probably doubled      because of it just in terms of any type of measurement:  sales tax      collections, property tax collections, jobs.      ZARROLI:  By Mississippi law, the casinos had to be on water, which means      they were built on boats attached to big hotels, but being on water also      may have made them especially vulnerable to big storms as Katrina vividly      illustrated.      Mr. WILLIAM YATES(ph) (President, Construction Company):  The casinos are      devastated.  You know, the damage, the--just the unbelievable      devastation.      ZARROLI:  William Yates is president of a large commercial construction      company that helped build some of the casinos.  His office was virtually      destroyed by the storm, but by this weekend, he and his staff were back      at work using a generator for power in a building literally without      walls.  Only now, instead of building casinos, they've got contracts for      cleaning up some of the mountains of debris that line Biloxi streets.      Mr. YATES:  Maybe some of the casinos can be up and running in a year,      but it's hard to tell even at this point because we're still assessing      damage.      ZARROLI:  Yates' is one of the only offices still operating in Biloxi      these days, that and the police station and the local hospital.  Nearly      every other store, office or restaurant remains boarded up.  One of the      first to try to reopen was Her Majesty's Coiffures run by Audrey      Crawley(ph) for 40 years. Crawley's shop was spared a lot of damage.  She      thinks it's because the giant Beau Rivage Casino nearby acted as a kind      of windbreak.  But some water came in her roof and she spent the weekend      sweeping out her store.  Like a lot of people in Biloxi, she thinks the      state should repeal the law that restricts casinos to riverboats.      Ms. AUDREY CRAWLEY (Shop Owner):  Yeah, I think it should go land-based      because they have their hotels.  They can move the machines into the      hotels. Our economy depends on them.      ZARROLI:  Many people in town even suggest that Katrina could one day be      seen as a blessing in disguise.  There used to be frequent disputes over      land use and the casinos were sometimes thwarted in their efforts to      expand.  But with so many buildings destroyed, they say, Biloxi now has a      chance to rebuild bigger and better than it was before.  Jim Zarroli, NPR      News, Biloxi, Mississippi.       MELISSA BLOCK, host:       From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  I'm Melissa Block.       While much of the focus has been on the catastrophe in New Orleans,      Mississippi's coastal towns are also struggling to right themselves after      Hurricane Katrina.  Many people are still seeking food, water and      shelter. The damage extends far inland where the eye of the storm moved      ashore, but the coast took the brunt of the blow.  If you drive along      Highway 10 in Biloxi these days, you will come across a remarkable sight:      two casino boats as big as office buildings lie tattered and twisted on      the far side of the road where the floodwaters of Katrina deposited them.      Casinos have been the mainstay of the Biloxi economy since they were      approved in the early 1990s.  Now all of them are shut down indefinitely      and residents are wondering how Biloxi will recover.  NPR's Jim Zarroli      reports.       (Soundbite of voices)       JIM ZARROLI reporting:       Patty Landry(ph) has come to a small garbage-strewn parking lot near      Biloxi's beach to pass out shoes and clothes to hurricane victims.      Landry is spending her time volunteering these days because the big      casino where she works as a dealer is closed and she doesn't know when it      will reopen.  But Landry is still being paid for now and she has faith      that she'll be back at work eventually.

Labor Day is one of America's major holidays, but some workers never get      this day off; among them:  nurses, sanitation crews and security guards.      That last category is at the center of a major labor dispute.  Organizers      from the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, say that many      security guards are black men from poor neighborhoods.  They argue that      building owners and security companies are preventing workers from      organizing.  Two weeks ago, we met one young man as he prepared to picket      a California building management company.  Here's his story.      Mr. WILLIAM JONES:  My name is William Jones.  I'm from Duarte,      California. I work graveyard shift, 11 to 7.  It's starting to take a      toll on me because I'm not really used to it.  I have a five-year-old      daughter.  I'm trying to make money for me, as well as her, and, like,      right now I can't even afford benefits from the company.      CHIDEYA:  Are you confident things are going to change?  Are you afraid?      What--How are you feeling?      Mr. JONES:  You got to work toward change.  I'm not afraid.  Being      afraid's not gonna get you nowhere.  Like, if you want something, you're      gonna fight for it.  You got to work for what you really want.      CHIDEYA:  What did you think you would be doing at this age?      Mr. JONES:  At 20, I'm thinking I'm really I college, playing basketball      and doing music, but I really didn't--I procrastinated, like, way too      much.  I do music.  That's what I'm really gonna do.      CHIDEYA:  What kind?      Mr. JONES:  Well, gospel.  I grew up in the church.  I'll play some stuff      for you when we finish.      CHIDEYA:  There happened to be a piano in the union's break room, and      though it was battered and out of tune, William sang us a spiritual.      (Soundbite of song)      Mr. JONES:  (Singing) And Jesus is my portion.  At times it      (unintelligible).      CHIDEYA:  In a nearby room, other union members and some of the security      guards hoping to unionize prepared for the march.      (Soundbite of clapping)      CHIDEYA:  After a short bus ride, they arrived at the offices of Maguire      Properties.  SEIU organizers argue that Maguire refuses to use unionized      guards at its properties, and that, in turn, the agencies that provide      guards to companies like Maguire refuse to allow union organizing.      Maguire Properties did not respond to repeated requests for an interview      over the telephone or at their headquarters.      (Soundbite of rally)      Unidentified Man #1:  (Singing) 24-7 we're on the job, the first line of      defense across the nation, the jubilation.  Union guards who work both      night and day. . .      CHIDEYA:  In front of a tall glass office building, organizers gathered      with clergy and public officials, all under the gaze of local police.      Glendale City Councilman Frank Quintero took the microphone.      Mr. FRANK QUINTERO (Glendale City Councilman):  Thank you.  Thank you      very much.  I want to welcome you.  I want to welcome you all to the city      of Glendale.  I just find it so ironic that in this age of terrorism,      with the billions of dollars that are being spent to keep our nation      safe, we don't have the stability, we don't have the training, we don't      have the type of enforcement that we could have with a good SEIU-led      labor force.      Unidentified Man #2:  And what do we want?      Protesters:  (In unison) More pay!      Unidentified Man #2:  When do we want it?      Protesters:  (In unison) Now!      CHIDEYA:  Towards the end of the rally, William and other protesters      entered the building to speak with Maguire management.  Here's how      William described what happened.      Mr. JONES:  Went I inside the building with the delegation, gave the      letter to the secretary, it was kind of odd because she said she was the      only person in the building today at this moment.  But I never heard of      nothing like that before, because somebody else has to be in there.      CHIDEYA:  Do you think they were avoiding you?      Mr. JONES:  Yeah, I think they were avoiding me, because a couple of      doors were closed.      CHIDEYA:  So you went in there with a minister and a group of other      organizers.      Mr. JONES:  Yes, ma'am.      CHIDEYA:  How did it make you feel to go into those offices at this huge      corporate headquarters?      Mr. JONES:  It makes me feel important because I am--me, myself--I'm      going in as a security worker, as one of the people, and I'm really      getting my point across, but then it makes me feel disappointed at the      same time because it's, like, `It has to come to this, that I have to go      inside and talk to these people? '  I have mixed emotions.      CHIDEYA:  And so what happens after this?  Do you go back to work tonight      at 11?      Mr. JONES:  After this, I'm going to head to the house.  I just worked      graveyard last night.  Try to get some rest.  And I go back to work      tonight at 11, report for duty.  That's my job for right now.      CHIDEYA:  Thanks a lot.      Mr. JONES:  Oh, thank you.      (Soundbite of rally)      Unidentified Man #3:  More pay!      (Soundbite of drums)      Unidentified Man #3:  More pay!

Now he's the chair of American Rights at Work.  It's a      new non-profit championing workers who want to unionize and challenging      those, including Wal-Mart, that it says prevent union activity.      David Bonior, welcome.      Mr. DAVID BONIOR (Chairman, American Rights at Work):  Thank you.  Nice      to be with you today, Farai.      CHIDEYA:  Tell me a little bit more about this organization, particularly      given that you served Michigan, which is known as a real blue-collar      state, a state with a lot of workers who are unionized or who are in jobs      that would be unionized.      Mr. BONIOR:  Well, American Rights at Work is a leading labor policy and      advocacy organization.  And we formed about two and a half years ago, and      our job is to fight for, to recognize the right of workers to organize      and to collectively bargain in our society today, a right, by the way,      which has been taken away and which has been diminished considerably,      particularly over the last 25 years.  We believe the right to associate      is a fundamental human right.  If you don't have the right to associate      at the place you spend the most time during the day, which is your      workplace, that is a very fundamental problem, then, with the democratic      principles in our society.  The first thing a dictator will do is get rid      of the right to associate.  And that's what's happening in this country.      The right to associate is being challenged in a way that you can't      imagine.  Twenty-three thousand workers in America today are fired or      disciplined each year for trying to organize at their workplace.  And we      want to tell those stories, expose that problem and try to create a more      positive relationship between employees and employers.      CHIDEYA:  Speaking of a positive relationship, you have just come up with      this list, Partnerships That Work.  It's about companies that are      profitable, where you seem to have an alliance between workers and      employers.  Does this really come out of a desire to counter sometimes      the perception that labor complains and complains and pickets and marches      and protests but doesn't really point out when things work?      Mr. BONIOR:  Well, it's an attempt to show that there's another and a      better model than this model that we have now, which is a race to the      bottom.  And that model basically rests upon the principle, the      race-to-the-bottom idea that, you know, you can't make it today unless      you cut wages, fire workers, get rid of benefits, take away their right      to organize and collectively bargain.  We can't compete, some say, in the      globalized world unless we do these things.  And we think there is a      better model, and there are companies out there who are doing it and      doing it extraordinarily well.  And they have a partnership with their      employee organizations and unions, and we think these models are out      there.  They're not talked about enough and we've come up with our Labor      Day list that will be published each Labor Day to really praise, in this      case, nine employers and their partners who do an extraordinary job      providing wages and benefits and also having a good bottom line for their      management and for their stockholders.      CHIDEYA:  Let's talk about one of the companies on your list, Costco.  It      has often been compared to another major retailer, Wal-Mart, which has a      very different set of labor practices regarding unions.  Tell us more      about your organization's profiling of Costco and also some of the things      that you, as an organization, have been doing around Wal-Mart.      Mr. BONIOR:  What I want to do is contrast, really, Costco with Sam's      Club, which is Wal-Mart's counterpart.  There is a huge difference.      First of all, as we all know, Wal-Mart does everything they can to      prohibit workers from joining a union.  And Costco has the opposite      concept.  They provide opportunities--if you want to join a union, they      provide sustainable wages and progressive increases and worker-friendly      benefits.  They pay about $15 an hour, compared to maybe Sam's Club,      which is around $9, maybe, $10 an hour. And as a result of this, they      have a huge retention advantage over Wal-Mart.      CHIDEYA:  Twenty-six years in Congress--should the federal government      play a more active role in dealing with what you see as the obstruction      of unions in America today?  There's obviously some states that are      right-to-work states, some states that are much more apt to create an      environment in which unions flourish.  What in your opinion should the      federal government be doing?      Mr. BONIOR:  The federal government should be enforcing the 1935 Labor      Relations Act, the so-called--the Wagner Act, as it was named in 1935.      And the Wagner Act is really very, very basic, and it says that employees      or workers have a right, a right under our Constitution, to form unions,      and to do that in a way that is not impeded.  Now that's in law today.      CHIDEYA:  Well, David Bonior, you're chair of American Rights at Work.      Thank you so much for joining us.      Mr. BONIOR:  Thank you.

This is NEWS & NOTES.       FARAI CHIDEYA, host:       David Bonior has lived many lives--military man, probation officer,      adoption case worker and, for 26 years, member of the US House of      Representatives.  Now he's the chair of American Rights at Work.  It's a      new non-profit championing workers who want to unionize and challenging      those, including Wal-Mart, that it says prevent union activity.       David Bonior, welcome.       Mr. DAVID BONIOR (Chairman, American Rights at Work):  Thank you.  Nice      to be with you today, Farai.       CHIDEYA:  Tell me a little bit more about this organization, particularly      given that you served Michigan, which is known as a real blue-collar      state, a state with a lot of workers who are unionized or who are in jobs      that would be unionized.       Mr. BONIOR:  Well, American Rights at Work is a leading labor policy and      advocacy organization.  And we formed about two and a half years ago, and      our job is to fight for, to recognize the right of workers to organize      and to collectively bargain in our society today, a right, by the way,      which has been taken away and which has been diminished considerably,      particularly over the last 25 years.  We believe the right to associate      is a fundamental human right.  If you don't have the right to associate      at the place you spend the most time during the day, which is your      workplace, that is a very fundamental problem, then, with the democratic      principles in our society.  The first thing a dictator will do is get rid      of the right to associate.  And that's what's happening in this country.      The right to associate is being challenged in a way that you can't      imagine.  Twenty-three thousand workers in America today are fired or      disciplined each year for trying to organize at their workplace.  And we      want to tell those stories, expose that problem and try to create a more      positive relationship between employees and employers.       CHIDEYA:  Speaking of a positive relationship, you have just come up with      this list, Partnerships That Work.  It's about companies that are      profitable, where you seem to have an alliance between workers and      employers.  Does this really come out of a desire to counter sometimes      the perception that labor complains and complains and pickets and marches      and protests but doesn't really point out when things work?       Mr. BONIOR:  Well, it's an attempt to show that there's another and a      better model than this model that we have now, which is a race to the      bottom.  And that model basically rests upon the principle, the      race-to-the-bottom idea that, you know, you can't make it today unless      you cut wages, fire workers, get rid of benefits, take away their right      to organize and collectively bargain.  We can't compete, some say, in the      globalized world unless we do these things.  And we think there is a      better model, and there are companies out there who are doing it and      doing it extraordinarily well.  And they have a partnership with their      employee organizations and unions, and we think these models are out      there.  They're not talked about enough and we've come up with our Labor      Day list that will be published each Labor Day to really praise, in this      case, nine employers and their partners who do an extraordinary job      providing wages and benefits and also having a good bottom line for their      management and for their stockholders.       CHIDEYA:  Let's talk about one of the companies on your list, Costco.  It      has often been compared to another major retailer, Wal-Mart, which has a      very different set of labor practices regarding unions.  Tell us more      about your organization's profiling of Costco and also some of the things      that you, as an organization, have been doing around Wal-Mart.       Mr. BONIOR:  What I want to do is contrast, really, Costco with Sam's      Club, which is Wal-Mart's counterpart.  There is a huge difference.      First of all, as we all know, Wal-Mart does everything they can to      prohibit workers from joining a union.  And Costco has the opposite      concept.  They provide opportunities--if you want to join a union, they      provide sustainable wages and progressive increases and worker-friendly      benefits.  They pay about $15 an hour, compared to maybe Sam's Club,      which is around $9, maybe, $10 an hour. And as a result of this, they      have a huge retention advantage over Wal-Mart.       CHIDEYA:  Twenty-six years in Congress--should the federal government      play a more active role in dealing with what you see as the obstruction      of unions in America today?  There's obviously some states that are      right-to-work states, some states that are much more apt to create an      environment in which unions flourish.  What in your opinion should the      federal government be doing?       Mr. BONIOR:  The federal government should be enforcing the 1935 Labor      Relations Act, the so-called--the Wagner Act, as it was named in 1935.      And the Wagner Act is really very, very basic, and it says that employees      or workers have a right, a right under our Constitution, to form unions,      and to do that in a way that is not impeded.  Now that's in law today.       CHIDEYA:  Well, David Bonior, you're chair of American Rights at Work.      Thank you so much for joining us.       Mr. BONIOR:  Thank you.

I'm Lynn Neary in Washington, sitting in for      Neal Conan.      As the displaced of Katrina begin to settle into their new homes, whether      permanent or temporary, the help pouring in from around the nation should      be enough to meet their basic needs.  But the next step will be harder.      Millions of jobs have been lost to the storm.  New Orleans' largest      employer, Tulane University, hopes to reopen to students for the spring      semester.  The region's largest industry, tourism, can't give a timetable      about when or if it will be back.  The casino barges that helped      revitalize the Mississippi coast are no more.  The infrastructure around      them is demolished.  And as the floodwaters recede, traditional industry,      such as shrimping and agriculture, have to deal with a stew of pollutants      the storm has spread across the land and into the water.  Right now, only      insurance agents and construction workers seem to have guaranteed      employment in the storm-damaged areas.      Today on the show we'll look at the employment future for Katrina's      displaced, from teachers and professionals being welcomed into other      cities, to local entrepreneurs, as they struggle to rebuild, to those who      were already on public assistance.  Later, we'll also visit Capitol Hill,      where Congress returned for the fall session today amid recriminations      over the disaster response, and postponed hearings on Supreme Court      nominee John Roberts.      But, first, Katrina's survivors on the job hunt.  If you were displaced      by the storm, are you looking for work where you're living now or do you      intend to rebuild what Katrina took away?  And if your business is trying      to hire storm victims, tell us about that.  Our number here in Washington      is (800) 989-8255. That's (800) 989-TALK.  And our e-mail address is      totn@npr. org.      As thousands of evacuees are beginning to think about jobs, employers of      those displaced are trying to pick up the pieces, too.  Bart Bailey is      the CEO of 3001 Inc. , a satellite mapping company.  He joins us by phone      from their office in Gainesville, Florida.      Thanks for being with us, Mr. Bailey.      Mr. BART BAILEY (CEO, 3001 Inc. ):  Yeah, thank you, Lynn.      NEARY:  I understand you had three offices in the region.  Is that      correct?      Mr.  BAILEY:  We did.  We had one in downtown New Orleans, in Jefferson      Parish.  We had one at Stennis Space Center in southern Mississippi and      we have one at Mobile.      NEARY:  And so how badly were they damaged and how were your employees      affected?      Mr. BAILEY:  We're still getting the reports on the offices.  The one at      Stennis appears--it's probably all right.  But they have no power and no      communications.  So the employees--so we can't do any work there at that      point.  The one in downtown New Orleans, it appears that it escaped the      flood so we didn't damage too much equipment there but we're not being      allowed to go in to use the facility.  The one in Mobile is--came back up      a couple of days ago.  They got power and they're fully operational.      NEARY:  Now how many employees do you have and are they all accounted      for?      Mr. BAILEY:  We have 150 employees in the company.  We have--about 100 of      them were in the area directly affected.  Of that 100, we still have two      that we have not been able to locate.      NEARY:  Yeah.  What is your greatest concern now, then?  Is it. . .      Mr. BAILEY:  My greatest concern now--well, other than the two employees      that we haven't located, the--all the ones that we have located do have      some sort of shelter.  They're staying with family and friends.  Biggest      concern, though, is as we get the company back up and running, they need      an infrastructure, they need houses and homes so that they're fairly      convenient to where the workplace is.      NEARY:  Yeah, how do you begin to address these problems for employees?      I mean, you're talking now about a work force that has gone through      losing homes, losing family.  How do you begin to get them working again?      Mr.  BAILEY:  Most of them, as soon as they got their families situated,      immediately wanted to know when and where they should be going back to      work. Our managers at those various officers are in the process of moving      contracts, moving equipment, and we've gotten--from the geo space shuttle      mapping community, we've gotten great support.  And they're re--we're      getting interest-free and--we're getting loaners on some of the equipment      and stuff.      NEARY:  Will all these people be able to go back to work as soon as they      want to?      Mr. BAILEY:  In our case, the answer is yes.  Because we had good      disaster plans prior to the hurricane hitting.  The bulk of what we do      ends up being digital data that we have to do something with.  We did      daily backups and then they were sent to another location.  The trick is      going to be getting--matching the employees back up to the locations and      having accommodations for them until we can get--they get back to      permanent housing.      NEARY:  Yeah.  And as I understand it, you are prepared to--what is the      financial affect for this on your company, first of all?      Mr. BAILEY:  Well, last week we were probably down to 25 percent      capacity. We're probably back up to 50 or 60 percent, and, at this point,      provided the power comes back up at Stennis Space Center in southern      Mississippi by the end of the week, at least equipmentwise, we'll be back      up to 100 percent.  The question will be:  Can we get all the employees      to the right places?  Our managers are in the process of trying to make      that happen.      NEARY:  Can you keep paying everybody?      Mr. BAILEY:  Yes, and we are, at this point.  A lot of the work that we      do is completion-type work, and so we've got some very understanding      customers that pushed back the dates that we have to provide them some of      our mapping products.      NEARY:  Now does what you do fit into the overall economy there and will      you be affected by what's going on with other businesses in the area?      Perhaps some haven't survived as well as yours.      Mr. BAILEY:  We're one of--in Louisiana, we're one of the high-tech      industries that they have down there, and the community's been very proud      of the work that our folks are doing down there, and the jobs that we      have, and we have no intentions of deserting the community.  And one      of--now one of the things that we're doing right now is we are flying the      disaster areas with our aircraft and our sensors on a daily basis and      then we're shipping that data back up to FEMA and the Corps of Engineers      for their use in the recovery.      NEARY:  So you're helping out.      Mr. BAILEY:  So we're already helping out, yeah.      NEARY:  Yeah.  And so there--I hate to say it, put it quite this way, but      there are some, then, opportunities for your company in this situation?      I mean, is it--on some level, some of the economy is going to have to      be--there is going to have to be based on rebuilding, isn't it?      Mr. BAILEY:  Absolutely, and I guess if there's a silver lining, it is      that we got an extra mapping job out of it.      NEARY:  OK.  Well, Mr. Bailey, thanks very much for joining us.      Mr. BAILEY:  My pleasure.      NEARY:  Bart Bailey is the CEO of 3001 Inc. , and he joined us by phone      from his office in Gainesville, Florida.      Businesses indigenous to the storm region, of course, have borne the      worst of the burden.  At the moment, Louisiana's oyster industry is      entirely out of commission.  Curt Pannagl is an oyster broker and the      owner and operator of Gulf Island Seafood in Hopedale, Louisiana.  He      joins us by phone now from Gulf Shores, Alabama.      Thanks so much for your time, Mr. Pannagl.      Mr. CURT PANNAGL (Gulf Island Seafood Owner, Operator):  How you doing      today?      NEARY:  How badly was your business affected, Mr. Pannagl?      Mr.  PANNAGL:  Well, we're still getting reports back in.  There's no way      to get back into the St.  Bernard Parish or Blackman Parish yet but      through talking to different people that are in the parish and flew over      my business, personally, my dock isn't there anymore.  I got a phone call      this morning; some rescue workers had passed where our location was and      they don't have a sign of it.  They don't even have a brick left.  In      Hopedale, we purchase oysters in several different areas from Blackman's      to St.  Bernard, the most fertile areas for oyster harvesting, and then      the Empire area that's been hit. So far the word is I lost two boats,      personally, down there, and fishermen that worked for me, the majority of      them, have lost their boats or, if they did find them, they're      not--they're in areas that they're gonna have to, you know, get salvage      equipment to get them.      NEARY:  Oh.  How many employees did you have in your company?  How many      boats?      Mr. PANNAGL:  Well, I'm a broker so I have a lot of boats that fish for      me. So I--basically, what I do is I have a dock or facilities where we      unload in different areas and I have fishermen with their boats that I      purchase their product and turn around and resell them to processors.      NEARY:  Do you know how the people that work with you have been affected      by the storm?  Is anybody unaccounted for?      Mr. PANNAGL:  Nobody that's working for me directly.  We, you know,      thought we had some people that were missing, and, you know, people are      popping up here and there.  I've heard from several guys that work for      me, or sell their oysters to me.  We thought they were missing and      they've--you know, we've heard from them in the last two days.  So I'm      sure they're getting--there's a lot of casualties and fatalities.  I      would not be surprised if I--you know, we lost some crew members.      NEARY:  We are talking about the economic fallout from Hurricane Katrina      with Curt Pannagl.  He's owner and operator of Gulf Island Seafood in      Hopedale, Louisiana.  If you'd like to join our discussion, or if you      have any questions about the economic recovery in the area of the      hurricane, give us a call at 1 (800) 989-8255.  That's 1 (800) 989-TALK.      Mr. Pannagl, when do you expect you're going to be able to harvest      oysters again?      Mr. PANNAGL:  In the area that was devastated from the east bank of the      river to the Mississippi line--and I would assume Mississippi's wiped      out, too--the season was set to open on the 7th.  And I don't think now      that they'll open at all this year.  Number one, is because there's      pollutants out there.  Also the tidal surge has a habit of covering your      oyster beds with mud and debris and storm grass and more than likely      the--what crop they did have, which was not a great crop this year, I      think we were down 40 to 50 percent from what the biologists said, so I      would assume they're not going to open up this year at all, and they'll      probably take a--it takes about three years to recover.      NEARY:  Three years you're expecting.      Mr. PANNAGL:  Yeah.  That's what I would--if you have a mortality of what      I--I would assume there's--it could go up to 100 percent.      NEARY:  Well, thanks so much for joining us today, Mr. Pannagl.      Mr. PANNAGL:  OK.      NEARY:  Curt Pannagl is an oyster broker and the owner and operator of      Gulf Island Seafood in Hopedale, Louisiana.  He joined us by phone.      We're talking about efforts to find jobs for people displaced by Katrina.      After the break, we'll talk about how the region's unusual demography      will make recovery especially difficult for many evacuees.  If you were      displaced by Katrina, what are your job prospects?  Give us a call at      (800) 989-TALK, or send us an e-mail at totn@npr. org.      I'm Lynn Neary.  It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.      (Soundbite of music)      NEARY:  This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Lynn Neary in Washington.  Neal      Conan is away.      For those displaced by Katrina, the biggest struggles are still the daily      ones:  settling into shelters or relatives' houses; searching for      separated loved ones; finding schools for the children.  But as the      coming weeks and months of disruption in the region slowly become clear,      people will need to look for more permanent housing and jobs.  Today      we're looking into the employment situation for evacuees from Louisiana      and Mississippi.  If you had to flee the region, what are you doing for      work?  And if you're an employer, are you trying to help storm victims?      You're invited to join the discussion. Give us a call at (800) 989-TALK.      And our e-mail address is totn@npr. org.      The Mississippi Gulf Coast is one of the nation's poorest regions and New      Orleans was one of its poorest cities.  For many of those forced out by      the storm, job skills and steady employment were already hard to come by.      To give us a more complete image of the region, we turn to Sheila      Zedlewski, director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban      Institute in Washington, DC.  She joins us here in Studio 3A.      Thanks so much for being with us.      Ms. SHEILA ZEDLEWSKI (Director, Income and Benefits Policy Center, Urban      Institute):  You're welcome, Lynn; glad to be here.      NEARY:  Sheila, let's talk about New Orleans, its demographics.  The      demographics are unusual for an American city.  And in what way?      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, they are unusual, Lynn.  One-quarter of the      population of New Orleans live below the federal poverty level.  That's      about $15,000 a year for a family of three.  And that's double the      poverty rate in the United States and one of the highest rates for cities      in the United States.      NEARY:  And give us a sense of who we're talking about.  Give us an image      of the poor of New Orleans.      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, it is very important to understand who are the poor      in New Orleans.  Two-thirds of poor families are single mothers with      young children, nine in 10 are African-American, and only half of the      poor had jobs. So that means that a lot, i. e. , about one in three, were      on public assistance or disability benefits.  And 78 percent were      receiving food stamps. Seventy-eight percent of the poor were receiving      food stamps.  That's quite a bit higher than anywhere in the United      States.      NEARY:  Now are we talking about the working poor or are we talking about      people who for the most part were on--receiving government assistance?      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  We're talking about all of the poor in New Orleans,      whether they're working or not, young or old.      NEARY:  Yeah.      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  That two-thirds are mothers with young children, or      relatively young.      NEARY:  Now obviously race is part of this story.  That's something that      has been part of this story.  From the images we've been seeing on TV,      the people who are affected in the most devastating way were not only      poor but black.      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  That's right.  As I said, nine in 10 of poverty      population in New Orleans is black, but two-thirds of the entire city      population was black, so it is not unusual that we're seeing such a high      percentage of people who have been affected by this storm who are      African-American.      NEARY:  What does this mean then if this--if these people have been      displaced, and are being re-settled in other cities, at least      temporarily, possibly permanently?  What effect is it going to have on      those other states, those other cities?      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, it's going to be very challenging.  Obviously, poor      families don't have many resources to fall back on.  Many of these      families were not working.  And many depend on their broader family      networks to survive economically so I worry about how--to what extent      will these families be able to be reunited in one place back in New      Orleans or maybe if they're relocated.      NEARY:  Do the other places--Houston, for instance, has taken a huge      number of people.  Does Houston have the resources to take on this      population?      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, Houston is a little bit better off than New Orleans      in terms of having a lower poverty rate and a higher rate of employed      population but obviously this could make a big difference for Houston if      families want to stay and try to find a job and try to get social      services to get back on their feet.  Mostly, I think, families are going      to have turn to food stamps, the federal safety net, until they can get      by with a private sector job or other family members helping them out.      NEARY:  We're talking about the economic fallout from Hurricane Katrina,      the road to economic recovery, the jobless and those who are dependent on      government assistance, were before the hurricane and will be in the      future. If you'd like to join our discussion, the number is 1 (800)      989-8255.  That's 1 (800) 989-TALK.  And my guest is Sheila Zedlewski.      She's the director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban      Institute.      Sheila, how then--there's so much that federal and local officials are      trying to deal with now, just in terms of recovering from the immediate      effect of this hurricane.  How, then, to begin to prepare for what's      coming down the line in terms of people needing to earn a living, people      needing money coming in?      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Right, well, obviously, the health of people affected by      this storm is most important.  But, then, looking forward to where will      the jobs be, will they be moved back--be able to move back to New Orleans      or staying in their host cities right now?  Many of the poor who are now      in the shelters have limited educations and were working in service jobs      in the New Orleans tourist economy so their finding a job is going to      depend on whether they can find an employer who needs those same skills,      obviously.      NEARY:  That tourism industry is in shreds now.      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Right.      NEARY:  What about the other demographics of the region?  Who else are we      talking about besides the very poor?  What else we have in terms of the      working class?  We were just talking with someone from the oyster      industry. We have shrimpers.  We have fishermen.  We have an agriculture      base there.      Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, you're right.  I can only give you statistics on      the poverty population when the storm hit.  Obviously, when people lose      their jobs, you'll create more poverty and more people needing food      stamps and assistance and reliance on government safety nets until they      can get back on their feet.  It's really hard to predict how much the      poverty population will grow but it surely will for quite some time,      until the city is rebuilt.      NEARY:  Well, joining us now to discuss this is Ann Silverberg      Williamson. She's a secretary of the Louisiana Department of Social      Services, and she joins us from her office in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.      Thanks so much for giving us your time today, Ms. Williamson.      Ms. ANN SILVERBERG WILLIAMSON (Secretary, Louisiana Department of Social      Services):  Yes, thank you.      NEARY:  Perhaps you can tell us what the situation is there in terms of      public assistance.  Many of the people we've just heard that have been      affected by this storm probably were on public assistance.  What are you      expecting--how are you expecting the storm's going to affect that in the      future?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Our focus in Louisiana over the past few days has been      both to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of those families who      are previous recipients of our assistance, and also to make sure that we      avail ourselves of those that are finding themselves in certainly a new      situation of needing basic assistance such as food and nutrition.      NEARY:  And are people beginning to register or are people beginning to      seek public assistance from the shelters?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  In order to be as responsive as possible, Louisiana      arranged it such that previous recipients, for instance, of food stamp      benefits, have automatically had their dollars uploaded to their      electronic cards, therefore, those in the shelters, those with families,      those in other parts of the nation, do not have to go without access to      those benefits.      NEARY:  And how's that working, the electronic cards?  Maybe you can      explain that to us.      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Certainly.  Just as many of us are familiar with debit      cards or credit cards, Louisiana has a card such that it can be swiped      through an ATM machine, in a grocery store, and there is--there are funds      on that card that will ensure that their groceries can be paid for.      NEARY:  Yeah.  And how are states working cooperatively, or are they      working together?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  We have had tremendous cooperation, support and outreach      by all states in this nation to ensure that displaced Louisiana citizens'      lives are gotten back on track as smoothly and responsibly as possible.      NEARY:  Do you expect that kind of cooperation is going to continue into      the future?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  . . . (Unintelligible) we just. . .      NEARY:  I mean, how difficult is this going to be as you go down      the--go--as the months go on?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Well, truly, the spirit of Louisiana is such that it's      just our culture, it's our nature, to give to one another, and we've been      overwhelmed with the sentiment that has also been expressed by our fellow      Americans in every state in this nation.  And I have the faith that that      will continue as long as Louisiana does need that assistance.      NEARY:  All right, we're talking about the economic recovery from      Hurricane Katrina.  We're going to take a call now from Tom.  He's in      Hudson, Ohio.      Hi, Tom.  Go ahead.      TOM (Caller):  Hi.  Social Security checks should have been delivered on      the 2nd of the month.  I was wondering what's being done to make sure      that people get those.  I was also wondering:  Are these people being      screened after walking through all this filth?  They've got a good      possibility of having been exposed to hepatitis A and things like that.      And where are they going to pump all this polluted, filthy water that's      coming out of the city?      NEARY:  I don't know if all of our guests for this particular show can      answer all those questions.  But I think that Ms. Williamson might have      an answer to a couple of those questions.      Ann?      TOM:  OK.      Ms.  WILLIAMSON:  Sure, absolutely.  The first assistance I'd like to      offer is that this--the following phone number, 1 (888) 524-3578, that's      1 (888) LAHELPYOU is--will be a resource to address the Social Security      assistance. The second thing that I'd like to explain is that evacuees      who have been exposed to any situation wherein their health needs to be      assessed are definitely being processed through medical assessment sites.      We have three of those set up in the southeast part of Louisiana to      assure that, prior to going on to general population shelters, any health      needs are met.      NEARY:  OK.  Thanks so much for your call, Tom.      Let's take a call now from Pat.  She's in Charlotte, North Carolina.      Hi, Pat.      PAT (Caller):  Actually, it's a he.      NEARY:  OK, Pat.  Sorry.  Go ahead.      PAT:  That's OK.  Yes, I'm on the board of directors of the National      Association of Personnel Services.  Basically, it's an employment agency.      We've already decided to have roundtable discussions on how we can      mobilize our recruiting engines for both those that are out of jobs and,      you know, possibly can never go back home and will need to be relocated,      where we can work with our employers on a fee-free basis to get those      candidates new jobs, and also in reverse to work with those companies      that have lost their employee base to help them either find temporary      workers or permanent workers on a fee-free basis.      Now we're not there yet.  We're still in the organization phase.  So I      was wondering, from your guests, how do I work with them to get the      information to them once we're organized and once we have this Web site      set up, not only in Louisiana but for Alabama and Mississippi as well?      NEARY:  Ms. Williamson.      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Well, certainly, we are absolutely focused on economic      revitalization, not only of the New Orleans area but of this entire state      and are hopeful that we will be given the opportunity for any of our      displaced citizens to find jobs right here in Louisiana because we      believe they have much to offer and that we have much to receive.  I      would encourage you, sir, to please reach out to our state Department of      Labor.  I'm sorry, I don't have that direct line, but again, I believe if      you dial the (800) LAHELPU, we would definitely be able to connect you      with that appropriate resource.  We do believe. . .      PAT:  Thank you.      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  . . . that we'll need to invest in work force development      and ensure that we do have jobs and the skills to match our citizens with      those jobs.      PAT:  How about getting in touch with employers or getting at least the      word out to employers in your area that there's this army of recruiters      out there that's mobilizing to help them find workers?  Is there any      suggestion you might have on how we may reach out to them?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Sure.  Maybe through the AFL-CIO.  How does that sound?      PAT:  That's probably a good start, yeah.      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Great.      NEARY:  All right.      PAT:  OK.  I appreciate it.      NEARY:  Thanks so much for your call, Pat.      PAT:  You're welcome.      NEARY:  We are discussing the economic fallout from Hurricane Katrina.      And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.      Ms. Williamson, before this hurricane hit, there were plans for a lot of      organizations, a number of charities, people involved in social services      to go to Capitol Hill this week to lobby against federal cuts to food      stamps and other federal assistance programs.  What do you think is going      to happen now? Do you think that these proposed cuts will be placed on      hold as a result of this?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Well, certainly the momentum has increased, hasn't it,      for the obvious critical importance of these services to our citizenry.      And I believe that sound public policy's got to be preserved, and I      believe that even more aggressive and innovative public policy approaches      need to be given credence.      NEARY:  You know, it's interesting; you just said something that is      interesting to me because we've got a couple of e-mails here from      people--let me read them, and then I have a question for you.  This is      from Jordan saying, `This is my comment in reply to your request for      employers seeking potential employees among the Americans affected by      Hurricane Katrina.  I have numerous client law firms in Las Vegas seeking      associate attorneys in numerous practice areas, especially real estate,      commercial litigation, labor, employment and intellectual property. '      And then we have another e-mail.  `We have a swimming pool service      company in the Washington, DC, area and we're always looking for      qualified repair technicians. '      Now it's interesting to me that you've mentioned that you're hoping that      people are going to come back to Louisiana and find the jobs there.      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Absolutely.  Again, I've talked about the richness of      our culture and the sense of identity that we have as Louisianans.  And      we are just, you know, so sorry that our citizens have been affected in      this catastrophic way and certainly have a vision for a future wherein      that they will be able to definitely call Louisiana their home, call the      New Orleans area their home, and be surrounded by a community that's even      stronger than we were prior to Katrina, because we do have citizens with      new skills, with sharpened skills, and we have communities wherein      employment opportunities will await them.      NEARY:  In the meantime, though, do you think that people are      perhaps--maybe for the next year things may not get back to normal?  Are      people going to have to think about moving elsewhere, even if it's only      temporarily, and take up some of these job offers that may be out there      around the country but aren't in that region at the moment?      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  We are doggedly and aggressively planning to create      every opportunity in as short of a time as possible to create those jobs      here and to create safe and stable housing for our citizens here.  I do      recognize, we all recognize, that this will be a process, one that--you      know, we're informed by others who've gone through similar experiences      that it could be 18 months, it could be two years.  At the same time, our      governor and we all have the vision for our state to be whole again and,      as I said, even stronger.  And we want to pursue that beginning      immediately.  We already have.  And so we're focused on the short term as      well as the long term and in doing that as strategically as possible.      NEARY:  Oh, great.  Thanks so much for being with us, Ann.      Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Thank you, Lynn.      NEARY:  Ann Silverberg Williamson is the secretary of the Louisiana      Department of Social Services.  She joined us from baton Rouge,      Louisiana.  And I also would like to thank my guest Sheila Zedlewski.      She's the director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban      Institute.  It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.      (Announcements)      NEARY:  This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Lynn Neary in Washington sitting      in for Neal Conan.      Here are the headlines of some of the stories we're following at NPR News      today.  Engineers have plugged the levee break that swamped much of the      city of New Orleans.  Now workers are struggling to pump out the water,      still as high as seven feet in some places.      And Egyptians go to the polls tomorrow in their first multiparty      elections under a new and supposedly more democratic system.  President      Hosni Mubarak faces nine other candidates but is expected to win      re-election handily.      You can hear details on those stories and others later today on \"All      Things Considered\" from NPR News.      Tomorrow, as the floodwaters start to recede from New Orleans, we look      into early evaluations of what went wrong and right in the local and      national responses to Hurricane Katrina.      Right now we're talking about what the hundreds of thousands of people      displaced by Hurricane Katrina are doing to find new employment.  If      you're unemployed, what are you doing?  And if you're an employer trying      to help storm victims, we want to hear from you, too.  Join the      conversation.  Call us at (800) 989-TALK.  The e-mail address:      totn@npr. org.      We're joined now by Jacques Soulas, owner of Cafe Degas in New Orleans,      and he's currently at the home of his wife's cousin in Bentonville,      Arkansas, otherwise known as the headquarters of Wal-Mart.      Thanks for being with us, Jacques.      Mr. JACQUES SOULAS (Owner, Cafe Degas):  Thank you.      NEARY:  Jacques, tell us about your situation.  Seven of your family      members had to. . .      Mr. SOULAS:  Seven of us drove to Bentonville because of my cousin.  And      we've been here for now a week.      NEARY:  Yeah.  Tell us what happened--tell us about your restaurant. . .      Mr. SOULAS:  Well, Cafe Degas is a ver--a rather small restaurant that is      located about three blocks on Esplanade Avenue, three blocks from the      fairgrounds--so sometimes you can even see the location whenever they pan      around the fairgrounds--and about eight block or so from the New Orleans      Museum of Art.  It's about 1,800 square feet.  We had about 35 employees.      Last year, we served 55,000 meals.  And we were grossing about $1. 6,      $1. 75 million a year.      NEARY:  And what about now?  Do you--what is the story with those      employees at this point?      Mr. SOULAS:  Everyone is scattered.  I understand from getting in touch      with everybody that it's possible that two or three of my cooks had      decided to stay behind, to stay in their homes, and we haven't heard from      them.  Through the Web site, I got a message from the mother of one of      these guys, and she was extremely worried about him.  And we haven't      heard anything from him yet.      NEARY:  Jacques, what do you expect to do in the future?  Do you plan to      return to New Orleans?  Can you even begin to think of what you're going      to do?      Mr. SOULAS:  Yeah.  Of course, I want to return to New Orleans.  It's my      home, it's my history, it's what I've done, it's what I've enjoyed.  My      restaurant was really quite a valuable place to work and live.  For me,      it makes sense to go back to New Orleans if there is some kind of      economic viability about it. And we're talking a city where, you know,      there's got to be more shops coming back in, there's got to be people      working again.  Essentially, my customer base was 80 percent local, about      20 percent visitors.  My customers were the doctors, the professors, the      engineers--several of them worked, in fact, for the Army Corps of      Engineers--the lawyers, all these people have got to have some kind of      economic activity to even come back.      NEARY:  Yeah.      Mr. SOULAS:  And eventually if they come back, then I have an economic      activity, then I can start over.  And so far, this is really where we're      so worried, is whether there is going to be that kind of activity coming      back.      NEARY:  And in the meantime, what do you do?  Do you put down roots in      Bentonville?  Do you open a restaurant there or what?      Mr. SOULAS:  Well, not yet.  That's a little bit more--I would have to      find some funds first.  I've already put out some resumes, I went to a      number of people and I got a job offer this morning as, you know, more or      less a consultant, if you will, to help opening up a new restaurant here      in town.      I'm also an artist, I paint, so I'm going to start painting on the square      and try to find some kind of activity that way.  I got really lucky.  My      kids are going to a great school over here, something, you know, that I      could not imagine in New Orleans.  And it's a public school, no less.      And so I'm so fortunate with that that, you know, I want to try to spend      some time here.      NEARY:  All right.  Well, thanks so much for joining us, Jacques.      Mr. SOULAS:  You're welcome.      NEARY:  Jacques Soulas is the owner of Cafe Degals in New Orleans.  We      spoke to him from the home of his wife's cousin in Bentonville, Arkansas.       LYNN NEARY, host:       This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Lynn Neary in Washington, sitting in for      Neal Conan.       As the displaced of Katrina begin to settle into their new homes, whether      permanent or temporary, the help pouring in from around the nation should      be enough to meet their basic needs.  But the next step will be harder.      Millions of jobs have been lost to the storm.  New Orleans' largest      employer, Tulane University, hopes to reopen to students for the spring      semester.  The region's largest industry, tourism, can't give a timetable      about when or if it will be back.  The casino barges that helped      revitalize the Mississippi coast are no more.  The infrastructure around      them is demolished.  And as the floodwaters recede, traditional industry,      such as shrimping and agriculture, have to deal with a stew of pollutants      the storm has spread across the land and into the water.  Right now, only      insurance agents and construction workers seem to have guaranteed      employment in the storm-damaged areas.       Today on the show we'll look at the employment future for Katrina's      displaced, from teachers and professionals being welcomed into other      cities, to local entrepreneurs, as they struggle to rebuild, to those who      were already on public assistance.  Later, we'll also visit Capitol Hill,      where Congress returned for the fall session today amid recriminations      over the disaster response, and postponed hearings on Supreme Court      nominee John Roberts.       But, first, Katrina's survivors on the job hunt.  If you were displaced      by the storm, are you looking for work where you're living now or do you      intend to rebuild what Katrina took away?  And if your business is trying      to hire storm victims, tell us about that.  Our number here in Washington      is (800) 989-8255. That's (800) 989-TALK.  And our e-mail address is      totn@npr. org.       As thousands of evacuees are beginning to think about jobs, employers of      those displaced are trying to pick up the pieces, too.  Bart Bailey is      the CEO of 3001 Inc. , a satellite mapping company.  He joins us by phone      from their office in Gainesville, Florida.       Thanks for being with us, Mr. Bailey.       Mr. BART BAILEY (CEO, 3001 Inc. ):  Yeah, thank you, Lynn.       NEARY:  I understand you had three offices in the region.  Is that      correct?       Mr.  BAILEY:  We did.  We had one in downtown New Orleans, in Jefferson      Parish.  We had one at Stennis Space Center in southern Mississippi and      we have one at Mobile.       NEARY:  And so how badly were they damaged and how were your employees      affected?       Mr. BAILEY:  We're still getting the reports on the offices.  The one at      Stennis appears--it's probably all right.  But they have no power and no      communications.  So the employees--so we can't do any work there at that      point.  The one in downtown New Orleans, it appears that it escaped the      flood so we didn't damage too much equipment there but we're not being      allowed to go in to use the facility.  The one in Mobile is--came back up      a couple of days ago.  They got power and they're fully operational.       NEARY:  Now how many employees do you have and are they all accounted      for?       Mr. BAILEY:  We have 150 employees in the company.  We have--about 100 of      them were in the area directly affected.  Of that 100, we still have two      that we have not been able to locate.       NEARY:  Yeah.  What is your greatest concern now, then?  Is it. . .       Mr. BAILEY:  My greatest concern now--well, other than the two employees      that we haven't located, the--all the ones that we have located do have      some sort of shelter.  They're staying with family and friends.  Biggest      concern, though, is as we get the company back up and running, they need      an infrastructure, they need houses and homes so that they're fairly      convenient to where the workplace is.       NEARY:  Yeah, how do you begin to address these problems for employees?      I mean, you're talking now about a work force that has gone through      losing homes, losing family.  How do you begin to get them working again?       Mr.  BAILEY:  Most of them, as soon as they got their families situated,      immediately wanted to know when and where they should be going back to      work. Our managers at those various officers are in the process of moving      contracts, moving equipment, and we've gotten--from the geo space shuttle      mapping community, we've gotten great support.  And they're re--we're      getting interest-free and--we're getting loaners on some of the equipment      and stuff.       NEARY:  Will all these people be able to go back to work as soon as they      want to?       Mr. BAILEY:  In our case, the answer is yes.  Because we had good      disaster plans prior to the hurricane hitting.  The bulk of what we do      ends up being digital data that we have to do something with.  We did      daily backups and then they were sent to another location.  The trick is      going to be getting--matching the employees back up to the locations and      having accommodations for them until we can get--they get back to      permanent housing.       NEARY:  Yeah.  And as I understand it, you are prepared to--what is the      financial affect for this on your company, first of all?       Mr. BAILEY:  Well, last week we were probably down to 25 percent      capacity. We're probably back up to 50 or 60 percent, and, at this point,      provided the power comes back up at Stennis Space Center in southern      Mississippi by the end of the week, at least equipmentwise, we'll be back      up to 100 percent.  The question will be:  Can we get all the employees      to the right places?  Our managers are in the process of trying to make      that happen.       NEARY:  Can you keep paying everybody?       Mr. BAILEY:  Yes, and we are, at this point.  A lot of the work that we      do is completion-type work, and so we've got some very understanding      customers that pushed back the dates that we have to provide them some of      our mapping products.       NEARY:  Now does what you do fit into the overall economy there and will      you be affected by what's going on with other businesses in the area?      Perhaps some haven't survived as well as yours.       Mr. BAILEY:  We're one of--in Louisiana, we're one of the high-tech      industries that they have down there, and the community's been very proud      of the work that our folks are doing down there, and the jobs that we      have, and we have no intentions of deserting the community.  And one      of--now one of the things that we're doing right now is we are flying the      disaster areas with our aircraft and our sensors on a daily basis and      then we're shipping that data back up to FEMA and the Corps of Engineers      for their use in the recovery.       NEARY:  So you're helping out.       Mr. BAILEY:  So we're already helping out, yeah.       NEARY:  Yeah.  And so there--I hate to say it, put it quite this way, but      there are some, then, opportunities for your company in this situation?      I mean, is it--on some level, some of the economy is going to have to      be--there is going to have to be based on rebuilding, isn't it?       Mr. BAILEY:  Absolutely, and I guess if there's a silver lining, it is      that we got an extra mapping job out of it.       NEARY:  OK.  Well, Mr. Bailey, thanks very much for joining us.       Mr. BAILEY:  My pleasure.       NEARY:  Bart Bailey is the CEO of 3001 Inc. , and he joined us by phone      from his office in Gainesville, Florida.       Businesses indigenous to the storm region, of course, have borne the      worst of the burden.  At the moment, Louisiana's oyster industry is      entirely out of commission.  Curt Pannagl is an oyster broker and the      owner and operator of Gulf Island Seafood in Hopedale, Louisiana.  He      joins us by phone now from Gulf Shores, Alabama.       Thanks so much for your time, Mr. Pannagl.       Mr. CURT PANNAGL (Gulf Island Seafood Owner, Operator):  How you doing      today?       NEARY:  How badly was your business affected, Mr. Pannagl?       Mr.  PANNAGL:  Well, we're still getting reports back in.  There's no way      to get back into the St.  Bernard Parish or Blackman Parish yet but      through talking to different people that are in the parish and flew over      my business, personally, my dock isn't there anymore.  I got a phone call      this morning; some rescue workers had passed where our location was and      they don't have a sign of it.  They don't even have a brick left.  In      Hopedale, we purchase oysters in several different areas from Blackman's      to St.  Bernard, the most fertile areas for oyster harvesting, and then      the Empire area that's been hit. So far the word is I lost two boats,      personally, down there, and fishermen that worked for me, the majority of      them, have lost their boats or, if they did find them, they're      not--they're in areas that they're gonna have to, you know, get salvage      equipment to get them.       NEARY:  Oh.  How many employees did you have in your company?  How many      boats?       Mr. PANNAGL:  Well, I'm a broker so I have a lot of boats that fish for      me. So I--basically, what I do is I have a dock or facilities where we      unload in different areas and I have fishermen with their boats that I      purchase their product and turn around and resell them to processors.       NEARY:  Do you know how the people that work with you have been affected      by the storm?  Is anybody unaccounted for?       Mr. PANNAGL:  Nobody that's working for me directly.  We, you know,      thought we had some people that were missing, and, you know, people are      popping up here and there.  I've heard from several guys that work for      me, or sell their oysters to me.  We thought they were missing and      they've--you know, we've heard from them in the last two days.  So I'm      sure they're getting--there's a lot of casualties and fatalities.  I      would not be surprised if I--you know, we lost some crew members.       NEARY:  We are talking about the economic fallout from Hurricane Katrina      with Curt Pannagl.  He's owner and operator of Gulf Island Seafood in      Hopedale, Louisiana.  If you'd like to join our discussion, or if you      have any questions about the economic recovery in the area of the      hurricane, give us a call at 1 (800) 989-8255.  That's 1 (800) 989-TALK.       Mr. Pannagl, when do you expect you're going to be able to harvest      oysters again?       Mr. PANNAGL:  In the area that was devastated from the east bank of the      river to the Mississippi line--and I would assume Mississippi's wiped      out, too--the season was set to open on the 7th.  And I don't think now      that they'll open at all this year.  Number one, is because there's      pollutants out there.  Also the tidal surge has a habit of covering your      oyster beds with mud and debris and storm grass and more than likely      the--what crop they did have, which was not a great crop this year, I      think we were down 40 to 50 percent from what the biologists said, so I      would assume they're not going to open up this year at all, and they'll      probably take a--it takes about three years to recover.       NEARY:  Three years you're expecting.       Mr. PANNAGL:  Yeah.  That's what I would--if you have a mortality of what      I--I would assume there's--it could go up to 100 percent.       NEARY:  Well, thanks so much for joining us today, Mr. Pannagl.       Mr. PANNAGL:  OK.       NEARY:  Curt Pannagl is an oyster broker and the owner and operator of      Gulf Island Seafood in Hopedale, Louisiana.  He joined us by phone.      We're talking about efforts to find jobs for people displaced by Katrina.      After the break, we'll talk about how the region's unusual demography      will make recovery especially difficult for many evacuees.  If you were      displaced by Katrina, what are your job prospects?  Give us a call at      (800) 989-TALK, or send us an e-mail at totn@npr. org.       I'm Lynn Neary.  It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.       (Soundbite of music)       NEARY:  This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Lynn Neary in Washington.  Neal      Conan is away.       For those displaced by Katrina, the biggest struggles are still the daily      ones:  settling into shelters or relatives' houses; searching for      separated loved ones; finding schools for the children.  But as the      coming weeks and months of disruption in the region slowly become clear,      people will need to look for more permanent housing and jobs.  Today      we're looking into the employment situation for evacuees from Louisiana      and Mississippi.  If you had to flee the region, what are you doing for      work?  And if you're an employer, are you trying to help storm victims?      You're invited to join the discussion. Give us a call at (800) 989-TALK.      And our e-mail address is totn@npr. org.       The Mississippi Gulf Coast is one of the nation's poorest regions and New      Orleans was one of its poorest cities.  For many of those forced out by      the storm, job skills and steady employment were already hard to come by.      To give us a more complete image of the region, we turn to Sheila      Zedlewski, director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban      Institute in Washington, DC.  She joins us here in Studio 3A.       Thanks so much for being with us.       Ms. SHEILA ZEDLEWSKI (Director, Income and Benefits Policy Center, Urban      Institute):  You're welcome, Lynn; glad to be here.       NEARY:  Sheila, let's talk about New Orleans, its demographics.  The      demographics are unusual for an American city.  And in what way?       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, they are unusual, Lynn.  One-quarter of the      population of New Orleans live below the federal poverty level.  That's      about $15,000 a year for a family of three.  And that's double the      poverty rate in the United States and one of the highest rates for cities      in the United States.       NEARY:  And give us a sense of who we're talking about.  Give us an image      of the poor of New Orleans.       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, it is very important to understand who are the poor      in New Orleans.  Two-thirds of poor families are single mothers with      young children, nine in 10 are African-American, and only half of the      poor had jobs. So that means that a lot, i. e. , about one in three, were      on public assistance or disability benefits.  And 78 percent were      receiving food stamps. Seventy-eight percent of the poor were receiving      food stamps.  That's quite a bit higher than anywhere in the United      States.       NEARY:  Now are we talking about the working poor or are we talking about      people who for the most part were on--receiving government assistance?       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  We're talking about all of the poor in New Orleans,      whether they're working or not, young or old.       NEARY:  Yeah.       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  That two-thirds are mothers with young children, or      relatively young.       NEARY:  Now obviously race is part of this story.  That's something that      has been part of this story.  From the images we've been seeing on TV,      the people who are affected in the most devastating way were not only      poor but black.       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  That's right.  As I said, nine in 10 of poverty      population in New Orleans is black, but two-thirds of the entire city      population was black, so it is not unusual that we're seeing such a high      percentage of people who have been affected by this storm who are      African-American.       NEARY:  What does this mean then if this--if these people have been      displaced, and are being re-settled in other cities, at least      temporarily, possibly permanently?  What effect is it going to have on      those other states, those other cities?       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, it's going to be very challenging.  Obviously, poor      families don't have many resources to fall back on.  Many of these      families were not working.  And many depend on their broader family      networks to survive economically so I worry about how--to what extent      will these families be able to be reunited in one place back in New      Orleans or maybe if they're relocated.       NEARY:  Do the other places--Houston, for instance, has taken a huge      number of people.  Does Houston have the resources to take on this      population?       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, Houston is a little bit better off than New Orleans      in terms of having a lower poverty rate and a higher rate of employed      population but obviously this could make a big difference for Houston if      families want to stay and try to find a job and try to get social      services to get back on their feet.  Mostly, I think, families are going      to have turn to food stamps, the federal safety net, until they can get      by with a private sector job or other family members helping them out.       NEARY:  We're talking about the economic fallout from Hurricane Katrina,      the road to economic recovery, the jobless and those who are dependent on      government assistance, were before the hurricane and will be in the      future. If you'd like to join our discussion, the number is 1 (800)      989-8255.  That's 1 (800) 989-TALK.  And my guest is Sheila Zedlewski.      She's the director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban      Institute.       Sheila, how then--there's so much that federal and local officials are      trying to deal with now, just in terms of recovering from the immediate      effect of this hurricane.  How, then, to begin to prepare for what's      coming down the line in terms of people needing to earn a living, people      needing money coming in?       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Right, well, obviously, the health of people affected by      this storm is most important.  But, then, looking forward to where will      the jobs be, will they be moved back--be able to move back to New Orleans      or staying in their host cities right now?  Many of the poor who are now      in the shelters have limited educations and were working in service jobs      in the New Orleans tourist economy so their finding a job is going to      depend on whether they can find an employer who needs those same skills,      obviously.       NEARY:  That tourism industry is in shreds now.       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Right.       NEARY:  What about the other demographics of the region?  Who else are we      talking about besides the very poor?  What else we have in terms of the      working class?  We were just talking with someone from the oyster      industry. We have shrimpers.  We have fishermen.  We have an agriculture      base there.       Ms. ZEDLEWSKI:  Well, you're right.  I can only give you statistics on      the poverty population when the storm hit.  Obviously, when people lose      their jobs, you'll create more poverty and more people needing food      stamps and assistance and reliance on government safety nets until they      can get back on their feet.  It's really hard to predict how much the      poverty population will grow but it surely will for quite some time,      until the city is rebuilt.       NEARY:  Well, joining us now to discuss this is Ann Silverberg      Williamson. She's a secretary of the Louisiana Department of Social      Services, and she joins us from her office in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.       Thanks so much for giving us your time today, Ms. Williamson.       Ms. ANN SILVERBERG WILLIAMSON (Secretary, Louisiana Department of Social      Services):  Yes, thank you.       NEARY:  Perhaps you can tell us what the situation is there in terms of      public assistance.  Many of the people we've just heard that have been      affected by this storm probably were on public assistance.  What are you      expecting--how are you expecting the storm's going to affect that in the      future?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Our focus in Louisiana over the past few days has been      both to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of those families who      are previous recipients of our assistance, and also to make sure that we      avail ourselves of those that are finding themselves in certainly a new      situation of needing basic assistance such as food and nutrition.       NEARY:  And are people beginning to register or are people beginning to      seek public assistance from the shelters?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  In order to be as responsive as possible, Louisiana      arranged it such that previous recipients, for instance, of food stamp      benefits, have automatically had their dollars uploaded to their      electronic cards, therefore, those in the shelters, those with families,      those in other parts of the nation, do not have to go without access to      those benefits.       NEARY:  And how's that working, the electronic cards?  Maybe you can      explain that to us.       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Certainly.  Just as many of us are familiar with debit      cards or credit cards, Louisiana has a card such that it can be swiped      through an ATM machine, in a grocery store, and there is--there are funds      on that card that will ensure that their groceries can be paid for.       NEARY:  Yeah.  And how are states working cooperatively, or are they      working together?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  We have had tremendous cooperation, support and outreach      by all states in this nation to ensure that displaced Louisiana citizens'      lives are gotten back on track as smoothly and responsibly as possible.       NEARY:  Do you expect that kind of cooperation is going to continue into      the future?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  . . . (Unintelligible) we just. . .       NEARY:  I mean, how difficult is this going to be as you go down      the--go--as the months go on?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Well, truly, the spirit of Louisiana is such that it's      just our culture, it's our nature, to give to one another, and we've been      overwhelmed with the sentiment that has also been expressed by our fellow      Americans in every state in this nation.  And I have the faith that that      will continue as long as Louisiana does need that assistance.       NEARY:  All right, we're talking about the economic recovery from      Hurricane Katrina.  We're going to take a call now from Tom.  He's in      Hudson, Ohio.       Hi, Tom.  Go ahead.       TOM (Caller):  Hi.  Social Security checks should have been delivered on      the 2nd of the month.  I was wondering what's being done to make sure      that people get those.  I was also wondering:  Are these people being      screened after walking through all this filth?  They've got a good      possibility of having been exposed to hepatitis A and things like that.      And where are they going to pump all this polluted, filthy water that's      coming out of the city?       NEARY:  I don't know if all of our guests for this particular show can      answer all those questions.  But I think that Ms. Williamson might have      an answer to a couple of those questions.       Ann?       TOM:  OK.       Ms.  WILLIAMSON:  Sure, absolutely.  The first assistance I'd like to      offer is that this--the following phone number, 1 (888) 524-3578, that's      1 (888) LAHELPYOU is--will be a resource to address the Social Security      assistance. The second thing that I'd like to explain is that evacuees      who have been exposed to any situation wherein their health needs to be      assessed are definitely being processed through medical assessment sites.      We have three of those set up in the southeast part of Louisiana to      assure that, prior to going on to general population shelters, any health      needs are met.       NEARY:  OK.  Thanks so much for your call, Tom.       Let's take a call now from Pat.  She's in Charlotte, North Carolina.       Hi, Pat.       PAT (Caller):  Actually, it's a he.       NEARY:  OK, Pat.  Sorry.  Go ahead.       PAT:  That's OK.  Yes, I'm on the board of directors of the National      Association of Personnel Services.  Basically, it's an employment agency.       We've already decided to have roundtable discussions on how we can      mobilize our recruiting engines for both those that are out of jobs and,      you know, possibly can never go back home and will need to be relocated,      where we can work with our employers on a fee-free basis to get those      candidates new jobs, and also in reverse to work with those companies      that have lost their employee base to help them either find temporary      workers or permanent workers on a fee-free basis.       Now we're not there yet.  We're still in the organization phase.  So I      was wondering, from your guests, how do I work with them to get the      information to them once we're organized and once we have this Web site      set up, not only in Louisiana but for Alabama and Mississippi as well?       NEARY:  Ms. Williamson.       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Well, certainly, we are absolutely focused on economic      revitalization, not only of the New Orleans area but of this entire state      and are hopeful that we will be given the opportunity for any of our      displaced citizens to find jobs right here in Louisiana because we      believe they have much to offer and that we have much to receive.  I      would encourage you, sir, to please reach out to our state Department of      Labor.  I'm sorry, I don't have that direct line, but again, I believe if      you dial the (800) LAHELPU, we would definitely be able to connect you      with that appropriate resource.  We do believe. . .       PAT:  Thank you.       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  . . . that we'll need to invest in work force development      and ensure that we do have jobs and the skills to match our citizens with      those jobs.       PAT:  How about getting in touch with employers or getting at least the      word out to employers in your area that there's this army of recruiters      out there that's mobilizing to help them find workers?  Is there any      suggestion you might have on how we may reach out to them?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Sure.  Maybe through the AFL-CIO.  How does that sound?       PAT:  That's probably a good start, yeah.       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Great.       NEARY:  All right.       PAT:  OK.  I appreciate it.       NEARY:  Thanks so much for your call, Pat.       PAT:  You're welcome.       NEARY:  We are discussing the economic fallout from Hurricane Katrina.      And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.       Ms. Williamson, before this hurricane hit, there were plans for a lot of      organizations, a number of charities, people involved in social services      to go to Capitol Hill this week to lobby against federal cuts to food      stamps and other federal assistance programs.  What do you think is going      to happen now? Do you think that these proposed cuts will be placed on      hold as a result of this?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Well, certainly the momentum has increased, hasn't it,      for the obvious critical importance of these services to our citizenry.      And I believe that sound public policy's got to be preserved, and I      believe that even more aggressive and innovative public policy approaches      need to be given credence.       NEARY:  You know, it's interesting; you just said something that is      interesting to me because we've got a couple of e-mails here from      people--let me read them, and then I have a question for you.  This is      from Jordan saying, `This is my comment in reply to your request for      employers seeking potential employees among the Americans affected by      Hurricane Katrina.  I have numerous client law firms in Las Vegas seeking      associate attorneys in numerous practice areas, especially real estate,      commercial litigation, labor, employment and intellectual property. '       And then we have another e-mail.  `We have a swimming pool service      company in the Washington, DC, area and we're always looking for      qualified repair technicians. '       Now it's interesting to me that you've mentioned that you're hoping that      people are going to come back to Louisiana and find the jobs there.       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Absolutely.  Again, I've talked about the richness of      our culture and the sense of identity that we have as Louisianans.  And      we are just, you know, so sorry that our citizens have been affected in      this catastrophic way and certainly have a vision for a future wherein      that they will be able to definitely call Louisiana their home, call the      New Orleans area their home, and be surrounded by a community that's even      stronger than we were prior to Katrina, because we do have citizens with      new skills, with sharpened skills, and we have communities wherein      employment opportunities will await them.       NEARY:  In the meantime, though, do you think that people are      perhaps--maybe for the next year things may not get back to normal?  Are      people going to have to think about moving elsewhere, even if it's only      temporarily, and take up some of these job offers that may be out there      around the country but aren't in that region at the moment?       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  We are doggedly and aggressively planning to create      every opportunity in as short of a time as possible to create those jobs      here and to create safe and stable housing for our citizens here.  I do      recognize, we all recognize, that this will be a process, one that--you      know, we're informed by others who've gone through similar experiences      that it could be 18 months, it could be two years.  At the same time, our      governor and we all have the vision for our state to be whole again and,      as I said, even stronger.  And we want to pursue that beginning      immediately.  We already have.  And so we're focused on the short term as      well as the long term and in doing that as strategically as possible.       NEARY:  Oh, great.  Thanks so much for being with us, Ann.       Ms. WILLIAMSON:  Thank you, Lynn.       NEARY:  Ann Silverberg Williamson is the secretary of the Louisiana      Department of Social Services.  She joined us from baton Rouge,      Louisiana.  And I also would like to thank my guest Sheila Zedlewski.      She's the director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban      Institute.  It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.       (Announcements)       NEARY:  This is TALK OF THE NATION.  I'm Lynn Neary in Washington sitting      in for Neal Conan.       Here are the headlines of some of the stories we're following at NPR News      today.  Engineers have plugged the levee break that swamped much of the      city of New Orleans.  Now workers are struggling to pump out the water,      still as high as seven feet in some places.       And Egyptians go to the polls tomorrow in their first multiparty      elections under a new and supposedly more democratic system.  President      Hosni Mubarak faces nine other candidates but is expected to win      re-election handily.       You can hear details on those stories and others later today on \"All      Things Considered\" from NPR News.       Tomorrow, as the floodwaters start to recede from New Orleans, we look      into early evaluations of what went wrong and right in the local and      national responses to Hurricane Katrina.       Right now we're talking about what the hundreds of thousands of people      displaced by Hurricane Katrina are doing to find new employment.  If      you're unemployed, what are you doing?  And if you're an employer trying      to help storm victims, we want to hear from you, too.  Join the      conversation.  Call us at (800) 989-TALK.  The e-mail address:      totn@npr. org.       We're joined now by Jacques Soulas, owner of Cafe Degas in New Orleans,      and he's currently at the home of his wife's cousin in Bentonville,      Arkansas, otherwise known as the headquarters of Wal-Mart.       Thanks for being with us, Jacques.       Mr. JACQUES SOULAS (Owner, Cafe Degas):  Thank you.       NEARY:  Jacques, tell us about your situation.  Seven of your family      members had to. . .       Mr. SOULAS:  Seven of us drove to Bentonville because of my cousin.  And      we've been here for now a week.       NEARY:  Yeah.  Tell us what happened--tell us about your restaurant. . .       Mr. SOULAS:  Well, Cafe Degas is a ver--a rather small restaurant that is      located about three blocks on Esplanade Avenue, three blocks from the      fairgrounds--so sometimes you can even see the location whenever they pan      around the fairgrounds--and about eight block or so from the New Orleans      Museum of Art.  It's about 1,800 square feet.  We had about 35 employees.      Last year, we served 55,000 meals.  And we were grossing about $1. 6,      $1. 75 million a year.       NEARY:  And what about now?  Do you--what is the story with those      employees at this point?       Mr. SOULAS:  Everyone is scattered.  I understand from getting in touch      with everybody that it's possible that two or three of my cooks had      decided to stay behind, to stay in their homes, and we haven't heard from      them.  Through the Web site, I got a message from the mother of one of      these guys, and she was extremely worried about him.  And we haven't      heard anything from him yet.       NEARY:  Jacques, what do you expect to do in the future?  Do you plan to      return to New Orleans?  Can you even begin to think of what you're going      to do?       Mr. SOULAS:  Yeah.  Of course, I want to return to New Orleans.  It's my      home, it's my history, it's what I've done, it's what I've enjoyed.  My      restaurant was really quite a valuable place to work and live.  For me,      it makes sense to go back to New Orleans if there is some kind of      economic viability about it. And we're talking a city where, you know,      there's got to be more shops coming back in, there's got to be people      working again.  Essentially, my customer base was 80 percent local, about      20 percent visitors.  My customers were the doctors, the professors, the      engineers--several of them worked, in fact, for the Army Corps of      Engineers--the lawyers, all these people have got to have some kind of      economic activity to even come back.       NEARY:  Yeah.       Mr. SOULAS:  And eventually if they come back, then I have an economic      activity, then I can start over.  And so far, this is really where we're      so worried, is whether there is going to be that kind of activity coming      back.       NEARY:  And in the meantime, what do you do?  Do you put down roots in      Bentonville?  Do you open a restaurant there or what?       Mr. SOULAS:  Well, not yet.  That's a little bit more--I would have to      find some funds first.  I've already put out some resumes, I went to a      number of people and I got a job offer this morning as, you know, more or      less a consultant, if you will, to help opening up a new restaurant here      in town.       I'm also an artist, I paint, so I'm going to start painting on the square      and try to find some kind of activity that way.  I got really lucky.  My      kids are going to a great school over here, something, you know, that I      could not imagine in New Orleans.  And it's a public school, no less.      And so I'm so fortunate with that that, you know, I want to try to spend      some time here.       NEARY:  All right.  Well, thanks so much for joining us, Jacques.       Mr. SOULAS:  You're welcome.       NEARY:  Jacques Soulas is the owner of Cafe Degals in New Orleans.  We      spoke to him from the home of his wife's cousin in Bentonville, Arkansas.

The possibility that crude oil will be in short supply from      Hurricane Katrina has pushed up gasoline prices.  But Americans could      soon see higher prices for more than just gasoline.  Natural gas piped      from the Gulf Coast provides heat and cooking fuel for tens of millions      of Americans and power plants are increasingly using natural gas to      generate electricity.  To find out what impact Katrina is having on the      price of natural gas, we called Mike Zenker in Oakland, California.  He's      a specialist in natural gas with Cambridge Energy Research Associates.      And good morning.      Mr. MIKE ZENKER (Cambridge Energy Research Associates):  Good morning,      Renee. It's a pleasure joining you.      MONTAGNE:  What impact is Katrina having on natural gas production?      Mr. ZENKER:  Well, much like the gasoline market that you referred to,      natural gas markets have been quite tight in North America as well.      Hurricane Katrina comes just after a strong demand in the summer for      electricity due to hotter than normal weather.  And now we've had this      big supply shock.  So it's coming on top of a very strong demand shock.      MONTAGNE:  Well, do you have a figure or an estimate of how high we might      see natural gas prices go and also for how long?      Mr. ZENKER:  The market was quite worried about the risk of a strong      hurricane like Katrina and it was already pricing some of that into      prices. We've seen prices double over the last couple of years and then      with Hurricane Katrina prices have doubled yet again.  Currently, 10      percent of natural gas production is out in the United States and if that      prolongs, we should see prices stay at these elevated levels, again      staying above double.      MONTAGNE:  Why had the prices gone up so much before Katrina hit?      Mr. ZENKER:  The US has had a difficult time keeping pace with demand.      As a result, demands been outstripping supply and prices playing this      unfortunate but necessary role in rationing supply out there.  And we're      going to be in that environment until 2008 when new imports of natural      gas from overseas help rebalance the market.      MONTAGNE:  Is the US relying too heavily on natural gas to meet our      energy needs?      Mr. ZENKER:  Well, there was a very deliberate turn to natural gas.  It      had been relatively inexpensive and certainly is much more      environmentally friendly than some of the alternatives, at least it was      perceived that way. And so there was a very strong embrace of natural      gas, particularly in the power sector with better than 90 percent of the      large round of new power plants constructed over the last five years      turning to natural gas. So very much an environmentally conscious      approach to that fuel.

Even      before the hurricane, prices were running significantly higher than they      were last winter.  From member station WBUR in Boston, Fred Thys tells us      how three families plan to cope.      FRED THYS reporting:      Window fans are blowing the hot air out of the Levers' home in North      Billerica, a Boston suburb.  The Levers don't have air conditioning and      the heat makes winter seem far off.  But it's very much on Kenneth      Lever's mind.      Mr. KENNETH LEVER:  With the price of fuel and, you know, we want to stay      comfortable, but, you know, just listening to what happened in New      Orleans and the rigs and everybody's panicking, you get gas one night,      the next morning, eight hours later, you know, you see a 20 cent      increase.      THYS:  The Levers are having an energy audit of their home.  Local      utilities provide the service free of charge.      Mr. BOB ECKEL(ph):  But let's just talk about what's going on up in the      attic.      THYS:  In this case, Bob Eckel is conducting the audit for the National      Grid, the electric company.      (Soundbite of people going up in an attic)      THYS:  He sees that the Levers use most of their attic for storage.      Mr. ECKEL:  I can tell already you take full advantage of all the space.      You've got it stacked up three or four boxes high.      THYS:  Eckel estimates that the Levers can save up to 25 percent on their      heating costs if they can add insulation to their attic.  They just have      to make room.      (Soundbite of cars on highway)      THYS:  On the other side of Boston in the suburb of Hingham, the remains      of Katrina shower the lawns.  Cindy Coe(ph) has installed new windows in      her house this summer.      Ms. CINDY COE:  What's amazing about these is they tilt right in and if      you just, just listen to the sound. . .      (Soundbite of window closing)      Ms. COE:  . . . you can hear the difference.      THYS:  The windows have double panes for insulation.      Ms. COE:  I expect to really garner some significant energy gains, you      know, this next winter with the heating oil cost, which now thanks to      Katrina should be going absolutely through the roof.      THYS:  Like thousands of Boston-area heating oil consumers, Coe locked in      her oil price this summer by committing to buy her winter supply at a set      price.      Ms. COE:  At the time, I really choked on $2. 35 a gallon.  And now, I'm      just thanking my lucky stars that I acted on it and did it.  It means a      considerable amount of money out of pocket, but it's rather like the      windows. I mean, it's an investment against future catastrophe.      THYS:  Linda Kelly(ph) knows how expensive it can be to heat a home.  She      live with her husband and three children in a small house in Quincy, just      south of Boston.      Ms. LINDA KELLY:  My house is just a little cape on the beach, right.      It's a three bedroom.      THYS:  Kelly shudders when she thinks of last year.  Many people used two      to three tanks of oil a month.  But she managed to get through the whole      winter on two tanks.  Kelly kept the thermostat at 68 during the day, but      only when she was home; around 62 at night.  She had federal assistance      and help from a non-profit that supplies heating oil at half price to      low-income people.      Ms. KELLY:  I don't have the heat on during the day, the kids are in      school all day and, you know, you keep it down; you put a sweater on.      You just learn to live like that, you know, and I do with what I have.      THYS:  For this winter, the Department of Energy was forecasting the      average retail price of heating oil at $2. 15 a gallon, a 16 percent      increase over last year.  But that was before Katrina.      For NPR News, I'm Fred Thys in Boston.      MONTAGNE:  This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.  I'm Renee Montagne.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      More than a dozen European countries are sending emergency supplies of      food and medicine and blankets and tents, not to some stricken Third      World country, but to the US.  Europe is rushing to send aid to the      victims of Hurricane Katrina after the US government appealed for      international help.  Joining us from the \"Marketplace\" European desk in      London is Stephen Beard.      Stephen, welcome back.  Give us an idea of the scale of this operation.      STEPHEN BEARD (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, Alex, it's been described as      Europe's biggest aid operation since the Asian tsunami at the end of last      year, and help is coming from across the EU.  France is flying in tents,      generators and water purifying plants.  A Dutch frigate is delivering      medicine and helicopters to New Orleans.  Greece has offered two cruise      ships to provide temporary accommodation for the evacuees.  And Britain      is dispatching half a million military food ration packs to the States.      CHADWICK:  Has anyone asked, `Why does a rich country like the US need      aid? '      BEARD:  Yes, indeed.  Some British newspapers have been posing that very      question, pointing out that per-capita national income in the US is more      than 40 times that of, for example, Indonesia, which received a lot of      aid after the tsunami.  But Britain's Ministry of Defense says this is      not a matter of wealth or poverty.  It's about logistics.  It's about      having sufficient quantities of the right supplies on hand and ready to      go.      The man who's been organizing the British airlift of food rations to the      States, Brigadier Chris Steirn, says he personally was not surprised by      the American appeal for help.      Brigadier CHRIS STEIRN:  I don't think any nation stockpiles sufficient      food of this type for the enormity of the crisis that has hit the      Southern States, and therefore, I would expect actually almost all      Western nations to ask other nations to support with this type of ration.      BEARD:  There is, in fact, even some suggestion--although this hasn't      been confirmed yet--that the US will be expected to pay for some of these      emergency supplies.      CHADWICK:  It's not just emergency supplies, is it?  I think there have      been appeals for cash, charities asking people in Europe to contribute      money to a Hurricane Katrina fund.      BEARD:  Yes, the British Red Cross is appealing for cash donations.  It's      not clear, I have to say, how people are going to respond to this kind of      appeal. They'd probably be much readier to do so if this was a poor      country where the disaster had occurred.  But poor Americans have borne      the brunt, or appear to have borne the brunt of this disaster.  Their      plight has evoked a lot of sympathy here, so it is possible that people      may be prepared to put their hands in their pockets to help pay for the      relief work.      And later today, in \"Marketplace,\" we'll be hearing more about that work      that's now under way in New Orleans.      CHADWICK:  Thank you, Stephen.

Returning employees found the plant essentially undamaged      by the storm and restarted it over the weekend.  Spokeswoman Angelia      Graves says the plant's now running at full speed, making millions of      gallons of gas each day.      Ms. ANGELIA GRAVES (Spokeswoman, Marathon Oil):  We're very pleased to be      able to bring that additional supply to the market to help meet our      customers' demands.      HORSLEY:  Marathon's also been able to ramp up production at its      midwestern refineries now that a key pipeline is operating and they're no      longer choked for crude oil.  Rayola Dougher, of the American Petroleum      Institute, says, from Louisiana to Illinois, refiners are in better shape      than they were a week ago.      Ms. RAYOLA DOUGHER (American Petroleum Institute):  It's been a massive      dislocation, you know, a big jigsaw puzzle that came undone, and they're      putting the pieces back together right now.      HORSLEY:  The improving supply situation is starting to show up in prices      at the gas pump.  According to the Energy Department, the average price      of gasoline soared to almost $3. 07 a gallon on Monday, within a dime of      the inflation-adjusted record.  But a survey released by AAA yesterday      showed gas prices inching back by a penny a gallon, and gas prices fell      sharply on the futures market, suggesting further cuts are possible.      Ben Brockwell tracks energy for the Oil Price Information Service.      Mr. BEN BROCKWELL (Oil Price Information Service):  The good news is the      refineries in the Gulf Coast that can resume production are doing so.      However, it's premature to say the oil patch is out of the woods yet.      HORSLEY:  That's because the repairs made so far are the easiest.  Former      refinery worker Tancred Lidderdale, who's now with the Energy Department,      says fixing flooded refineries will pose a bigger challenge.      Mr. TANCRED LIDDERDALE (Energy Department):  Just like if your car      went--was underwater, your electrical system is pretty much shot.      They're going to have damage to their electrical pumps or all their      electrical equipment valves. That takes some time to be repaired.  So      that can take a couple of months.      HORSLEY:  At the Murphy Oil refinery in Meraux, Louisiana, officials say      it could take another three weeks just to assess the damage, a job that's      taking longer because the plant is still surrounded by water.  Murphy has      better news about its two deep-water drilling platforms in the Gulf.      Company treasurer Kevin Fitzgerald says one platform is already up and      running again.      Mr. KEVIN FITZGERALD (Treasurer, Murphy Oil Corporation):  The other      platform, that was more in the eye of the storm, is still being assessed,      still needs some repairs, but it appears to be relatively minimal.      `Relatively minimal' in offshore terms can still be a couple of weeks.      HORSLEY:  According to the Energy Department, more than 40 percent of      Gulf oil production is now back on line, up from just 5 percent at the      beginning of last week.  Every day, more oil is being produced.  But the      Petroleum Institute's Dougher says it could be a long time before the      region's output is back to normal.      Ms. DOUGHER:  There are 26,000 miles of underground pipelines in the Gulf      of Mexico.  We are still even recovering now from Ivan a year ago, so      it's hard to say when it's going to be back to where it was.      HORSLEY:  The big impact from Katrina at the gas pump may have peaked,      but the storm will have lingering effects on the nation's oil and      gasoline supply, and consumers will continue to pay a price for that.      Scott Horsley, NPR News.       RENEE MONTAGNE, host:       Gasoline prices are beginning to fall slightly, and repairs to refineries      and pipelines are beginning to show progress.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      The destruction wrought by Hurricane Katrina continues to be felt on the      other side of the Atlantic.  In Britain, the rising price of gasoline has      sparked a major fuel protest.  A group of truckers and farmers is      threatening to disrupt oil supplies unless the British government drives      down the cost of gas.  The same group almost brought Britain to a halt      five years ago.  Joining us from London is \"Marketplace's\" Stephen Beard.      And, Stephen, first of all, how high are those prices?      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      Well, they were, of course, very high already because of the rising cost      of crude, but the prices at the pump have been given a very sharp upward      twist by the fact that the US has been buying up gas supplies here to      deal with the threat of shortages caused by Katrina, so that we now have      in parts of Britain gas selling at more than one pound a liter.  That's      the equivalent of more than $7 a US gallon.      BRAND:  More than $7.  So what are protesters planning to do?      BEARD:  Well, this group, which is called Fuel Lobby--it's, as you say,      farmers and truckers.  They say that unless the British government cuts      the very large burden of tax that it puts on gasoline, unless it does      that before next Wednesday, this group is going to blockade every oil      refinery in the country and disrupt supplies.  They did it before and      very effectively in the year 2000.  As oil analyst John Roberts recalls,      they almost brought the country to its knees.      Mr. JOHN ROBERTS (Oil Analyst):  I think we were probably about 24 to 48      hours away from a near total stoppage of the retail side of the British      economy, just simply due to the fact that we couldn't get petrol from one      place to another.      BEARD:  Now that protest five years ago paid off.  The government at the      time dropped plans to increase fuel taxes.  But the protest worked on      that occasion because it was overwhelmingly supported by the British      public, and the police felt pretty much powerless to intervene.  This      time, there's probably much less public support.  People, I think, are      generally aware that the price of gas has gone up for reasons that are      really beyond the government's control.      BRAND:  And, Stephen, what does the government say?  How has it responded      to the threat?      BEARD:  Well, the government has actually made an extra $20 billion in      tax on gasoline prices this year as a result of the price rises, so it      could do something, but it doesn't want to cave in, and like the US, the      British government is running a big budget deficit.  It needs all the tax      it can get. So it looks as if the government's going to stand firm and      hope that next week's action just fizzles out.  But it's interesting that      the ripples from Katrina continue on this side of the Atlantic.      And coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we'll be looking at more of      the US repercussions and, in particular, how the thousands of workers in      Mississippi's casino industry are surviving.

I'm Melissa Block.      ROBERT SIEGEL, host:      And I'm Robert Siegel.      In Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, hundreds of thousands of homes and      apartment buildings are at least partially underwater.  Many have been      that way for 10 days now, and many will have to be torn down when the      floodwaters recede.  By the time it's all over, Katrina may set an ugly      record: destroying more homes than any other natural disaster in American      history. NPR's John Nielsen reports.      JOHN NIELSEN reporting:      If you were to pull on some scuba diving gear and swim around inside some      of the flooded homes in the city of New Orleans, you'd know right away      why many of them are not likely to survive.  So says Ken Ford, a disaster      expert with the National Association of Home Builders.      Mr. KEN FORD (National Association of Home Builders):  You'll see wood      flooring buckled.  You'll see if you have vinyl sheeting it'll be turned      up at the edges.  Plaster walls will have started to disintegrate.  If      it's drywall, it will crumble.  You'll--it'll be very evident that you've      got problems.      NIELSEN:  Many of these flooded homes are built of bricks and mortar.      Most of the rest are wrapped around a frame of wooden beams.  Older      wooden beams begin to warp and rot after sitting underwater for just 12      hours, Ford says.  Newer pressured-treated wooden beams may last a few      days longer.  Most bricks will survive a flood, but the mortar holding      them together might not, Ford adds. He says floodwaters often wash the      mortar out or cause it to disintegrate. For all of these reasons Ford      expects that many of the houses now flooded will start to collapse under      their own weight as the floodwaters recede.  Many of the houses still      standing may be uninhabitable.      Mr. FORD:  Let's put it this way:  The environmental conditions that are      going to be inside is going to be something you really don't want to live      in.      NIELSEN:  One of the problems threatening the standing homes will be the      layer of polluted mud inside them.  Muck at the bottom of the flood zones      has been soaking up everything from oil spills to lead paint.  If this      mud tests high for toxins, whole neighborhoods may have to be bulldozed.      Homes that pass their mud tests may face another problem:  staggering      amounts of mold that can be dangerous to humans.  Anu Dixit, a community      health expert at the St. Louis University School of Public Health, says      it takes three or four days for the first fungal spores to become      visible.      Ms. ANU DIXIT (St. Louis University School of Public Health):  Very much      like the kind of mold you find on an orange or a apple.  You will see      specks, round structures.  Some would be fluffy, some would be not so      fluffy.  Some would be green, orange, black, you name it.      NIELSEN:  Dixit studied fungal outbreaks that followed massive flooding      episodes in Missouri in the early 1990s.  She says the growth of this      fungus can be explosive.      Ms. DIXIT:  Whole walls were covered.  Even we found mold growing on the      ceiling.  We found mold growing on the carpeting.      NIELSEN:  Mold spores can sicken people with allergies and other kinds of      breathing problems, especially asthmatics.  Getting rid of mold can be      all but impossible, says Dixit.  She's seen mold return to houses      stripped down to their studs and then treated with special kinds of      bleach.  Often it turns out to be cheaper to raze whole buildings and      start over.      It's still too early to put a number on the residential damage caused by      Hurricane Katrina, but home builder Ken Ford predicts that a gruesome      record is about to be broken.  In 1992 Hurricane Andrew destroyed roughly      28,000 living units in Florida and damaged at least a hundred thousand      more.  Ford says Katrina could easily double those figures, and that will      create another problem.      Mr. FORD:  What do you do with that debris?  Where do we truck it off to?      I mean, you really don't have enough trucks to carry all--a whole town      essentially out of there.  That's a big issue that has to be addressed.      NIELSEN:  Ford says finding landfills capable of holding all this debris      will be difficult.  Burning it will require an exemption from the      nation's air pollution laws.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      In Dallas-Ft. Worth, more than 20,000 hurricane survivors have registered      with the Red Cross.  Since they can't go home and don't want to live in      shelters, many are looking for work.  Government agencies are slowly      chipping away at the number of newly unemployed.  At the Dallas      Convention Center, 200 employers gathered yesterday for a Texas-sized job      fair.  From member station KERA, Catherine Cuellar reports.      CATHERINE CUELLAR reporting:      The Dallas Convention Center occupies an entire block next to City Hall.      Currently it's being used as a Red Cross emergency shelter and FEMA      Disaster Recovery Center.  Yesterday those agencies were joined by room      after room of booths filled with recruiters from Dallas companies,      hospitals and schools, like Jeff Strese of Southern Methodist University.      Mr. JEFF STRESE (Southern Methodist University):  What was the name of      the company that you were with?      Mr. DAVID STERLING (Louisiana Evacuee):  The last one was K Time RVs(ph).      It's a motor home company.      Mr. STRESE:  OK.      Mr. STERLING:  We serviced RVs.  I mean, we did--it's like, I tell      people, I say, `Well, in my years of experience, it's a house on wheels. '      CUELLAR:  David Sterling used public transportation to get to the job      fair. He arrived from New Orleans last week with his two sons and two      grandsons.      Mr. STERLING:  I put them in school as of yesterday.  I signed them up      for school.  I think I'm going to stay.      CUELLAR:  Sterling hopes he'll hear from SMU about a job.  In the      meantime, he's going to pursue all leads.      For those relocating permanently, career opportunities range from      teaching and nursing to maintenance and retail.  Others who hope to      return and rebuild soon also have options.      Sandy Olsen is a recruiter for the Dallas-based 7-Eleven convenience      store chain.      Ms. SANDY OLSEN (7-Eleven):  Because we have over 230 stores in      Dallas-Ft. Worth, we always have openings.  To give you an exact number      is difficult, but there will be openings.  And if I don't have one today,      I usually have one tomorrow.      CUELLAR:  The job fair was organized by WorkSource for Dallas County, the      local arm of the Texas Workforce Commission.  The commission has been      holding fairs all over the state.  WorkSource also opened an employment      center in the emergency shelter earlier this week which has been      counseling 200 job seekers an hour, according to president Laurie Larrea.      Ms. LAURIE LARREA (President, WorkSource for Dallas County):  We can't go      into this and say, oh, of course we can cover everyone's need.  We don't      have that many jobs; we don't have that much opportunity.  But we can      begin, as we normally do our daily work, one person, one job at a time.      We're also finding that jobs are not necessarily going to come from our      pocket areas but throughout the state of Texas and throughout the      country.      CUELLAR:  But moving again is difficult for those who have lost their      cars and are eager to put down roots.  Reginald Dove has traveled from      Louisiana along with his parents, brother and stepson.  They're staying      with another family in a Dallas suburb.      Mr. REGINALD DOVE (Louisiana Evacuee):  Today I'm looking for something      in sales.  My forte is sales.  I've done sales all my life in New      Orleans, whether it meant doorman, car salesman, waiter.  So my sales      abilities are going to help me get a job.      CUELLAR:  Dove's evacuee status is evident only because he's wearing a      bright plastic wristband which grants him access to services in the      emergency shelter.  He's ready to lose the bracelet and call Dallas home.      For NPR News, I'm Catherine Cuellar.       MADELEINE BRAND, host:       This is DAY TO DAY from NPR News.  I'm Madeleine Brand.       In Dallas-Ft. Worth, more than 20,000 hurricane survivors have registered      with the Red Cross.  Since they can't go home and don't want to live in      shelters, many are looking for work.  Government agencies are slowly      chipping away at the number of newly unemployed.  At the Dallas      Convention Center, 200 employers gathered yesterday for a Texas-sized job      fair.  From member station KERA, Catherine Cuellar reports.       CATHERINE CUELLAR reporting:       The Dallas Convention Center occupies an entire block next to City Hall.

Officials decided to let owners back to assess hurricane damage and to      retrieve important data and material to keep their businesses running.      NPR's Tom Goldman has the story of one businessman hoping to salvage a      lifelong dream.      TOM GOLDMAN reporting:      The dream for 45-year-old Patrick Singley was to own a restaurant.  It      came true 12 years ago when he bought Gautreau's, a small bistro that's      become a minor New Orleans institution.  The restaurant doesn't have a      sign outside, but locals hungry for seared sea scallops or loin of lamb      know where to find it.  Gautreau's was last open two days before the      storm hit on a Monday morning.      Mr. PATRICK SINGLEY (Gautreau's):  After we served our last meal Saturday      night, we closed down shop.  We refrigerated and iced everything that was      perishable, thinking we were going to probably be back on Wednesday.      GOLDMAN:  Of course they weren't.  Now nearly two weeks later, Patrick      Singley sits in an SUV traveling into New Orleans for the first time      since evacuating with his family to northern Louisiana.  Ten miles      outside the city, Singley looks out the window and admits his stomach is      churning.      Mr. SINGLEY:  Well, I've tried to control myself in front of my children      and my wife--and my employees.  You know, I've got about 20 employees who      call me on a regular basis wanting to know when they can come back and      what we can do and how am I, and we're all in a state of wait.  None of      us knows what's going to happen.      GOLDMAN:  Singley starts to get an idea as the truck pulls up in front of      his restaurant.      Mr. SINGLEY:  Unbelievable.  Completely intact.  Not a broken window.      Let's go see what's inside.      (Soundbite of car door opening)      Mr. SINGLEY:  That's unbelievable.  Check that out.      GOLDMAN:  While Gautreau's smells moldy and musty, the inside looks OK,      but then. . .      Mr. SINGLEY:  Oh.  There is water damage.  I spoke too soon.  It's all      over the floor in the dining room.      GOLDMAN:  Singley heads up to the attic and finds the problem.      Mr. SINGLEY:  The whole side of my roof's missing from the top.  There's      sunlight coming through and I guess it rained.  It's just going to      continue to pass through.      GOLDMAN:  The inspection ends, and Patrick Singley considers what's      happened to, as he puts it, 12 years of hard work.      Mr. SINGLEY:  It ain't great, but I'm lucky.  Could be a lot worse.  I      need help.  I need our insurers to come to our aid.      GOLDMAN:  So far that's happened, but Singley says not nearly enough.      His insurance company, inundated with claims, is offering to cover      Singley's expenses only for two weeks.  Considering it might be months      before Gautreau's could reopen, Singley won't be able to pay his workers      during the downtime.      Mr. SINGLEY:  (On phone) Sue?      Ms. SUSAN ZEMANICK:  (On phone) Hi, Patrick.      GOLDMAN:  Singley phones Susan Zemanick, his 24-year-old chef.  She's      been a rising star at Gautreau's, but now Singley has to tell her to look      for other work.      Mr. SINGLEY:  (On phone) So if I can be creative and come up with      something, I'll call you.  I mean, I know of a guy that is looking for      some potential private chefs in the meantime, if you want.      Ms. ZEMANICK:  (On phone) Any private chef job would be great.      Mr. SINGLEY:  (On phone) All right.      GOLDMAN:  Singley says he's prepared to challenge his insurance company      in court to get more than the two-week reimbursement.  But like so many      other business owners in New Orleans, he's entering a tenuous period.  If      he doesn't get enough money to reopen Gautreau's, Singley says he'll      declare bankruptcy and try to start another dream in another city.  Tom      Goldman, NPR News.

They      answer questions about whether they offer health insurance.  If so, what      kind?  And how much do employers and employees have to pay?  NPR's Joanne      Silberner reports the newest survey shows companies and their workers are      struggling.      JOANNE SILBERNER reporting:      Last year, health insurance rates increased 11 percent.  This year, the      survey shows that insurance rates went up less, 9 percent.  Drew Altman      heads the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducts the survey.      Mr. DREW ALTMAN (Kaiser Family Foundation):  I guess the good news is      that the rate of increase is lower than last year, and the bad news is      that's the only good news.      SILBERNER:  Employers reported that insurance premiums are still going up      at a rate double or triple that of wages and inflation.  The average      price for health insurance for a family is now nearly $11,000 a year.      Altman says that's having an effect on whether companies offer health      insurance to their employees.      Mr. ALTMAN:  The percentage of firms offering health insurance coverage      fell from 69 percent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2005, and it's a little bit      each year.      SILBERNER:  The survey shows companies are making some changes as a      result.      Mr. ALTMAN:  They're trying to manage the costs of people with chronic      illness.  Sometimes when they can, they'll shift costs to their workers.      Some of them were trying the new so-called consumer-driven health-care      arrangements with high-deductible plans.      SILBERNER:  That's what Ferrellgas of Liberty, Missouri, is doing with      its 3,500 employees who have full benefits.  It paid $20 million in      medical claims last year.  Benefits supervisor Heather Dumas says the      company has always paid generous health benefits but is making some      changes.      Ms. HEATHER DUMAS (Benefits Supervisor, Ferrellgas):  We're going more      from that paternalistic approach to more of a consumerism partnership      environment, where we really want to teach our employees the benefits to      consumerism and really starting to understand the cost of health care,      letting them realize the cost of going to the doctor is not their $15      co-pay that they pay at the front desk; it's really $100.      SILBERNER:  So this year, the company offered as an option those      high-deductible plans.  Employees pay the first 1,000 to $3,000 of      expenses and can set up a savings account to pay for it with pretax      dollars.  Dumas says it's too early to say whether it's saved her company      any money.      The Kaiser survey showed that though the numbers are still low, more      companies are going this route in addition to the other strategies      they're trying. Karen Ignagni heads the health insurance trade group.      She's encouraged by the survey.      Ms. KAREN IGNAGNI:  The direction of the trend is right.  Other benefits      consulting firms have already indicated that '06 is going to be the      lowest rate of increase in five years.  I think that shows that the      strategies and the tools and techniques that have been developed by our      members are beginning to work for consumers.      SILBERNER:  But even so the prices are still increasing, and Kaiser's      Drew Altman is definitely not encouraged.      Mr. ALTMAN:  When we see these dips, always in the past, we see      health-care costs bounce back again to double-digit rates of increase.      And I don't see any evidence that we're dealing in any fundamental way      with the underlying drivers behind these increases in health-care costs.      SILBERNER:  The main factor, he says, are new medical technologies that      everyone wants and no one wants to pay for.  Joanne Silberner, NPR News,      Washington.

And now thousands of restaurants and bars are closed      in the area and as many as 64,000 restaurant workers are out of jobs.      That's a lot of talent sitting idle.  Restaurant owners across the      country are trying to put these men and women back to work.  NPR's Ted      Robbins reports.      (Soundbite of restaurant ambience)      TED ROBBINS reporting:      This is The French Quarter.  Well, not `the French Quarter'; this is a      restaurant called The French Quarter in Tucson, Arizona.  Posters of New      Orleans and a neon alligator hang from the pressed tin wall; plates of      fried food come out of the kitchen during happy hour.      Ms. JULIE PEREZ (The French Quarter):  Onion rings, zucchini and okra.      ROBBINS:  These days, owner Bryce Zeagler, a Baton Rouge native, is      having a tough time getting authentic ingredients from home.      Mr. BRYCE ZEAGLER (Owner, The French Quarter):  Yeah, we're having      problems with crawfish, oysters, alligator, you name it.      ROBBINS:  But he managed to find at least one native, Julie Perez,      formerly a bartender in New Orleans' Garden District.      Ms. PEREZ:  I worked at the Rendezvous Tavern on Magazine and Eighth      Street, which was left relatively dry but was looted.  That whole area      was all pretty much looted.      ROBBINS:  After evacuating, Perez made her way to Tucson because a      childhood friend lives here and works at the restaurant.  Within two      hours, she, too, had a job.  She says she has lots of friends facing the      same situation.      Ms. PEREZ:  Yeah.  Basically, I could get on the phone tonight and have      about 40 applicants 'cause everybody wherever they evacuated to basically      they're just--they're getting jobs and they're finding apartments      wherever they ended up.  I mean, Chicago, South Carolina, Texas, Kansas.      I mean, everywhere.      ROBBINS:  In many of those places, work is waiting but those who need it      don't know it yet.  After the hurricane, the Council of Independent      Restaurants of America, or CIRA, the James Beard Foundation and the      Southern Foodways Alliance set up a job bank for displaced Gulf Coast      restaurant workers.  The Web site now lists more than 1,000 jobs.      Mr. DON LURIA (President, CIRA):  Well, our biggest challenge is to go      after the applicants and find a way to get them to the Web site.      ROBBINS:  Don Luria is president of CIRA.  He looks at his computer      screen and scrolls through listings in 28 states.      Mr. LURIA:  Now here's a restaurant I've been to, La La(ph) in Sarasota.      They're looking for two line cooks, one chef, three servers and a host.      ROBBINS:  Of course, not only do job applicants have to find out about      the Web site, they need to have an Internet connection.  That may be      slowly happening as more and more resumes appear on the Web site or      workers contact restaurants directly, like Julie Perez who, at 27,      already has a 10-year resume in the New Orleans restaurant business.  Now      she finds herself in a reproduction of one called The French Quarter and      she says her friends from back home are teasing her about it.      Ms. PEREZ:  Yeah, they're making fun of me pretty much for that just      because the name, you know; it's kind of funny.  But it's great.  I've      been taken in--and, I mean, I already know the menu.  I am kind of      worried about being the evacuee, like circus freak that people want to      come and look at, you know. But so far, everybody's been so nice.      Hey, guys!  How's it going?      ROBBINS:  Don Luria says connections like this one should continue to      multiply because the solid reputation of New Orleans' restaurant workers      virtually ensures a successful match.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      One and possibly two of the nation's major air carriers are expected to      file for bankruptcy protection today.  If they do, Northwest and Delta      will join US Airways and United already in bankruptcy.  That would mean      four of the nation's seven largest airlines will be operating under court      protection from creditors.  Joining us is John Dimsdale of \"Marketplace. \"      John, what will bankruptcy mean--what would it mean for Northwest and      Delta's customers?      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Well, in a short run, not a whole lot.  Flights continue, tickets are      good, frequent-flier programs go on.  But studies show that fliers worry      about booking flights on bankrupt carriers.  And over time, passengers      will see some changes.  The biggest one will be fewer employees.  US      Airways has cut its work force in half during bankruptcy.  Now the big      airlines, the legacy carriers, still have more employees and higher-paid      employees than the low-fare airlines like Southwest and JetBlue, and      they're looking for more give-backs from workers and that's always a      tough process.  Just look at Northwest.  It's dealing with a strike by      machinists right now and the company has just begun hiring permanent      replacements for those strikers.      CHADWICK:  Review for us how we got here, John.      DIMSDALE:  Well, these airlines have been deep in debt, losing billions      of dollars in the four years since 9/11.  Delta alone is down nearly $10      billion since then.  Plus, prices for aviation fuel have doubled this      year.  The major airlines haven't been able to pass those costs on to      their customers because they're being undercut by the low-fare carriers.      And there's another reason.  New bankruptcy laws take affect October      17th; that's why this is happening now.  They're going to make it tougher      to shield assets from debt holders.  And deadlines for restructuring and      coming out of bankruptcy are shorter under the new rules, and that's      especially a factor for Northwest.  Northwest has more cash on hand than      Delta, so there's less urgency for bankruptcy but this is a pre-emptive      move to take advantage of looser rules.  As for Delta, it's been      anticipating bankruptcy for some time; selling assets, rearranging leases      and contracts.  Analysts expect the company to have its reorganization      plan all ready to present to the court.  It's sort of a prepackaged,      prearranged bankruptcy; it's become part of its business plan.      CHADWICK:  John, these conditions, it doesn't look like they're going to      change; high fuel prices and all that sort of thing.  How long can we go      on with four of the seven largest airlines in bankruptcy?      DIMSDALE:  Well, there's pressure to put an end to all of this from the      airlines that are not in bankruptcy.  They complain that it's unfair to      have competitors in bankruptcy protection and they can't match those      costs which the bankrupt airlines have been able to cut.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Economists trying to assess Hurricane Katrina's effects on the US economy      have new information today.  The Labor Department reports the numbers of      workers who filed last week for first-time unemployment benefits jumped      at its fastest pace in 10 years.  And a separate report on consumer      prices showed a big rise in energy costs in August.  Joining us is John      Dimsdale from \"Marketplace. \"      John, I guess these higher energy bills are no surprise to the      economists.      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Yeah, that's right.  They were certainly expected, but the actual      increases were less than many had predicted.  Overall, consumer prices      were up a half a percent, and that's a lot, but the forecast was for even      more.  And when you take out the volatile prices for food and energy,      what's called the core index, was really only a 10th-of-a-percent gain      for August.      As for those unemployment benefits, the claims rose last week by 71,000;      that's the highest in 10 years, worst than after 9/11.  The Labor      Department estimates that all but 3,000 of those new jobless were the      result of Katrina.      CHADWICK:  So what are people making of these numbers?      DIMSDALE:  Well, the economy had already been slowing down due to the      higher gas prices, and it's taken a further hit from Katrina.  And some      are even talking about a possible recession; major disruptions of energy      supplies, the bottleneck for imports of produce and coffee and other      things.  Plus, there's going to be this run on building materials like      bricks and cement and lumber. So since there's going to be at least a      slowdown, some economists say it's time for the Fed to stop raising      interest rates.  The central bank's been slowly hiking borrowing costs      over a year.  But others say that would be the exact wrong thing to do.      Given all the rising prices, they're worried about inflation that would      go out of control without higher interest rates.  So it'll be interesting      to see what the Fed does next Tuesday when they meet. One economist I      spoke to today, Gary Shilling, doesn't think the Fed will change course      because he says they'll keep the storm in perspective.      Mr. GARY SHILLING (Economist):  This whole effect, although it's a      disaster for the people involved and the geographic area, in the greater      scheme of things, it isn't that big.  I mean, that whole affected area, I      think, accounts for 1 percent of retail sales in the country.  Well,      that's not exactly the whole country itself.      CHADWICK:  John, I was just looking through The Wall Street Journal today      to see this thing I noted earlier.  Retail sales declined 2. 1 percent in      August, biggest drop in three years.  Prices for gasoline, natural gas      and heating oil, are they such a drag on the economy?  What is Congress      going to do about energy prices?  Anything?      DIMSDALE:  Oh, absolutely.  There's a whole raft of ideas to encourage      more drilling, build more refineries, improve conservation.  But here's      another way to deal with the problem.  Just yesterday, the Senate tacked      on an amendment to a spending bill that would require the Federal Trade      Commission to make a formal investigation into reports of price gouging.      That would apply some pressure on gas companies to keep prices low.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we're taking a look at the impact      Katrina evacuees are having on cities across the country, including      Birmingham and St. Louis.

I'm Melissa Block.      ROBERT SIEGEL, host:      And I'm Robert Siegel.      In his speech from New Orleans last night, President Bush promised tax      relief and loans to small businesses on the Gulf Coast.  Mom-and-pop      outfits in the region say they need all the help they can get as they      survey damage from Hurricane Katrina and try to keep from going out of      business.  NPR's Frank Langfitt has that story.      FRANK LANGFITT reporting:      Karen Greenbaum runs a court reporting company in New Orleans.  Recently,      the firm celebrated its 10th birthday.  Now Greenbaum's worried it won't      last the year.  Her employees are living in temporary places as far away      as Nevada. The law firms she served are gone and her tiny company,      Alliance Reporting, has almost no income.      Ms. KAREN GREENBAUM (Owner, Alliance Reporting):  I don't know if my      business can survive this 'cause, you know, everyone is so scattered and      I have two reporters whose homes probably cannot be rebuilt.  My home is      underwater and I don't know if it can be rebuilt.  I don't know if some      of the people are ever going to come back this way.  Some of the smaller      law firms that we dealt with, I don't know, you know, if they are going      to reconstitute the business. It's very frightening.      LANGFITT:  Most big corporations have the money to survive a disaster,      but small businesses are another story.  Many carry modest cash reserves      and don't have insurance.  Tony Martinez runs a business incubator at      Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.  He says most companies in the      state have fewer than a hundred employees, and he worries Katrina may      force many of them to close.      Mr. TONY MARTINEZ (Business Incubator, Louisiana State University):  When      you sit and you look at records about all the different counties and      cities in Florida that were hit by Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Charley      and how many businesses didn't come back.  And so, the--you know,      Louisiana being at the lower end on the economic end, you know, every      business that we lose is crucial.      LANGFITT:  Without clients, workers or access to offices, small      businesses are improvising.  Allen Kelly renovates older homes in New      Orleans.  Now he's living in the Houston suburbs picking up small      painting jobs to bring in a little cash.  Kelly's posted his temporary      address for clients on allneworleans. com, a Web site for dislocated      businesses.  He's also changed his phone number after call volume      overloaded circuits around the city.      Mr. ALLEN KELLY (Renovator, New Orleans):  It was a (504) cell phone      number. With all the damage to the cell phone system in New Orleans and      metro New Orleans, it was very difficult to contact anyone.  So I did a      temporary switch to the Houston area and it's been much better since.      FLINTOFF:  Some small businesses were prepared for disaster.  Sutaher      Cina(ph) runs ReliaGene Technologies, which tests DNA in criminal and      paternity cases. Before fleeing his offices in suburban New Orleans, Cina      put all his samples in a metal cage on the second floor.  He also has      insurance to cover his payroll, which runs $300,000 a month.      Mr. SUTAHER CINA (ReliaGene Technologies):  So I had business insurance,      interruption insurance, hurricane storage plan, backup plan for server,      everything I had.  I was very worried that something like, you know--last      year when hurricane hit Florida, that was an eye-opener for me.      FLINTOFF:  Katrina is certain to put some small firms out of business,      but it will create opportunities for others.  Kelly, the home renovator,      has stayed in touch with customers and craftsmen using his BlackBerry, a      mobile e-mail device.  As soon as the waters recede, he plans to start      back up in middle-class and suburban neighborhoods like Lakeview and old      Metairie.      Mr. CINA:  If the government has not condemned a lot of these houses in      the neighborhoods that I've worked in, then there's going to be a world      of work to be done.      FLINTOFF:  New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin plans to open up a number of areas      to businesses for the first time this weekend.  Owners see it as a step      forward, but many wonder how long it will take for their clients and the      city's infrastructure to come back.  Frank Langfitt, NPR News.

In his speech from New Orleans last night, President Bush promised tax      relief and loans to small businesses on the Gulf Coast.  Mom-and-pop      outfits in the region say they need all the help they can get as they      survey damage from Hurricane Katrina and try to keep from going out of      business.  NPR's Frank Langfitt has that story.       FRANK LANGFITT reporting:       Karen Greenbaum runs a court reporting company in New Orleans.  Recently,      the firm celebrated its 10th birthday.

Now the problem is getting worse.  The state      is scrambling to absorb hundreds of new students displaced by the storm.      Tanya Ott reports from member station WBHM in Birmingham.      TANYA OTT reporting:      Longtime educators say the number of unfilled teaching positions in      Alabama is unprecedented and they're not sure what they're going to do      with all the new students.  Department of Education spokeswoman Rebecca      E. White says classroom sizes will swell, especially in some of Alabama's      coastal counties that were themselves battered by Katrina.      Ms. REBECCA E. WHITE (Department of Education):  And that's where we're      trying to focus on trying to see if we can't get substitute teachers and      more counselors and nurses and support staff in these schools to help      with that flow.      OTT:  White says 36 teachers displaced from Louisiana and Mississippi      have already requested emergency certification to teach in Alabama.      Ms. WHITE:  The governor's waived that $49 background check fee for these      folks, so we are waiving the usual circumstances that it takes to become      a teacher and get certificate here in Alabama.      OTT:  Florida governor is also courting displaced teachers.      Ms. WHITE:  He can't have them.  No, I'm just kidding.      OTT:  She jokes, but Alabama is 45th in the nation for teacher pay, and      longtime educators say competition from higher-paying states like Florida      and Georgia is a big reason there's a serious teacher shortage here this      year.  In the lounge of Birmingham's McElwain Elementary School, union      representative Jeff McDaniels has spent the day talking with teachers      about what they want.      Mr. JEFF McDANIELS (Union Representative):  In short, people are making      less money now because the cost of goods and services has gone up and,      unfortunately, people again are looking at other alternatives.      OTT:  Young teachers are lured to Florida and Georgia for signing      bonuses. Many older teachers are retiring or leaving for private      industry.  The problem is especially acute in rural and urban districts.      Birmingham, for example, started the year with more than 50 unfilled      positions.  Superintendent Wayman Shiver says students may be stuck with      substitute teachers for weeks, possibly months.      Mr. WAYMAN SHIVER (Superintendent):  It may mean that--particularly if      they have more than one substitute in some period of time, that they're      getting mixed messages, they may not be getting instruction from the most      qualified person.      Professor MICHAEL FRONING (Dean, School of Education):  Well, it means      they get an inconsistent, poorly conceived education.      OTT:  Michael Froning is dean of the School of Education at the      University of Alabama at Birmingham.      Prof. FRONING:  Unfortunately, in this country that happens more often to      kids of poverty than it does to kids of affluence.      OTT:  Hoping to stem the flow of teachers out of Birmingham,      Superintendent Wayman Shiver resorted to the controversial step of      invoking the so-called 45-day rule.  It prohibits teachers under contract      from quitting less than 45 days before school starts.  Critics say it      smacks of indentured servitude, but Shiver defends the practice.      Mr. SHIVER:  I have to have my classes covered by highly qualified      certified teachers and if I keep allowing them to leave just any time      they choose, that just puts me further and further in the hole.      OTT:  The Mobile County school system also invoked the 45-day rule.  Even      before Hurricane Katrina sent scores of displaced children to Mobile,      there were at least 100 unfilled teaching positions.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Members of the oil-producing cartel OPEC are meeting in Vienna with plans      to talk about whether they could pump more oil.  Three weeks after      Hurricane Katrina sent the price of crude soaring, the cartel's under      pressure to increase production.  Joining us from the \"Marketplace\"      European desk in London is Stephen Beard.      Stephen, there's concern about the damage that higher fuel prices could      do to the global economy.      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      Yes, and that could tip OPEC into opening up the taps.  It is a powerful      argument.  The last thing OPEC wants to do is trigger a global recession      through high oil prices.  It would cut demand for oil, first thing, and      then lose a lot of their customers.  Also, they have very considerable      investments in the US and Europe, which would lose value, too.  But on      the other hand, they don't want to pump so much crude that the world is      awash with the stuff and the price plummets, the way it did in the late      1990s, down, if you remember, to as low as $10 a barrel.      CHADWICK:  Right.  But I guess the question is can they produce more oil      if they want to?  I mean, haven't we been reporting that they're pretty      close to doing everything they can?      BEARD:  Yes.  I mean, Western analysts reckon that every OPEC member is      pumping flat-out at the moment, except Saudi Arabia, which is thought to      have the world's biggest known reserves and it's thought that the Saudis      could supply an extra two million barrels a day.  But, you know, many      analysts say all this actually rather misses the point.  Julian Lee of      the Center for Global Energy Studies says that right now, OPEC and other      producers are not the problem.      Mr. JULIAN LEE (Center for Global Energy Studies):  The real short-term      problem that we have is a lack of refining capacity, not a lack of crude      oil. Hurricane Katrina has taken out almost a million barrels a day of      very sophisticated US refining capacity.      BEARD:  He says that what the world needs now is more refineries to      produce more gasoline, diesel and heating oil.      CHADWICK:  Well, maybe this OPEC meeting really is irrelevant at this      point.      BEARD:  Well, not irrelevant, because we are, after all, talking about a      group of countries which produce 40 percent of the world's oil.  The      Nigerian oil minister, I think, hit the nail on the head over the weekend      when he said the point about pledging to step up production is      psychological.  It's reassuring at a time when the consuming nations are      getting increasingly nervous about oil when they're increasingly tempted      to stockpile more of the stuff.      Well, oil is obviously a key component in the world economy.  Later today      on \"Marketplace,\" we'll be hearing about some political developments      which could have economic repercussions, too.  We'll be looking at the      elections in Afghanistan and Germany and finding out how they will affect      the rest of us economically.

I'm Melissa Block.      MICHELE NORRIS, host:      And I'm Michele Norris.      With tropical storm Rita headed toward the Gulf of Mexico, energy prices      soared today.  The price of a barrel of oil, which has been falling in      recent days, jumped about 7 percent on the New York market.  Gasoline      futures were also higher.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      In the days before Hurricane Katrina, the energy markets grew complacent.      A lot of traders dismissed speculation that the storm would do much      damage. This time around, no one is making that mistake.  As Rita began      to move toward the Gulf, energy prices began to rise, and by the end of      the day, gasoline futures were up 14 percent.  Heating oil futures were      up 11 percent.  Fadel Gheit is senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer &      Company.      Mr. FADEL GHEIT (Senior Energy Analyst, Oppenheimer & Company):  We are      really suffering from the previous hurricane.  The facilities are not      back online and will not be back online for quite a long time, so the      market, really, is very apprehensive and cannot stand another push.      ZARROLI:  Meanwhile, Royal Dutch/Shell and Chevron reportedly were again      evacuating workers from oil rigs in the Gulf, many of which are being      repaired.  Today's price surge comes at a time when oil has been falling      back down again.  Oil hit almost $71 a barrel in the days after Katrina,      but it has been reversing course lately as production in the Gulf began      to recover.  But Fadel Gheit says production capacity in the Gulf remains      severely strained.      Mr. GHEIT:  Overall, I think that the Gulf production is down by about 50      percent from the pre-hurricane levels.  You know, we're talking about      more than a million barrel a day, combined oil and gas, that's been taken      out of the market.      ZARROLI:  And Gheit says about 35 percent of the Gulf's refining capacity      remains down because of Katrina.  Four refineries in Louisiana and      Mississippi are shut down, including two of the largest facilities, and      it's not clear when they will reopen.  Many traders are worried that Rita      could damage parts of the oil infrastructure that were spared by Katrina.      As oil markets closed this afternoon, it appeared the storm could be      headed for the Texas coast, where 26 petroleum refineries are located,      about a quarter of total US capacity.      Oil prices were not helped by mixed signals from OPEC officials who are      meeting in Vienna.  The United States has pushed OPEC to increase      production, and OPEC officials have said they are willing to release two      million barrels a day of spare capacity, but they stopped short of      actually increasing quotas, saying they would do so only if it was      absolutely necessary.

With tropical storm Rita headed toward the Gulf of Mexico, energy prices      soared today.  The price of a barrel of oil, which has been falling in      recent days, jumped about 7 percent on the New York market.  Gasoline      futures were also higher.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.       JIM ZARROLI reporting:       In the days before Hurricane Katrina, the energy markets grew complacent.      A lot of traders dismissed speculation that the storm would do much      damage. This time around, no one is making that mistake.  As Rita began      to move toward the Gulf, energy prices began to rise, and by the end of      the day, gasoline futures were up 14 percent.  Heating oil futures were      up 11 percent.  Fadel Gheit is senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer &      Company.       Mr. FADEL GHEIT (Senior Energy Analyst, Oppenheimer & Company):  We are      really suffering from the previous hurricane.  The facilities are not      back online and will not be back online for quite a long time, so the      market, really, is very apprehensive and cannot stand another push.       ZARROLI:  Meanwhile, Royal Dutch/Shell and Chevron reportedly were again      evacuating workers from oil rigs in the Gulf, many of which are being      repaired.  Today's price surge comes at a time when oil has been falling      back down again.  Oil hit almost $71 a barrel in the days after Katrina,      but it has been reversing course lately as production in the Gulf began      to recover.  But Fadel Gheit says production capacity in the Gulf remains      severely strained.       Mr. GHEIT:  Overall, I think that the Gulf production is down by about 50      percent from the pre-hurricane levels.  You know, we're talking about      more than a million barrel a day, combined oil and gas, that's been taken      out of the market.

In a state like      New Hampshire, where half the homes are heated by oil, residents are      scrambling for cheaper alternatives.  New Hampshire Public Radio's Kerry      Grens reports on the soaring demand for wood.      KERRY GRENS reporting:      The firewood industry ranges from the most basic practice of ax meets log      to the sophisticated processing of prepackaged wood pellets.  Right now      pellets are a booming industry, with shipments in the Northeast up 20      percent from last year and pellet stove shipments up 60 percent.  The      stoves resemble traditional wood burners but with automatic feeds,      computerized temperature controls and electric blowers.      (Soundbite of pellet factory operations)      Unidentified Man:  Quite dusty in here.      GRENS:  Each day the New England Wood Pellet factory in southwest New      Hampshire takes about 200 tons of sawdust and presses it into little      rabbit-foodlike nuggets.      (Soundbite of pellet factory operations)      GRENS:  The factory recently expanded its production by over 30 percent.      But operations manager Norwood Keaney(ph) says it's still not enough to      meet demand.      Mr. NORWOOD KEANEY (Operations Manager, New England Wood Pellet):  We're      standing in our warehouse, which, at this time of year, really ought to      have a whole lot more product in it.  But as one looks around and one      listens to the echo in the building, you realize that it is quite empty.      GRENS:  Stacks of pellets are being sold out at retail stores in what      owners have called a panic and a hoarding frenzy.  One store put      customers on a three-week waiting list.  Heating oil prices average $2. 65      a gallon in New Hampshire.  The Maine State planning office calculates      that at that price, homes heated with wood will save over 40 percent in      heating costs compared with those heated with oil.  But only between 3      and 10 percent of homes in New Hampshire are fueled primarily from wood.      Most wood burners use it as a supplemental source of heat.      Mr. JOE OLYMPIO(ph):  We probably burn less than a cord a year, but I      think that's about to change.      GRENS:  Joe Olympio stands outside the Abundant Life Wood & Gas Stove      shop near Concord.  The store has a large sign urging passing drivers to      beat the oil prices.  Olympio's shopping for a new stove.      Mr. OLYMPIO:  Because of the oil prices, I'm looking at splitting and      cutting a lot more wood than I usually have in the last five years.      GRENS:  Olympio hopes he can cut his oil use by about 20 percent, and      luckily for him, he already has his wood ready to go.  Prices of firewood      have gone up by about a third in the last year, and the supply is short.      Jason Stock, the executive director of the New Hampshire Timberland      Association, says the problem is that this year's wood burners are      relying on last year's harvest.      Mr. JASON STOCK (Executive Director, New Hampshire Timberland      Association): You have to allow almost a year's time for the wood to dry      out.  So one of the pickles that people are finding themselves in is that      they're able to buy wood, but it's not seasoned; it's what they call      green wood.  That's a tree that's been freshly cut.      GRENS:  Stock predicts that demand will continue to rise.  He says the      resource will not be a limiting factor; that there are definitely enough      trees to heat houses.  It's just that production needs to expand.  And      even now, he says, seasoned wood is available.  It's all a matter of how      much people are willing to pay for it.  For NPR News, this is Kerry Grens      in Concord, New Hampshire.

With us to talk about what the Fed may do is David Wessel,      deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal.      Good morning, David.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street      Journal): Good morning.      INSKEEP:  So what will they do?      Mr. WESSEL:  Almost everybody expects them to raise interest rates,      another quarter percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent.  There's been some      hesitation in the markets.  They thought they might hold off because of      Hurricane Katrina. But that's evaporated and the Fed has said nothing to      discourage people from believing that.      INSKEEP:  Well, why wouldn't the Fed hold off increasing interest rates      again since that's a move that would slow down the economy and you      already have this hurricane slowing down the economy?      Mr. WESSEL:  The Fed would say to that, `Look, the one thing we can do      for the people of the Gulf Coast is to make sure the rest of the economy      is stable, growing and avoiding inflation. '  Right now it doesn't look      like Katrina, though devastating to the Gulf Coast, has been as      devastating to the national economy as some people have feared.  So the      Fed is going to take the long view and say, `We have to look ahead to      where the economy will be six to 12 months from now and we think it needs      another rate increase. '      INSKEEP:  Will there be some people who see this as a heartless move      given the timing?      Mr. WESSEL:  Absolutely.  Nobody likes rate increases and any time that      the Fed seems to be doing something that's counter to the needs of the      most vulnerable people in our society, they get criticism.  Look, being      chairman of the Fed is a little bit like steering a big ocean liner and      not being able to see where you're going.  And there's a little whiff of      inflation in the air. Oil prices are up a lot.  Gasoline prices are up a      lot.  That hasn't translated into increases in other consumer prices, but      the Fed is definitely worried that it might and they want to make sure      that doesn't happen.      INSKEEP:  By choosing to raise rates at this time, would the Fed      effectively be saying they're happy with how strong the economy is      despite Hurricane Katrina?      Mr. WESSEL:  I think it would be a vote of confidence in how much the US      economy seems to be able to adjust to shocks, even those as great as      Katrina.      INSKEEP:  Would the Fed be right to have faith in the resilience of the      economy right now?      Mr. WESSEL:  Nobody really knows whether they're right or not.  The only      thing we know is that the worst-case scenario, that oil prices today      would be at a hundred dollars a barrel and gas would be at $4 a gallon,      hasn't come to pass, and we do know that the economy still seems to be      showing some signs of life, and it's going to get a big dose of help from      federal spending.      INSKEEP:  Tens of billions of dollars already on the way for hurricane      relief, maybe hundreds of billions on the way.  What does that do to the      deficit?  What does that do to the economy?  And how does that concern      the Fed?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, it definitely makes the deficit bigger.  For the Fed,      it means this.  Congress is going to give the economy a big shot of      adrenaline in the form of all this hurricane-related spending and that      makes it easier for them to raise interest rates.      INSKEEP:  How far will the Fed go?      Mr. WESSEL:  Markets expect the Fed to go at least to 4 percent on their      key interest rate, and maybe as high as 4 1/2, but one interesting thing      is that there's only three more Fed meetings left before Alan Greenspan      retires as chairman.  So how far the Fed actually takes rates has a lot      to do with the beliefs of the person who succeeds him.      INSKEEP:  We've talked about this before.  Would the Fed be more likely      to raise interest rates now to avoid any concern and worry as this      transition takes place at the top of the Fed?      Mr. WESSEL:  I don't think that's their primary concern, but I do believe      Mr. Greenspan will err on the side of raising rates, both to prevent      inflation from getting out of hand in his last days in office and to make      life a little easier for his successor.      INSKEEP:  David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall      Street Journal, thanks very much.      Mr. WESSEL:  You're welcome.      INSKEEP:  This is NPR News.

The best-known of these is      Halliburton.  Once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, Halliburton has      made more money in Iraq than any other contractor, about $10 billion.  A      rival firm, Bechtel, has brought in more than $3 billion.  Both are among      an elite group of multinationals that have received no-bid contracts to      aid rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf region.  But several contractors      in Iraq, including Halliburton, have been cited for cost overruns.  Some      have been accused of corruption.      Washington Post staff writer Griff Witte has been covering the private      contracting business.  He joins us from the nation's capital.  Welcome.      Mr. GRIFF WITTE (The Washington Post):  Thanks so much for having me.      CHIDEYA:  So can you just make it clear, the connection between the firms      that have been working in Iraq and the Katrina cleanup?      Mr. WITTE:  It's interesting.  You're seeing somewhat of a reunion.  It's      like the whole gang is in the Gulf Coast now.  Halliburton had a      pre-existing Navy contract, which was actually competitively bid that      they're now using to do a lot of reconstruction work down there.  Bechtel      actually got a brand-new hundred-million dollar no-bid contract.  They're      trying to basically construct temporary housing for some of the people      who have been displaced by the hurricane.  Also, the--Blackwater USA is      down in the Gulf Coast.  You probably remember Blackwater from Iraq.      They were the security company that had four of its security guards      killed in Fallujah last year, and they were strung up from the bridge      that spans the river there.  And they are also a company that had a lot      of business in Iraq, and now they're doing business in the Gulf Coast as      well.  They're basically securing FEMA facilities down there.      CHIDEYA:  FEMA is going to be distributing at least $62 billion to help      reconstruct the Gulf regions that were hit by Katrina.  Who ultimately is      responsible for making the decisions about who to hire, how much scrutiny      they should have both initially and ongoing?      Mr. WITTE:  Well, it's an interesting question because FEMA is an agency,      obviously, that is under attack right now, very heavily criticized, and      it's an agency that is being criticized in large part because the agency      has been hollowed out, to a certain extent.  A lot of its top civil      servants have left in recent years.  It's been left with a lot of      political appointees who have been running the agency who don't      necessarily have a background in disaster management.  So you've had a      void that's developed there.  And actually, it's the case now that      contractors are going to be helping out in managing these contracts.      FEMA has hired a contractor essentially to help it with contract      management because they don't have the number of people in-house to do it      on their own with government employees.      CHIDEYA:  In theory, Republicans have stood for a smaller government,      Democrats for a somewhat larger government.  As some commentators have      noted, for example, David Brooks of The New York Times, the era of small      government is over, and Republicans don't necessarily stand for small      government.  That said, what does the need to outsource so much of this      effort say about the size of government and what's needed?      Mr. WITTE:  If the Katrina recovery does not work out well, if it      continues to flail, if it continues to be beset by the same kind of      problems that you saw with the initial response, I think that you are      going to be seeing a lot of people wondering was it a good decision to      outsource so much of what government does, to contract that out?  And      remember that this is not a purely partisan movement.  The outsourcing of      government began in earnest really in the Clinton administration with the      reinventing government initiatives of Vice President Al Gore.  That was a      major initiative of the Clinton administration. It was something that      they took great pride in, that they were reducing the number of overall      federal employees, that they were giving work to the private sector where      it was warranted.  That was something that was certainly--it was a trend      that was certainly continued under President Bush when he took office,      but it was not something that he began.  And the big question now is is      it working?  Is it providing for effective services to the people who are      paying taxes.      CHIDEYA:  Last question, and briefly, who will step in if there seems to      be overcharging or misappropriations of funds?  Whose job is that?      Mr. WITTE:  One of the lessons of Iraq, if you talk to the people who are      now overseeing contracts in Iraq, is that you need oversight very early      in the process.  You need someone to step in immediately and say, `We're      here to police business and we're here to make sure that no one is      committing fraud, no one is wasting money,' and there's an open question      about who's going to be doing that now.  The Department of Homeland      Security has an Inspector General's Office.  They are on the ground, and      they have said that they are going to be taking a lead in this.      But there are members of Congress who feel that the Department of      Homeland Security's IG Office is in over its head on this one, and so      there are a number of proposals out there.  One is to create a new      special Inspector General's Office that would just look at Iraq.  Another      is to expand the work of the special inspector general for Iraq and have      it look at Gulf Coast work as well.  There are proposals out there to      create a bipartisan commission that would oversee all of these contracts      and make sure that no funny business is going on.  So it really is not      entirely clear right now who is going to be doing the monitoring, but if      you talk to people who are now overseeing the Iraq contracts, they'll      tell you that regardless of who does it, someone needs to be doing it      soon.      CHIDEYA:  Griff Witte is a reporter from The Washington Post.  He's been      covering the private contracting business for the paper since February.      Thank you so much.      Mr. WITTE:  Thank you.  It was my pleasure.      CHIDEYA:  Farai Chideya, NPR News.      ED GORDON (Host):  You're listening to NEWS & NOTES from NPR News.       FARAI CHIDEYA reporting:       Black businesses are expected to reap some of the profits from the      rebuilding of New Orleans, but the lion's share will go to companies that      have become household names in Iraq.  The best-known of these is      Halliburton.  Once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, Halliburton has      made more money in Iraq than any other contractor, about $10 billion.  A      rival firm, Bechtel, has brought in more than $3 billion.  Both are among      an elite group of multinationals that have received no-bid contracts to      aid rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf region.  But several contractors      in Iraq, including Halliburton, have been cited for cost overruns.  Some      have been accused of corruption.       Washington Post staff writer Griff Witte has been covering the private      contracting business.  He joins us from the nation's capital.  Welcome.       Mr. GRIFF WITTE (The Washington Post):  Thanks so much for having me.       CHIDEYA:  So can you just make it clear, the connection between the firms      that have been working in Iraq and the Katrina cleanup?       Mr. WITTE:  It's interesting.  You're seeing somewhat of a reunion.  It's      like the whole gang is in the Gulf Coast now.  Halliburton had a      pre-existing Navy contract, which was actually competitively bid that      they're now using to do a lot of reconstruction work down there.  Bechtel      actually got a brand-new hundred-million dollar no-bid contract.  They're      trying to basically construct temporary housing for some of the people      who have been displaced by the hurricane.  Also, the--Blackwater USA is      down in the Gulf Coast.  You probably remember Blackwater from Iraq.      They were the security company that had four of its security guards      killed in Fallujah last year, and they were strung up from the bridge      that spans the river there.  And they are also a company that had a lot      of business in Iraq, and now they're doing business in the Gulf Coast as      well.  They're basically securing FEMA facilities down there.       CHIDEYA:  FEMA is going to be distributing at least $62 billion to help      reconstruct the Gulf regions that were hit by Katrina.  Who ultimately is      responsible for making the decisions about who to hire, how much scrutiny      they should have both initially and ongoing?       Mr. WITTE:  Well, it's an interesting question because FEMA is an agency,      obviously, that is under attack right now, very heavily criticized, and      it's an agency that is being criticized in large part because the agency      has been hollowed out, to a certain extent.  A lot of its top civil      servants have left in recent years.  It's been left with a lot of      political appointees who have been running the agency who don't      necessarily have a background in disaster management.  So you've had a      void that's developed there.  And actually, it's the case now that      contractors are going to be helping out in managing these contracts.      FEMA has hired a contractor essentially to help it with contract      management because they don't have the number of people in-house to do it      on their own with government employees.       CHIDEYA:  In theory, Republicans have stood for a smaller government,      Democrats for a somewhat larger government.

You      might assume the city's wrecked real estate is worth nothing anymore.      Some think, though, that with so much money pouring in, property values      will go up.  NPR's Adam Davidson spoke to some hopeful sellers and buyers      to find out how the market is doing.      ADAM DAVIDSON reporting:      Carol Loomis(ph) and her family had never been to Atlanta before Katrina,      but they evacuated there to stay at a friend's house.  Loomis remembers      when they decided to stay.  It was two days after they enrolled their      nine-year-old daughter, Alex(ph), in school.      Mrs. CAROL LOOMIS (Evacuee):  That happened after we got her in school      and she came home--it was the Friday after the hurricane actually--and      she said, `Mom, Dad, I'm on the student council.  I decided I really want      to get involved. '      DAVIDSON:  Loomis and her husband, Patrick(ph) decided that their      daughter had enough trauma from the hurricane.  They'll just stay in      Atlanta.  But that means they have to sell their home in New Orleans.      Mrs. LOOMIS:  We need the money that we put into the house.  Why?      Because we don't have a lot of other money.      DAVIDSON:  They just bought the place in June for $325,000.  Loomis says      it's a great house, a century-old shotgun with 19 gorgeous windows.  She      knows her block wasn't flooded, but she hasn't been back to the city      since the storm.      Mrs. LOOMIS:  We're still not a hundred percent sure that it's OK.  We      haven't had anybody give us a visual of our house.  I know we've got      stinky things in the refrigerator.  You know what I'm saying?      DAVIDSON:  Loomis is hoping to get what she paid for the house, maybe a      few thousand more, but what she wants most, she says, is to get the sale      done and start her new life in Atlanta.  But that's not how Kurt      Bookart(ph) feels.  He lives in the same area.  He owns three houses, and      he's been told they're fine.  He's trying to sell them for a lot of      money.      Mr. KURT BOOKART (Evacuee):  From what I've read, price gouging on real      estate is not illegal.      DAVIDSON:  Bookart is right.  Louisiana law outlaws price gouging on      goods and services during a state of emergency, but the State Attorney      General's office says the law does not cover real estate.  Bookart wants      to charge $100,000 or more above what his homes would have fetched a      month ago.  He figures with all the money pouring into New Orleans, his      properties must be worth a lot more. And then there are the out-of-state      speculators who are thinking just the opposite.  John Olson is a real      estate broker in Portland, Oregon.      Mr. JOHN OLSON (Real Estate Broker):  Just one guy who is looking to      maybe buy one or two destroyed houses, basically.      DAVIDSON:  Olson has never been to New Orleans.  He doesn't know anything      about the city, he says, but here's his theory:  Some family's house was      destroyed.  They're desperate to move on and will sell their land at a      big discount.  Olson can hold onto it and resell it for a lot more when      the city's rebuilt.      Mr. OLSON:  People were saying, `Oh, these greedy capitalist, greedy      investors are going try to steal your property. '  I don't believe it.      DAVIDSON:  He says he's hoping to help a family out, and he says no one      will sell if they don't want the money.  To Olson, there's nothing wrong      with speculators from out of state profiting.      Mr. OLSON:  This is an incredibly risky investment, and I stand to lose      everything, every dime, every penny I put in.  Whenever you have a risky      investment, the reward is usually higher if it works out.      DAVIDSON:  Olson says that people in New Orleans who have enough money      will hold on and wait for insurance checks and government payouts before      they do anything.  Not everyone has that luxury.  For now, everything is      uncertain and it's difficult to know what any property is really worth.      Adam Davidson, NPR News, New Orleans.

I'm Noah Adams.      All that glitters is not gold, but the price of the real thing has been      putting on a scintillating performance in recent weeks.  The yellow metal      reached $470 an ounce in London trading today, its highest level since      the beginning of this year.  Some analysts are predicting it could go      much higher, but this may not be good news for the rest of us.  Joining      us from \"Marketplace's\" London bureau is Stephen Beard.      Welcome, Mr. Beard.  Why are people buying gold now?  What's up with      gold?      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      Well, Noah, there's always a certain amount of physical demand, of      course. People actually buy gold mostly to make jewelry, and 300 tons a      year are used by the electronics industry to make contacts and      connectors, 70 million tons are snapped up by the dental profession.  But      this most recent buying spree is almost certainly investment.  This is      big hedge funds, wealthy individuals buying gold because they think the      price is gonna go up.      ADAMS:  And why do think the price is go--are people concerned about      inflation here?      BEARD:  That seems to be the likeliest explanation, yes.  I mean, gold      doesn't earn an income like shares or bonds, it's expensive to store and      insure.  The only real justification for investing in it is if you think      money, currencies are going to lose value because of inflation.  And a      number of analysts here in London are saying that this spike in the price      of gold is a sign of waning confidence in currencies.  Here's Andrew      Hilton, the head of a leading think tank here, the Centre for the Study      of Financial Innovation.      Mr. ANDREW HILTON (Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation):  Gold      is the haven of last resort for those who have no faith that      governments--and not just the American government, but European      governments and the Japanese government--can actually preserve the value      of their currencies.      BEARD:  And this is the point, really, that all the world's major      currencies have a big question mark over them at the moment:  the dollar      because of the budget and trade deficits; the euro because of economic      stagnation and uncertainty after the German elections; and the yen      because of lingering doubts about the strength of the Japanese recovery.      ADAMS:  But the investors in gold--they call them goldbugs, I      understand--don't think we're about to see a big burst of inflation?      BEARD:  No, they don't.  I mean, if they did, gold would be much higher      than it is today.  It's worth remembering that in 1979, what was then the      Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and gold hit more than $800 an ounce, so      we're a long way from that.  But this recent spike, these analysts say,      is a sign that some investors are fretting.  Consumer price inflation has      been held down in recent years by the wave of cheap manufactured goods      from China, but they say pressure is building up from things like, for      example, the price of oil and other commodities.  They argue that      inflation is far from dead; it could be reviving and could soon begin to      erode living standards.

But this recent spike, these analysts say,      is a sign that some investors are fretting.  Consumer price inflation has      been held down in recent years by the wave of cheap manufactured goods      from China, but they say pressure is building up from things like, for      example, the price of oil and other commodities.  They argue that      inflation is far from dead; it could be reviving and could soon begin to      erode living standards.

As the wind speed of Hurricane Rita keeps rising, so does the price of      oil.  More big oil companies are moving their workers out of the Gulf of      Mexico.  The storm is heading toward the Texas coast, home to many big      refineries.  And many energy traders are worried it will disable      production facilities that were spared by Katrina three weeks ago.  NPR's      Jim Zarroli reports.      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      Once again yesterday, a hurricane was creeping across the Gulf of Mexico      gathering strength as it moved, and oil companies were contemplating more      damage to their rigs and refineries.  Concern about the storm's impact on      oil production sent stock prices down and the president of Valero Oil      warned that gasoline could shoot back over $3 a gallon.  Meanwhile, the      price of a barrel of oil rose another $1. 15 on the New York market,      finishing at $67. 35.  That was on top of big increases earlier this week.      Dan Pickering, president of Pickering Energy Partners in Houston, said      traders are worried that Rita will damage facilities that were spared by      Katrina.      Mr. DAN PICKERING (President, Pickering Energy Partners):  Every little      bit matters in this environment, and so lowering US gasoline production,      if only for a few days, will tighten up the market on the margin and      that's what you've seen the financial markets react to.      ZARROLI:  Of big concern right now is refining capacity.  Katrina shut      down most of the big oil refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi, and      four are still off line.  About a quarter of the nation's refining      capacity is in Texas.  But Pickering says, even if Rita remains a strong      hurricane, there are reasons to be less worried about the outcome.  He      says the Texas refineries are spread out over a much larger area than      those struck by Katrina.      Mr. PICKERING:  That's a big area and you--so you have some pockets of      capacity, but it's not all bunched in one place and, I think, important      to remember--that the damage from Katrina was both loss of power at the      refineries and then water damage.      ZARROLI:  Pickering says Rita could knock power out to the refineries,      but the odds are against a repeat of the unusual storm surge caused by      Katrina. Still, with the memory of Katrina's destruction so fresh in      people's minds, many people in the oil business, like many people      throughout the Gulf, aren't taking any chances.

I'm Noah Adams.      Hurricane Rita has been sending shock waves around the world's financial      markets.  Shares in some insurance companies have fallen sharply.  The      worry is that Rita could cause even more destruction than Katrina and      trigger further multibillion-dollar claims.  But the biggest fear is      about oil and whether this hurricane will damage more installations and      push fuel prices even higher.  Joining us now from London is      \"Marketplace's\" European editor Stephen Beard.  He's been talking to      dealers in the London oil market.      What's happening there to the price of crude, Stephen?      STEPHEN BEARD reporting:      Well, Noah, it's been moving higher for much of the day, edging back up      towards that $70-a-barrel level for high quality American crude which we      last saw in the immediate aftermath of Katrina.      ADAMS:  Are they thinking that Rita will actually knock out some of those      oil rigs out in the Gulf of Mexico?      BEARD:  Yes, that's the first concern, the impact on crude production.      Our information is that more than half the manned offshore platforms and      oil rigs in the Gulf have been evacuated because of Rita, and that's      nearly three-quarters of oil production in the Gulf now shut down.  So a      region that was only beginning to recover after Katrina now has yet more      disruption.      And there's some concern that because Rita is so powerful, and more      powerful than Katrina, she could cause serious damage to underwater pipes      and other installations which could take weeks and perhaps even months to      repair, which obviously would further reduce the flow of crude.      ADAMS:  And then you get to the flow of gasoline to the pumps eventually.      BEARD:  Very much so.  If Rita keeps to her present path, she could hit      as many as 16 American oil refineries.  And as senior London oil trader      Rob Laughlin told me, that includes three of the most important.      Mr. ROB LAUGHLIN (London Oil Trader):  Most notable is the big BP Texas      City Refinery, which is a refinery worth around 500,000 barrels a day.      You've got the Lake Charles Refinery, the Port Arthur Refinery, three of      the largest refineries in the Southern side of the US.  They're all at      risk.      BEARD:  Lasting damage to big refineries like that means more expensive      gasoline, of course.  And that naturally will mean more expensive      gasoline on this side of the Atlantic, too, as American oil companies and      distribution companies will be shopping around for refined product here      as they did after Katrina.      Well, coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we'll have the latest on      Rita's economic repercussions.

Now the recovery effort is beginning to create jobs.  And because there      still aren't enough job seekers in some places, pay for low-wage workers      is going up.  NPR's Frank Langfitt reports.      FRANK LANGFITT reporting:      Lakim Gild(ph) used to work as a cook at the Chateau Country Club just      outside of New Orleans.  These days, he sets up temporary housing for      people like himself, left homeless by the storm.  Gild says the pay was a      pleasant surprise.      Mr. LAKIM GILD:  They started me off with 13. 25 an hour, and that's      wonderful compared to what I was making.  I was making 9. 35.      LANGFITT:  Gild got his new job through a recruiter who visited the      shelter in Baton Rouge where he's living with his four children, his      fiancee and her family.  Gild now works for Flour, one of the first big      companies to do government-contracted recovery work.  Earlier this week,      Flour showed him how to set up trailers.      Mr. GILD:  It's so simple that anyone can do it.  They're just teaching      us how to set and lock trailers down and, you know, teaching us how to      use certain tools, different tools like the Jackson, the leveler, you      know, different kinds of saws that we'll be using cutting the wood.  It's      basically just common sense.      LANGFITT:  President Bush has suspended a law called Davis-Bacon, which      requires firms to pay prevailing wages on government contracts and often      favors union labor.  But instead of paying laborers less, Flour's paying      them more, as much as $16. 40 an hour.  That's because of competition from      other contractors, says a Flour recruiter.  Pay for low-wage workers can      rise in the short term after a disaster because of high demand, according      to economists.      That's what seems to be happening in Gulfport, Mississippi.  A      representative for Labor Ready, a temporary service firm, reports trying      to fill several hundred jobs, but only finding a couple dozen takers.      Stacey Burke is a spokeswoman for Labor Ready.  She says this is not new.      Ms. STACEY BURKE (Spokeswoman, Labor Ready):  Last year, in the wake of      the hurricanes in Florida, we saw a similar situation, for the short      term, an enormous demand for workers to clean up after the devastation.      LANGFITT:  But an opportunity for workers can be a loss for small      business owners like Richard Chenoweth.  Chenoweth runs Scranton's, a      restaurant in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  After Katrina flooded his place,      he brought back some of his workers to clean it up.      Mr. RICHARD CHENOWETH (Scranton's):  I was paying them anywhere from 10      to $12 an hour, trying to keep them employed and keep them, you know,      with some hope that, `Hey, what you're doing is you're cleaning up the      restaurant to get this place open, you know, so that you will have a job,      and you will have something to do. '      LANGFITT:  But Chenoweth says he has lost a third of his work force.      Several employees took jobs with companies cleaning up storm damage.      Mr. CHENOWETH:  They're making, you know, anywhere from 15 to $20 an hour      working for different subcontractors that are--you know, they're--some      are working for companies that are cleaning up plants, you know,      corporations that have been flooded, doing labor, doing picking up,      cleaning up, raking up, you know, anything like that, very--you know,      just your entry level job.  And they're making more than they can make      here.      LANGFITT:  Most of the initial recovery jobs won't last.  Flour plans to      employ people like Lakim Gild, the former cook, for three to nine months.      But a new job can get a person thinking.  Gild says he was looking to      get out of New Orleans anyway.  The work with Flour is one more reason to      stay around Baton Rouge.      Mr. GILD:  You know, I wouldn't mind just leaving and not looking back,      especially with the opportunity with this job.  I really, really don't      want to go back.      LANGFITT:  For now, the job provides needed income and stability, as Gild      looks to move on from the shelter.

This past weekend, before Hurricane Rita made landfall, refineries along      the Texas and Louisiana coast shut down.  One-quarter of the oil refining      capacity in the United States was in Rita's path.  This soon after the      storm, only the most preliminary damage reports are in.  The Associated      Press reports that Valero Energy Corporation said its      255,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Port Arthur suffered damages that      would keep it offline for at least two weeks.  Motiva Enterprises and      Citgo Petroleum told the AP that their refineries suffered minor damage,      but ExxonMobil Corporation said its 557,000-barrel-per-day refinery      outside Houston, the country's largest, was safe to restart.      In anticipation of Rita, analysts warned that gas prices could rise as      high as $4 a gallon.  Analysts have also worried that the region's      enormous natural gas processing facilities would suffer damage from Rita,      potentially touching off a rise in energy costs for homeowners and      industry around the country. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco this      weekend said that at least one natural gas plant in her state was      damaged.  Mike Zenker is a natural gas specialist with Cambridge Energy      Research Associates and he's on the phone.      Welcome to the program, sir.      Mr. MIKE ZENKER (Cambridge Energy Research Associates):  Good morning,      Liane.      HANSEN:  So what are you immediately looking for to learn about what the      situation actually is along the Texas-Louisiana coastline?      Mr. ZENKER:  Well, maybe a little context would be helpful here, and when      we think of the Gulf, we often tend to think of oil production, but it      turns out that the US is more dependent on the Gulf for natural gas and      for oil.  About 20 percent of US natural gas needs are supplied from the      waters of the Gulf of Mexico while only about 10 percent of oil is.  If      you add in then the Gulf Coast to the offshore Gulf of Mexico, these      comprise about half of US gas supplies.  So both Katrina and Rita passed      through the breadbasket of natural gas production.  So we're looking for      potential damage to both offshore and onshore facilities.  It turns out      that Katrina knocked out three important gas processing facilities in      Louisiana that are preventing gas from flowing from offshore to pipelines      to consumers.      HANSEN:  So how strong is the current capacity and what do you expect to      see happen with the prices of natural gas in the coming months?      Mr. ZENKER:  Yeah, this is even more problematic since the industry was      already worried about meeting winter demand.  The greatest use of natural      gas is during the winter for heating, and this concern really is rooted      in the inability of producers to grow supply.  The ability to produce      natural gas in the US has been relatively flat for a decade, but imports      from Canada had kept the market well supplied and prices low.  Both US      and Canadian natural gas production peaked in 2001 and yet there's been a      growing number of uses for natural gas in homes and businesses and now      power.  So we've had this mismatch between supply and demand.  Katrina      and Rita now come in and remove about what turns to be eight to nine days      of total gas production for the US, and with no spare supply, we have a      real problem.  And unlike oil, we can't import natural gas in sufficient      quantities to offset this.  So Katrina and Rita together come at a very      difficult time for the industry.      HANSEN:  So you anticipate there's going to be a critical shortage of      natural gas this winter.      Mr. ZENKER:  It looks, Liane, like there'll be enough for homes and      business, but as we approach that important winter heating season, the      real concern of the industry is whether there's a sufficient amount of      inventory for all uses. What traditionally happens is some of the key      industries that use natural gas are simply not able to get enough for      their needs or prices are too high, but all consumers wind up paying      because just as we buy natur--or gasoline at the pump whenever we need      it, that's similarly how utilities tend to buy natural gas, on the spot      market, and prices already had doubled before Katrina.  And now with      Katrina and Rita, prices have doubled yet again at the wholesale level.      HANSEN:  Is there any silver lining?      Mr. ZENKER:  The silver lining is that the industry is very flexible.  It      has shown resiliency to respond very quickly to these events in the past,      and there's already a lot of critical work to restore these facilities,      some heroic efforts.  We will get through this winter, and the real      silver lining comes in that there's a lot of investment going on to drill      new supplies both domestically and then internationally there's a lot of      new supply coming, but that's a few years off.      HANSEN:  Mike Zenker is a natural gas specialist at Cambridge Energy      Research Associates.      Thanks for your time.      Mr. ZENKER:  Thank you.       LIANE HANSEN, host:       When Hurricane Katrina hit almost four weeks ago, it knocked out oil      refinery production by about 800,000 barrels a day, approximately 5      percent of US capacity, and sparked a sudden rise in gasoline prices.      This past weekend, before Hurricane Rita made landfall, refineries along      the Texas and Louisiana coast shut down.  One-quarter of the oil refining      capacity in the United States was in Rita's path.  This soon after the      storm, only the most preliminary damage reports are in.  The Associated      Press reports that Valero Energy Corporation said its      255,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Port Arthur suffered damages that      would keep it offline for at least two weeks.  Motiva Enterprises and      Citgo Petroleum told the AP that their refineries suffered minor damage,      but ExxonMobil Corporation said its 557,000-barrel-per-day refinery      outside Houston, the country's largest, was safe to restart.       In anticipation of Rita, analysts warned that gas prices could rise as      high as $4 a gallon.  Analysts have also worried that the region's      enormous natural gas processing facilities would suffer damage from Rita,      potentially touching off a rise in energy costs for homeowners and      industry around the country. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco this      weekend said that at least one natural gas plant in her state was      damaged.  Mike Zenker is a natural gas specialist with Cambridge Energy      Research Associates and he's on the phone.       Welcome to the program, sir.       Mr. MIKE ZENKER (Cambridge Energy Research Associates):  Good morning,      Liane.       HANSEN:  So what are you immediately looking for to learn about what the      situation actually is along the Texas-Louisiana coastline?       Mr. ZENKER:  Well, maybe a little context would be helpful here, and when      we think of the Gulf, we often tend to think of oil production, but it      turns out that the US is more dependent on the Gulf for natural gas and      for oil.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      As the weather clears over the Gulf Coast, the nation's economic climate      is also improving.  Federal officials say Hurricane Rita did minimal      damage to refineries in its path, and the Bush administration's top      economist is now saying the effect of both recent hurricanes on the US      economy should be modest.  \"Marketplace\" New York bureau chief Bob Moon      joins us now with more on this economic picture.      And, Bob, how are the oil markets reacting today?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Hi, Madeleine.  Well, we were all at the mercy      of the winds as the weekend began, and fortunately it would seem that      we've been spared the worst.  That's a relative term, of course.  So even      though the price of a barrel of oil was trading lower today as the      session began and the turbulent energy markets have settled down a bit,      there's also some concern still out there among some analysts that it's      not strictly true to say that we have escaped here untouched.  Refining      capacity is down by several million gallons a day, and it'll take a while      to restore that.      President Bush did tell reporters today that the capacity should return      relatively quickly because the storm did miss a lot of the key places      down there.  He says about 1. 8 million barrels a day should be back      online soon in both Texas and Louisiana.  Meantime, he is urging      Americans to conserve gasoline whenever possible.  He says he remains      prepared to loan crude oil to refineries from the nation's emergency      stockpile if that has to happen.      But the picture certainly isn't as dismal as it looked heading into the      weekend.  In fact, one senior government energy analyst did say today      that there's still plenty of crude oil in storage, so even if there is      more damage discovered to the big drilling platforms offshore, there      shouldn't be a really serious problem.      BRAND:  And in terms of the overall economy, why is the administration so      confident that it is strong enough to overcome these two storms?      MOON:  Well, the White House economic adviser was putting a positive spin      on things over the weekend.  Yesterday he did voice some concern about      the effect that these higher energy prices could continue to have on the      economy, and he warned that job losses this month will be very heavy.      But he also did say that as the economy begins to recover and the jobs      start coming back over the next couple of years, the effects overall      should be actually positive on the economy.      BRAND:  And what about the financial markets?  Stock market obviously      nervous last week.  Are they--are investors reassured today?      MOON:  Seem to be.  The stock market really jumped at the open today.      One interesting reaction:  Insured losses for the insurance industry for      Rita are forecast to be way lower than predicted, so those insurance      company stocks are up today.      And today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we'll be taking a closer look at      the economic effects from all this stormy weather.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      In a few minutes, getting back to business in New Orleans.      But first, to international business.  A Chinese bid to buy the US oil      company Unocal earlier this year caused quite a stir.  Some people      questioned the wisdom of letting foreigners control an American oil      company.  But in Canada, which is the largest supplier of crude oil to      the United States, the Chinese have recently been snapping up oil      companies.  Richard Reynolds reports from Toronto.      RICHARD REYNOLDS reporting:      Several media pundits here have dubbed this the year of the Chinese      takeover. Canadians really began to notice in June when the Chinese      government-owned company Minmetals made a bid for Noranda, one of      Canada's largest mining companies.  This came on the heels of a $2      billion investment by the Chinese National Overseas Oil Company, or      CNOOC, into Canada's oil sands.  Andrew Willis is one of Canada's leading      business journalists.  He writes for The Globe and Mail newspaper.      Mr. ANDREW WILLIS (The Globe and Mail):  There you had the premier      Canadian mining company that suddenly it was going to pass into Chinese      control.  And I think the staggering thing for a lot of us who date back      to an era when Canada was vehemently protectionist was the fact that,      first of all, the public didn't seem to mind at all, and secondly, that      the government was quite willing to let that deal go through with      absolutely no problem.      REYNOLDS:  The deal later fell apart over the question of price.      Attention was focused even more in June when the Chinese signed a      memorandum of understanding to take half the capacity of a new pipeline      being built from the oil fields of Alberta to the Pacific Coast and again      when CNOOC took over oil firm PetroKazakhstan for $3. 75 billion in late      August.      The Noranda bid did generate some protest, but the more recent deals went      through with hardly any.  Andrew Willis.      Mr. WILLIS:  There was a sense of trying to connect China's record on      human rights and, you know, China's behavior in Tibet, for example, with      the Noranda purchase.  And it was a difficult argument to make right from      the start.  So after a day or two of strident blasting and trying to      connect what really are seen by most Canadians as unconnected issues, the      issue faded away.      REYNOLDS:  This is in sharp contrast to the US response over the proposed      takeover of Unocal.  US lawmakers, including Republican Congressman      Richard Pombo of California, backed a measure that delays any Chinese      acquisition of a US oil company for at least 120 days.  The measure was      included in the energy bill which was signed into law last month.  In the      end, CNOOC abandoned its takeover.  In contrast, the Canadian government      has thrown the doors wide open to investment from China.  This past      January, Prime Minister Paul Martin even signed a statement of      cooperation with the Chinese that dealt with investment in the oil and      resource sectors.  Industry Minister David Emerson.      Mr. DAVID EMERSON (Canadian Industry Minister):  The government of Canada      has taken the position that we do want an increase in international      investment into Canada, and China is certainly one of the countries that      we hope to see an intensification of our economic relationship with.      REYNOLDS:  But energy and resources are central to the Chinese overseas      investment strategy.  Walid Hejazi is a professor at Toronto's Rotman      School of Business and an expert on China.  He explains that China has      over $800 billion in foreign currency reserves and its economy is growing      so fast, it has an almost unquenchable thirst for raw materials.      Professor WALID HEJAZI (Rotman School of Business):  So it's a very      forward-looking strategy on the part of the Chinese to take this $800      billion and growing reserve of US money to deploy those resources as      strategically as possible in order to ensure the growth of their industry      in as smooth a possible way.      REYNOLDS:  Canada is one of the world's larger oil producers, but it is      also rich in coal, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, uranium and lumber, all      materials the Chinese need.  And as Loren Brandt, an economist at the      University of Toronto explains, Canada is also safe.      Mr. LOREN BRANDT (University of Toronto):  The Chinese are looking all      over for resources.  They're looking in Africa.  They're looking in Latin      America. They're looking in South America, Australia, can--they're      looking in Russia. And so some of those countries that I just mentioned      are potentially risky, very risky.      REYNOLDS:  If Canada is a target for the Chinese, should the US be      concerned? Canada is a natural resources storehouse for the US economy.      Walid Hejazi believes, as do many Canadian experts, that the US just      takes Canadian oil and resources for granted, often forgetting that      Canada is the largest and the most stable provider of oil to the United      States.      Prof. HEJAZI:  For many, many years, the Americans just believe that all      of this energy is available in Canada.  We can get access to all of this      energy, and now you have the Chinese trying to get access to not just      energy in Asia or in the Middle East, but also in Canada, and I think      that's a real threat to the Americans.      REYNOLDS:  Hejazi also believes this is just the beginning.  He expects a      huge surge of investment overseas by the Chinese in the next few years.      Media reports indicate that the Chinese may be planning a bid for Husky      Oil, one of Canada's largest oil companies and already owned by Hong Kong      billionaire Li Ka-shing.

Walid Hejazi believes, as do many Canadian experts, that the US just      takes Canadian oil and resources for granted, often forgetting that      Canada is the largest and the most stable provider of oil to the United      States.       Prof. HEJAZI:  For many, many years, the Americans just believe that all      of this energy is available in Canada.  We can get access to all of this      energy, and now you have the Chinese trying to get access to not just      energy in Asia or in the Middle East, but also in Canada, and I think      that's a real threat to the Americans.       REYNOLDS:  Hejazi also believes this is just the beginning.  He expects a      huge surge of investment overseas by the Chinese in the next few years.      Media reports indicate that the Chinese may be planning a bid for Husky      Oil, one of Canada's largest oil companies and already owned by Hong Kong      billionaire Li Ka-shing.

In New Orleans,      the Central Business District is beginning to get back to work after the      double shutdowns from Rita and from Hurricane Katrina.  Many downtown      businesses had flooded basements, but now their electricity is starting      to come back on. NPR's Jason DeRose reports on the early days of the      city's reopening.      JASON DeROSE reporting:      The sign outside the makeshift Business Credentialing Center(ph) in the      lobby of an abandoned credit union says, `Anyone wishing to do business      in the city of New Orleans must have a proper Business Credentialing      Center ID. '  The problem is the doors are locked three hours after the      center was supposed to open.      (Soundbite of voices; door being unlocked and opened)      DeROSE:  Hi.  I'm just wondering if either of you would be willing to      talk with me about, you know, that you were told to shut down.      Ms. BRANDI BOURGEOIS(ph) (Business Credentialing Center):  Come on in.      We can what we can tell you.  We don't know anything else.      DeROSE:  OK.      Brandi Bourgeois works the non-functioning Credential's desk.  She is      young and incredibly stressed.      Unidentified Woman #1:  . . . (Unintelligible).      Ms. BOURGEOIS:  That's the problem, we have no information.      Unidentified Woman #1:  No, we don't know anything . . . (unintelligible).      Ms. BOURGEOIS:  We have no idea.      Unidentified Woman #1:  . . . (Unintelligible).      DeROSE:  Well, just what happened this morning.  That's what I want to      know.      Ms. BOURGEOIS:  We were told that they were switching over.  They were      going to give out car decals, and then they didn't, and so we started      issuing IDs again and then they came in and shut us down.      DeROSE:  And who are `they'?      Ms. BOURGEOIS:  The city, the city.      DeROSE:  Outside the Credentialing Center, dozens of people are lined up      to get their IDs, right next to an ominous sign that reads, `Caution:      Falling glass. '  Two of those standing in line who witnessed the center's      closing are Christina Hernandez(ph) and Tammy Vasquez(ph).      Ms. CHRISTINA HERNANDEZ:  They were shut down, but. . .      Ms. TAMMY VASQUEZ:  By somebody with a badge, but they have no idea who      it was.  Just some guy with a badge came in and told them they had to      shut down and not to print another badge.  Nobody seems to know what's      going on.      DeROSE:  The reason these credentials are so important is that you can't      get through police and military checkpoints around the city unless you      have one, and there are rumors among the people in line here that if you      try to open a business without the credentials, you'll be shut down.      Vasquez says her work and the work of everyone in this line is essential      to getting New Orleans back to business.      Ms. VASQUEZ:  We work for an apartment management company, and we're      trying to get our apartments up and running, you know, so that way, you      know, our residents can come back, you know, and other people can have      housing and stuff like that, and nobody seems to know what's going on.      DeROSE:  Someone who did manage to get business credentials during the      brief window when the center was open is Maureen Louden(ph), the general      manager of the boutique Whitney Hotel.  The Whitney opened five years ago      in a renovated bank.  Lots of marble and brass, the old teller windows      double as the bar. Louden is inspecting the damage done by the wind, rain      and floodwater.      Ms. MAUREEN LOUDEN (Whitney Hotel):  See, this is the old vault, and this      is--I can't see it without a flashlight, but this is the vault.  We've      turned it into a dining room.  So this is the safe door, which is      starting to rust, so I'm trying to figure out what I can do to--I asked      my husband if I could borrow some of his gun oil because I thought maybe      that might do the trick, so. . .      DeROSE:  The vault dining room is an eerie sight.  Tables are still set      with napkins and silverware; a few checks still sit on the tables.      People stayed in the Whitney during Hurricane Katrina, but fled when      floodwaters started to rise in the days right after.      Ms. LOUDEN:  Most of the damage was in the basement, and unfortunately,      everything that runs the hotel is in the basement.  All the pumps that      you have to have because we're below sea level, so you have to pump the      water up, so you don't have toilets.  You don't have running water.  You      can't take a shower, and we don't have power, because the whole power      grid was in the basement also.      (Soundbite of box being opened)      Mr. KEN BRASSO(ph) (General Contractor):  These are the dryers that we're      going to put inside the rooms to dehumidify.      DeROSE:  The hotel hired Ken Brasso, a general contractor, to coordinate      repairs.  He somehow also managed to get a business credential's ID.      He's unpacking 99 boxes of dehumidifiers.  Brasso says the extent of      repairs throughout the city is overwhelming.      Mr. BRASSO:  Yes, we are stretched thin.  A lot of our work has left town      and have not come back yet, so we're working, you know, seven-10s right      now just trying to keep our head above water.      DeROSE:  That's seven days a week, 10 hours a day, until further notice.      At least general contracting is one industry buoyed by hurricanes.  By      just midafternoon, Brasso says his company already had jobs to repair two      other hotels and an apartment complex.  Jason DeRose, NPR News, New      Orleans.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      The Commerce Department reports today that the US economy was growing      strongly in the second quarter of the year, but that was before two      disastrous hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast and economists are still      trying to gauge the likely effects of that.  \"Marketplace\" New York      bureau chief Bob Moon joins us now.      Bob, although the economy was thriving before the hurricanes, maybe we      just give up on that given the extent of the damage that's been done.      BOB MOON reporting:      Well, Alex, you could look at it this way, the way a doctor looks at a      patient.  If somebody suffers severe trauma, they're likely to have a      better shot at recovery if they were in good physical shape to begin      with.  So in that sense, today's numbers are at least somewhat reassuring      because they do show that the economy was humming along quite nicely      before the disaster struck.  In the second quarter of the year, the gross      domestic product--which is pretty much the best gauge of the nation's      economic fitness--it grew at a 3. 3 percent annual rate, which is about      what analysts had been expecting. That compares to a 3. 8 percent growth      rate in the first three months of this year.      Now here's where the hurricanes come in.  Before Katrina and Rita, the      consensus for growth in the second half of the year was above 4 percent.      Well, now economists are widely anticipating a slowing to a pace of      around 3 percent.  And keep in mind now we're talking about the economy      continuing to grow, not a nosedive here.  This is growth.  It's just      expected to be at a slower pace than had been expected.      CHADWICK:  And are there numbers that support this?      MOON:  Well, in fact, just one positive sign today from the Labor      Department. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless      benefits actually dropped by 79,000 last week, which was much better news      than had been widely anticipated.  Much of that was thanks to a big drop      in the number of hurricane-related applications.  They totaled 60,000      last week, and that was down from about 108,000 the week before.      There are a couple of caveats here, though, as well.  As often happens,      these numbers are likely to be revised at some point.  And the Labor      Department points out there are a lot of claims that were still being      collected using, you might say, out-of-the-ordinary methods because of      all the hurricane disruptions.      CHADWICK:  How about a picture of how the--of the damage the storms left?      MOON:  Wall Street's really looking for any and all data on that very      question, and there are a lot of discouraging reports still emerging out      there.  The Financial Times reports that oil industry officials now      believe that this latest hurricane, Rita, caused more damage to oil rigs      than any other storm in history, and that it could force companies to      delay drilling for oil in places even outside the Gulf because of a      likely shortage of drilling equipment.  And also, the big credit rating      service Standard & Poor's is reporting that past-due commercial mortgage      loans in the hurricane region have risen sharply, and that might not bode      well, either.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we'll be taking a look into the      pressure on the Red Cross to start sharing all those hurricane donations.      CHADWICK:  Huh.  All right.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      The country's financial picture has turned a lot darker.  The government      reports today that the hurricanes have pushed incomes down and prices      higher. That has some economists talking about a possible recession.      \"Marketplace\" New York bureau chief Bob Moon joins us with more on this.      And, Bob, I thought the consensus was just the opposite, that the      hurricane did not cause widespread economic damage.      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, that's true, Madeleine.  Most economists      are still hopeful that we can escape any extended economic downturn.      They do expect at least a downturn of several months here.  But today's      news on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in particular is really      dramatic.  Consumer spending plunged a full percentage point in August,      which is the biggest drop since the terror attacks of 9/11/2001.  That's      especially troublesome when you figure that consumer spending accounts      for two-thirds of the US economy, so this raises the big question of:      Will consumers be distressed enough by even higher gasoline prices that      the economy might be pushed into a full-blown recession?      There is even more reason for concern.  We've got the numbers out today      also on personal income.  The Commerce Department says if it hadn't been      for the disastrous weather, incomes would have gone up by 2/10ths of a      percent.  Well, instead, they went down a tenth of a percent in August.      But wait, there's more.  One more thing that could sap our wallets in the      coming months:  Inflation is on the rise, and not just energy prices.      Overall consumer inflation was up half a percent in August; that's the      biggest jump in almost five years.  That number includes energy prices.      If you factor those out, the volatile energy and food costs, though,      inflation was still up 2/10ths of a percent.  So all in all, a whole      basket of bad economic news today.      BRAND:  Some grim news, indeed.  And so does that mean if inflation's on      the rise that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates?      MOON:  Well, undoubtedly so, it would seem.  Economists say, if anything,      today's news makes the case more compelling for continuing the interest      rate hikes that the Fed hopes will hold back this inflation.  The Fed has      really seen this storm disaster cutting both ways here.  It has said that      it will hit economic growth, but that this hit is likely to be temporary,      and that's good news that it'll be short-term.  But the higher energy      prices could add to the inflationary pressures for some time to come, and      the suggestion is that the Fed intends to stay the course here with their      interest rate hikes.      BRAND:  Any good news in today's numbers?      MOON:  Well, I can offer you one ray of hope here.  The Chicago      Purchasing Managers Index rose sharply in the past month.  Now that's a      sign that factory activity in the Midwest is actually gearing up after      what was a brief contraction in August.  Analysts are seeing that as an      indication that the disastrous weather might actually be having a      positive effect on factory workers, and it's also likely to build as the      government's massive rebuilding expenditures kick in over the coming      months.      But I have to say that overall, the economic news is really not good      today. One other thing that has economists concerned:  the personal      savings rate. It's down 7/10ths of a percent, and that means that      Americans are not only spending all their income, but they're dipping      into savings.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, it's Michael Eisner's last day of      work at Disney.  We're taking a look back at his stormy reign over the      Magic Kingdom.

The government      reports today that the hurricanes have pushed incomes down and prices      higher. That has some economists talking about a possible recession.      \"Marketplace\" New York bureau chief Bob Moon joins us with more on this.       And, Bob, I thought the consensus was just the opposite, that the      hurricane did not cause widespread economic damage.       BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, that's true, Madeleine.  Most economists      are still hopeful that we can escape any extended economic downturn.      They do expect at least a downturn of several months here.  But today's      news on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in particular is really      dramatic.  Consumer spending plunged a full percentage point in August,      which is the biggest drop since the terror attacks of 9/11/2001.  That's      especially troublesome when you figure that consumer spending accounts      for two-thirds of the US economy, so this raises the big question of:      Will consumers be distressed enough by even higher gasoline prices that      the economy might be pushed into a full-blown recession?       There is even more reason for concern.  We've got the numbers out today      also on personal income.  The Commerce Department says if it hadn't been      for the disastrous weather, incomes would have gone up by 2/10ths of a      percent.  Well, instead, they went down a tenth of a percent in August.       But wait, there's more.  One more thing that could sap our wallets in the      coming months:  Inflation is on the rise, and not just energy prices.      Overall consumer inflation was up half a percent in August; that's the      biggest jump in almost five years.  That number includes energy prices.      If you factor those out, the volatile energy and food costs, though,      inflation was still up 2/10ths of a percent.  So all in all, a whole      basket of bad economic news today.       BRAND:  Some grim news, indeed.  And so does that mean if inflation's on      the rise that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates?       MOON:  Well, undoubtedly so, it would seem.  Economists say, if anything,      today's news makes the case more compelling for continuing the interest      rate hikes that the Fed hopes will hold back this inflation.  The Fed has      really seen this storm disaster cutting both ways here.  It has said that      it will hit economic growth, but that this hit is likely to be temporary,      and that's good news that it'll be short-term.  But the higher energy      prices could add to the inflationary pressures for some time to come, and      the suggestion is that the Fed intends to stay the course here with their      interest rate hikes.       BRAND:  Any good news in today's numbers?       MOON:  Well, I can offer you one ray of hope here.  The Chicago      Purchasing Managers Index rose sharply in the past month.  Now that's a      sign that factory activity in the Midwest is actually gearing up after      what was a brief contraction in August.  Analysts are seeing that as an      indication that the disastrous weather might actually be having a      positive effect on factory workers, and it's also likely to build as the      government's massive rebuilding expenditures kick in over the coming      months.       But I have to say that overall, the economic news is really not good      today. One other thing that has economists concerned:  the personal      savings rate. It's down 7/10ths of a percent, and that means that      Americans are not only spending all their income, but they're dipping      into savings.       Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, it's Michael Eisner's last day of      work at Disney.  We're taking a look back at his stormy reign over the      Magic Kingdom.

Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas provide      much of the seafood, sugar, citrus, nuts, poultry and livestock that      Americans enjoy year-round, and the Port of New Orleans conveys wheat and      other commodities to destinations worldwide.  But crop devastation and      disruption in shipping has yet to adversely affect most Americans.  Yra      Harris is the senior partner at Praxis Trading in Chicago, and he can      tell us why.  Mr. Harris joins us from our studios in Chicago.      Welcome.      Mr. YRA HARRIS (Praxis Trading):  Thank you, Linda.      WERTHEIMER:  Why aren't Americans feeling a pinch yet?      Mr. HARRIS:  The first effects haven't really been measured out yet.  At      first, people thought the devastation would be closing the ports of New      Orleans, which would have different types of effects.  Number one would      be, of course, the import of certain goods.  We bring a lot of coffee in      through those ports.  And for the American farmer, the danger was coming      into harvest season that you would have grain piling up in the US ports.      WERTHEIMER:  But it hasn't happened yet?      Mr. HARRIS:  No, we have not really seen that effect.  There's been an      effect on cotton prices in the short term.  As the cotton comes into      harvesting, there's some speculation that there'll be some damage to the      cotton crop. Outside of that, coffee prices did rise because the big      coffee warehouses are down in New Orleans, and people didn't know about      how they'd be impacted by the flood.  But those prices have actually come      back lower than they were prior to the first hurricane hitting.      WERTHEIMER:  Are markets so big and so flexible now that temporary losses      from just about any region could be absorbed--California, for example, or      the breadbasket, the Middle West?      Mr. HARRIS:  Well, no.  I mean, if the damage was so severe you couldn't      make up for it.  There's only so much food and you can't replace it      overnight.  But we do seem to see a resiliency, being that--I can      remember the Green Revolution and its impact upon especially the      developing world.  It really has made a difference.  You see Brazil and      Argentina, who could certainly jump in and fill the void of any shortness      that would develop in the US, and that's what you would see, but we      haven't quite gotten to that point yet.      WERTHEIMER:  So do you think that globalization has put a net under us      all?      Mr. HARRIS:  Well, to some regards, yes, that's true.  But on the other      hand, the other effect is that you see rising energy prices, and that too      is a product of the success of global growth.  Everybody's been caught      off guard by the huge amount of demand that's now coming out of China and      India and other places, Brazil especially.  So that's the good and bad.      WERTHEIMER:  So is any region of the country, any sort of area of      production, indispensable now?      Mr. HARRIS:  Yeah.  I think the damage that we're going to see--and it      was already showing itself even before the hurricanes--is in the natural      gas production.  Natural gas prices are up, as of yesterday, about 125      percent year to date, which is--far exceeds petroleum, and heating oil's      up quite a bit, too.  And natural gas just cannot be replaced as easily      as oil.  You can't go and get refined products.  Natural gas is really      domestically driven. Until we see some huge increase in the LNG or      liquefied natural gas and being able to actually bring it from other      places, we're kind of caught in this trap.      WERTHEIMER:  And so we could expect heating prices to really go through      the roof this winter for people who use natural gas for heating and      cooking.      Mr. HARRIS:  Linda, I've been talking about this since actually February,      because natural gas was starting to move up then.  This is going to be      dramatic, and this is going to be the impact.  And unfortunately, it      doesn't show on a television picture; you know, you can't go out to the      pump and see them change prices every hour.  This is going to be on a      monthly basis, and it's going to be dramatic.      WERTHEIMER:  Yra Harris is the senior partner at Praxis Trading in      Chicago.

Ford's sales fleetwide were down 19      percent.  GM's were off 24 percent.  By contrast, both Toyota and Honda      posted record sales for the month.  NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports.      WENDY KAUFMAN reporting:      Toyota posted its best third-quarter sales ever and sales for year to      date are up more than 11 percent over last year.  So it's hardly      surprising that at Toyota of Puyallup, which sells more Toyotas than any      other dealer in Washington state, business is brisk.      Mr. MATT PENROSE (General Sales Manager, Toyota of Puyallup):  As a      dealer, my biggest concern every day is trying to get more inventory,      trying to get more cars for our customers.      KAUFMAN:  Matt Penrose is the general sales manager.      Mr. PENROSE:  We have plenty of customers coming through the door.  What      I'm concerned about is having the cars when they get here to buy them.      We're selling Corollas right now as fast as we can get them without any      factory incentives and without having to discount the cars because      customers recognize that it's a good value.      KAUFMAN:  While Detroit's Big Three automakers have a combined 60-day      supply of new vehicles as of September 1st.  Toyota's fleetwide supply is      now less than 20 days, and for its most sought-after cars, the supply is      even smaller, a nine-day supply of the fuel-efficient Corolla, for      example, and only a single day's supply for the Prius hybrid which goes      about 50 miles on a single gallon of gas.  Penrose says the high cost of      gasoline has definitely had an impact on what people are buying.      Mr. PENROSE:  They're buying Corollas, Camrys and Matrixes.  They're      buying them specifically because of the fuel economy.  It's a real easy      formula when you're buying a car that may cost 15, 16, $17,000 and you      finance it that the amount of gas that they save might be the amount of      your payment.      KAUFMAN:  For a typical driver, that's a bit of an overstatement, but if      gas is $3 a gallon and you drive 12,000 miles a year, you would save at      least $900 a year at the pump by driving a Toyota Camry instead of a big      SUV.  Minnesota resident Jim Ericson(ph) is putting his giant      gas-guzzling sports utility into the garage and moving to something more      economical.  After being told he would have to wait more than 12 months      to get a Prius hybrid from his local dealer, Ericson cashed in some      frequent-flier miles and flew to the Seattle area to pick up his new      Prius.      Mr. JIM ERICSON:  As we walk up to it, I just touch the door handle and      just like that it's open.  I'll just sit in the driver's seat.  To start      it up, you just push the brake and you don't have to stick a key in it at      all and touch the power button.  It is ready to go.      KAUFMAN:  Hybrid sales now total about 1 1/2 percent of all new vehicles      sold in the US.  Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, says      as gas prices have risen about a dollar a gallon over the past year, the      number of new car shoppers who say they would consider a hybrid has      climbed dramatically to nearly 15 percent.      Mr. ART SPINELLA (President, CNW Marketing Research):  We are seeing      people who are changing their consideration of vehicles, consideration of      hybrids and what premium people are willing to pay is higher.  We're      seeing people who are leaving the large sports utility segment for      crossover vehicles.      KAUFMAN:  Those are small sport utilities built on car, not truck,      platforms. They typically get much better mileage than the traditional      SUV.      Ford and GM have suffered most as buyers have moved away from those big      vehicles.  For example, Ford's SUV sales fell about 50 percent last      month. Some of that is due to the end of price incentives offered by Ford      this summer.  Now that prices are back to normal and many who wanted to      buy SUVs already have, future prospects for SUV sales in the US remain      poor.  As Art Spinella suggests, the SUV buyers who bought them because      they looked cool are now looking for new, more fuel-efficient fashion      statements.      Wendy Kaufman, NPR News.

Whether people want      to rent or buy, prices are going up, in some cases dramatically.  NPR's      John Ydstie has the story.      (Soundbite of door being unlocked)      JOHN YDSTIE reporting:      At the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Tchoupitoulas, Realtor Tom French      unlocks the door of a modest duplex for the first time in more than a      month.      Mr. TOM FRENCH (Realtor):  I got power.      YDSTIE:  Before Katrina, French listed this property for $269,000.  He's      pleased to see it's virtually undamaged.  Like much of historic New      Orleans, it's on higher ground near the river.  That makes it even more      desirable now, says French.      Mr. FRENCH:  Thousands of people that are now going to be looking for      property because of this shortage of real estate--we're not going to have      a shortage of buyers--the number of people who are now even willing to      make offers on damaged property pending their improvement is growing.      YDSTIE:  In addition to being high and dry, this property has another      advantage; it has a rental unit.  French says landlords are getting 50 to      75 percent more in monthly rents now than before the storm.      Mr. FRENCH:  There's a huge demand for rentals.  I would say 90 to 95      percent of the phone calls coming in to our office are people looking to      rent.  I feel so sorry for a lot of them because they've lost everything      and they can't find anything.  They want to come back, and there's simply      nothing for rent.      YDSTIE:  While rents are skyrocketing, French, who works for RE/MAX      Realtors, is more cautious than some in predicting huge increases in the      prices of homes that didn't flood.      Mr. FRENCH:  At this point, it's still hard to tell.  We've had people      who've rushed to up their asking price, but I'm not seeing them get it.      YDSTIE:  At least so far.  Among the things that might hold home prices      in check, says French, is that lenders will be reluctant to write      mortgages at prices above pre-Katrina levels because appraisals will be      tied to pre-storm values.  Also, lenders require that properties be      insured, and insurance companies are reluctant to write policies now.      The only way to circumvent all this would be to pay cash for a property.      (Soundbite of door)      YDSTIE:  Back in his office, Tom French sits down with Troy(ph) and Amy      David(ph) of Metairie.  Their home took on four feet of floodwater.      Ms. AMY DAVID:  All our clothes and everything is just in our cars in      bags and laundry baskets.  And this morning I'm, like, rummaging through      clothes.  And we just want to get some normal life back together.      YDSTIE:  Amy and Troy and their two young children need a place to live      for at least a year while they rebuild.  They couldn't find an affordable      rental, so they came to French desperately looking for a place to buy in      their old neighborhood.  They've already made an offer on a house, but      French tells them the seller isn't satisfied.      Mr. FRENCH:  Quite honestly, because of the situation, they're coming      from a much stronger point than we are.      Ms. DAVID:  We just want to get in there, you know, before. . .      Mr. TROY DAVID:  You know, let's. . .      Ms. DAVID:  . . . Monday and before the kids start, you know. . .      Mr. FRENCH:  I'm. . .      Ms. DAVID:  I'm just trying. . .      Mr. FRENCH:  Yeah, I'm going to call Sandy(ph) and ask her how quickly      can she get this. . .      Ms. DAVID:  OK.      Mr. FRENCH:  . . . done because they've given us till 8:00 tonight. . .      YDSTIE:  Troy and Amy want to move in immediately and rent the house for      a month before closing.  But to do that, the seller is demanding an      additional $1,500 deposit they really can't afford.  Tom French calls the      seller's agent to make a counteroffer, the seller balks, and Troy and Amy      get nervous.      Mr. FRENCH:  (On phone) OK.  Bye-bye.      OK, she's not sold on the deposit thing.  She wants to protect her      people. They're still concerned that you're strictly trying to rent it,      and they want to make sure that you truly are buyers.      Mr. DAVID:  Tell them to go look at my house.  Tell Sandy to go look at      my house.  I mean, just tell her to go drive at my house and she'll see      that I have no other choice.      Ms. DAVID:  I mean, `I'm staying there a month' ain't going to do      anything for what we need, you know?      Mr. DAVID:  Right.      Mr. FRENCH:  And I understand that.      Mr. DAVID:  You just want to write the $1,500 check and write out the      line of credit, just pay the $1,500, we're done with this, so there's no      negotiation.      YDSTIE:  In the end, Troy and Amy get the house for a few thousand      dollars more than they might have spent before Katrina.  Realtor Tom      French says while home prices may spike over the next couple of months,      he's skeptical they'll stay high, especially when rehabbed homes from the      flooded areas come back on the market.      Mr. FRENCH:  One thing I've found down here is people have a short      memory. They're going to walk into this completely rehabbed home.  It's      going to be disclosed it flooded during Katrina, and it's not going to      bother them. They're going to realize these things happen; that's what      flood insurance is all about.  If you're going to live in New Orleans,      you deal with it.      YDSTIE:  French rejects the idea that fear of hurricanes will depress      prices. He points to Florida, where, after four hurricanes last year, the      real estate market remains strong.  John Ydstie, NPR News, New Orleans.      NORRIS:  You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.       MICHELE NORRIS, host:       With more than 100,000 homes in the New Orleans area significantly      damaged, the market for habitable housing is tight.  Whether people want      to rent or buy, prices are going up, in some cases dramatically.  NPR's      John Ydstie has the story.       (Soundbite of door being unlocked)       JOHN YDSTIE reporting:       At the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Tchoupitoulas, Realtor Tom French      unlocks the door of a modest duplex for the first time in more than a      month.       Mr. TOM FRENCH (Realtor):  I got power.       YDSTIE:  Before Katrina, French listed this property for $269,000.  He's      pleased to see it's virtually undamaged.  Like much of historic New      Orleans, it's on higher ground near the river.  That makes it even more      desirable now, says French.       Mr. FRENCH:  Thousands of people that are now going to be looking for      property because of this shortage of real estate--we're not going to have      a shortage of buyers--the number of people who are now even willing to      make offers on damaged property pending their improvement is growing.       YDSTIE:  In addition to being high and dry, this property has another      advantage; it has a rental unit.  French says landlords are getting 50 to      75 percent more in monthly rents now than before the storm.       Mr. FRENCH:  There's a huge demand for rentals.  I would say 90 to 95      percent of the phone calls coming in to our office are people looking to      rent.  I feel so sorry for a lot of them because they've lost everything      and they can't find anything.  They want to come back, and there's simply      nothing for rent.       YDSTIE:  While rents are skyrocketing, French, who works for RE/MAX      Realtors, is more cautious than some in predicting huge increases in the      prices of homes that didn't flood.

The move surprised many      environmentalists who have criticized the administration for focusing far      too little on conserving energy.  Stephen Johnson is the administrator of      the Environmental Protection Agency.  Today, the EPA is kicking off a      campaign to get every American home to change one lightbulb from a      traditional bulb to a more energy efficient compact florescent.  He came      into our studio to explain.      Mr. STEPHEN JOHNSON (Administrator, EPA):  The average homeowner spends      more than $1,500 every year on energy costs.  Lighting, just lighting,      accounts for 20 percent of those costs.  And what we know is these Energy      Star bulbs use two-thirds less energy and they last six times longer.      Well, if every household changed just one light, as a country, we will      save $600 million in energy bills.      MONTAGNE:  So given that, if one only has to change a lightbulb that      presumably you wouldn't even notice you're doing, what wouldn't the      administration then and the EPA promote a bit more sacrifice?      Mr. JOHNSON:  Well, I think again there's one size doesn't fit all and      that today's focus is our Energy Star program and Changing A Light Day.      Last year, by people buying Energy Star products, we were able to save      enough energy to power 20 million homes.  And so these are significant      steps.      MONTAGNE:  There are bills in Congress to give the EPA the ability to      exempt from environmental rules following Hurricane Katrina.  Is that      necessary in your opinion, and if so, how limited will it be?      Mr. JOHNSON:  Well, we're currently evaluating what our needs are from a      legislative standpoint.  I mean, there are certain requirements that are      currently on the books for opening up wastewater treatment systems,      regulations that require that a certain amount of monitoring and a      certain amount of evaluation be done before wastewater treatment systems      are allowed to operate.  And we've got communities that are needing to      and they need to flush the system.  So, you know, are we going to wait      for, you know, months or a year for the EPA to do an evaluation?  I think      not.  We need to look at to see what are the reasonable and prudent steps      that we can take to bring these systems back up to operation?      MONTAGNE:  Critics have said that the administration or the EPA is using      Katrina to make the rules less stringent.      Mr. JOHNSON:  Well, I would beg to differ.  Again, what we are doing--and      I think that it's appropriate public policy for us to look at given the      enormity of the situation to look at:  Are there things that we need to      do for cleanup and for restoration that just don't make good common      sense?  This isn't a lessening of environmental standards across the      board.

Federal officials say it will take until next year for oil and gas      drilling here along the Gulf Coast to recover from Hurricanes Katrina and      Rita. Interior Secretary Gale Norton offered a preliminary assessment of      the storms' damage, and NPR's Scott Horsley reports this morning.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      Of some 4,000 drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 3,000      sat in the path of the hurricanes.  While more than a hundred older      platforms were damaged or destroyed, most of the newer facilities      weathered the storms intact.  Even so, Interior Secretary Gale Norton      says it will take another 10 days to get people back on all the manned      platforms, weeks to make even minor repairs, and months to undo the worst      of the hurricanes' damage.      Secretary GALE NORTON (Interior Department):  We have no official      estimates of the dollar value of the damage and the amount that it will      cost to repair those facilities, but it will clearly be in the billions      of dollars.      HORSLEY:  The number two oil company, BP, said yesterday the storms      trimmed an estimated $700 million from its third-quarter profits.      Chevron says Katrina alone reduced its profits by some $350 million.  As      of yesterday, 90 percent of the Gulf's oil production remained shut down,      along with more than 70 percent of its natural gas.  Norton says even      though most of that production will eventually come back, the storm      damage points up the need to find sources of oil and gas in regions other      than the hurricane-prone Gulf.      Sec. NORTON:  We have put so many of our eggs in one basket, and with a      strong push from Katrina and Rita we have now dropped the basket.  While      we work to restore Gulf production to pre-Katrina levels, we must not      lose sight of the fact that diversification of our nation's energy supply      is a key goal for this administration.  It must remain a top priority for      our nation's economic and national security.

I'm Ed Gordon.      Hurricane Katrina shone a bright light on America's poverty crisis.  The      ranks of the poor swelled to 37 million Americans last month.  That      number includes those who work for the federal minimum wage, currently      $5. 15.  In many corners, people are suggesting the minimum wage be raised      to help workers thrive, not just survive.  But would raising the minimum      wage really help America's poor?  And would the added burden on      businesses have an adverse effect on the economy?  Joining us to answer      those questions and more are William Spriggs, senior fellow at the      Economic Policy Institute in Washington, DC, and Barbara Ehrenreich,      journalist and author of the best-seller \"Nickel and Dimed. \"  Her new      book is called \"Bait and Switch. \"  She joins us from the City of      Brotherly Love, Philadelphia.      I thank you both for joining us.      Mr. Spriggs, let me start with you.  Between 1989 and 1997, we saw the      minimum wage go up four times.  In the last nine years, it has not moved.      Why is that the case?      Mr. WILLIAM SPRIGGS (Economic Policy Institute):  Well, it takes      legislative action from Congress and signature of the president to raise      the minimum wage. It's set within law, and so unless we raise it through      legislation, it doesn't change.  Each president except Ronald Reagan has,      during their term, signed legislation to raise the minimum wage.  And so      far this President Bush has made no motion to raise the minimum wage.  So      we're about to repeat the Reagan legacy of a prolonged period in which      the purchasing power of the minimum wage goes down and people making the      minimum wage get dragged way below what would be a poverty wage.      You have to make above $9 an hour in order to keep a family of four at      the official poverty line.  You have to make around $8 an hour to keep a      family of three above the poverty line.  And you have to be at a little      above $6 to keep a family of two above the poverty line.  So anyone      making the minimum wage could not keep any family.      GORDON:  And, Barbara Ehrenreich, we should note in your book \"Bait and      Switch,\" you took a year and went out to try to see if, in fact, you      could live along those lines.  We should note you didn't always work for      the minimum wage, sometimes above, but you saw the real struggle that      people have to live through.      Ms. BARBARA EHRENREICH (\"Bait and Switch\"):  Yes, and I was earning an      average of $7 an hour.  This was in my book \"Nickel and Dimed. \"  And I      can tell you, $7 an hour isn't enough for one person, at least any way I      could figure out to live, mostly because of extraordinary rents, even for      trailer parks, even for dingy residential motel rooms.  $7 an hour,      that's about 1,200 a month.  If you have to pay 600 or 700 on rent, you      can see you don't have a lot to play around with.  If there are      child-care expenses, too, well, you're in the red before you've even      bought groceries.  So this is not a matter of ideology. This is a matter      of arithmetic.      GORDON:  And, Barbara, we should note in the new book, \"Bait and Switch,\"      you upped it, if you will, and you're looking at the life of the      middle-class, unemployed, white-collar workers who are finding it harder      year by year to stay employed, gainfully employed.  And you're saying      once again, `Let's not be fooled by labels.  It is just difficult out      there, period. '      Ms. EHRENREICH:  Yes, and I think what I found in \"Bait and Switch\" about      the white-collar unemployed certainly says to me that people who imagine      themselves securely middle class and imagine the poor to be somebody      else, you know, those people should bear in mind that they may be one      year, even just six months, away from that very-low-wage job themselves.      GORDON:  William Spriggs, much has been talked about since Hurricane      Katrina in terms of America's poor, as if all of a sudden we've found      them.  They've always been there.  I'm curious; as you've studied this      issue throughout, when you look at the minimum wage, can you see      historically a real bump in the quality of life as it relates to raising      the minimum wage?      Mr. SPRIGGS:  Well, there's a direct correlation for a large chunk of the      poor.  About 15 percent of the poor work full time, full year.  So      clearly when you see the minimum wage go up, you see the share of      full-time, full-year, poor workers go down.  There's a direct correlation      for those workers.  Oddly, when the minimum wage goes up, more people are      pulled into the labor market because work pays.  So oddly, in 1999, when      the labor market was very tight and wages for low-wage workers was up, 40      percent of the poor actually worked.  This includes those who were the      full-time workers.  So there is a logic to getting people into the labor      market by raising the wage, but it definitely helps those who are able to      work by raising the wage.      The key is that, as in Barbara's case, where she wasn't paid exactly the      minimum wage, there are a whole set of workers whose wages are tied to      the minimum wage.  So employers are trying to bid above the minimum wage      for these workers and the problem becomes the relationship between the      average wage in the economy, which is now about $15 an hour, and the      minimum wage.  When that gets very big, the turnover in minimum-wage      companies goes up because people are hoping to get a regular job and      there's really no path from someone making $5 or $6 an hour to get them      up to $15 an hour.  They really have to be. . .      GORDON:  And I guess, William Spriggs, that was my next question; and      follow up, if you will, the idea that once you find yourself in this      group, it is very difficult--and we see disproportionately      African-Americans and Latinos within this group of the working poor to a      great degree.  It is very difficult to springboard yourself above this      number.      Mr. SPRIGGS:  That's correct, because the firm that you've hired into,      the whole wage structure is based on this very low wage.  So, you know,      even if they gave you a 50 percent wage increase, which would be a very      big wage increase, they still can't get you up to what would be the      average wage in the economy.  So you're really locked in, and that's why      the turnover at these companies is very high because people are trying to      switch out of those companies and out of those industries into jobs that      pay better, but people are trapped in that zone.  When we raise the      minimum wage, we lower the turnover rate and we lower the gap between      people who have the exact same skills as workers who are in jobs that      would pay the average wage.  They have the same skills and the same      background, but they do suffer a penalty from working in these companies.      GORDON:  Barbara, talk to me, if you will, about the stories that you      found when you talked to the people who really lived this life.  They are      really ofttimes living a horrific tale from year to year.      Ms. EHRENREICH:  Well, it's from week to week, because when you're at a      very low wage, the minimum or just above, anything can become a      catastrophe.  You don't need a hurricane to wreck your life.  A broken      car, a car that's not working; it can be a sick child, you know, who you      have to stay home with, 'cause the day-care center or baby sitter won't      take a sick child.  You stay home, you could lose your job.  So anything      can knock you off the track.      GORDON:  And, Barbara, what do you think Washington is missing in all of      this? It seems to me, again, that the bureaucrats in Washington will talk      about--even those who tout raising the minimum wage to $7, some have seen      as the key, offtimes don't really know the hardship that many of these      people live day to day.      Ms. EHRENREICH:  No.  I mean, our senators and congresspeople are very      disproportionately white male, wealthy cut of society.  They have in      those cases no notion of what it would be like to try to take care of a      family or even, you know, be one wage earner in the family where the      wages are under $10 an hour.  I wish we could have this as a kind of      entrance exam.  You want to be a senator?  Please spend one month, three      months out there trying to do this, and then we'll talk to you.      GORDON:  William Spriggs, you've been around Washington for some time.      When you talk about issues like this, is it to a great degree falling on      deaf ears on Capitol Hill?  Are they understanding what these people are      grappling with?      Mr. SPRIGGS:  No, they aren't, and part of the problem is that you get      people talking out of both sides of their mouths.  They think that it's      inefficient to interfere in the labor market by setting wages, but we      should solve this problem, they think, through safety nets, like      providing Medicaid, providing housing assistance, but then at the same      time, those same people will vote against the budget for Section 8      housing or for Medicaid assistance.  And so it really is a difficult      situation.  It has become, unfortunately, a partisan battle.  Through      1980, both Republicans and Democrats voted in the majority to raise the      minimum wage and now it has become partisan.  So it really is a Democrat      issue.  And currently with the Republican-controlled Congress, that means      the majority of members of Congress would vote against it.      GORDON:  And, Barbara, what do you think happens to these folks if we      don't see any raise in the federal minimum wage?      Ms. EHRENREICH:  I just want to underscore what something Bill said      first, is that this is, in fact, a situation where things are only      getting worse. Before Katrina, Congress was due to return to Washington      and make deep cuts in things like Medicaid and other programs which are      already inadequate for the poor and working poor.  So there's an attack      on two fronts.  The safety net is being destroyed while wages are      stagnant or actually decreasing in real value. What will this lead to?      Well, right now it's hard to know how people keep--you know, survive at      all.  When I was working on \"Nickel and Dimed\". . .      GORDON:  Yeah.      Ms. EHRENREICH:  . . . I worked alongside full-time workers who lived in      their cars.  I worked alongside full-time workers who did not get enough      to eat and were actually dizzy by the end of the shift.  You know, this      is a state of biological threat. . .      GORDON:  Yeah.      Ms. EHRENREICH:  . . . to people, and I think this is a kind of condition      which eventually, historically, has led to huge social instability.      GORDON:  Yeah.  And I think it's important--and I'll echo what you      suggested earlier--that many, many people who are perhaps riding in their      cars now and feel very comfortable are only a paycheck or two away from      feeling the real pinch.      William Spriggs is a senior fellow at the Economic Policy Institute and      Barbara Ehrenreich is a journalist and author of \"Nickel and Dimed,\" and      her new book is called \"Bait and Switch. \"      I thank you both for joining us today.  Appreciate it.      Mr. SPRIGGS:  Thank you.      Ms. EHRENREICH:  Yeah, my pleasure.      GORDON:  This is NPR News.       ED GORDON, host:       From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.  I'm Ed Gordon.       Hurricane Katrina shone a bright light on America's poverty crisis.  The      ranks of the poor swelled to 37 million Americans last month.  That      number includes those who work for the federal minimum wage, currently      $5. 15.  In many corners, people are suggesting the minimum wage be raised      to help workers thrive, not just survive.  But would raising the minimum      wage really help America's poor?  And would the added burden on      businesses have an adverse effect on the economy?  Joining us to answer      those questions and more are William Spriggs, senior fellow at the      Economic Policy Institute in Washington, DC, and Barbara Ehrenreich,      journalist and author of the best-seller \"Nickel and Dimed. \"  Her new      book is called \"Bait and Switch. \"  She joins us from the City of      Brotherly Love, Philadelphia.       I thank you both for joining us.       Mr. Spriggs, let me start with you.  Between 1989 and 1997, we saw the      minimum wage go up four times.  In the last nine years, it has not moved.      Why is that the case?       Mr. WILLIAM SPRIGGS (Economic Policy Institute):  Well, it takes      legislative action from Congress and signature of the president to raise      the minimum wage. It's set within law, and so unless we raise it through      legislation, it doesn't change.  Each president except Ronald Reagan has,      during their term, signed legislation to raise the minimum wage.  And so      far this President Bush has made no motion to raise the minimum wage.  So      we're about to repeat the Reagan legacy of a prolonged period in which      the purchasing power of the minimum wage goes down and people making the      minimum wage get dragged way below what would be a poverty wage.       You have to make above $9 an hour in order to keep a family of four at      the official poverty line.  You have to make around $8 an hour to keep a      family of three above the poverty line.  And you have to be at a little      above $6 to keep a family of two above the poverty line.  So anyone      making the minimum wage could not keep any family.       GORDON:  And, Barbara Ehrenreich, we should note in your book \"Bait and      Switch,\" you took a year and went out to try to see if, in fact, you      could live along those lines.  We should note you didn't always work for      the minimum wage, sometimes above, but you saw the real struggle that      people have to live through.       Ms. BARBARA EHRENREICH (\"Bait and Switch\"):  Yes, and I was earning an      average of $7 an hour.  This was in my book \"Nickel and Dimed. \"  And I      can tell you, $7 an hour isn't enough for one person, at least any way I      could figure out to live, mostly because of extraordinary rents, even for      trailer parks, even for dingy residential motel rooms.  $7 an hour,      that's about 1,200 a month.  If you have to pay 600 or 700 on rent, you      can see you don't have a lot to play around with.  If there are      child-care expenses, too, well, you're in the red before you've even      bought groceries.  So this is not a matter of ideology. This is a matter      of arithmetic.       GORDON:  And, Barbara, we should note in the new book, \"Bait and Switch,\"      you upped it, if you will, and you're looking at the life of the      middle-class, unemployed, white-collar workers who are finding it harder      year by year to stay employed, gainfully employed.

'       Ms. EHRENREICH:  Yes, and I think what I found in \"Bait and Switch\" about      the white-collar unemployed certainly says to me that people who imagine      themselves securely middle class and imagine the poor to be somebody      else, you know, those people should bear in mind that they may be one      year, even just six months, away from that very-low-wage job themselves.

The bankruptcy laws will change when the      Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 goes into      effect on October 17th.  With the new law comes tighter requirements,      which include credit counseling and means testing.  Yesterday, the US      Trustee Program at the Department of Justice announced measures designed      to ease some of the requirements for victims of the Gulf Coast      hurricanes.  Here now to help us understand these changes is Sam Gerdano.      He is the executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute, and      he joins us by phone from his office in Alexandria, Virginia.      Welcome to the program.      Mr. SAM GERDANO (Executive Director, American Bankruptcy Institute):      Thank you.  Good to be with you.      NEARY:  And I just want to tell our listeners that if you have questions      about the new law, especially if you are an evacuee of Hurricane Katrina,      give us a call.  The number here is (800) 989-TALK.  That's (800)      989-8255.  Of course, you can e-mail us at totn@npr. org.      And you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.      So, Sam Gerdano, for those of our listeners who aren't sure what the new      bankruptcy law is all about, just give us a little sense of the changes      that are going to go into effect on October 17th.      Mr. GERDANO:  Well, sure.  The new law is just about 10 days away now.      It has been in the works for several years in Congress.  And it      represents a fundamental change in approach in particularly consumer      bankruptcy, although there are some significant business bankruptcy      changes as well.  The law imposes some new requirements at the front end      in terms of counseling as a precondition to being eligible to even seek      relief under the Bankruptcy Code. And then, for those who have the      ability to repay some of their debts to creditors over a period of time,      the law provides a mechanism to more easily shift them into repayment      plans where, over a period of roughly 60 months, they will repay a      portion of their debts to their creditors.      The bill does much more than that, but by and large it represents a      statement by Congress that bankruptcy laws were previously too easy, too      readily available, too forgiving in terms of the scope of relief      provided.      NEARY:  And in terms of those who are affected by hurricanes Katrina and      Rita, what are the motions that were made yesterday and how are they      tailored to help those people?      Mr. GERDANO:  Well, what was done yesterday was fairly significant.  The      Justice Department, within their discretion to enforce some of the key      provisions of the law, has announced that they will relax certain of the      enforcement guidelines for victims of the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast      region. They've relaxed things like document requirements.  The law      provides, for example, that filers would have to provide copies of tax      returns and pay stubs to verify their income and expenses, and the      Justice Department has said that they will relax certain of those      requirements if the person's otherwise eligible to file for bankruptcy.      They also announced that they would consider income loss and expense      increases that are directly related as effects of natural disaster when      calculating the means test under the bill, which determines whether or      not an individual is eligible to file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13      of the Bankruptcy Code.      And they also allowed more discretion and flexibility in terms of where      the case could actually be filed.  After all, many of the Katrina-related      victims are not located in Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama anymore.      They're in different parts of the country.  To the extent that they are      relocated and still want to file for bankruptcy in a local court where      they are now, the Justice Department has announced that they will not      raise or support an objection to what's called the venue, where the      matter was filed in those cases.  So they're going to allow people to get      into the system and then perhaps transfer the venue at a later time      that's more convenient to the rest of the parties.  That's one of a      number of things they have done.      And then the previous day, they had announced a relaxation of the credit      counseling requirement.      NEARY:  Yeah, let me ask you about that.  I mean, credit counseling is      really an important part of people who are filing for bankruptcy, and      this would allow people affected by the hurricanes to do--not to have to      go through that. Why is that?      Mr. GERDANO:  Well, that is an acknowledgment by the Justice Department      that, at least on a temporary basis, some of those providers of those      services are simply going to be unavailable in the affected regions.      Counseling can be done, under the provisions of the law, by Internet and      by phone, but there also is contemplated the ability to get counseling      face-to-face, in person, in terms of being an effective way to provide      options to individuals who are facing financial problems.      NEARY:  What about--there were some proposals to offer a year's grace to      victims of the hurricanes and that didn't happen.  Why not?      Mr. GERDANO:  Well, that's because the Justice Department doesn't have      the authority to unilaterally change the effective date of the provision.      That would require a statutory change which, of course, can only come      from Congress.  And there are bills pending in both and the House and      Senate that would do just that, that would delay the October 17th date      until some date in the future, six months, one year, even more than that.      NEARY:  So that may still happen?  That still is a possib. . .      Mr. GERDANO:  It's possible, but I wouldn't count on it.  I would--for      all parties involved in the system, whether they represent debtors or      creditors or whether they're a potential debtor themselves, I think that      everybody needs to count on October 17th as the starting date.      NEARY:  All right.  Thanks so much for joining us today, Mr. Gerdano.      Mr. GERDANO:  My pleasure.      NEARY:  Sam Gerdano is the executive director of the American Bankruptcy      Institute.  He joined us by phone from his offices in northern Virginia.      This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  I'm Lynn Neary in Washington.       LYNN NEARY, host:       As victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita piece together their finances,      many of them may choose bankruptcy as an option to try and clear the      decks and begin anew.  The bankruptcy laws will change when the      Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 goes into      effect on October 17th.  With the new law comes tighter requirements,      which include credit counseling and means testing.  Yesterday, the US      Trustee Program at the Department of Justice announced measures designed      to ease some of the requirements for victims of the Gulf Coast      hurricanes.  Here now to help us understand these changes is Sam Gerdano.      He is the executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute, and      he joins us by phone from his office in Alexandria, Virginia.       Welcome to the program.       Mr. SAM GERDANO (Executive Director, American Bankruptcy Institute):      Thank you.  Good to be with you.       NEARY:  And I just want to tell our listeners that if you have questions      about the new law, especially if you are an evacuee of Hurricane Katrina,      give us a call.  The number here is (800) 989-TALK.  That's (800)      989-8255.  Of course, you can e-mail us at totn@npr. org.       And you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.       So, Sam Gerdano, for those of our listeners who aren't sure what the new      bankruptcy law is all about, just give us a little sense of the changes      that are going to go into effect on October 17th.       Mr. GERDANO:  Well, sure.  The new law is just about 10 days away now.      It has been in the works for several years in Congress.  And it      represents a fundamental change in approach in particularly consumer      bankruptcy, although there are some significant business bankruptcy      changes as well.  The law imposes some new requirements at the front end      in terms of counseling as a precondition to being eligible to even seek      relief under the Bankruptcy Code. And then, for those who have the      ability to repay some of their debts to creditors over a period of time,      the law provides a mechanism to more easily shift them into repayment      plans where, over a period of roughly 60 months, they will repay a      portion of their debts to their creditors.       The bill does much more than that, but by and large it represents a      statement by Congress that bankruptcy laws were previously too easy, too      readily available, too forgiving in terms of the scope of relief      provided.       NEARY:  And in terms of those who are affected by hurricanes Katrina and      Rita, what are the motions that were made yesterday and how are they      tailored to help those people?       Mr. GERDANO:  Well, what was done yesterday was fairly significant.  The      Justice Department, within their discretion to enforce some of the key      provisions of the law, has announced that they will relax certain of the      enforcement guidelines for victims of the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast      region. They've relaxed things like document requirements.  The law      provides, for example, that filers would have to provide copies of tax      returns and pay stubs to verify their income and expenses, and the      Justice Department has said that they will relax certain of those      requirements if the person's otherwise eligible to file for bankruptcy.      They also announced that they would consider income loss and expense      increases that are directly related as effects of natural disaster when      calculating the means test under the bill, which determines whether or      not an individual is eligible to file for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13      of the Bankruptcy Code.       And they also allowed more discretion and flexibility in terms of where      the case could actually be filed.  After all, many of the Katrina-related      victims are not located in Louisiana or Mississippi or Alabama anymore.      They're in different parts of the country.  To the extent that they are      relocated and still want to file for bankruptcy in a local court where      they are now, the Justice Department has announced that they will not      raise or support an objection to what's called the venue, where the      matter was filed in those cases.  So they're going to allow people to get      into the system and then perhaps transfer the venue at a later time      that's more convenient to the rest of the parties.  That's one of a      number of things they have done.       And then the previous day, they had announced a relaxation of the credit      counseling requirement.       NEARY:  Yeah, let me ask you about that.  I mean, credit counseling is      really an important part of people who are filing for bankruptcy, and      this would allow people affected by the hurricanes to do--not to have to      go through that. Why is that?       Mr. GERDANO:  Well, that is an acknowledgment by the Justice Department      that, at least on a temporary basis, some of those providers of those      services are simply going to be unavailable in the affected regions.      Counseling can be done, under the provisions of the law, by Internet and      by phone, but there also is contemplated the ability to get counseling      face-to-face, in person, in terms of being an effective way to provide      options to individuals who are facing financial problems.       NEARY:  What about--there were some proposals to offer a year's grace to      victims of the hurricanes and that didn't happen.  Why not?

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Coming up, in a struggle with a powerful political leader, a reporter      learns his real fight is with show business.      First, as diesel prices continue to rise, rural sheriffs across the      country say fuel thefts from farms is a growing problem.  Central      California is the only region in the nation that has a comprehensive      program to track these kinds of crimes.  Still, Sasha Khokha of member      station KQED reports that farmers there have lost more than $100,000 to      diesel thieves just this year.      SASHA KHOKHA reporting:      Chris Lang is used to cattle rustlers.  He's had plenty of cows stolen      from his ranch near the San Joaquin Valley town of Woodlake.  But lately      he's had to worry about thieves sucking his fuel tanks dry.  He's put      padlocks on the diesel tank he uses to fill up tractors and backhoes and      on the unleaded pump he uses to fill his pickups.  These two tanks are      just off a dirt driveway; they're like his own personal gas station in      the middle of the orange groves. Lang fiddles with a padlock and slides      open the metal door to a shed that houses the switch to turn on the fuel      pump.      Mr. CHRIS LANG (Orange Farmer):  We change the combination on this lock      every two months because we're so afraid that somebody might learn the      combination and then they would have access to the switch to turn on the      fuel.      (Soundbite of Lang turning on machinery)      KHOKHA:  The air-warming machines that Lang uses to heat his orange      groves in the winter are also an easy target.  Lang has lost hundreds of      gallons of fuel from one of these machines nestled deep in his groves.      Thieves have come back to drain the tank again and again.  And if thieves      swipe this diesel from these machines just before a frost, farmers like      Lang could lose their entire orange crop in just one day.  But Lang and      other California farmers have a unique program aimed at protecting them.      The Action Project is the nation's only high-tech, multiagency task force      designed to fight these types of rural crimes.  Its detectives sometimes      plant surveillance cameras, GPS units or motion sensors to track fuel      thieves.      (Soundbite of police radio)      Unidentified Man #1:  . . . short, but that 911 hang-up. . .      KHOKHA:  Detective Brian Davis is patrolling in an unmarked pickup.  He's      one of the investigators.  He used to be on the violent crimes unit      tracking down murderers, but he says protecting farmers is more      rewarding.      Detective BRIAN DAVIS (Action Project):  They get victimized.  I mean,      you know, it's whether they can put food on the table for their family,      pay their mortgages.      (Soundbite of bird)      Unidentified Man #2:  And took the pump out of. . .      KHOKHA:  Davis arrives at an orchard off a dirt road in Tulare County.      It's right next to a farmhouse with a sleepy German shepherd chained up      under a tree, supposedly standing guard.  But thieves still managed to      siphon off 300 gallons of diesel sometime in the night.  They even stole      part of the tank itself.      Det. DAVIS:  They took the actual pump off the tank when they took the      fuel.      Detective MIKE RUBALCABA (Tulare County Sheriff's Department):  I'll just      snap a picture here.      (Soundbite of digital camera)      KHOKHA:  Detective Mike Rubalcaba is here, too.  He's from the Tulare      County Sheriff's Department and is taking pictures and measuring tire      tracks next to the tank.      Det. RUBALCABA:  Tire tracks are kind of similar to your fingerprints and      stuff.  I mean, you're lifting actually the print of the tire.  You put      fingerprint powder on there.      KHOKHA:  Still, with all the high-tech surveillance gear and even      multiple law enforcement agencies on the job, rural gas thieves are hard      to catch. Sergeant Mike Watson works with Detective Rubalcaba on these      cases.      Sergeant MIKE WATSON (Tulare County Sheriff's Department):  And a VCR has      a serial number.  A gun has a serial number.  Fuel--if you come into      contact with a guy pulling a tank with fuel, it's hard to identify where      it came from. How do we know if he bought it at Chevron or if he stole it      from a farm?      KHOKHA:  Only about 25 fuel thieves have been arrested this year in the      San Joaquin Valley.  That's just a fraction of the cases the Action      Project has investigated.  But the DA's office here has successfully      prosecuted every thief.  And these crime fighters just got some welcome      news.  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill this week to extend      the life of the region's Rural Crime Prevention Program.  That program      was set to expire this year. For NPR News, I'm Sasha Khokha.      CHADWICK:  I'm Alex Chadwick.  More DAY TO DAY in just a moment.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      The Labor Department released the new unemployment figures today.      Nationwide, companies lost 35,000 jobs from their payrolls and the      unemployment rate in September rose to 5. 1 percent.  \"Marketplace's\" Tess      Vigeland is here from Los Angeles.      Tess, we talked about job losses yesterday, specifically numbers of      people filing for unemployment benefits because of the hurricanes.  What      do today's numbers actually mean?      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Well, this is the bigger picture.  What we have today is a measure of how      many jobs were added to the economy overall and how many were lost--not      just hurricane-related, but across the board.  Economists were expecting      to see a loss of about 140,000 jobs for the last month because of Katrina      and Rita. It's actually about a quarter of that.  Now it is the first      time in about two and a half years that we've seen net job losses instead      of gains, so it's not good news, but it's also not as bad as it could      have been, according to Joel Naroff, who is the chief economist for      Commerce Bank.      Mr. JOEL NAROFF (Chief Economist, Commerce Bank):  The losses were not      quite as large as expected.  This is just the first go-around, looking at      these numbers.  There are a lot of people who may have been on the      employment rolls but will be losing or have already lost their jobs.  So      the September numbers probably understate to some extent the full impact      of Katrina and, to a much lesser extent, Rita.      VIGELAND:  And he says we really won't know the full impact of the      hurricanes until we get to October and November numbers.      CHADWICK:  So if hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs      because of Katrina but the overall employment picture isn't that bad, I      guess the rest of the economy must be doing well.      VIGELAND:  That's exactly right.  You had all those job losses because of      the hurricanes, but Naroff points out there was enough job creation      elsewhere in the economy that it took some of the sting out of Katrina.      Mr. NAROFF:  The fact that there was momentum building tells us that we      will be able to weather the storm of the hurricanes as far as the economy      is concerned.      VIGELAND:  And again, it may be a different story by the time we get the      next month's figures, but analysts think that the underlying economy      might be able to offset the losses on the Gulf Coast.      CHADWICK:  And what sectors fared the worst in September in terms of job      losses?      VIGELAND:  Retail was a big loser, especially at clothing and sporting      goods stores.  The hospitality industry took a hit--hotels and the      like--and that's probably attributable at least in part to the      hurricanes.  Same with restaurants and others in the food service      industry.  Manufacturing also continuing to shed jobs, 27,000 of them      last month.      And, Alex, later today on \"Marketplace\" we're looking at the growing      relationship between churches and corporate sponsors.      CHADWICK:  Thank you, Tess.

Despite the hundreds of thousands of people thrown out of work by the      hurricanes, employers reopening their doors here are scrambling to find      workers.  All up and down Veterans Boulevard in Jefferson Parish, there      are `help wanted' signs.  There's a big blue-and-white banner in front of      the Best Buy store that says `Now hiring. '      Unidentified Man #1:  All right.  Let's get this rung up.  I got it by      the back door tagged.  I'll get it all the way out to the back for you      and it'll be ready for you to pick up.      Unidentified Man #2:  So just drive around out back?      Unidentified Man #1:  Just drive around and you'll be home in a half-hour      with a new refrigerator.      Unidentified Man #2:  All right.      YDSTIE:  This store is buzzing with people replacing flooded appliances      and computers.  Operations manager Tony Hines(ph) says about a third of      the workers from this store can't make it back because their homes were      destroyed.      Mr. TONY HINES (Store Operations Manager, Best Buy):  We've had a      considerable response to our banners that were hanging outside.  We're      getting quite a few applicants per day.  We're roughly hiring 10 to 15      people per day.      YDSTIE:  Hines says he's not sensing a labor shortage; there are plenty      of good applicants.  He says he's not raising wages to attract anyone.      But over at a kiosk, 20-year-old Quincy Jones(ph) is applying for a job.      The restaurant he used to work at is flooded.  He's expecting more than      the $8 minimum starting wage offered here.      Mr. QUINCY JONES:  At least.  'Cause in the restaurant, we was getting,      you know, nice money.  And we're looking for something around at least--I      mean, 10 and up, you know, 'cause we got bills.      YDSTIE:  Evidence at other firms suggest that workers like Quincy may      have the upper hand, at least in the service sector.  Over in the Uptown      section of New Orleans, at the corner of Washington and Magazine, people      are waiting for lunch at a trendy new restaurant called Table One.      Manager David Roach says he can't find enough help.      Mr. DAVID ROACH (Manager, Table One):  I don't think there's one place in      this city that has ample employees at this moment.      YDSTIE:  Are you seeing upward pressure on wages as a result?      Mr. ROACH:  Not yet.  A lot of my employees are just happy to be back and      working.  That's not an issue right now.  But I'm sure I can see in the      next coming months that--they have the bargaining power at this moment.      And it will; that's the law of supply and demands, you know.  It's going      to happen eventually.      YDSTIE:  In fact, it's happening already here.  Burger King is offering      signing bonuses of $6,000 for full-time workers.  Downtown at the      Sheraton Hotel on Canal Street, spokesman Bruce Hicks says the hotel is      housing returning workers whose homes have been destroyed and paying them      more.      Mr. BRUCE HICKS (Spokesman, Sheraton Hotel):  Every employee was paid      through September regardless.  Those who came back to work were paid      extra and are on a premium pay rate.  And that premium pay rate is going      to be in place for sometime probably, and the new market rate in New      Orleans will be changed.      YDSTIE:  While many local workers are not able to return yet, this city      is attracting lots of others anxious for work.  On Elk Street next to the      Tulane Medical School, four young Brazilians in white biohazard suits are      sprawled on the sidewalk taking a break.  They've been brought here by      the disaster cleanup firm Belfor.  One of them, named Siskai(ph), says      they're getting $8 an hour plus room and board.      SISKAI (Worker):  For instance, working one day here, I pay my child      support in Brazil.  That's why I'm here.      YDSTIE:  Are you staying for a month, a week, how long?      SISKAI:  Well, months.  They told us months.      YDSTIE:  The influx of workers from outside is creating some resentment      here. Mayor Ray Nagin told a business conference yesterday that New      Orleans didn't want to be overrun by Mexican workers.  Nagin also      expressed support for an upward pressure on wages.      Mayor RAY NAGIN (Democrat, New Orleans):  The days of haves and have-nots      is over.  And as you hire. . .      (Soundbite of applause)      Mayor NAGIN:  As you hire people, if you're hiring anybody below 8,      $10-an-hour wage, you're not going to play the game very long.  You're      not going to find workers.      YDSTIE:  Whether wage increases will stick depends on a lot of things;      how many local workers make their way home, how many business decide to      rebuild and reopen.  Mayor Nagin says he wants to create a new, more      diversified economy here, one that can support higher incomes at all      levels of society. John Ydstie, NPR News, New Orleans.

The US economy      lost jobs for the first time in more than two years, according to a      government report out this morning, but the loss amounted to only 35,000      jobs, far less than economists had predicted.  In fact, some analysts are      saying the relatively low number is good news, considering the toll      Hurricane Katrina took on the Gulf Coast.  NPR's Frank Langfitt is here      in our studio.      And, Frank, it's sort of a--What? --good news/bad news story?      FRANK LANGFITT reporting:      Yeah, pretty much.  You know, analysts had expected to lose maybe 150,000      jobs this month, and so I think they were quite surprised to see a      relatively low number like 35,000.  And what analysts are saying right      now is this is a sign of a really strong labor market nationally and that      the nation was able to absorb a lot of these losses.  You know, over the      last year, each month we've seen an average about 200,000 jobs created,      and that really seems to have helped with what's happened with Katrina.      MONTAGNE:  Well, you know, given the hundreds of thousands displaced from      their homes and businesses, how did the government measure employment      last month?      LANGFITT:  Well, the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures jobs every      month, and this was an unprecedented challenge for them because there      were so many people displaced.  So they set up a special sort of system.      One of the things they did is they took a look--when they would get in      touch with businesses, if there was no response, they would just zero      them out and just assume that there were no jobs there.  But then they      went to check on the Web as well to see which businesses were still      paying their workers, and that's one reason why we may not have seen such      a big job loss as well in this case.      Analysts also say you need to take this report with a grain of salt.  It      was a difficult report to do.  It also was taken in the middle of the      month, so it may have missed some other numbers as well.  And also the      government didn't break out job losses from Katrina, so we're still      really not quite sure of its impact.      MONTAGNE:  Well, is that the possible bad news in the report, or does the      report actually have some bad news?      LANGFITT:  It does have some bad news.  You know, a lot of people clearly      lost jobs, as everyone knows.  Tens, hundreds of thousands of people left      the region, and some of them are still in shelters in Louisiana and      Texas.  And so what we did see is the unemployment rate did go up from      4. 9 to 5. 1 percent, and so we're definitely seeing some job losses.  And      what that may mean as well to some people, because the national economy's      doing pretty well, more and more people may be looking for jobs because      the labor market has been doing better in that nationwide.      MONTAGNE:  NPR's Frank Langfitt, thanks very much for joining us.      LANGFITT:  Happy to do it.       RENEE MONTAGNE, host:       Coming up in today's business segment, a drop in jobs.

I'm Robert Siegel.      For the first time in more than two years, the US economy has lost jobs.      Several hundred thousand jobs along the Gulf Coast disappeared last      month, and that has had a big impact on the overall employment picture.      The Labor Department reports today that around the country, the number of      jobs on business payrolls dropped by 35,000, but that was much lower than      what most economists had feared.  We'll hear about the situation in New      Orleans in a few minutes from reporter John Ydstie.  First, here's NPR's      Frank Langfitt with the big picture.      FRANK LANGFITT reporting:      Economists expected that Katrina would cut the nation's labor force by      about 150,000 jobs in September, but so far growth around the rest of the      country appears to have offset most of the losses along the Gulf Coast.      Stuart Hoffman is chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.      Mr. STUART HOFFMAN (Chief Economist, PNC Financial):  And what it      says--and these are very preliminary data--is that certainly, the Gulf      area was devastated and many, many people lost jobs.  But the good news      appears to be in the other 47 states across the country, the job market      continues to be fairly strong.      LANGFITT:  This month's report provides the broadest gauge yet of the      hurricane's impact on employment.  Sectors big along the Gulf Coast, like      tourism and entertainment, were among the hardest hit; 80,000 jobs were      lost in the leisure and hospitality industry alone.  But employment      losses could have been worse.  Some companies are taking a long view.      John Silvia is chief economist at Wachovia Bank.      Mr. JOHN SILVIA (Chief Economist, Wachovia Bank):  Many, many large US      companies having facilities in that Gulf area simply said, `This is only      a temporary glitch.  We're certainly not going to let good workers go;      we're going to keep them employed, keep them paid. '      LANGFITT:  The Labor Department says that prior to Katrina, job growth      was even stronger than thought.  Revised numbers show the nation produced      nearly half a million jobs in July and August.      So far Katrina appears to have knocked more than 300,000 people out of      work, government figures show.  Some of those jobs will never come back.      Robert Muldowner(ph) owns a camera store in New Orleans that employed six      people; flooding destroyed most of his equipment.  Muldowner says if he      reopens, he'll probably be on his own.      Mr. ROBERT MULDOWNER (New Orleans Business Owner):  I would have to      reinvent it.  I don't necessarily think that I would be a retail camera      store anymore. I mean, I'll be a one-person place.  It won't be any jobs,      so there's, you know, five jobs that will not get replaced.      LANGFITT:  Katrina scattered people across the country, presenting huge      problems for those trying to count lost jobs.  So last month, the Bureau      of Labor Statistics, or BLS, used new techniques.  If a business did not      respond to its survey, officials went online to see whether it was still      paying employees.  Chris Carbone is an economist at the bureau.      Mr. CHRIS CARBONE (Bureau of Labor Statistics):  This is a first for BLS.      The actual impact and the scale of this disaster is so much greater than      we've seen from anything else.      LANGFITT:  The Gulf Coast has just a tiny percentage of the nation's      total jobs, and Silvia of Wachovia Bank thinks that's one reason the      country's labor market may rebound fairly quickly.      Mr. SILVIA:  The numbers for the next three to six months will be below      average.  However, a year from now we'll probably see good, solid      employment numbers.      LANGFITT:  The report did show the unemployment rate rising to 5. 1      percent. Analysts think one reason may be the summer's strong labor      market.  Healthy markets sometimes attract many more job-seekers than      they can actually absorb, and the result can be a higher unemployment      rate.  Frank Langfitt, NPR News.

LANGFITT:  Katrina scattered people across the country, presenting huge      problems for those trying to count lost jobs.  So last month, the Bureau      of Labor Statistics, or BLS, used new techniques.  If a business did not      respond to its survey, officials went online to see whether it was still      paying employees.  Chris Carbone is an economist at the bureau.       Mr. CHRIS CARBONE (Bureau of Labor Statistics):  This is a first for BLS.      The actual impact and the scale of this disaster is so much greater than      we've seen from anything else.       LANGFITT:  The Gulf Coast has just a tiny percentage of the nation's      total jobs, and Silvia of Wachovia Bank thinks that's one reason the      country's labor market may rebound fairly quickly.       Mr. SILVIA:  The numbers for the next three to six months will be below      average.  However, a year from now we'll probably see good, solid      employment numbers.       LANGFITT:  The report did show the unemployment rate rising to 5. 1      percent. Analysts think one reason may be the summer's strong labor      market.  Healthy markets sometimes attract many more job-seekers than      they can actually absorb, and the result can be a higher unemployment      rate.  Frank Langfitt, NPR News.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Despite rising gas prices, the demand for oil does not appear to be      slowing. In fact, the International Energy Agency predicts demand for oil      will only increase.  \"Marketplace's\" Tess Vigeland is here from Los      Angeles.      And, Tess, we've been hearing some predictions that demand for oil would      slow because of the high prices, especially after the hurricanes, but      this group sees it differently?      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Yeah, this is a monthly report that the International Energy Agency puts      out, and this one says yes, we have seen a slight drop-off in demand      since the hurricanes, and oil prices have followed along.  They're down      to around $62 a barrel today instead of near, you know, $70 that we saw      during and after the storms.  But the agency is predicting that this is      very much a short-lived slowdown.  And I spoke with Tom Wallin, who's      president of the Energy Intelligence Group, and he says that's not a huge      surprise to the industry.      Mr. TOM WALLIN (Energy Intelligence Group):  There certainly is this      perception and I think this reality with $3 gasoline and these higher      prices that people are going to consume less.  What this report is really      telling us is that they're going to consume less, but not that much less.      VIGELAND:  And there is some anecdotal evidence of exactly that, people      cutting down a little bit on their driving, for example, but not cutting      it out.  Demand for SUVs on the decline, but people are still buying      them.  And of course, you've still got enormous growth in energy demand      in places like China and India, and that's hardly slowed at all.      BRAND:  And, Tess, winter is right around the corner.  People are worried      about home heating bills.  Any relief there?      VIGELAND:  In a word, no.  In fact, there is actually concern within the      oil industry about whether there's enough heating oil to meet the demand      this winter, and Wallin says that's because there's been so much focus on      making sure there's enough gasoline production.      Mr. WALLIN:  When they maximize gasoline like they did, or they have been      doing, that meant we produced less heating oil and less jet fuel.  That      means those supplies are very tight.      VIGELAND:  So you're not exactly robbing Peter to pay Paul, but there's      certainly been a lot of borrowing going on in the oil industry, and      that's not good news for folks who will need to heat their homes this      winter and, as he said, for airlines needing that jet fuel.      BRAND:  And it is possible to know what the final impact of the      hurricanes will be on oil and gas supplies?      VIGELAND:  No.  Analysts say that it'll probably be well into next      year--six months possibly--before they can assess the full impact.  And a      lot of it, Madeleine, will depend on what's going on in the rest of the      economy.  If economic growth slows down, maybe consumer confidence takes      a dip, people start clamping down on their wallets, then oil demand is      probably going to go down as well.  We may see people driving even less.      But Wallin, for one, says that the message of today's report is simply      that we cannot save our way out of a supply crunch, and that's what's      really going to have an impact this winter.      And coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we'll find out how companies      are trying to lure workers back to New Orleans.

I'm Farai Chideya in for Ed Gordon.      Real estate has become the hot investment for America's middle class, but      now there are signs that new home buyers can't count on making quick      profits.  The key question:  Will real estate prices plunge?  And if so,      how will that affect our economy?  First, a close-up look at how the      market is affecting sellers.      Ms.  ELAINE CHEN (New York Advertising Executive):  Having gone to quite      a few open houses over the course of 2005, they were literally insane.      CHIDEYA:  New York advertising executive Elaine Chen spent much of this      year shopping for her second apartment.  She bought a one bedroom facing      Central Park three years ago.  Since then, it's nearly doubled in price.      She's even put a down payment on a two-bedroom apartment.  There's only      one problem.  She still hasn't sold her current home.      Ms. CHEN:  So I was a little concerned after Katrina and everything else,      and it made me put my place on the market as soon as possible.  And      frankly, I thought at the time, well, I'll have a couple of offers the      first week, and the place will be in contract by October.  So at this      point, it's now obviously well into October, and I haven't even gotten      one offer yet, so I obviously was very disappointed about that.      CHIDEYA:  For now, Chen's real estate agent says not to lower the price.      Ms. CHEN:  He basically has said to me, `Well, this is something that a      lot of people are experiencing. '  So I feel that the price is not the      problem for my particular apartment yet, but sure, if it gets to be      December and I still haven't had an offer, would I lower the price at      that point?  You'd better belive I will.      CHIDEYA:  Audrey Edwards is a licensed real estate agent who runs Plaza      Properties in Brooklyn, New York.  She thinks the market is strong, but      sellers need to temper expectations.      Ms. AUDREY EDWARDS (Plaza Properties):  . . . had not gotten one offer in a      month in this market, I would know that I had done something wrong.  I      had either priced it incorrectly, I had not spruced it up the way it      needed to be spruced up.  Clearly, one of those two things would be      operating.      CHIDEYA:  In fact, according to one study, the average sales price of      Manhattan apartments has fallen 13 percent in the past three months.  But      seller's woes are not limited to New York.  Barbara Goodspeed is an      interior designer in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  When she got married, she      bought a new house with her husband, but it took her months to sell her      previous home at a price lower than the one she expected.      Ms. BARBARA GOODSPEED (Interior Designer):  Occasionally, there would be      people even stopping by, telling me, `If you ever decide to sell your      house, you have to let me know. '  It's just a perfect starter home and in      really good condition, and then when I went to put it on the market, I      thought, oh, there'll be no problem to sell it and did not get an offer.      Finally, after four months, I did list it with a realtor, and after being      on the market for about a month, an offer was presented, but it was      extremely low and, you know, after many negotiations, I finally did sell      it.      CHIDEYA:  Still, Edwards says that purchasing a home shouldn't be scary.      Ms. EDWARDS:  What you're buying first and foremost is a home, so you      should buy something that you want to live in.  Don't buy with the idea      that, `I'm going to make a hundred thousand dollars in five years. '  Buy      something that you want to live in now.  Buy something that you can      afford to live in now. And your life will pretty much take care of the      rest of it.       FARAI CHIDEYA, host:       From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      All that extra money you've been spending on gas helped boost inflation      last month by the highest percentage in 25 years.  Retail sales were also      up, again, mostly because of the spike in gas prices.  And because of all      this inflation, seniors living on Social Security are getting a bump in      their monthly checks.  From Los Angeles, \"Marketplace's\" Tess Vigeland is      here.      And, Tess, first, let's start with today's inflation figures.  What are      the numbers and just how much of it does come from those energy prices?      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Well, the Consumer Price Index, and this is inflation as its measured at      the check-out counter, rose 1. 2 percent in September.  Now that may not      sound like much, but, as you mentioned, it's the biggest percentage jump      in 25 years. And here's why:  90 percent of that increase came from a      record-setting surge in energy prices, oil, gasoline, natural gas.  And,      of course, we've been talking about this for several weeks now because of      the hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, had a devastating on production along      the Gulf Coast.  So things are slowly getting kind of back up and      running, but having that industry knocked back on its heels for any      length of time really meant a big price hike. That's exactly what we got.      If you take out the energy spike from this equation, then inflation rose      just a 10th of a percent--what economists call the core rate of      inflation--because energy and food are so volatile from month to month.      BRAND:  And let's look at retail sales.  That number also skewed by high      energy prices?      VIGELAND:  Yeah, that's right.  Retail sales rose 2/10ths of a percent      last month, what most analysts would deem a pretty modest performance,      not great, not bad.  But a good chunk of that came from gasoline, which,      as we know, topped $3 a gallon in some places.  Again, if you take gas      sales out of the equation, retail sales actually fell 2/10ths of a      percent in September.  The big reason there was a slowdown in demand for      cars.  And--in fact, a report out from J. D. Power and Associates today      shows that sales for this month are already down by 33 percent compared      to this time last year.  People are clamping down on their wallets      because they're paying so much for gasoline these days.      BRAND:  Well, at least some good news for the nation's seniors who are      receiving Social Security, a boost in their check.      VIGELAND:  Right, yeah.  Social Security recipients are going to be      getting a 4. 1 percent cost-of-living allowance and that's starting in      January.  That's the biggest increase in almost 15 years.  And so for      them the monthly payment goes from $963 to $1,002, and it's a $39-a-month      bump.  And that adjustment, of course, is based on the Consumer Price      Index, which we have just been talking about.  But, unfortunately, some      of the increase is going to be offset by seniors having to pay higher      premiums for Medicare.  That cost is going up by about $10 a month.  So      about a quarter of the living adjustment that they're going to get is      going to be going toward Medicare.      And we'll parse out all these numbers even further later today on      \"Marketplace. \"      BRAND:  And we'll listen for that.

And we'll parse out all these numbers even further later today on      \"Marketplace. \"       BRAND:  And we'll listen for that.

I'm Michele Norris.      ROBERT SIEGEL, host:      And I'm Robert Siegel.      Consumer prices jumped sharply last month, recording their biggest      increase in more than 25 years.  Soaring energy costs fueled most of the      increase.  But as NPR's Frank Langfitt reports, the run-up in energy      prices is not spreading to the rest of the economy, at least not yet.      FRANK LANGFITT reporting:      Prices rose 1. 2 percent in September, the biggest jump since the Carter      administration.  Driving that increase were Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,      which tore up energy facilities along the Gulf Coast.  But other than      food and energy, prices in the rest of the economy rose a modest 1/10th      of a percent.      Mr. JIM GLASSMAN (Senior Economist, JP Morgan Chase):  It's telling us      that we're not really seeing the inflation danger that everybody has been      fearing.      LANGFITT:  That's Jim Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan Chase in      New York.  Glassman says the small increase in prices, other than food      and energy, shows that most companies are not passing on high fuel costs      to consumers. And he says much of that has to do with competition.  Take      the airline industry.  Low-cost competitors are helping keep fares low,      despite high fuel costs.  And competitive pressure on prices is not just      at home.      Mr. GLASSMAN:  The competition goes beyond our shores.  We're getting      competition from all around the world.  We've got a lot of companies      making products in East Asia, bringing it back here.  So raw materials      costs may be up and energy prices may be up, but labor costs are very      low.      LANGFITT:  Another factor:  Consumers are spending so much for fuel,      they're reluctant to spend more on other things.  Again, Jim Glassman.      Mr. GLASSMAN:  The retailers are going to have a hard time pushing that      through to the customer because if I'm paying more for energy bills and I      have less available to buy products, a lot of retailers are going to have      to ramp up the incentives to get customers into the store.      LANGFITT:  Economists hope that if energy prices ease, the nation could      avoid an inflationary cycle.  Lynn Reaser is an economist with Bank of      America.      Ms. LYNN REASER (Economist, Bank of America):  We're seeing production      facilities slowly come back online in the Gulf of Mexico.  Inventories      are starting to build.  And, also, demand is beginning to ease somewhat;      people are buying more fuel-efficient cars, and people are cutting back      on those extra driving trips.      LANGFITT:  Today's consumer price report showed energy prices jumped 12      percent in September, the biggest increase on records which go back to      1957. And Glassman predicts the nation's energy problems won't go away      soon.  He says when winter comes, homeowners are likely to suffer sticker      shock when they see their first heating bills.

The storm knocked      out the refinery's power and scattered its work force.  It took long      hours, improvisation and a bit of homemade gumbo to get the plant up and      running again.  NPR's Scott Horsley reports.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      For Jim Gillingham, Rita was a rude introduction to Port Arthur.  He'd      taken over as general manager of the refinery just a few weeks earlier      when Valero bought out the plant's previous owner Premcor.      Mr. JIM GILLINGHAM (General Manager, Valero):  We took over on September      1st and then September 22nd, we had a hurricane.  And we've been working      with it ever since--kind of night and day.      HORSLEY:  Gillingham and a team of core employees rode out Hurricane Rita      90 miles north of the plant.  As soon as the winds died down, they      returned to Port Arthur to survey the damage.  Although they found the      refinery under a foot or more of water, that was actually less flooding      than they'd feared. The biggest challenge was restarting on-site      generators, which had never before been shut down.      Mr. GILLINGHAM:  Normally, those machines that generate the power are      running all the time.  This was a unique event that we shut these      machines down and walked away from them.  They got cold, they got wet,      they were not being attended.  So we didn't really know how quickly we      would be able to restart those machines.  It was more difficult than we      thought.      HORSLEY:  Gillingham and others immediately went to work lining up repair      crews and locating employees.  With much of the surrounding area      unlivable, workers had to be housed and fed on site.      Mr. GILLINGHAM:  We started with home cooking, people got stuff out of      their freezers and we barbecued and made gumbo here in the refinery in      the first couple of days.  Then we got a catering service in, a small one      at first, staffed by Valero volunteers.  And then as the number of people      in the plant ramped up, we brought in a second kitchen, and we really got      over onto a more commercial catering service.      (Soundbite of cash register operation)      HORSLEY:  Gillingham offers a driving tour of the temporary city that's      grown up inside the refinery's gates with air-conditioned trailers,      portable showers and a dining tent that seats 500.      Mr. GILLINGHAM:  You can see we have water tanks set up and barbecue      cookers, then a lot of other trucks, refrigerator trucks.  We were going      through 3 or 4,000 bags of ice a day.  Of course, when you've got 1,700      people working in 100-degree, 100 percent humidity heat, they drink a lot      of stuff.      HORSLEY:  Valero's initial forecast was that it would take two to four      weeks to get the refinery up and running.  Sure enough, three weeks to      the day after Rita struck, the plant is churning out gasoline at a rate      of more than five million gallons a day.  Two other refineries in the      Port Arthur area are still shut down because of Rita, and three in      Louisiana remain closed on account of Katrina.  The ongoing shortage of      refining capacity is keeping prices high, so Valero stands to profit      handsomely from its plant's speedy recovery.  As the nation's largest      refiner, Valero has been betting on a supply crunch, which is why it's      buying older refineries like this one.  Veteran employee Gary Byrd(ph)      says it's quite a turn-around from a decade ago when then owner Chevron      was ready to close this refinery.      Mr. GARY BYRD (Veteran Employee):  I've been here 34 years.  There are a      large number of employees that's been here at least 25 years.  Valero      showed us what they were capable of doing and what they would do as far      as giving us support. And I think the employees showed them their      appreciation by getting this refinery up in a record time.      HORSLEY:  Byrd says the hurricane was also a reminder to refinery      workers, if they needed on, of just how important their work is.  Some      drivers now recognize that as well.  Filling her tank at a nearby Valero      station, Tina Vaccara(ph) says even at today's high prices, she's      grateful just to have the gas.      Ms. TINA VACCARA (Gas Customer):  Like they say:  You don't know what you      have till it's gone, and you just take it for granted having everything,      and all of a sudden you don't have the conveniences that you normally      have, and it's, like, whoa, you know.  So it's scary.      HORSLEY:  General manager Gillingham says even when all the refineries      knocked out by the hurricanes are back on line, the country will still      have trouble keeping up with demand for gasoline.  Valero is planning an      expansion of its Port Arthur refinery.  That should be finished next      spring.  Scott Horsley, NPR News.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      The Labor Department reports wholesale prices in this country jumped 1. 9      percent in September; that is the biggest increase in 15 years.  Is      inflation back?  Here to help us figure that out is John Dimsdale from      \"Marketplace's\" Washington bureau.      John, welcome back.  And let me guess:  gas prices.      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      You've got it.  We're seeing how oil seeps through this whole economy.      It's such a vital part of transportation, electricity, heat, chemicals.      We feel it in so many ways, and energy prices at the wholesale level      soared a whopping 7 percent in September.  Now amazingly, the core      inflation rate--that's when you take out volatile food and fuel      prices--was only 3/10ths of a percent.      CHADWICK:  So why is that?  Energy prices jumped so much, but core      inflation remains restrained.      DIMSDALE:  There are several things going on.  One is the effect of      global competition.  If you're competing against an Asian supplier, you      can't pass along those price increases to your customers.  Second,      American consumers are shifting their buying habits.  They're buying      less.  You know, the back-to-school clothing sales moved from more      upscale department stores to discounters earlier this fall.  The chief      economist at Mesirow Financial, Diane Swonk, says middle-income consumers      these days are willing to shop around to get a bigger bang for their      buck.      Ms. DIANE SWONK (Mesirow Financial):  They're buying, for instance,      prepared foods at grocery stores instead of going to The Limited Service,      Boston Markets, McDonald's and, you know, fast-food kind of providers.      They're willing to walk into a supermarket that may have slightly      less-expensive prices, but prepared foods now have become a big profit      margin item for those grocery stores.  We're seeing lots of shifts in      consumer behaviors so that their living standard isn't dramatically      compromised.      CHADWICK:  So when wholesalers cannot pass along their increases to      consumers, John, what happens to the company then?      DIMSDALE:  Well, you know, they don't get back their extra added costs,      but--so it has--the first thing it does is cuts into profits.  Generally,      right now, in this economy, profits are fairly strong, so many companies      can absorb the increased costs for a while.  To protect their profits,      companies have now an incentive to look for productivity gains.  They're      trying to produce their goods and services more efficiently.  And as      Diane Swonk points out, the economy has some built-in self-correcting      measures.      Ms. SWONK:  The higher energy prices have finally triggered behavioral      changes, which over time will actually bring energy prices back down.  In      fact, investment in energy-saving technologies has surged in recent      months. And over time, that'll help to correct some of these persistently      high and rising energy prices and help to alleviate the pressure on the      Fed.      CHADWICK:  The Fed--she means the Federal Reserve Board.      DIMSDALE:  Right.  Right, the famous guardians against inflation.  And      these higher prices are going to keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to      keep raising short-term interest rates to prevent inflation from      spiraling out of control.  Most analysts expect the Fed to continue doing      that for the next few months given today's inflation numbers.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" a conversation with one of the      founders of the mutual fund business, who says the industry has gone down      the wrong path.

Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" a conversation with one of the      founders of the mutual fund business, who says the industry has gone down      the wrong path.

I'm Ed Gordon.      Senator Hillary Clinton and a handful of congressional Democrats urged      the Bush administration yesterday to increase funding to the Low Income      Energy Assistance Program.  The Energy Department recently announced that      home heating bills would increase by as much as 50 percent this winter.      That will suck hundreds of dollars from Americans' already strained      budgets.  And without increased federal support, some poor households may      have to face the cold and the cost of keeping warm alone.      Few cities are more vulnerable to this looming energy crisis than      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  NPR's Farai Chideya has the story.      FARAI CHIDEYA reporting:      Novaline Whitehead(ph) is 60 years old, divorced and disabled.  She pays      $600 in rent for her Philadelphia apartment, but she lives on $606 in      Social Security disability, plus a small settlement from an accident.      And now as winter approaches, she spends her time on the telephone with      the gas company trying to keep the heat on.      Mrs. NOVALINE WHITEHEAD:  `I don't have $74. '  And she said, `Well, Mrs.      Whitehead, if you don't have the $74, we're going to have to turn your      gas off,' which was slated for the 10th of October.  So I said, `Well,      you know, you can't get blood from a turnip.  If I can't give you $74 to      keep it on, what makes you think I can pay you 300 and something dollars      to turn it back on? '      CHIDEYA:  But Pennsylvania residents like Whitehead may face a steeper      battle than usual.  A Pennsylvania law passed last November lets utility      customers ask cut-off customers to pay $1,500 to reconnect.  This is the      first full winter the law will be in effect.      Ms. LIZ ROBINSON (Executive Director, Energy Coordinating Agency of      Philadelphia):  Utility terminations statewide have risen by 58 percent.      CHIDEYA:  Liz Robinson is the executive director of the non-profit Energy      Coordinating Agency of Philadelphia, one of the poorest cities in the      country.      Ms. ROBINSON:  In Philadelphia, we have had over 100,000 accounts      terminated in the last 12-month period.  That's a record for us.      CHIDEYA:  While there are a mix of assistance programs from the federal      government and the gas company, Pennsylvania is one of the few states      that doesn't offer its own program.      Ms. ROBINSON:  There just simply isn't the money anywhere in any system.      So our neighborhood energy centers have been turning people away already      for several months.      CHIDEYA:  Robinson says this winter could bring fires, even deaths.      Ms. ROBINSON:  What we'll see is an epidemic of kerosene space heaters      this winter.  The most dramatic thing that happens is that people put      gasoline into them and they immediately explode and you get carbon      monoxide poisoning. You'll see people leaving their homes if the winter      is severe.  So you'll see a rise in homelessness.  All the repercussions      are pretty awful.      CHIDEYA:  In fact, the gas company serving Philadelphia, Philadelphia Gas      Works, was fined $100,000 for improperly cutting off service to two      elderly citizens who froze to death.  Spokesperson Doug Oliver says the      company has retrained employees, but argues low-income programs cannot      fall solely on energy providers.      Mr. DOUG OLIVER (Spokesperson, Philadelphia Gas Works):  Unfortunately,      while utilities in general provide a basic social service, we are not a      social service agency and we cannot give or be expected to just give gas      away.  What we can do is get people enrolled into programs that they may      be eligible for. We can continue to fight, as we are, at both the federal      and at the state level for LIHEAP heating funding, Low Income Home Energy      Assistance program, to get funds to help people pay these bills.      CHIDEYA:  Oliver also points out that Pennsylvanians rejected the chance      to fund a state program.      Mr. OLIVER:  They spoke very loud and clearly last summer when there was      a proposal of a surcharge and said, `No way, nohow. '      CHIDEYA:  Joe Rhodes is a former Pennsylvania state representative and      former vice chairman of the Pennsylvania Utilities Commission.  Now as a      private consultant, he was retained by state Representative Dwight Evans      to examine the new energy law.      Mr. JOE RHODES (Private Consultant):  What this law did was put the rate      payer at the mercy of the utility.  That's not right.      CHIDEYA:  Rhodes compares Hurricane Katrina's devastation of energy      industries to an earthquake and the coming winter heating problems as a      subsequent tsunami.  Only the federal government, he argues, can prevent      more deaths.      Mr. RHODES:  The federal government has to increase its LIHEAP.  And I      hear that there's a squabble in the Congress between the Senate and the      House and the White House over what ought to be done.  There shouldn't be      any squabble. We're not talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.      We're talking about a couple of billion dollars to make sure that people      in this country don't freeze to death this winter.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      You've probably seen the holiday shopping ads on TV and in newspapers.      Not the Halloween holiday shopping ads; Christmas sales pitches are      already out there.  Why so early?  Joining us is \"Marketplace's\" John      Dimsdale.      John, they used to wait till Thanksgiving for Christmas.      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Ah, you're taking me way back, Alex.  I remember those long-gone days.      But you know, Christmas shopping has become so vital for retailers.  The      last two months of the year can be 40 percent of their annual sales and      profits.  One reason they're early this time is a lesson learned from      last year.  The big discount stores waited deep into December to offer      sales prices, and customers were slow to shop and the stores had to slash      pretty deeply to drum up business.  This year, retailers are hoping to      get an early jump with sales and discounts.      The other issue is gasoline and home heating bills this winter.  The      stores are worried that once those heating bills start coming in,      Americans are going to rein in their holiday cheer.  So retailers figure,      `Well, we better lure those shoppers in early. '  A survey by the National      Retail Federation found that more than a fourth of online stores will      begin their marketing campaigns early this year, but the federation's      Scott Krugman says it's only a matter of degree.      Mr. SCOTT KRUGMAN (National Retail Federation):  We get that question      every year and it always seems like the holiday season starts earlier and      earlier. That may be true by a day or two, but nothing dramatic.  I mean,      you're going to see retailers offering holiday-related merchandise in      October.  In fact, according to our survey, just over 21 percent of      consumers have already started their holiday shopping.  So we're behind      the curve.      CHADWICK:  John, what kind of season are retailers expecting?      DIMSDALE:  Not great, given those uncertainties about gas prices.  There      are some signs that people are downsizing, looking for more discounts.      But you know, American consumers are surprisingly resilient in the face      of bad news. There's one prediction of a 4-percent increase in sales this      year over last. That'd be a moderate year, about the average for the last      10 years.      CHADWICK:  And what kind of merchandise do they think is going to be      popular?      DIMSDALE:  Electronics are always a good bet--portable music players,      video games, computer accessories.  But so far, no one item has broken      out of the pack.  Home furnishings are expected to be popular, maybe      reflecting the housing boom that we've seen.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we're finishing up an      investigative report into the past failures of the Army Corps of      Engineers and how they may affect reconstruction of the Gulf Coast.

I'm Robert Siegel.      MELISSA BLOCK, host:      And I'm Melissa Block.      President Bush today nominated Ben Bernanke to succeed Alan Greenspan as      chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.  Greenspan's final term ends on      January 31st, and it cannot be renewed.  The 51-year-old Bernanke has      been head of the president's Council of Economic Advisers since June.      NPR's John Ydstie has more on the president's choice.      JOHN YDSTIE reporting:      During Greenspan's 18-year tenure, the Fed chairmanship has often been      described as the second most powerful job in Washington, affecting      interest rates, employment and inflation.  Flanked by Greenspan and      Bernanke in the Oval Office today, President Bush listed his nominee's      qualifications for the job, citing experience as a prominent researcher      and economics professor and nearly three years as a Federal Reserve Board      governor before becoming the president's top economic adviser.      President GEORGE W. BUSH:  He's earned a reputation for intellectual      rigor and integrity.  He commands deep respect in the global financial      community.  And he will be an outstanding chairman of the Federal      Reserve.      YDSTIE:  The president went on to praise Greenspan for his stewardship of      the US economy, which has included managing stock market crashes, shocks      like 9/11 and the longest period of growth in US history.      Pres. BUSH:  He has dominated his age like no central banker in history.      He has contributed to a better life for all Americans, and I thank him      for his service.  Ben Bernanke is the right man to build on the record      Alan Greenspan has established.      YDSTIE:  When it was his turn to step forward, Bernanke made this pledge.      Dr. BEN BERNANKE (Federal Reserve Chair Nominee):  If I'm confirmed to      this position, my first priority will be to maintain continuity with the      policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years.      YDSTIE:  That statement will please a wide swath of people, from      investors to lawmakers, who value the low inflation and relative      stability of the Greenspan era.  Indeed, the stock market rallied as it      became clear Bernanke was to be the nominee, and his confirmation by the      Senate seems all but assured.  The response was also positive in the      economics community, where Bernanke is viewed as a mainstream thinker and      superior intellect.  David Wyss is chief economist at Standard & Poor's.      Mr. DAVID WYSS (Chief Economist, Standard & Poor's):  Generally I think      Bernanke is perhaps one of the best-qualified Fed chairman in history, at      least on paper.  We just have to see how he does it in practice.      YDSTIE:  Former colleagues at the Fed have suggested Bernanke has much in      common with Greenspan in his approach to monetary policy, specifically in      his willingness to be pre-emptive but systematic in moving interest rates      to block inflation and head off recession.  One issue on which he differs      with Greenspan is his advocacy of explicit inflation targets; that is,      publicly stating that Fed policy will be aimed at keeping inflation in a      specific range, say between 1 and 2 percent.  That would eliminate some      of the guessing in the markets about what the Fed is up to.  But David      Wyss says efforts by the European central bank to do that have been      largely unsuccessful.      Mr. WYSS:  It just seemed to focus on inflation pretty much to the      exclusion of anything else that was going on in the world--for example,      the dreadful state of the European economies.      YDSTIE:  Critics of inflation targeting also say it would take away the      flexibility to deal with events like stock market meltdowns and terrorist      attacks.      The other concern Wyss has is that Bernanke lacks the political      experience that Greenspan and former Chairman Paul Volcker had before      they took the job. Ned Gramlich, who recently retired as a Fed governor,      says Bernanke's politics aren't apparent in his approach to policy.      Mr. NED GRAMLICH (Former Fed Governor):  Ben is a Republican.  The reason      I know that is that he says he's a Republican; that is, you cannot tell      that he's a Republican from his discussion of issues.      YDSTIE:  That should give Bernanke more bipartisan credibility on Capitol      Hill.  Whether he will have the political savvy to work the levers of      power in Washington as successfully as Greenspan remains a question.      John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

YDSTIE:  Former colleagues at the Fed have suggested Bernanke has much in      common with Greenspan in his approach to monetary policy, specifically in      his willingness to be pre-emptive but systematic in moving interest rates      to block inflation and head off recession.  One issue on which he differs      with Greenspan is his advocacy of explicit inflation targets; that is,      publicly stating that Fed policy will be aimed at keeping inflation in a      specific range, say between 1 and 2 percent.  That would eliminate some      of the guessing in the markets about what the Fed is up to.  But David      Wyss says efforts by the European central bank to do that have been      largely unsuccessful.       Mr. WYSS:  It just seemed to focus on inflation pretty much to the      exclusion of anything else that was going on in the world--for example,      the dreadful state of the European economies.       YDSTIE:  Critics of inflation targeting also say it would take away the      flexibility to deal with events like stock market meltdowns and terrorist      attacks.       The other concern Wyss has is that Bernanke lacks the political      experience that Greenspan and former Chairman Paul Volcker had before      they took the job. Ned Gramlich, who recently retired as a Fed governor,      says Bernanke's politics aren't apparent in his approach to policy.       Mr. NED GRAMLICH (Former Fed Governor):  Ben is a Republican.  The reason      I know that is that he says he's a Republican; that is, you cannot tell      that he's a Republican from his discussion of issues.       YDSTIE:  That should give Bernanke more bipartisan credibility on Capitol      Hill.  Whether he will have the political savvy to work the levers of      power in Washington as successfully as Greenspan remains a question.      John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

And, Adam Posen, you're a colleague to some extent of Ben Bernanke's.      Mr. ADAM POSEN (Senior Fellow, Institute for International Economics):      I've known Ben for well over a decade, and I had the privilege to      co-author a book with him.  And actually my first published paper was in      a volume he edited. So I've known Ben and admired him for quite a long      time.      SIEGEL:  Well, in the universe of economists, bankers, people in the      equity markets, what does this signal, the choice of Ben Bernanke?      Mr. POSEN:  This is pure meritocracy.  This is someone who is the best      monetary economist or one of the top two or three monetary economists in      the world, who has had exposure working directly on practical central      banking issues and who has not been politically compromised and, above      all, who's incredibly good at articulating policy issues for the public,      both written and spoken.      SIEGEL:  He has written a great deal about inflation.      Mr. POSEN:  Yes.  I mean, if you're a central banker, that's your      number-one issue because you--that's the one thing that central banks not      directly control but can influence most.  And it's the one thing that you      believe over the long run a central bank can provide--is price stability,      and then things get better in other ways.  He's also written, of course,      on deflation.  Ben is one of the great analysts of all time on what      happened in the Great Depression, what the Fed did wrong then, the things      that had to be--take in account to prevent that from happening.      SIEGEL:  I read a very wary column about him in the National Review, a      conservative magazine, saying, `Watch out.  This guy, Ben Bernanke, he is      no supply-sider. '      Mr. POSEN:  Gots to thank God.  He is no supply-sider, that's absolutely      right, and no mainstream serious economist is a supply-sider.      SIEGEL:  So there may be some people in that wing of the conservative      movement or the Republican Party that'll be disappointed by this. . .      Mr. POSEN:  There may well be, and I would view that as good, just as I      would view it as good that he's not someone who, from the far left,      believes you can create jobs like printing money.  I mean, this      is--certainly he's conservative in the sense that he's a Republican.      He's identified with this administration.  He's comfortable with this      administration's stance on taxes and Social Security, which not      necessarily all of us are.  But on monetary policy, I mean, Ben is not      just the mainstream; he's defined the mainstream for the last five, 10      years.      A central bank's primary job is to keep price stability.  It's not its      only job.  You have to worry about growth; you have to worry about jobs.      But there are limits to what a central bank can do, and you have to      publicly explain what a central bank can and cannot do.  That's the work      that he and I and others did on inflation targeting--was about that,      about disciplining the central bank to explain things to the public,      justify when it deviates from focusing on inflation.  It's a much more      transparent world, and I think that's going to be a shock for people when      they get Ben in office.      SIEGEL:  Alan Greenspan has been many things but transparent is not one      of them.  What would you expect in the way of Ben Bernanke's style as Fed      chairman that might be different from Alan Greenspan's?      Mr. POSEN:  I think there are going to be three major differences.      First, as we've already discussed, he's going to be much more clear in      his statements. He believes in central bank communications; he believes      in being a communicator himself.  You're just going to have much more      straightforward statements.      Second, I think he's going to be more collegial; that doesn't necessarily      mean he's going to talk less than the chairman, but that there's going to      be much more clearly promotion of people like Don Kohn, Roger Ferguson,      Tim Geithner, other senior people in the system.  And it won't      necessarily be read as, `Do they agree with Bernanke or not? '  They will      be able to make their own statements.      The third point that I think--in style is he's probably going to be much      more disciplined about not talking on issues that are not central bank      issues.  I mean, one of the biggest complaints with the chairman,      Greenspan, which I certainly feel is he's gone overboard in occasionally      opining on Social Security or tax policy or things that, frankly, are not      his remit.  He may know about them, but they're not his job.  And I think      Bernanke, I expect, will be much more disciplined about sticking to      central banking issues, financial issues, banking issues.      SIEGEL:  So we're not going to hear him commenting on real estate values      in the United States anytime soon?      Mr. POSEN:  You might hear him say, `If you're a bank and real estate      values are overvalued, you should probably provision a bit more against      real estate values going down. '  You're probably not going to hear him      lecturing the public, `Hey, don't take out that interest-only mortgage. '      SIEGEL:  Adam Posen, thanks a lot for talking with us.

We begin with the man nominated to fill Alan      Greenspan's shoes.      Financial markets reacted positively yesterday to President Bush's      nomination of Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.  If      confirmed by the Senate, he will replace Alan Greenspan, who has served      as Fed chairman for 18 years.  For more on this choice, we turn now to      David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal.      Good morning.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (Deputy Washington Bureau Chief, The Wall Street      Journal): Good morning.      MONTAGNE:  Would you expect Fed policy to be different under Ben Bernanke      than it has been under Alan Greenspan?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, in its basic outline, I think Fed policy will be very      similar.  Bernanke believes that inflation is the prime--fighting      inflation is the prime objective of the Fed.  Like Mr. Greenspan, he      doesn't think the Fed should be moving interest rates to burst stock      market or real estate bubbles. But he does believe in something called      inflation targeting, which means setting a specific target for inflation      that the Fed publicizes in advance and then tries to hit.      MONTAGNE:  Now Alan Greenspan has long opposed inflation targeting.      What's his argument?      Mr. WESSEL:  Mr. Greenspan has preferred ultimate flexibility where he      could set interest rates where he thought appropriate no matter what the      circumstances.  But he enjoyed what you might call the `Greenspan      standard. ' He could get away with that.  Advocates of inflation targeting      say setting a rule like this, which actually is pretty similar to the way      the Fed has actually operated, might make it easier for Mr. Bernanke to      continue Mr. Greenspan's success as a monetary policy-maker.      MONTAGNE:  Now another thing under Alan Greenspan:  The Fed has been      criticized for the secrecy of the way it makes decisions.  Is there any      indication that Bernanke will try to make the Fed a more transparent      operation?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, there certainly is.  For one thing, he talks all the      time about how important it is to be transparent and to be clear about      what the Fed is doing and what their objectives are.  And beyond that,      unlike Mr. Greenspan, who was born without some enzyme that allows you to      speak in simple declarative sentences, Mr. Bernanke is actually a very      clear speaker.  He's a practiced teacher, and he's very cogent, and I      think it'll be a lot easier for people to understand him until he figures      out that maybe that's not such a good idea and starts sounding like      Greenspan.      MONTAGNE:  Well, coming from a White House job--and that job, perhaps we      should remind listeners--is the head of the head of the President's      Council of Economic Advisers--is that an asset or a liability?      Mr. WESSEL:  It does give Mr. Bernanke a feel for Washington politics,      which is really important for a Fed chairman.  The problem he'll have, I      think, is when he starts to talk about deficits, taxes, Social Security,      people will be questioning his motives.  Is he continuing to speak on      behalf of the Bush administration?  Or if he differs from the Bush      administration, does this mean that he was not telling the truth while he      was at the White House?  I suspect, at least in the beginning, that that      means he won't talk very much about anything, except those subjects in      the Fed's purview:  inflation, banking and monetary policy.      MONTAGNE:  And just quickly, any views as to why President Bush chose him      and made the announcement this week?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, he's obviously a very qualified guy.  They're talking      about him as the John Roberts of central banking.  It was very convenient      for Mr. Bush to have some good news to talk about now with all this talk      of indictments of his aides and hurricanes and stuff like that.

That's why some schools across the country are      experimenting with longer school days and weekend classes.  So far these      initiatives have been limited to individual schools and school districts.      Now Massachusetts has become the first state to launch a systemwide      effort to extend the traditional six-hour school day.  NPR's Anthony      Brooks reports.      ANTHONY BROOKS reporting:      It's just after 2:30 in the afternoon, and across the city of Boston,      most kids are on their way home from school.  But inside the Murphy      Middle School, a public school in the Dorchester neighborhood, a full      afternoon of work is just getting started.      (Soundbite of voices in classroom)      Unidentified Teacher #1:  Boys and girls, we're back to silent homework      time for five more minutes, and then I have your snack.      BROOKS:  Three hundred kids, about a third of this school's population,      take part in this extended-day program that runs until 6 PM.  They can      get help with their homework or take extra reading and math classes.      Unidentified Teacher #1:  What happens--actually, Lam(ph), can you go and      add the 0 and bring down another 0 on that?      BROOKS:  They can study piano and violin, or join a hip-hop dance class.      (Soundbite of background music)      Unidentified Teacher #2:  Ready?  Let's start with looking right and      left. Right, and left, and left. . .      BROOKS:  They can do sports, take art classes or study French, as well as      Japanese.      Unidentified Teacher #3:  OK.  So we're going to start with (Japanese      spoken). Let's go again.  (Japanese spoken).      Group of Students:  (Japanese spoken).      Unidentified Teacher #3:  (Japanese spoken).

BROOKS:  Many of the students at the Murphy School come from low-income      families, but they earn some of the highest reading and math scores in      the city.  Principal Mary Russo says this program is an important reason      why.      Ms. MARY RUSSO (Principal, Murphy Middle School):  Well, what's different      now is that students are required to learn to standards all over the      country, and in order to reach those standards, which are tougher now and      more rigorous, students need more time to learn.      BROOKS:  Holly Concannon(ph) agrees.  She's a fourth-grade teacher here      who says the traditional six-hour school day is just too short to meet      the new, tougher standards.      Ms. HOLLY CONCANNON (Fourth-Grade Teacher):  It's very challenging to fit      it all in, and things like recess are sacrificed.  You know, there's the      guilt of not allowing the children to have recess, and then there's the      guilt of `If I take them to recess, what am I missing? '      BROOKS:  This program is voluntary, but it offers a glimpse of what      public education could look like in the years ahead.  Many charter      schools across the country, with freedom to experiment, use longer days,      particularly in urban districts which otherwise have few after-school      academic programs for their kids, who often need them the most.      Mr. CHRIS GABRIELI (Massachusetts 2020 Foundation):  The real question      is, what is the amount of time that kids need to succeed?      BROOKS:  That's Chris Gabrieli, who heads the Massachusetts 2020      Foundation, a non-profit group pushing for a longer school day.      Mr. GABRIELI:  The notion that every kid can succeed in exactly the same      amount of time, 180 days, six hours a day, is sort of nonsensical on its      face. So why not expand school to be significantly more time, contain      considerably more of the things that kids need to succeed, meaning      enrichment, arts, music, drama, sports, depending on their needs?      BROOKS:  Gabrieli has pushed the idea in the Massachusetts Legislature,      which approved about a half million dollars worth of planning grants to      help districts design school days that would be a full 30 percent longer.      Twenty districts, including Boston, have applied for the money.  So has      the small city of Lowell, Massachusetts, where school superintendent      Karla Baehr says a longer day and a longer school year would help the      city's large immigrant population.      Ms. KARLA BAEHR (Lowell School Superintendent):  Our youngsters would      greatly benefit from the opportunity to be in settings where they're      constantly encouraged to speak, to listen, to read and to really develop      their language skills.      BROOKS:  But Baehr says the trick will be to design a longer school day      that works, and then sell the concept to politicians, teachers and      parents.      Ms. BAEHR:  This is not simple, because when you shift from voluntary to      mandatory, when you really think about it as integrated and coordinated      with the regular school program, it's very challenging.      BROOKS:  Catherine Boudreau, president of the Massachusetts Teacher      Association, is open to some of the benefits of a longer school day, but      she says it shouldn't be required.      Ms. CATHERINE BOUDREAU (President, Massachusetts Teacher Association):      I'm not even sure that teachers believe mandatory extended day is good      for students.  There are parents that would like their children to come      home, play outside and not be at school from 7:00 in the morning to 6:00      at night.  They would like their children to have some childhood.      (Soundbite of classroom noise)      Unidentified Teacher #4:  Now my answer--OK?  No more remainders.  We      don't want to use it, OK? --in sixth grade.  Twenty-five. . .      BROOKS:  At the Murphy School, some teachers voice similar concerns.  But      Principal Mary Russo says she favors a fundamental restructuring of the      school day, not just extending more of the same.      Ms. RUSSO:  Sometimes when it's presented to people in terms of time,      they think, `Oh, well, more time doesn't necessarily equal higher      achievement. ' But if you think about balancing recreation, academics,      arts, I think you're talking about a much stronger educational      experience.      Unidentified Teacher #4:  Right now. . .      BROOKS:  Paul Reville, who heads the Rennie Center for Education in      Cambridge, agrees.  He points out kids from Europe to Asia spend a lot      more time in classrooms than do American kids, who are stuck with an      outdated academic calendar.      Mr. PAUL REVILLE (Rennie Center for Education):  We're essentially in a      post-industrial information age, with an agrarian model of education      time.  We sent them home in the afternoon to do chores on the farm.  We      sent them home all summer to bring in the harvest.  And we're still doing      that, even though 1 or 2 percent of our population is engaged in      agriculture.      BROOKS:  But the biggest challenge may be cost.  While the state has      committed just a half million dollars in planning grants, it will require      much more to implement longer school days statewide, and it's not yet      clear if the public is committed to such a large investment.  Anthony      Brooks, NPR News, Boston.       RENEE MONTAGNE, host:       Just about everybody agrees that when it comes to education, the more      learning, the better.  That's why some schools across the country are      experimenting with longer school days and weekend classes.  So far these      initiatives have been limited to individual schools and school districts.      Now Massachusetts has become the first state to launch a systemwide      effort to extend the traditional six-hour school day.  NPR's Anthony      Brooks reports.       ANTHONY BROOKS reporting:       It's just after 2:30 in the afternoon, and across the city of Boston,      most kids are on their way home from school.  But inside the Murphy      Middle School, a public school in the Dorchester neighborhood, a full      afternoon of work is just getting started.       (Soundbite of voices in classroom)       Unidentified Teacher #1:  Boys and girls, we're back to silent homework      time for five more minutes, and then I have your snack.       BROOKS:  Three hundred kids, about a third of this school's population,      take part in this extended-day program that runs until 6 PM.  They can      get help with their homework or take extra reading and math classes.       Unidentified Teacher #1:  What happens--actually, Lam(ph), can you go and      add the 0 and bring down another 0 on that?       BROOKS:  They can study piano and violin, or join a hip-hop dance class.       (Soundbite of background music)       Unidentified Teacher #2:  Ready?  Let's start with looking right and      left. Right, and left, and left. . .       BROOKS:  They can do sports, take art classes or study French, as well as      Japanese.       Unidentified Teacher #3:  OK.  So we're going to start with (Japanese      spoken). Let's go again.  (Japanese spoken).       Group of Students:  (Japanese spoken).       Unidentified Teacher #3:  (Japanese spoken).

BROOKS:  Many of the students at the Murphy School come from low-income      families, but they earn some of the highest reading and math scores in      the city.  Principal Mary Russo says this program is an important reason      why.

I'm Melissa Block.      ROBERT SIEGEL, host:      And I'm Robert Siegel.      Now baseball and the Federal Reserve.  From Professor Dwight Jaffee of      the Haas School of Business at UC-Berkeley comes this news.  Ben      Bernanke, the economist just nominated to chair the Fed, believes that a      key measure of pitching success is skewed.  It overstates relief      pitchers' successes and understates the success of starters.  Well, what      with the World Series under way and Professor Bernanke's confirmation      hearings not too far off, we thought we'd pursue this with Professor      Jaffee.  He says he knows what Ben Bernanke thinks about this because      when they talked together at Princeton, they played squash together and      they talked baseball.      Professor DWIGHT JAFFEE (Haas School of Business, UC-Berkeley):  We were      both very interested in statistics.  A lot of financial economists are,      and we were.  And we discovered we both had a great love of baseball and      baseball statistics, and as we would walk back and forth from the squash      courts and were chatting, we discovered there was an error in the way      they were computing some of the baseball statistics.      SIEGEL:  You discovered that there was an error in the way that they're      calculating it.      Prof. JAFFEE:  I would say so.      SIEGEL:  What was the Jaffee-Bernanke error that was discovered there?      Prof. JAFFEE:  You have to know a little bit about baseball and the      statistic is called an earned run average, and it's a statistic that's      used to evaluate the quality of a pitcher.  And basically the idea is      that over a nine-inning game, how many runs would you expect a pitcher to      give up?  And the ERA, or earned run average, is the average number that      a specific pitcher allows. Lower is better.      SIEGEL:  Mm-hmm.  And a pitcher is charged with those runs that score by      batters who reached base on his watch.      Prof. JAFFEE:  Exactly right.      SIEGEL:  And if he's lifted for a relief pitcher and that guy who hit a      double is singled home, the run is charged to the pitcher who put him on      base.      Prof. JAFFEE:  Exactly.      SIEGEL:  And I gather that Professor Bernanke and you have found the      problem here.  That's the difficulty.      Prof. JAFFEE:  Well, there's actually two difficulties.  The fundamental      difficulty is that it's much easier to end an inning and not have any      runs charged against you if you actually have the luxury that somebody      else has put a runner on base and you're not responsible for them.      SIEGEL:  That would be the relief pitcher?      Prof. JAFFEE:  The relief pitcher is not responsible.  For example, if a      relief pitcher comes in and there's already a runner on first base and      the first batter hits a ground ball and it's a double play, he gets two      outs to his credit.      SIEGEL:  Mm-hmm.      Prof. JAFFEE:  But if that player instead on first base had scored a run,      it would be charged to the previous pitcher.  So it's sort of a `Heads      you win, tails they lose' sort of situation.      SIEGEL:  Well, did Professor Bernanke--now I know you also were involved      in this, but he's the one who's becoming chairman of the Fed so we want      an insight here--did he have a solution, a correction for that problem?      Prof. JAFFEE:  Yeah.  I think the idea is that you would have to sort of      have a greater degree of data.  You'd have to actually anticipate who was      on base and make a correction for that.  So, for example, you would      compute what was the expected advantage to a relief pitcher of already      having this player on base, and you would give them a higher earned run      average the more often that they had that advantage.      SIEGEL:  Well, would you split it?  Would you say that a run that scores      from first base is more weighted toward the relief pitcher, but a run      that scores from third base is more weighted to the pitcher who put him      on or something like that.  How would you do it?      Prof. JAFFEE:  Yeah, I think that's exactly.  Now we never went forward      with this.  I would have to say we had more important things to do in      serious--in monetary or financial economics than this.  So it's not that      we executed this, but it always annoyed us and we would, you know, hear      in the newspaper some relief pitcher was considered great because he had      this very low earned run average and we would always say, `Did you see      that?  They still don't understand how to compute 'em. '      SIEGEL:  Now do you think that your friend and fellow squash partner      would, you know, bring a similar analytical critique to the way the      unemployment rate is determined, say, or inflation is determined?      Prof. JAFFEE:  I think that there is definitely a commonality in a mind      that takes to these statistics and understands what doesn't make sense      and tries to make sense of them.  And it applies every bit as much to      unemployments rates and inflation rates as it does to ERAs, and it's      probably much more important with respect to employment and inflation.      SIEGEL:  Well, thank you very much, Professor Jaffee, for talking with us      about this today.      Prof. JAFFEE:  Very good.  Good-bye.      SIEGEL:  Professor Dwight Jaffee of UC-Berkeley.  Like economist Ben      Bernanke, he says he is deeply skeptical of the formula used to compile      the earned run average.       MELISSA BLOCK, host:       This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  I'm Melissa Block.       ROBERT SIEGEL, host:       And I'm Robert Siegel.       Now baseball and the Federal Reserve.

I'm Robert Siegel.      MELISSA BLOCK, host:      And I'm Melissa Block.      Despite hurricanes and rising energy prices, the US economy continued to      grow at a healthy pace during the third quarter of this year.  The      Commerce Department said today the economy expanded an annual rate of 3. 8      percent between July and September.  That's slightly more than many      economists expected.  But some cautioned that the numbers don't yet      reflect the full impact of Hurricane Katrina.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.      JIM ZARROLI reporting:      The past few weeks have been somewhat anxious times for the US economy.      Consumer confidence is down sharply.  The major stock indexes have lost      ground for the year and there's growing concern that rising energy prices      will slow growth.  But so far, at least, there's no sign that any of this      has affected the overall economy.  The Commerce Department said today      that growth exceeded 3 percent for the 10th straight quarter.      Mr. RICHARD YAMARONE (Argus Research):  I think it's just telling us that      the economy is on a firm footing with very solid fundamentals.      ZARROLI:  Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research, says the      economy fired on all cylinders during the quarter.  Consumer spending      rose by nearly 4 percent with especially strong automobile sales and      government spending was up 7. 7 percent.  Yamarone says not even the sharp      rise in energy prices seemed to affect the economy too much.      Mr. YAMARONE:  This is not what they teach you in grad school on how to      do forecasting.  You know, traditionally when oil prices, energy prices      are elevated at record high levels, you tend to see somewhat of a      softening in economic growth, consumer spending, business investment, and      that certainly wasn't the case in the third quarter.      ZARROLI:  Yamarone says one reason growth remained stronger in the      quarter is that companies haven't yet passed on higher fuel prices to      their consumers at the rate that many analysts expected.      Mr. YAMARONE:  There are a number of companies that said that they have      intentions of passing on higher energy prices through their products.      We've heard from Clorox.  We've heard from Kimberly-Clark.  We've heard      from Procter & Gamble.  Come the 1st of January we're going to see some      higher prices in consumer products, but today we really haven't seen all      that many.      ZARROLI:  In fact, the government said today the key measure of inflation      actually fell during the third quarter when food and energy costs were      excluded.  But Commerce Department officials also noted that the third      quarter numbers are preliminary and are virtually certain to be revised.      Economist Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute says today's      report doesn't include some data from September such as personal income      numbers, and September was the time when the full impact of Hurricanes      Katrina and Rita was being felt.  Bivens says the report also suggests      one potential problem for the economy.  Consumer spending actually      outpaced wage growth, suggesting that much of the boom in growth      continues to be fueled by credit cards and home equity loans.      Mr. JOSH BIVENS (Economic Policy Institute):  What that says for the      future is I don't think we can rely on consumption growth to power      forward unless we see better underlying income growth.  That is, people      can't put stuff on their credit card forever, and so I think it's just      yet another reason to think this economy is not out of the woods.      ZARROLI:  As for the Bush administration, today's report was a welcome      piece of good news in a week when there hasn't been very much of it.  In      a statement, Commerce Department Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said last      quarter's solid growth coming at a time of many challenges is evidence of      the underlying resilience of the US economy.

Despite hurricanes and rising energy prices, the US economy continued to      grow at a healthy pace during the third quarter of this year.  The      Commerce Department said today the economy expanded an annual rate of 3. 8      percent between July and September.  That's slightly more than many      economists expected.  But some cautioned that the numbers don't yet      reflect the full impact of Hurricane Katrina.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports.       JIM ZARROLI reporting:       The past few weeks have been somewhat anxious times for the US economy.      Consumer confidence is down sharply.  The major stock indexes have lost      ground for the year and there's growing concern that rising energy prices      will slow growth.  But so far, at least, there's no sign that any of this      has affected the overall economy.

I'm Noah Adams.      Wall Street is kicking off a new week with some good financial news,      lower oil prices and a rise in personal income, and that boosted stock      prices in early trading today.  But \"Marketplace\" New York bureau chief      Bob Moon tells us there's a ghost of sorts hanging over investors on this      Halloween, and the fear of the unknown might be holding back the stock      market just a bit.      Bob, the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq opened higher today; big gains on      the European stock markets earlier.  So what problem do you see in this?      BOB MOON reporting:      Well, it's what we don't know as opposed to what we do.  We know that the      news has been pretty good lately as you mentioned.  Today, for example,      there was a flurry of takeover deals that investors find so encouraging,      word that the pace of consumer spending grew last month, businesss      activity in the Midwest was better than expected.  So that's what we      know.  But the policy-makers at the Federal Reserve haven't really given      us a clear signal as to how much longer they're going to keep raising      interest rates, and that's what we don't know.  They meet again tomorrow.      Economists who were surveyed by Reuters in the past month were unanimous      in expecting another quarter-percentage point increase tomorrow; that      would bring it up to an even 4 percent.  What's not clear, though, is how      serious the threat of inflation is and how far these policy-makers at the      Fed might go to keep the prospect of higher prices under control.      ADAMS:  And how much worry, indeed, does that create on Wall Street, the      idea of higher interest rates?      MOON:  Well, it's a little hard to illustrate this point on a day like      today when you've got the markets making these big gains.  You take a      look over at trading in London today, for example; the FTSE 100 scored      its biggest one-day point gain in two and a half years.  But some      analysts say that this is just the kind of thing that really does      illustrate the point, this volatility that we've seen in the stock      markets over the past few weeks; big gains followed by big losses.  They      say that that's a sign that investors are still trying to get a sharper,      longer-term picture.  Last week on Wall Street, we saw a couple of days      with triple-digit gains.  We also saw a triple-digit loss.  And to some,      that suggest that investors are still concerned that rising interest      rates could constrain economic growth and that could bring lower consumer      spending.      ADAMS:  And if you're a contrarian on this issue, what would you be      looking at?      MOON:  Well, so far there hasn't been really much news that might      convince the Fed to change course.  If anything, the economy's been more      resilient than expected.  We just saw last week figures from the      government that showed that the economic growth had bettered the previous      quarter.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      A sobering warning today about the world's energy future; this from the      International Energy Agency.  It says that if developed and developing      nations keep burning oil the way they do now, the next 25 years will      bring soaring energy prices and dramatic increases in greenhouse gas      pollution.  Joining us is John Dimsdale in \"Marketplace's\" Washington      bureau.      John, what is the IEA?      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      It was set up by the world's big industrialized nations after the 1970s      oil embargo to keep an eye on energy markets, to try to avoid disruptions      like we had back in the '70s.      CHADWICK:  So they're sounding this alarm.      DIMSDALE:  Yeah.  It's really due to the economic success of growing      countries like China and India and South Korea.  They've been emulating      the US, Europe and Japan by building their economies by using fossil      fuels for electricity and transportation.  So you add that growing demand      to what developed countries are already using, and the IEA finds that the      burning of oil and coal and natural gas is going to spew 50 percent more      carbon dioxide and other global warming gases into the atmosphere by the      year 2030.      Beyond these environmental problems, the IEA is also worried that the      producers of oil and gas can't meet the demand.  Only the Middle East has      the available resources, and they're going to have to spend, like, $56      billion a year just on new drilling rigs and refineries to keep pace.      CHADWICK:  So do they offer any other solutions?      DIMSDALE:  Nothing that you haven't already heard.  You know, they're      trying to switch away from carbon-based energy resources; solar, wind,      hydrogen-based fuel cells.  They're asking for these investments in      alternative fuels on top of the investments in refineries and pipelines      from the whopping profits that oil companies have been making.  The IEA      is telling oil producers to, quote, \"invest with confidence. \"  But you      know, Alex, there are also signs today that people with money are      reluctant to invest it.      CHADWICK:  How do you mean that?      DIMSDALE:  A Cleveland investment bank is out with what they call the      Affluent Consumer Confidence Index.  It's a survey of people who earn      more than $150,000 a year.  It turns out that their optimism in the      future of the economy dropped dramatically during the third quarter of      the year.  The poll shows that rich people are worried about the high      government deficits, higher interest rates, and that they're changing      their investment strategies. They're very cautious about the stock      market.  And here's a concern for retailers:  A quarter of the wealthy      people surveyed said they're planning to spend less on holiday gifts and      entertaining this year.      And all these jitters kind of jibe with some recent corporate investment      trends.  It seems like big companies--Berkshire Hathaway,      Microsoft--they're setting aside more of their assets in cash, keeping      money out of the stock market.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we look at how drug companies are      trying to find the next blockbuster drug in the depths of the ocean.      CHADWICK:  Well, those were sobering reports, but thank you, John.      John Dimsdale of public radio's daily business show, \"Marketplace,\"      produced by American Public Media.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      The US trade deficit jumped by more than 11 percent in September.  That      was much more than expected and means that the trade deficit is on track      to be the largest ever.  Joining us is John Dimsdale from \"Marketplace's\"      Washington bureau.      And, John, I would imagine the September figures were caused, at least in      part, by the high oil prices.      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      That's certainly part of it but not all.  You know, it seems the American      appetite for foreign TVs, electronics, clothing, cars, food just knows no      bounds.  That being said, oil and other petroleum products do account for      about 42 percent of the steady rise in the US trade deficit since 2001.      BRAND:  And oil prices are now coming down after the record highs, after      the hurricanes.  So should that help the trade deficit?      DIMSDALE:  It should.  It should make the trade deficit look a little      better, at least over the next couple months.  But there are other trends      that are running counter to oil prices.  For example, the value of the      dollar has been strengthening recently, and that makes foreign products      even cheaper, more attractive, for US consumers.  Also, American products      are not selling well overseas.  Exports in September were down $3 billion      from the month before. Now that's partly due to a drop in aircraft      shipments because of a machinist strike at Boeing, but the demand for      American-made goods just continues to slide.      BRAND:  And, John, the trade deficit has been rising steadily since the      beginning of this decade, for the last few years, breaking new records      year and year, and economists keep saying that this is unsustainable.  So      how long can this go on?      DIMSDALE:  Well, I put that very question to C. Fred Bergsten.  He's one      of this city's most prominent trade experts at the Institute for      International Economics.  He says the trade imbalance eventually will      make the value of America's currency drop.  The question for him is:  How      fast?      Mr. C. FRED BERGSTEN (Institute for International Economics):  There is      an inevitable large decline of the dollar coming.  Even if it's the      smoothest and most gradual moves, it still means important upward      pressure on inflation and interest rates.  If it were to go into a free      fall and the total inevitable decline of 20, 25 percent happened in a few      months or even a couple quarters, then it could be much nastier then.      Interest rates could go to double digits, for example.      DIMSDALE:  And that increases borrowing costs and would slow economic      growth. And most worrisome for free-trade experts like Fred Bergsten, it      generates trade protectionist pressures in Congress.  There are already      moves to require more tariffs and other barriers on China to induce the      Chinese to let their currency rise in value against the dollar.  Earlier      this week we saw China and the US sign a deal that will limit cheap      clothing imports from China.  That reflects more of this pressure.      Coming up on \"Marketplace,\" we're looking into the finances of the      crumbling newspaper market.  And should the Tribune Company sell their      flagship Chicago Tribune?

You know, it seems the American      appetite for foreign TVs, electronics, clothing, cars, food just knows no      bounds.  That being said, oil and other petroleum products do account for      about 42 percent of the steady rise in the US trade deficit since 2001.       BRAND:  And oil prices are now coming down after the record highs, after      the hurricanes.  So should that help the trade deficit?       DIMSDALE:  It should.  It should make the trade deficit look a little      better, at least over the next couple months.  But there are other trends      that are running counter to oil prices.  For example, the value of the      dollar has been strengthening recently, and that makes foreign products      even cheaper, more attractive, for US consumers.  Also, American products      are not selling well overseas.  Exports in September were down $3 billion      from the month before. Now that's partly due to a drop in aircraft      shipments because of a machinist strike at Boeing, but the demand for      American-made goods just continues to slide.       BRAND:  And, John, the trade deficit has been rising steadily since the      beginning of this decade, for the last few years, breaking new records      year and year, and economists keep saying that this is unsustainable.  So      how long can this go on?       DIMSDALE:  Well, I put that very question to C. Fred Bergsten.  He's one      of this city's most prominent trade experts at the Institute for      International Economics.  He says the trade imbalance eventually will      make the value of America's currency drop.  The question for him is:  How      fast?       Mr. C. FRED BERGSTEN (Institute for International Economics):  There is      an inevitable large decline of the dollar coming.  Even if it's the      smoothest and most gradual moves, it still means important upward      pressure on inflation and interest rates.  If it were to go into a free      fall and the total inevitable decline of 20, 25 percent happened in a few      months or even a couple quarters, then it could be much nastier then.      Interest rates could go to double digits, for example.       DIMSDALE:  And that increases borrowing costs and would slow economic      growth. And most worrisome for free-trade experts like Fred Bergsten, it      generates trade protectionist pressures in Congress.  There are already      moves to require more tariffs and other barriers on China to induce the      Chinese to let their currency rise in value against the dollar.  Earlier      this week we saw China and the US sign a deal that will limit cheap      clothing imports from China.  That reflects more of this pressure.       Coming up on \"Marketplace,\" we're looking into the finances of the      crumbling newspaper market.  And should the Tribune Company sell their      flagship Chicago Tribune?

I'm Robert Siegel.      MICHELE NORRIS, host:      And I'm Michele Norris.      The industrial conglomerate Koch Industries is buying the big paper and      timber products company Georgia-Pacific.  The $13 billion deal makes Koch      the largest privately held company in the US by annual sales.  It's just      the latest in a flurry of acquisitions by private companies and so-called      private equity funds.  Many investment groups are awash in money these      days, and as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, they've been buying up public      companies and bidding up prices in multibillion-dollar deals.      CHRIS ARNOLD reporting:      You may not have heard too much before about Koch, spelled K-O-C-H.      That's because, as a private company, Koch doesn't have to spend a lot of      time and money promoting its image and worrying about what investors      think of it.  Mary Beth Jarvis is a communications director for Koch.      Ms. MARY BETH JARVIS (Communications Director, Koch Industries):  Yeah,      being privately held certainly means that I have more explaining to do      when I say I work for Koch than someone who works for the soft drink      maker.      ARNOLD:  Koch is a giant, family-owned business that runs scores of other      companies.  They make oil and chemical products, fabrics like nylon and      Lycra. They're in the ranching industry.  And now, by acquiring      Georgia-Pacific, Koch's getting into wood and paper products, such as      Brawny towels and Dixie cups.  And actually, Jarvis says, Koch has been      looking at other possible deals, too, lately.  But before this one, it      had been holding back.      Ms. JARVIS:  Frankly, the market's been a bit frothy, and folks are      bidding up the price of assets to figures that we just didn't think were      compatible with the long-term value they could create.      ARNOLD:  It's not just private companies like Koch looking to buy public      companies.  Investment groups have been getting into the act in a big      way. These are private equity funds with money from rich individuals,      pension funds and banks.  And lately their returns have been huge.      Earlier this year a big private equity group called Blackstone quadrupled      its money by selling a German chemical company after owning it for less      than 12 months.  Professor Colin Blaydon studies private equity at      Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.      Professor COLIN BLAYDON (Tuck School of Business, Dartmouth):  It's      looked very attractive, and so people looking at the attractive returns      over the last two years have pushed more and more money into it.  There      are megafunds that have been raised in the last few months that are over      $10 billion.  This is new territory.      ARNOLD:  Probably the easiest way to picture what's been going on here is      to compare it to the housing market.  As with homes, the prices of      multibillion-dollar companies have been rising.  Interest rates are low,      so investors can pay more.  And some of these buyout firms have been      buying and quickly flipping and selling companies for tremendous profit.      Prof. BLAYDON:  So the question is:  Is this a classic boom-bust cycle,      where people see--`There've been great returns.  Let me put a lot more      money into it,' right when valuations are at the top?  And then the      returns stagnate, the economy turns down a bit, and it becomes a      self-fulfilling prophecy that the bust follows the boom.      ARNOLD:  Blaydon thinks there will probably be just a gradual stagnation      in the near term, but others think the bottom could fall out more      dramatically. And if that happens, Blaydon says many pension funds      especially could get hurt.  He says the pension funds of major companies      have been putting more and more money into these private equity groups.      Prof. BLAYDON:  There is a lot of underfunded pension funds that are      looking for returns.  They are in an aggressive search.  And so if those      returns are not there, they're going to have difficulties in meeting the      pension payments that they owe to their beneficiaries.      ARNOLD:  But for now private buyers are still eager to purchase publicly      traded companies.  Koch paid a 39 percent premium to shareholders to buy      Georgia-Pacific, where it says operations will continue much as they have      in the past.  Only now Georgia-Pacific won't have to worry about the      quarterly pressure from Wall Street for higher returns.  Chris Arnold,      NPR News.

Further west, in midcity, signs of life      are more plentiful.  Last night, residents in Faubourg St. John      celebrated the opening of one of their small neighborhood restaurants,      Lola's.  It serves Spanish food.  Reporter Molly Peterson was there.      MOLLY PETERSON reporting:      Recovery in this midcity neighborhood, not too far from the fairgrounds,      has been slow.  Electricity's only just coming back on.  National      Guardsmen patrolling nearby still casually refer to this area as a      sector, not a neighborhood.  But in the last few days, there've been      signs of progress.      (Soundbite of crowd noise)      PETERSON:  Until this summer, Lola's didn't have a liquor license.      Patrons still bring their own wine, so waiting for a table is not just      bearable, it's actually kind of like a street party.      Mr. IAN McNAULTY(ph) (New Orleans Resident):  My name's Ian McNaulty.  I      live about a mile away, where it's utter darkness.  I rode my bike over      here a mile away, and when I hit the area where the lights begin again,      it's heartbreaking in a way but so encouraging.      PETERSON:  Owner Angel Miranda lives right next door to Lola's.  On busy      nights, people are waiting actually on his porch.  He says after Katrina      hit, residents took care of each other here.      Mr. ANGEL MIRANDA (Owner, Lola's):  It was beautiful around here, because      a bunch of guys and ladies, they was cooking every day and they was      getting food all the way around.  And everybody . . . (unintelligible)      whatever--what you need, so everybody was helping each other.  So it was      nice.      PETERSON:  Neighbors say Lola's is the kind of place that they cross      their fingers and pray that food writer's don't find.  For one thing,      it's tiny; there's just about 10 or 12 tables.  And they're protective of      the community vibe.

And everybody is kind      of welcoming Angel back tonight, because this is the first restaurant      back in our neighborhood.      PETERSON:  What kind of a job do you think the city's done in bringing      the city back so far?      Mr. BURNS:  Mixed, I think.  I'm right now positive on Nagin.  This is a      situation where it'd almost be a miracle if someone handled it extremely      well. There's so many things changing, such a large area was affected, so      many things are broken.  I'm not unhappy with the city, let's put it that      way.  I think that the city can't handle it by itself.      PETERSON:  Owner Angel Miranda says the city, like the levees that are      supposed to protect it, is unprepared for natural disasters.      Mr. MIRANDA:  We need a better, stronger, honest people handling this      city. Where are they?  Well, we are here, so we have to--next time that      we vote, we have to choose the right one, if there are one or two.      PETERSON:  Miranda says he didn't have much damage.      Mr. MIRANDA:  Healthy people, healthy business, they don't get upset for      a situation like that, because we are strong enough and we have enough      energy to come back the same way or stronger.

Among other things, they urged the      European Union to cut tariffs on imported farm goods and they discussed      measures against bird flu. Tomorrow, President Bush will be in China,      whose leaders he rebuked earlier this week, for not matching the      country's growing economic power with greater democracy.  China is the      third largest trading partner for the United States and its importance is      only expected to grow.  I spoke earlier with      journalist-turned-businessman James McGregor.  He lives and works in      China, and he's the author of the new book \"One Billion Customers:      Lessons From the Front Lines of Doing Business in China. \"      Mr. JAMES McGREGOR (Author, \"One Billion Customers\"):  This place has      nothing to do with communism.  You can't look at China through the eyes      of the Soviet Union or Communist China.  That's kind of stir-fry      Kremlinology.  This country is capitalist down to its bone marrow, and      they are completely commercial in the way they do things.  Yeah, they're      very focused.  It's an authoritarian government, but it's a capitalist      system.      BRAND:  Give us a detail of how it is such an overwhelmingly capitalist      system.      Mr. McGREGOR:  Well, this is a government that has five-year plans from      the old Soviet planning days, but those five-year plans now talk about      `How do we build the world's best fiber-optic industry? '  `How do we      build the world's best silicon chip industry? '  `How do we build more      universities to educate engineers? '      BRAND:  Well, this has all happened very, very quickly, in the last      decade or so.  China has gone from a relatively closed Communist nation      to, as we say, a hypercapitalist one, so what does it feel like to be in      the midst of a country that's changing so quickly?      Mr. McGREGOR:  If you look at China in terms of the United States, things      have happened so fast, you can kind of feel the wind on your face.  I      mean, this is a country that has, in the past 15 years, compared to the      US, gone through the robber baron era of the late 1800s, the financial      speculation of the 1920s, the rural-to-urban migration of the 1930s, the      first car, first college education, first vacation consumer of the 1950s,      and aspects of the social appeal of the 1960s.  What we've gone through      in a hundred years, they've done in 15.      BRAND:  Well, what about its history and its traditions?  It must have      more than just a capitalistic ethic?      Mr. McGREGOR:  Well, I don't know.  If you look at China's history, I      mean, the equivalent of saying, `Merry Christmas' in China--How do you      say, `Happy New Year' for Chinese New Year in Chinese?  It's (Chinese      spoken), or `Congratulations on getting rich. '  So I think these      traditions do go back.  I think one of the--I mean, you have to look at      China really as simultaneously the world's largest start-up and the      world's largest turnaround.  It's a start-up in that in the last 15, 20      years, they're doing everything for the first time and they go as fast as      they can.  They copy what other people in the world do and they make it      up every day, just like any start-up in the Silicon Valley.  On the other      hand, it's a turnaround because they have a 2,000-year cultural encoding      that make people behave certain ways and just form the way society works.      BRAND:  We hear repeatedly here in the States that our century is over.      We owned the 20th century and the 21st century belongs to China and that      China will soon overtake America economically.  What do you think of      that?      Mr. McGREGOR:  No, it won't overtake America economically.  China has a      lot of its own internal problems that are going to be cropping up more      and more in the next decade.  Environment--this country is completely      trashed.  I mean, 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities are in China.      The waterways of China are toxic.  The haves and the have-nots--as      China's gotten richer, the people who have--the people in the countryside      have fallen behind, the health-care systems, and this government knows      that, but they've got to go a long way towards cleaning it up.  In the      1990s, the government of China was really trickle-down Republicans in      some ways.  They put all of the countries' money into building dazzling      infrastructure of dozens of ports and airports and highway systems and      other--telecom system that's superior to anybody in the world, but the      health-care system and the social systems were falling behind. And they      have to now clean that up.  This country is--they're not going to take      over the world anytime soon.  They're going to be focused on their own      internal problems for a decade.      BRAND:  And yet they'll still have an enormous impact on America and      Americans.  How do you see that happening?  How do you see the average      American being affected by China?      Mr. McGREGOR:  Well, America has to wake up, to be honest with you.  I      mean, Treasury Secretary Snow was here a month ago telling the Chinese      people they want--you should spend more and save less.  That's not what      my mother taught me.  The Chinese are acting like we did in the 1950s.      They're saving their money, they're working hard, they're focusing on      education because they've come from nothing and they're very hungry to      get ahead.  What America needs to learn from China is that we better wake      up.  We are--China is now the fourth pillar of economic growth around the      world.  We've got the US, Europe, Japan and now China, and it's a fact of      life and we have to compete to stay ahead. China's a new challenger and      the only way you take on a challenger is you beat them.  You don't beat      them down.  You beat them in their own game.

Thank you very much for joining us.      Mr. McGREGOR:  Thank you for having me.      BRAND:  Stay with us on DAY TO DAY from NPR News.       MADELEINE BRAND, host:       President Bush and other Pacific Rim leaders met today for the APEC      summit in Busan, South Korea.  Among other things, they urged the      European Union to cut tariffs on imported farm goods and they discussed      measures against bird flu. Tomorrow, President Bush will be in China,      whose leaders he rebuked earlier this week, for not matching the      country's growing economic power with greater democracy.  China is the      third largest trading partner for the United States and its importance is      only expected to grow.  I spoke earlier with      journalist-turned-businessman James McGregor.  He lives and works in      China, and he's the author of the new book \"One Billion Customers:      Lessons From the Front Lines of Doing Business in China. \"       Mr. JAMES McGREGOR (Author, \"One Billion Customers\"):  This place has      nothing to do with communism.  You can't look at China through the eyes      of the Soviet Union or Communist China.  That's kind of stir-fry      Kremlinology.  This country is capitalist down to its bone marrow, and      they are completely commercial in the way they do things.  Yeah, they're      very focused.  It's an authoritarian government, but it's a capitalist      system.       BRAND:  Give us a detail of how it is such an overwhelmingly capitalist      system.       Mr. McGREGOR:  Well, this is a government that has five-year plans from      the old Soviet planning days, but those five-year plans now talk about      `How do we build the world's best fiber-optic industry? '  `How do we      build the world's best silicon chip industry? '  `How do we build more      universities to educate engineers? '       BRAND:  Well, this has all happened very, very quickly, in the last      decade or so.  China has gone from a relatively closed Communist nation      to, as we say, a hypercapitalist one, so what does it feel like to be in      the midst of a country that's changing so quickly?       Mr. McGREGOR:  If you look at China in terms of the United States, things      have happened so fast, you can kind of feel the wind on your face.  I      mean, this is a country that has, in the past 15 years, compared to the      US, gone through the robber baron era of the late 1800s, the financial      speculation of the 1920s, the rural-to-urban migration of the 1930s, the      first car, first college education, first vacation consumer of the 1950s,      and aspects of the social appeal of the 1960s.  What we've gone through      in a hundred years, they've done in 15.       BRAND:  Well, what about its history and its traditions?  It must have      more than just a capitalistic ethic?       Mr. McGREGOR:  Well, I don't know.  If you look at China's history, I      mean, the equivalent of saying, `Merry Christmas' in China--How do you      say, `Happy New Year' for Chinese New Year in Chinese?  It's (Chinese      spoken), or `Congratulations on getting rich. '  So I think these      traditions do go back.  I think one of the--I mean, you have to look at      China really as simultaneously the world's largest start-up and the      world's largest turnaround.  It's a start-up in that in the last 15, 20      years, they're doing everything for the first time and they go as fast as      they can.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      Big news from the world's largest automaker.  General Motors says it's      cutting 30,000 jobs and closing nine of its North American plants in the      next three years.  Bob Moon joins us from the \"Marketplace\" news bureau      in New York.      And, Bob, GM must be facing some big problems.  How much money is it      hoping to save with this plan?      BOB MOON reporting:      Well, General Motors has really been bleeding red ink lately.  So far      this year, it's posted losses totalling almost $5 billion.  This plan is      aimed at reducing its $41 billion in annual operating expenses by around      $7 billion by the end of next year.  Now to reach this goal, it's      planning to close nine North American assembly, stamping and power train      plants in the next couple of years, along with several non-manufacturing      service and parts facilities. That'll bring the biggest round of job cuts      at GM in 14 years.  The job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas      says this morning that this is the biggest single layoff announcement      that the country has seen since back in January of 2003 when Kmart      announced it was cutting 37,000 jobs.  GM's Chief Executive Officer Rick      Wagoner told reporters today he's hoping to soften the blow for the      company's workers.      Mr. RICK WAGONER (CEO, General Motors):  I regret the impact that today's      actions will have on many of our employees and their families and      communities. We will work our hardest to mitigate that impact.  To that      end, given the demographics of our work force, we plan to achieve much of      this reduction via attrition and early retirement programs.      MOON:  Now labor union leaders say that there is really not much that      they can argue with in today's announcement given the dismal sales that      GM has been seeing lately.  The company's US sales were down 26 percent      last month.      BRAND:  Twenty-six percent.  What's caused those big losses?      MOON:  Well, there's a fairly long list of troubles that GM's been      dealing with.  The most immediate one is the company's shrinking market      share.  It peaked at 51 percent way back in 1962.  Well, in the first 10      months of this year, it was all the way down to 26 percent, and the trade      publication Automotive News figures that's the lowest market share that      GM has seen since the early days of the company, back in 1925.  There is      intense competition from Japanese automakers.  Toyota, for example, has      been opening up plants in North America.  It's announced plans to take 15      percent of the world's auto market in the next decade; right now it has      12 percent.  GM's also been battling rising health-care and pension costs      and, of course, commodities costs are way up, as well.      BRAND:  You paint a very troubling picture for GM.  Is this a matter of      the company's survival?      MOON:  Well, GM CEO Rick Wagoner said today he was not prepared to      discuss the company's 2006 profit outlook.  He did say earlier this      month, though, that the company was not in danger of having to declare      bankruptcy.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we're talking to some of the people      in the cities where GM has planned to close these plants to find out how      they might be prepared for these big cutbacks.

General Motors said it      was cutting 30,000 jobs at several plants.  The company expects the move      will cut its costs by some $7 billion by the end of next year, but there      is a human cost as well.  GM's staff at several plants from Portland,      Oregon, to Lansing, Michigan, will lose their jobs.  Beth Holcomb and her      husband Pete have been longtime workers at GM's Oklahoma City plant.  I      spoke with Beth earlier.      Ms. BETH HOLCOMB:  I hired in in February of 1979.  I was hired into the      material department, which means I drive a forklift.  I've unloaded      boxcars and trailers, and that's my job.      BRAND:  And your husband also works there?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  Yes, he works on the line.      BRAND:  And how did you first hear about being laid off?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  When we got to work yesterday morning at 6:30, they told us      we were to shut down the line at 7:00, that we would have a meeting in      the audit area.  And everybody was--thought that they were going to      introduce our new product.  Well, it wasn't that.  It was, `This is it. '      So that's how we were told.      BRAND:  What went through your mind?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  Surreal.  I just can't believe that it was happening.      BRAND:  You had no idea this was coming?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  No.  No.  I knew that General Motors was in trouble, but I      didn't think it would be us.      BRAND:  And they had already announced 25,000 layoffs earlier, and you      didn't think you'd be among them?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  No.  I thought it would be another plant because we have      always produced a quality car and we have a good work force here.  So I      just didn't think it would be us.      BRAND:  What do you have in terms of benefits?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  Right now everything's up in the air, just hearing a lot of      rumors.  From what I'm hearing, that we are still under contract to 2007,      so we will be getting, you know, our unemployment and subpay.  Now      whether they're going to offer early retirement--don't know.  Just kind      of have to wait and see.      BRAND:  Now your husband, I understand, is a member of the UAW, the union      bargaining unit at the plant there?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  Yes, he is.      BRAND:  And so he also had no idea this was coming down?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  This is true.  In fact, we were at the union meeting the      day prior, and the union officials, you know, had the impression that we      were OK, and that's what we were told.  So they were totally caught off      guard, too.      BRAND:  And does the union have any plan to help you, any benefits      package to help you?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  Nothing has come out yet.  This was such short notice that      they haven't had time to get anything together.      BRAND:  And what did you and your husband talk about last night over      dinner?      Ms. HOLCOMB:  What we're going to do.  We're going to sell his Harley.      We need to buckle down.  I'm going to have to start cooking dinner every      night, you know.  All of our little luxuries are gone.      BRAND:  And you'll have to look for other work, I assume.      Ms. HOLCOMB:  I think we'll be OK for a while.  It's just, you know,      everything's up in the air.  It depends on what--when we get our      information packet, what's really going to happen.  Then we'll go from      there.      BRAND:  OK.  Well, Beth Holcomb, thank you very much, and good luck to      you and your husband.      Ms. HOLCOMB:  OK.  Thank you so much.

I'm Ed Gordon.      On Monday, General Motors announced that it will cut 30,000 North      American manufacturing jobs.  GM will also close a dozen factories,      including plants in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.  The closures      highlight a growing trend in American manufacturing.  Companies are      saving billions by outsourcing low-skill jobs or replacing workers with      machines.  Meanwhile, workers who once made a middle-class living are now      being forced to find new ways to compete in the global market.      For more on the changing face of American manufacturing, we're joined by      Bill Fletcher Jr. , president and CEO of TransAfrica Forum.  Mr. Fletcher      formerly served as education director for the AFL-CIO and later as      assistant to that union's president.  He joins us from New York.      And joining us from Philadelphia is Bernard Anderson, professor of      management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.  He is      also former assistant secretary of Labor for the Clinton administration.      Gentlemen, I thank you both for joining us.  Professor Anderson, let me      start with you.  Some critics will suggest that perhaps some of these      jobs are due in part to the management style of General Motors, the      problems they have had over the years, but this is a growing trend in      America, is it not?      Professor BERNARD ANDERSON (University of Pennsylvania Wharton School):      It certainly is.  And first of all, the 30,000 jobs that were announced      by General Motors that should be added to the 20,000 reduction in      employment that was announced by GM last year, so we're talking here      about 50,000 jobs minimum to be eliminated over the next three years.  I      think that to some extent, the discouraging and unfavorable effect of      this is due to management decisions, which show that General Motors      simply is not competitive in world production and distribution of      automobiles.  They missed the market.  This is a management decision.      They were producing products that many people did not want to buy and      certainly wanted to buy far fewer of when the price of gasoline reached      $2. 50 or $3 an hour.      GORDON:  Mr. Fletcher, no one wants to say the sky is falling yet.  We      are seeing what used to be, as we noted earlier, the Mecca for      manufacturing, and that is this country turned out almost everything to a      degree that there was world dominance, and over the decades, we have seen      that shift and change, yet we haven't seen America change with that      shift.  What's the problem?      Mr. BILL FLETCHER Jr. (TransAfrica Forum):  Well, I think that part of      what's happening is that manufacturing is actually bifurcated in this      country, so you have a high-end, very skilled component of the      manufacturing work force, and then you have an increase of low-skilled      manufacturing jobs, so it's not that manufacturing is disappearing, but      the unionized, semiskilled work that once was central to the development      of a middle class in this country is being destroyed, and with it, we are      seeing the hollowing of many cities and the elimination of the      opportunity for people to have stable jobs where they can buy a home,      send their children to college.  Instead, people are working two,      three--many jobs.      Prof. ANDERSON:  Well. . .      GORDON:  So, Professor, taking what--and pick up on Mr. Fletcher's point.      Prof. ANDERSON:  Yes.      GORDON:  But taking that, what we've seen, as his suggestion is, is the      manufacturing moving to high-end, like computer chips and the like, and      what we knew before--the automobile industry, steel factories and the      like--being displaced and disproportionately displacing a whole lot of      African-American workers.      Prof. ANDERSON:  Yes.  Ed, welcome to the world of globalization.  What's      happening here is that as a result of the development of fiber-optic      communications technology, many middle-income jobs are being outsourced      to other countries.  As a result of our trade policy, NAFTA in      particular, there is strong encouragement for domestic manufacturers to      operate offshore.  What this is doing is eliminating the middle steps of      the ladder of upward mobility for non-professional working families.      We're eliminating those jobs that pay on average between maybe 800 and a      thousand dollars per week.  And these are jobs that typically paid good      benefits.  Fifty-three percent of American workers now have no pension      coverage; 46 million, no health insurance; 37 million, no prescription      drug coverage.  The average Social Security payment is $900 per month.      One of the major factors associated with this decline is, in my view, the      decline in unionization, which eliminates the major source of wage growth      for middle-wage production workers.  If you look at the relationship      between the increase in productivity in the American economy and the      increase in compensation, what you find is that beginning around the      1980s, there was a widening gap between productivity and compensation.      Well, in economic terms, under the basic economic principles, the two      should go hand in hand, but that is not what's happening.  What is the      impact on the black community?  It is eliminating production jobs that      were the bedrock of the black non-professional middle class.  These were      the jobs that provided income for black families to send their kids to      college.  Many of the kids who went to college, many of them going to      state universities, were the first in their family ever to graduate from      college or even from high school.  That whole slice of jobs available to      non-professional African-American families is being eliminated in this      country as a result of globalization.      GORDON:  So, Bill Fletcher, what do we tell those people and coming      generations that would have taken that same route, that same track,      people in Chicago and Cleveland and Detroit, as the professor said, who      made solidly middle-class lives for themselves and bettered their      children's future--with these jobs gone and nothing to replace them, are      we really looking at a city that will, in fact, decay and a group, a      generation, that will evaporate?      Mr. FLETCHER:  I think in order to answer that, I have to just qualify      one thing that the professor said, which is just so that there's not a      misunderstanding, when people talk about globalization, very often--and      I'm not saying that this is what the professor's saying--the assumption      is that this means jobs are simply moving overseas or something, and what      it's very important for the listener to understand is that many of the      manufacturing jobs that were once upon a time in our major cities are      being moved not overseas, but they're being moved into rural parts of the      United States.  It's a calculated move.  There's a historical basis of      this in what happened in the textile industry in the early part of the      20th century.  And it relates very much to what the professor was saying      earlier about management decisions in terms of issues and profits.      One of the things that I think is so critical for us to keep in mind is      that because these are decisions made by human beings, that human beings      can begin to make other decisions, particularly political decisions, when      it comes to issues of economic development.  So instead of having      governments that are emphasizing the building of racetracks and baseball      stadiums, we need to have economic development planning for our municipal      areas where we're thinking about the development and production of      high-end employment.  Other than that, what we're going to have is the      continued growth of low-end work.      GORDON:  Professor, let me ask you this.  Even if you account for state      vs. state, the South having perhaps more relaxed regulations or out West      in Los Angeles, where many undocumented workers take many of these jobs      from those who might have taken them in the past, you still find it      hard--companies being `you'--find it hard to compete on the global market      by virtue of the sheer wage that can be paid overseas.      Prof. ANDERSON:  Absolutely, and I think, at the end of the day, it comes      down to wage and profit competitiveness.  That's what it comes down to.      Take the automobile manufacturing industry.  For some years now, going      back at least two decades, automobile manufacturers domestic were moving      their plants increasingly to the South.  But--and here is the      globalization angle--foreign companies that produce automobiles moved      into the United States and where did they locate?  They located in the      South, in South Carolina, in Tennessee, in Mississippi, in Alabama.  They      are seeking the lowest-price, lowest-cost areas in which to operate.      They get tremendous tax advantages from the states in which they locate,      but they also avoid unionization.  I don't believe there is an automobile      manufacturing plant located in the South that is currently unionized.      Well, when they're not unionized, what does that mean?  That means they      don't pay the higher wages.  They don't pay the benefits.  They don't      have the pension obligations.  And so, yes, there's a rush to the bottom      in minimizing the cost of production.  Much of that, as was indicated,      depends on management decisions, but (technical difficulties) management      decisions. . .      GORDON:  Yes.      Prof. ANDERSON:  . . . in an effort to compete in a global economy.      GORDON:  Bill Fletcher, with less than a minute to go, quickly for me,      are you optimistic about what we have known for years as the black middle      class, that eventually they will be able to shore up and find ways to      fill the void that now exists?      Mr. FLETCHER:  I'm not optimistic about any middle class unless we      increase the rate of unionization and unless we change the political      priorities of this country.  I think that what we will see is exactly      what the professor was indicating, a continued race to the bottom,      declining living standards and increased polarization of wealth.  And      when you have that in any society, what you have is a recipe for mass      social instability.      GORDON:  All right.  Bill Fletcher is president and CEO of TransAfrica      Forum. He formerly served as education director for the AFL-CIO.  And      Bernard Anderson is professor of management at the University of      Pennsylvania's Wharton School and former assistant secretary of Labor      under the Clinton administration.  I thank you both for joining us.      Mr. FLETCHER:  Thank you.      Prof. ANDERSON:  Thank you.       ED GORDON, host:       From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES.  I'm Ed Gordon.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      New unemployment claims were up sharply last week according to the Labor      Department today.  It's the latest sign that the job market has not yet      recovered from the Gulf Coast hurricanes.  Bob Moon joins us with more      from the \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.      And, Bob, what are the latest figures, and should we worry?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, it's certainly not good news.  This      takes the number of unemployment claims back up to their highest point      since the middle of last month, and it happens just when it appeared that      things were finally stabilizing a bit.  In fact, in the previous week,      new filings had actually registered a sizable decline, but this past      week, the number of new applications for unemployment insurance was up by      a seasonally adjusted 30,000 jobs.  Now the consensus among leading      economists had been a total around 312,000.  This takes the number of      claims up to 335,000.      BRAND:  And so what does this tell us about the state of the economy, in      general, and, in particular, could this affect the Fed's policy of      raising interest rates?      MOON:  Yeah, a good question.  I guess you could say it depends a lot on      which economist you talk to and on which street corner they're watching      from.  The private business research group The Conference Board takes a      look at help wanted ad volume across the country, and it's finding that      the level is pretty much stagnant in the past month.  And that group's      economists are saying that this is a slower hiring pace; it suggests that      job growth could stay soft for several months to come.  The fear there is      that that could cause the economy to stall out perhaps, and that could      set up something of a self-fulfilling prophecy here.      You know, just yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its      latest monetary policy meeting, which brought another interest rate      increase earlier this month, and the Fed policy-makers have been trying      to balance their effort to keep inflation in check with the worry that      interest rates could put the brakes on the economic recovery.  Well, now      at their meeting this month, it turns out that their discussion did touch      on their belief that the hurricanes had only temporarily depressed      unemployment and, therefore, they should go ahead and raise interest      rates again.  Well, that view could change now and this could even      convince them to ease up on the higher interest rates.      BRAND:  Well, any good news out there to--something give thanks for      heading into this holiday weekend?      MOON:  Well, there is one bit of good economic news out there today from      the University of Michigan, which delivers a subscription-only report on      consumer sentiment.  And sources who have seen that report tell Reuters      that it shows consumer sentiment actually rose this month, and that the      increase was actually better than most analysts had been fearing.  It      rose from an 81. 6 percent level to 74. 2 percent in late October, and      analysts had been expecting a rise to around 80 percent, so it's slightly      above that.      Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we'll be taking a look at what makes      a successful airline.

This      takes the number of unemployment claims back up to their highest point      since the middle of last month, and it happens just when it appeared that      things were finally stabilizing a bit.  In fact, in the previous week,      new filings had actually registered a sizable decline, but this past      week, the number of new applications for unemployment insurance was up by      a seasonally adjusted 30,000 jobs.  Now the consensus among leading      economists had been a total around 312,000.  This takes the number of      claims up to 335,000.       BRAND:  And so what does this tell us about the state of the economy, in      general, and, in particular, could this affect the Fed's policy of      raising interest rates?       MOON:  Yeah, a good question.  I guess you could say it depends a lot on      which economist you talk to and on which street corner they're watching      from.  The private business research group The Conference Board takes a      look at help wanted ad volume across the country, and it's finding that      the level is pretty much stagnant in the past month.  And that group's      economists are saying that this is a slower hiring pace; it suggests that      job growth could stay soft for several months to come.  The fear there is      that that could cause the economy to stall out perhaps, and that could      set up something of a self-fulfilling prophecy here.       You know, just yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its      latest monetary policy meeting, which brought another interest rate      increase earlier this month, and the Fed policy-makers have been trying      to balance their effort to keep inflation in check with the worry that      interest rates could put the brakes on the economic recovery.  Well, now      at their meeting this month, it turns out that their discussion did touch      on their belief that the hurricanes had only temporarily depressed      unemployment and, therefore, they should go ahead and raise interest      rates again.  Well, that view could change now and this could even      convince them to ease up on the higher interest rates.       BRAND:  Well, any good news out there to--something give thanks for      heading into this holiday weekend?       MOON:  Well, there is one bit of good economic news out there today from      the University of Michigan, which delivers a subscription-only report on      consumer sentiment.  And sources who have seen that report tell Reuters      that it shows consumer sentiment actually rose this month, and that the      increase was actually better than most analysts had been fearing.  It      rose from an 81. 6 percent level to 74. 2 percent in late October, and      analysts had been expecting a rise to around 80 percent, so it's slightly      above that.       Today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom, we'll be taking a look at what makes      a successful airline.       BRAND:  Bob Moon of public radio's daily business show \"Marketplace. \"      And \"Marketplace\" is produced by American Public Media.

I'm Michele Norris.      There are signs the hot real estate market may be starting to cool.      Across the country, homes are taking longer to sell and prices are not      rising as fast.  Take the Boston area, where homes had been appreciating      at a faster rate than average.  That's where we find Fred Thys of member      station WBUR.      FRED THYS reporting:      The Massachusetts Association of Realtors reports that the median price      of a single-family home in the Boston area grew by 4 1/2 percent from the      third quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of this year, from $493,000      last year to $515,000 this year.  Healthy growth, but the days of      double-digit price increases from year to year appear to be over.  And      some prime real estate has hit the doldrums.      Ms. LISA DRAPKIN (Realtor):  Two bedrooms, one of which is used as the      master, which has access to an amazing deck.      THYS:  Realtor Lisa Drapkin is selling a house on a quiet dead-end street      in the wealthy Boston suburb of Cambridge, just a block away from the      park along the Charles River.  At the moment the river view is blocked by      an abandoned garden center, but that's about to change.      Ms. DRAPKIN:  The proposal is--that's been approved is that they're going      to be taking down all the buildings.  So this property, which right now      is blocked by the view of Mahoney's, which isn't particularly attractive,      is going to have an amazing city view and it's. . .      THYS:  Yet this house has been on the market for five months.      Ms. DRAPKIN:  Well, we first came on July 6th, right after the July 4th      weekend, obviously, and we came on at 539.  The market was pretty brisk      over the summer.      THYS:  But the house wasn't selling and, after four weeks, Drapkin and      her clients lowered the price.      Ms. DRAPKIN:  Again, lots of showings but not much in the way of offers.      And then around--we figured we'd stick out the end of August because      generally there's a real surge in the fall market.  And after Labor Day,      unfortunately, not much happened.      THYS:  Last month they brought the price down again to 499,000.  If      houses in Cambridge continue to go at the rate they've been selling at      for the past year, it would take six months to sell all those on the      market right now. Drapkin says when there's a four-month inventory, it      becomes a buyer's market. The trend in Boston reflects a nationwide      tendency.  Jay Brinkmann is a financial economist with the Mortgage      Bankers Association.      Mr. JAY BRINKMANN (Mortgage Bankers Association):  We see that the market      has probably peaked.  For the last approximately two months, applications      for mortgages to purchase homes are down from the levels that we saw this      time last year.      THYS:  In another wealthy suburb of Boston, Brookline, Realtor Mary      Gillach is selling a condo with period details and high ceilings.      Ms. MARY GILLACH (Realtor):  Tons of closet space, which you don't get in      Brookline a whole lot.  You know, so normally this kind of place where      there's parking would sell in a heartbeat.      THYS:  Instead, it's been on the market since April.  It started at      $469,000. The price has dropped consistently since to 399,000, a little      bit less than what the owners paid three years ago.  Gillach says she's      seeing a lot more properties on the market than last year.      Ms. GILLACH:  I'd say two to three times the inventory at least.      THYS:  Gillach says all the talk about a housing bubble over the last six      months has made homeowners nervous.      Ms. GILLACH:  And so I think you see a lot of sellers who don't really      need to sell testing the market to say, `Hey, you know, maybe I should      get out right now. '  They're not necessarily realistic about their price      'cause they don't have to sell.  That's the one extreme with what's going      on with some sellers. And then you've got a fair number of buyers saying,      `Hey, it might even get better, so maybe I ought to hang out. '      THYS:  Across the country, homes are staying on the market longer.  The      inventory of existing homes has grown from three and a half months to      five months, and there are a record number of new homes on the market.  A      spokesman for the National Association of Realtors says the days of      multiple bids on a home are probably over.  For NPR News, I'm Fred Thys      in Boston.

Builders of new homes are seeing that on      the ground. Inventories of new homes are up 20 percent above this time      last year and contractors are starting to pull back on new construction.      But as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, most don't think the sky is falling.      CHRIS ARNOLD reporting:      At a sprawling subdivision in Northbridge, Massachusetts, workers nail      vinyl siding on to one new house and use an earthmover to pile dirt up      around the foundation of another.  These three- and four-bedroom homes      are selling for around half a million dollars.      (Soundbite of earthmover)      ARNOLD:  Northbridge is an hour west of Boston.  In recent years, some      700 new homes have been built here, with nearly 600 more in various      stages of planning and permitting.  But in just the past few months,      sales have been slowing down sharply.      Mr. BRUCE TAYLOR (Developer and Home Builder):  Last year at this time,      we were probably selling two or three times as many houses in this      marketplace.      ARNOLD:  Bruce Taylor is the president of a major realty office in town      and he's also a developer and a home builder.  He says over the past few      years, people were tripping over themselves to buy homes like this.  Now      with interest rates inching higher, there aren't as many buyers.      Meanwhile, the inventory of new homes has been building.      Mr. TAYLOR:  In the last three months, there have only been three or four      new homes that have gone under agreement and that compares to 45 new      homes that are available in this town right now for sale.      ARNOLD:  At that rate, most of these new homes would be standing empty      for two years.  But Taylor expects things will pick up in the spring.  He      thinks mostly what's happening is the housing market is shifting gears      from overheated back to just a regular market where things slow down in      the winter. So he doesn't see any signs of a housing bubble that's about      to burst.      Mr. TAYLOR:  I don't think there's any major correction to be had at all,      not at all.  The economy's very strong.  Interest rates are up over the      last six months.  But you know what?  They're better than they've been in      the last 30 years.  So interest rates are terrific.      ARNOLD:  That's a feeling that echoed by executives at some very large      home building companies, as well.  Richard Dugas is the CEO of Pulte      Homes, a national home builder with projected revenues of $14. 5 billion      this year.      Mr. RICHARD DUGAS (CEO, Pulte Homes):  I think what you could      characterize the market as today is becoming more normalized as opposed      to the euphoria that we were seeing for the last two or three years.  And      as we look at the markets across the country, clearly the rate of price      appreciation has slowed.      ARNOLD:  But Dugas says he does not consider the housing market to be      soft right now.  Nationally, home building and home sales remain at      near-record levels.  Dugas says the market is healthy and will stay so as      long as interest rates don't rise too fast and the overall economy      remains solid.      Mr. DUGAS:  You know, it doesn't have to be white-hot in order to be      healthy. I think moderate rate increases from here combined with good job      growth, you know, mean another good year in 2006.      ARNOLD:  But Dugas says Pulte is pulling back slightly from its previous      rate of building new homes.  So are other home builders, and many      economists say that's a good thing.  Mark Zandi is chief economist with      Moody'sEconomy. com.      Mr. MARK ZANDI (Chief Economist, Moody'sEconomy. com):  It's absolutely      necessary.  I mean, we're putting up too many homes.  Underlying demand      for new homes is at best two million units per year, and we're putting up      homes at a rate that's well above that.  At least we have been for the      past year.  So if this rate of construction continues, then we will see      real signs of overbuilding in many parts of the country.      ARNOLD:  Zandi is decidedly less rosy than many home builders in the      language he uses to describe the current housing market.      Mr. ZANDI:  You know, housing is at the mountaintop.  All roads lead      down; it's just a question of how steeply.      ARNOLD:  Some economists for years now have been warning of a housing      bubble that's going to crash Hindenburg style, but like the home      builders, Zandi does not think that's going to happen.      Mr. ZANDI:  We'll see some markets, some parts of the country where we'll      see price declines, but I think in most cases, they'll be very modest.      ARNOLD:  But economists say the cooling housing market will mean fewer      jobs. Zandi says over the past three years, a full third of new      employment has been directly related to housing.  So any slowdown will be      felt by thousands of construction workers, plumbers, realtors and others      across the country.  At the work site outside Boston, home builder Bruce      Taylor says he's already seeing an impact.      Mr. TAYLOR:  The amount of work available in the marketplace has slowed      down considerably.  There are tradesmen today who are looking for work      who six months or a year ago had their dance card completely full and      they were booked up months and months in advance.  Some of the people      that I know have actually sent crews down to the Gulf states to help in      the reconstruction boom that's going on down in Louisiana and the other      communities there.      ARNOLD:  Stock analysts who track big home building companies say they're      looking at two main things:  employment and interest rates.  If rates      rise too fast or if the economy starts losing too many jobs, that could      really sink the housing market.  Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Last week, it was GM.  Today, it is the pharmaceutical company Merck      planning to shrink.  Joining us is John Dimsdale from \"Marketplace\" in      Washington.      John, what is the announcement, the numbers from Merck today?      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Seven thousand jobs they're cutting back.  This is a pretty big      downsizing; 11 percent of their worldwide work force.  Half of the cuts      will be in the United States.  The company will be closing five of its 31      factories, although the location of those shutdowns has yet to be      announced.  But you know, all this cutting back, Alex, is designed to      save the company $4 billion over the next four years.      CHADWICK:  Well, that's a lot of money, but why this great need now to      save that kind of money?  What is happening with them?      DIMSDALE:  Well, Merck is facing two big problems.  One has been in the      headlines; that's the loss of its Vioxx painkiller.  Merck poured a lot      of money into researching and marketing Vioxx, but it was found to be      unsafe and had to be pulled from the market last year.  So now instead of      being an income-producer, Merck is facing billions of dollars in      potential liability from Vioxx from more than 6,000 lawsuits.  The third      Vioxx trial against Merck begins tomorrow.  So far, the company has won      one of those and lost one.      The other problem is patents are expiring at several of Merck's      big-sellers, like the cholesterol-fighting drug Zocor; also for medicines      to fight osteoporosis and another one for hair loss, all next year.  But      losing patents on big-selling drugs isn't unique to Merck, according to      Gustav Ando, a pharmaceutical industry analyst with Global Insight.      Mr. GUSTAV ANDO (Global Insight):  This is something that the whole      industry faces in terms of patent expiration.  It's a big problem for the      industry, and you have HMOs everywhere trying to cut costs in whatever      way they can.  So as soon as a generic is available on the market,      they'll jump at the chance for that.      CHADWICK:  Well, John, what is the outlook for Merck now?  Does it have      any big, new drugs coming and that we're about to find out about?      DIMSDALE:  Apparently so.  One example is a cervical cancer vaccine that      could be on the market next year, and it shows a lot of potential.  But      you know, Merck's stock price has been dropping for a while now, and that      continued today, so the markets are clearly underwhelmed by Merck's      prospects.  Analysts say that, you know, the big pharmaceutical companies      may have become too big. A and with all these expiring patents, companies      like Merck and Pfizer have too much factory capacity; they're losing      business to leaner, smaller competitors.  So that's why Merck is looking      now to streamline its manufacturing process.  Of course, that causes many      in the West to fear that that's going to mean outsourcing factory jobs to      China and Asia.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" state and local governments in      this country are crunching new numbers on public employee health-care      obligations, and the taxpayers aren't going to be happy with the results.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      The latest government measure of the economy is out today.  It shows      healthy growth in the third quarter, thanks to a lot of spending by      consumers and robust investments by business.  The report from the      Commerce Department also indicates housing construction grew sharply and      inflation slowed a bit. Joining us to discuss all this, what sounds like,      very good economic news to me:  John Dimsdale from the \"Marketplace\"      Washington bureau.      Everyone must be happy, John.      JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:      Absolutely.  It's better than all the predictions.  Gross Domestic      Product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the US,      grew 4. 3 percent between July through September.  That's the best in a      year and a half, and it's happening despite the hit from this fall's      hurricanes.  Inflation, which has been running a bit hot recently,      moderated from 1. 7 percent in the previous quarter to 1. 2 percent.  Now      you combine all that with strong consumer confidence, the housing growth,      and you have to conclude that, you know, the economy has really hit a      sweet spot here.  November's employment report, which is going to be out      on Friday, should be pretty good.      CHADWICK:  Well, two things:  First, what explains all these good reports      about the economy?  And somehow whenever you have this kind of wave of      good economic news, it always seems the market goes down for some reason.      I don't get it.      DIMSDALE:  Well, the disruptions from the hurricanes weren't as bad as      expected, for one thing.  Sure, they threw a lot of people out of jobs.      They messed up energy supplies and hurt some other trade.  But maybe the      repairs and the rebuilding and recovery created opportunities that have      compensated for all of that.  And as you mentioned, you know, there are      always the folks who see this from `the glass is half empty' side, and      they say this economic activity is pretty flimsy.  The GDP statistics are      really only measuring consumption, which is being held up not by      factories and good jobs and productivity but by debt:  household debt,      government debt, trade debt--all financed in large part by foreign      countries.  And these folks that all the good news is really pretty bad      and is just compounding the imbalances in the world economy.      CHADWICK:  John, that glass isn't half empty.  It's practically      overflowing. What is it that skeptics are looking at here?  What do they      think could happen?      DIMSDALE:  Well, they think that, you know, with all this debt, Americans      will start spending less as their debts come due.  Foreign investors will      lose confidence in the US and take their profits elsewhere.  The US would      have to raise interest rates to try to keep that foreign investment here;      that means companies wouldn't be able to afford to expand, families can't      buy new houses. The result is fewer jobs and less economic growth.  And      that may explain why gold--the price of gold yesterday hit $500 an      ounce. . .      CHADWICK:  Wow.      DIMSDALE:  . . . which is an 18-year high.  So, you know, that's the refuge      for investors who are getting cold feet about the economy.      Coming up later today on \"Marketplace,\" we're looking at a new study of      travel by White House officials that's paid for by federal contractors,      lobbyists and other non-governmental organizations.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      The economy appears to have snapped out of its doldrums that followed      Hurricane Katrina.  The Labor Department reports employers hired an extra      215,000 workers during the month of November.  That keeps the nation's      unemployment rate at 5 percent.  The news, on top of other good economic      indicators this week, was very welcomed for President Bush.  Joining us      is John Dimsdale in \"Marketplace's\" Washington bureau.      John, the president made comments about the economy today.      JOHN DIMSDALE (\"Marketplace\"):  Yeah, he called reporters into the White      House Rose Garden soon after that jobs report was issued just to let them      know that he thinks the economy's in very good shape, despite all the      hurricanes, the high oil prices.  Bush said there's every reason to be      optimistic about the economic future.      President GEORGE W. BUSH:  I mean, when you think about the news that's      come in, the jobs report, the recent report on strong economic growth,      low inflation, strong productivity, lower gasoline prices, a strong      housing market, increases in consumer confidence and business investment,      our economic horizon is as bright as it's been in a long time.      CHADWICK:  John, are the numbers really that good, or is this something      that always happens in November for pre-holiday hiring?      DIMSDALE:  Well, anything above 200,000 new jobs, even in November, is      considered strong.  There are some economists who say they were expecting      more, given the other signs that the economy's pulling out of a recession      and from these storms.  David Malpass, the chief economist at Bear      Stearns, is not one of those.  He says today's jobs numbers were pretty      good when you remember where we've come from.      Mr. DAVID MALPASS (Chief Economist, Bear Stearns):  Some people are      saying that this is weak job growth because in past cycles we had more      job gains. But the problem with that is that this recession was shallow      and the unemployment rates stayed pretty low in 2001 in the recession.      And so you can't expect quite as robust a new job gains because you      really started the expansion at a pretty good level.      CHADWICK:  John, one other thing:  The outgoing chair of the Federal      Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, has also been talking about the economy      today, about the future, and it doesn't look quite so good to him.      DIMSDALE:  That's right.  He gave two speeches.  One is the familiar      warning that Washington needs to rein in its spending.  He said the      government has made more promises to retirees in terms of Social Security      and health care than it can keep.  And, secondly, he said the US trade      deficit with Asian countries is potentially a serious threat to the      economy because it's paid for with money borrowed from foreign investors.      He said he'd be much more comfortable if US debts and deficits were      funded domestically.

The Labor      Department reports that 215,000 jobs were created in November.  As NPR's      Frank Langfitt reports, economists attribute the jump to the overall      health of the US economy and the beginning of recovery on the Gulf Coast.      FRANK LANGFITT reporting:      In September and October, national employment growth was lousy, averaging      just 30,000 jobs.  But strong numbers last month suggest that Hurricanes      Katrina and Rita didn't do any lasting damage to the country's labor      market.  Stuart Hoffman is chief economist at PNC Financial Services in      Pittsburgh.      Mr. STUART HOFFMAN (Chief Economist, PNC Financial Services):  November      shows there's some rebound specifically in those hurricane-disrupted      regions.  And in the rest of the country, they're actually back on track      with job growth, especially now that gasoline prices have retreated to      levels actually well below where they were when Katrina first hit.      LANGFITT:  Speaking from the Rose Garden, President Bush pointed to      unemployment figures from today's report as a sign of a strong economy.      President GEORGE W. BUSH:  The unemployment rate is 5 percent, and that's      lower than the average for the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.      LANGFITT:  Some of last month's biggest employment gains came in      construction, where cleanup along the Gulf Coast helped produce 37,000      new jobs.  Even manufacturing, one of the labor market's weakest sectors,      grew by 11,000 jobs; that's the second increase in two months.  Stuart      Hoffman of PNC Financial says that may be partly driven by demand for      cement, plywood and other construction materials along the Gulf Coast.      Mr. HOFFMAN:  It does appear that manufacturing orders were doing better,      but some of that was probably related to the need to rebuild in the      Southeast and maybe not a sustained upturn.      LANGFITT:  Other economists say the recent rise in manufacturing masks a      fundamental trend in the job market.  John Silvia, chief economist at      Wachovia, says the report shows how American jobs have shifted from      manufacturing to the service sector.  For instance, unemployment for      production workers was 6. 3 percent last month, three times what it was      for professionals.      Mr. JOHN SILVIA (Chief Economist, Wachovia):  I think the unemployment      rate disparities between productional workers and management professional      workers is absolutely the key.  Listen, the issue is structural      unemployment; it isn't the business cycle.  We've got good economic      growth.  It's just that these jobs are not going to come along with that      growth.      LANGFITT:  Despite the uptick in the last couple of months, Silvia says      manufacturing employment will continue to struggle because companies have      so many choices in what is now a worldwide labor market.      Mr. SILVIA:  There is a reallocation of jobs around the globe, and it's      not simply taking US jobs and moving them abroad.  It's simply that as a      company looks to create new jobs, they're going to look at the US as just      one other place to put those jobs.  And unfortunately, what's happened is      we expect that these manufacturing jobs are suddenly going to reappear as      the economic cycle matures, and that simply hasn't happened for three      years.      LANGFITT:  The November job report also showed growth in other sectors,      including finance, health care and food services.  Frank Langfitt, NPR      News, Washington.

Most states report that they're      enjoying big gains in tax receipts this year, and for state governments,      that is a welcome change from a couple of years ago.  NPR's Scott Horsley      reports.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      New Mexico's state government found itself with so much money this fall,      it decided to give some back.  Every taxpayer in New Mexico received a      one-time refund check last month.  Finance Secretary James Jimenez says      the state's coffers are still full enough to cut tax rates going forward.      Secretary JAMES JIMENEZ (State Finance Department, New Mexico):  Our      underlying economy is strong.  The oil and gas prices are helping.  We      are a major producer of oil and gas, so that helps.      HORSLEY:  Even states that are not enjoying a windfall of oil and gas      royalties, like New Mexico, have seen big gains in income and sales tax      revenues.  North Carolina, for example, collected 11 percent more in      taxes this past year.  The governor's fiscal adviser, Dan Gerlach, hopes      that will help the state regain the AAA credit rating from Moody's that      it lost during the downturn.      Mr. DAN GERLACH (Fiscal Adviser, North Carolina):  We are putting money      back into our rainy day fund.  We have restored the health of our balance      sheet in large part.  So we think we have taken a lot of steps to improve      our situation because we met the challenges head on.      HORSLEY:  Tax receipts are climbing sharply in virtually every state,      except for those hit hardest by this year's hurricanes and Michigan,      where the auto industry is struggling.  Scott Pattison, of the National      Association of State Budget Officers, says even with more money coming      in, though, states still have some financial challenges left over from      the early years of the decade.      Mr. SCOTT PATTISON (National Association of State Budget Officers):      States are like the fellow who's been laid off who had to put less money      into savings, may not have been able to put money in his pension and in      the college fund for the kids, so there's some catch-up that states are      going to have to be doing.      HORSLEY:  And while revenues are increasing, Pattison says, states also      face mounting expenses.      Mr. PATTISON:  One of the biggest spending pressures for states continues      to be health care, particularly Medicaid.  Those costs have really been      rising.      HORSLEY:  Still, the budget picture is far better than it was in 2002 and      2003.  Even after cutting tax rates and sending residents a rebate, New      Mexico expects to have more than $600 million in new revenue next year.      Finance Secretary Jimenez says the governor's warning lawmakers not to      spend that money all at once.      Sec. JIMENEZ:  Well, there's an expectation when you have a large amount      of money to work with that you can meet everybody's needs and, of course,      that simply isn't the case.      HORSLEY:  Much of the new money flowing to states is from taxes on      capital gains and corporate profits, which are notoriously volatile.      Nicholas Jenny, who tracks state revenue for the Rockefeller Institute of      Government, says states can count on that money only so long as the      economy maintains its rapid growth.      Mr. NICHOLAS JENNY (Rockefeller Institute of Government):  The real      danger, of course, is that if the economy does slow down, that hits      states, you know, very hard.  It certainly did last time.      HORSLEY:  So far, many states are being cautious about committing the      newfound money to ongoing programs or passing permanent tax cuts that      could haunt them when fortunes change.  North Carolina's Gerlach notes      it's often when the economy is in a downturn that citizens need help from      their government the most.      Mr. GERLACH:  Remembering the times that were tough is going to be      important for state policy-makers not to get carried away as things get a      little bit better.      HORSLEY:  Scott Pattison of the Budget Officers group adds, states would      be wise to celebrate their improving revenues with cheap supermarket wine      rather than expensive Champagne.

During the      third quarter, the economy expanded at a robust 4. 3 percent annual rate.      There are new jobs; even the price of gasoline is down.  And all of that      happened as the economy faced lots of adversity.  NPR's Jack Speer      examines the current state of the nation's economy and where experts      think it's heading.      JACK SPEER reporting:      Consider that the US economy has weathered a run-up in energy prices and      two devastating hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast this year, and yet      through all of that, it has continued to grow.  And one area where you      can see that clearly is in trucking.      Mr. CHRIS LOFGREN (President, Schneider National):  Our equipment is      moving throughout all of North America.  We have about--roughly 12,500      tractors in our fleet.      SPEER:  Chris Lofgren is president of Schneider National, one of the      nation's largest trucking companies.  Around 70 percent of all goods      travel by truck, and as a result, he says economists often look at his      industry as a good gauge for the broader economy.      Mr. LOFGREN:  We're seeing some growth.  It isn't skyrocketing by any      means, but we're seeing year-over-year growth.  And I think those kinds      of numbers are indicative of the moderate and steady and stable growth      that I think we are seeing in the economy.      SPEER:  And steady and stable also seems to be a pretty good way to      describe the economy at the moment.  Mark Zandi is with Moody's      Economy. com.  Like many economists, he keeps an eye on trucking, but he      has some even more microlevel indicators he likes.      Mr. MARK ZANDI (Economy. com):  My favorite is how much titanium dioxide's      being produced.  That's the chemical that goes into producing white paint      which goes on cars and appliances and machine tools.  If we're producing      a lot of titanium dioxide, we're doing well.      SPEER:  And Zandi says at a time there's plenty of white paint being      produced, corporate balance sheets these days are awash in another color,      black, something he says is also positive for the economy moving forward.      Mr. ZANDI:  A principal area of strength is a surging corporate      profitability. Businesses are just rolling in cash.  And there are      exceptions; the airlines, domestic auto manufacturers, some manufacturers      that compete head-on with China.  But outside of that, businesses are in      great financial shape.  They have all the wherewithal they need to      expand, and they're doing it.      SPEER:  Those stronger balance sheets come at a time many companies are      starting to add workers.  Nariman Behravesh is chief economist at Global      Insight.  He says the economy's underlying strength has been bolstered by      sound policy from the Federal Reserve.  Together that has blunted the      effect of higher energy prices.      Mr. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH (Global Insight):  There are a couple of things      going on here.  One is the--at this particular period in time, the US      economy appears to be extremely resilient and able to sort of shrug off a      lot of shocks.  The other is, at least going into 2005, even into the      middle of 2005, you know, interest rates weren't that high yet.      SPEER:  That started to change as the Fed has steadily raised interest      rates, something which has had an effect on the housing market and has      boosted borrowing costs for millions of people.  Most economists aren't      expecting the economy to fall into recession anytime soon, but Behravesh      says higher interest rates and a cold winter could make consumers feel      more pinched.      Mr. BEHRAVESH:  A lot of people are worried.  They're worried about the      high energy prices, which they were seeing every time the went to the gas      pump, and they'll probably continue to worry as they see the winter home      heating bills, as well.  And so in that sense, you know, while they're      absorbing these higher costs, they're also worried about them.  So you      see this disconnect between how they feel about their own finances and      how they sort of view the bigger economy.      SPEER:  Still, most signs point to solid economic growth in the months      ahead. White House economists say they expect for the year the economy      will grow at a respectable 3 1/2 percent annual rate.  Growth is expected      to be only slightly below that next year.  Those are pretty good numbers      no matter whose economic indicators you favor.  Jack Speer, NPR News,      Washington.

SPEER:  That started to change as the Fed has steadily raised interest      rates, something which has had an effect on the housing market and has      boosted borrowing costs for millions of people.  Most economists aren't      expecting the economy to fall into recession anytime soon, but Behravesh      says higher interest rates and a cold winter could make consumers feel      more pinched.       Mr. BEHRAVESH:  A lot of people are worried.  They're worried about the      high energy prices, which they were seeing every time the went to the gas      pump, and they'll probably continue to worry as they see the winter home      heating bills, as well.  And so in that sense, you know, while they're      absorbing these higher costs, they're also worried about them.  So you      see this disconnect between how they feel about their own finances and      how they sort of view the bigger economy.       SPEER:  Still, most signs point to solid economic growth in the months      ahead. White House economists say they expect for the year the economy      will grow at a respectable 3 1/2 percent annual rate.  Growth is expected      to be only slightly below that next year.  Those are pretty good numbers      no matter whose economic indicators you favor.  Jack Speer, NPR News,      Washington. ", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2005 NPR.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      It's going to cost all of us more to stay warm this winter, possibly a      lot more.  The government is warning that the cost of heating our homes      will jump the most it has in five years.  Bob Moon joins us from the      \"Marketplace\" news bureau in New York.      And, Bob, how much more expensive will heating bills be?      BOB MOON (\"Marketplace\"):  Well, Madeleine, I guess it depends; do you      want the bad news or the not-quite-so-bad news here?      BRAND:  I'll take the bad news.      MOON:  OK, well, this could be a lot worse.  Just a month ago the Energy      Department was figuring it would be even worse.  The analysts there have      now adjusted their forecast down a bit.  They say on average homeowners      across the country can expect around a 26 percent increase in the cost of      heating a home which, as we mentioned, is still going to be the largest      jump since the winter of 2000-2001.  But it is a couple of percentage      points lower than the higher heating costs that they were forecasting      just a month ago.  They say that's thanks to a relatively milder fall,      and that led to lower-than-expected demand for energy.      But this could all change, of course, right along with the weather.      There's a fresh report out today from the Energy Department on petroleum      supplies that shows the country's inventories of heating oil rose in the      past week.  On the other hand, that doesn't reflect the likely drain on      supplies after the cold snap that's moved over much of the country this      week.      BRAND:  Well, I imagine this rise in prices is going to hurt the poorest      Americans the most.      MOON:  Absolutely.  In fact, the head of a group called the National      Energy Assistance Directors' Association says that we could be facing a      potential public health crisis here.  He says that we can talk about a      few percentage points one way or the other and it's still going to make      no difference to the low-income and fixed-income households that are      already struggling to make ends meet.  This is going to hit people who      use home heating oil the most, according to the Energy Department.  The      government analysts say that the people who use home heating oil can      expect to pay on average more than $1,400 to stay warm all winter.  That      compares to around a thousand dollars for natural gas and around $760 for      homeowners who use electricity.      BRAND:  And how will this affect the overall economy?      MOON:  Well, at this point researchers who watch that kind of thing say      that the economy ought to be able to absorb these higher energy costs for      now anyway.  There is concern, of course, that the higher heating bills      will mean that consumers will have less money to spend on other things.      That could hurt some businesses and the experts do say that this is going      to take a big chunk out of consumer spending so we have to watch that.      There's not much encouraging news to report on the energy front, by the      way, but we can say that oil and natural gas facilities that were hit by      the hurricanes out in the Gulf of Mexico have partly recovered.  About a      quarter of natural gas production is still out there, and about a third      of oil output is down in that region.      Speaking of cold, today in the \"Marketplace\" newsroom we're taking a look      at some Brits who are very scared by the possibility of a coming ice age      in the British Isles.

I'm Madeleine Brand.      The luxury home-building company Toll Brothers reported its fiscal      fourth-quarter earnings today.  No sign of a burst housing bubble.      Profits were up more than 70 percent over the same time last year.  But      there are other signs that the real estate market is slowing.  From Los      Angeles, \"Marketplace's\" Tess Vigeland is here.      And, Tess, first, let's talk about the Toll Brothers company.  They've      given some market-pleasing numbers today, but also a warning, I      understand.      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Yeah.  You know, who wouldn't cheer a 72 percent jump in profits?  Right?      But that news really came with a caution from Toll Brothers that it's      cutting its forecast for how well it's going to do for the full year.      Originally, it predicted overall growth of 20 percent.  Now it's talking      about 0 to 10 percent, and they're citing, of course, a slowdown in the      housing market, interest rates are on the rise, houses are taking a      little longer to sell these days.  There's just a lot of anecdotal      evidence out there that some of the air is coming out of the housing      bubble.      BRAND:  And what is some other evidence of that?      VIGELAND:  Well, there have been several pieces, though we've also seen      something of a mixed message in the last week or so.  Yesterday, the UCLA      Anderson forecast came out with its quarterly assessment of the housing      market, and it's predicting that as many as half a million construction      jobs and 300,000 financial sector jobs could be lost as the housing      market slows down.  On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors      released its index of pending home sales; that was down in October.  Last      week, we had a slew of numbers showing some weakness.  Home price      appreciation slowed in the third quarter, and sales of existing homes      dropped 2. 7 percent in October.      But then you also had a report that sales of new homes jumped 13 percent,      and that's the fastest monthly pace in 12 years.  So again, some mixed      signals but overall, the experts are saying that the hissing sound from      the bubble is going to stay with us for the foreseeable future.      BRAND:  But, Tess, I understand mortgage applications are up.  And isn't      that a sign that the housing market is still strong?      VIGELAND:  Yeah, that's usually true.  And mortgage applications were up      this week and that's mainly due to the fact that interest rates dipped      ever so slightly in the last couple of weeks so there was this big rush      to refinance by people who already own their homes.  But overall,      interest rates have been rising and that's put something of a damper on      mortgage applications since about the end of September.      And today on \"Marketplace,\" we're talking with those mysterious hedge      fund managers about why they're so unhappy about being unmasked, so to      speak, by the feds.

Mr. WRIGHT:  (As Bennett Holiday) Defrauded the government of Kazakhstan      of funds to which it was entitled.  Defrauded the people of Kazakhstan of      the right to the honest services of their elected and appointed      officials.      Unidentified Actor:  Dalton's a bit of a rogue, it's true.      Mr. CLOONEY:  (As Bob Barnes) And he'll have a nice little trust fund      waiting when he gets out.      Mr. WRIGHT:  (As Bennett Holiday) Look, Don, we can spend the next five      years in court to get back to the very place that we're at right now.      And they will fight tough.  They'll fight dirty.  They'll pressure your      boss.  They'll pressure the people who appointed your boss.  They'll      pressure the wives of the people who appointed your boss.  And you will      never hit them any harder than this, and you know it.      GORDON:  Writer and director Stephen Gaghan crafted \"Syriana\" through      four interlocking stories that depict the corruption of the global oil      industry. Wright likened \"Syriana\" to socially conscious political      thrillers that used to be common in Hollywood.      Mr. WRIGHT:  You know, in the late '60s, early '70s, you had films coming      out of Hollywood, out of major studio releases that, you know, whether      implicitly or explicitly, had a political bent to them, had some social      relevance to them; and then, you know, after, I guess, '76 and \"Star      Wars\" and \"Jaws,\" the birth of blockbusters, you know, that kind of fell      to the wayside.  But it's not typical Hollywood fare, but it is aided,      you know, by the presence of George Clooney and the influence that he      brings to it; but also by a guy named Jeff Skoll, one of the founders of      eBay, who has started this film company with the idea of promoting films      with social relevance and films that are about social justice and things      like this.  And he co-funded this film with Warner Bros. , so he mitigated      some of the risk for the studio to allow them to, quote, unquote, \"take a      chance\" on a film like this.      GORDON:  Talk to us, if you will, and, in a nutshell, explain the movie.      It gives you kind of a peek behind the curtain to see how so many things      are interconnected in the world today, particularly when you're talking      about big business and money and politics.      Mr. WRIGHT:  Sure.  I mean, I think a peek behind the curtain is an apt      description because that's exactly what Stephen Gaghan was able to do in      researching this film.  What Gaghan did was he went around the world to      all these various nether regions of the geopolitical structure, if you      will.  He got the chance to meet up with the Hezbollah members in      Lebanon, I think, and with arms dealers in the south of France.  He      really got to peek behind the curtain and to draw the conclusions for      himself.  And it really is a rare view for us on some of these issues,      issues revolving around our relationship to oil and oil's relationship to      politics, or the implications of America's wealth, of America's      dependence on oil, to the regions in which these resources occur.      GORDON:  Let me ask you this as relates to your character, Jeffrey.  And      I don't know if this speaks to the respect that people have for you      individually as an actor, if it speaks to the door opening to some degree      for African-Americans in Hollywood, if it speaks to the individuals that      are producing this film solely, or if it speaks to all of the above, but      one would think that casting you in this role as an African-American      would be seen as an aberration almost in Hollywood in that you are a very      high-powered Washington lawyer, and you don't blink to think that there's      a black man sitting in that chair.      Mr. WRIGHT:  Well, I think it's probably more specific to this      production.  I wouldn't say it's necessarily, you know, a trend in      Hollywood, but I think it's the folks who were involved in this      production--were going after something complex.  And I think the film      tows the line of a lot of moral ambiguities; in my case, you know, some      racial ambiguities, and I think it, you know--it just makes for an all      the more interesting portrayal.      GORDON:  You and I have had an opportunity to talk on a number of      occasions, not only on mike, so to speak, but off, and I know that you      have received your BA in political science from Amherst College.  Talk to      me about the intrigue that this brought to you just based on your      personal likings.      Mr. WRIGHT:  Yeah, I grew up in Washington.  My mom was a lawyer for the      government for many years so, you know, this stuff is home for me.  And      I, you know, as you said, studied political science with the intention      probably of going on to be a lawyer.  But more specifically, when Steve      Gaghan gave me the script, the reason that we found ourselves kind of,      you know, on common ground is that I've been spending a fair amount of      time in the last four or five years in Africa, particularly West Africa.      And in that time it has become increasingly apparent to me how the      relationship of a region to its natural resources informs its political      climate and its social stability.  You see that what drives it is the      necessity of access to valuable resources, whether they be oil,      industrial resources; whether they be precious metals, precious minerals.      We take for granted that we have a cell phone that uses coltan or uses      aluminum or these things, but, you know, aluminum is not mined in Midtown      Manhattan, you know?      GORDON:  Right.      Mr. WRIGHT:  It's mined in places like Guinea.  And coltan is found in      the Democratic Republican of Congo.  But what are the implications of our      having access to that for the folks of that area?  I think it's really      important for us, you know, as Americans to understand, you know, the      implications of our excesses and the implications of our wealth.  And I      think the film is--obviously, it's not going to answer all the questions      about that, but it's certainly trying to dig at these issues and      hopefully inspire some more informed questions about, you know, how we      live.      GORDON:  Well, the film is \"Syriana. \"  Jeffrey Wright, as always, man,      good to talk to you.      Mr. WRIGHT:  Ed, thank you so much for having me.

Wright likened \"Syriana\" to socially conscious political      thrillers that used to be common in Hollywood.       Mr. WRIGHT:  You know, in the late '60s, early '70s, you had films coming      out of Hollywood, out of major studio releases that, you know, whether      implicitly or explicitly, had a political bent to them, had some social      relevance to them; and then, you know, after, I guess, '76 and \"Star      Wars\" and \"Jaws,\" the birth of blockbusters, you know, that kind of fell      to the wayside.  But it's not typical Hollywood fare, but it is aided,      you know, by the presence of George Clooney and the influence that he      brings to it; but also by a guy named Jeff Skoll, one of the founders of      eBay, who has started this film company with the idea of promoting films      with social relevance and films that are about social justice and things      like this.  And he co-funded this film with Warner Bros. , so he mitigated      some of the risk for the studio to allow them to, quote, unquote, \"take a      chance\" on a film like this.       GORDON:  Talk to us, if you will, and, in a nutshell, explain the movie.      It gives you kind of a peek behind the curtain to see how so many things      are interconnected in the world today, particularly when you're talking      about big business and money and politics.       Mr. WRIGHT:  Sure.  I mean, I think a peek behind the curtain is an apt      description because that's exactly what Stephen Gaghan was able to do in      researching this film.  What Gaghan did was he went around the world to      all these various nether regions of the geopolitical structure, if you      will.  He got the chance to meet up with the Hezbollah members in      Lebanon, I think, and with arms dealers in the south of France.  He      really got to peek behind the curtain and to draw the conclusions for      himself.  And it really is a rare view for us on some of these issues,      issues revolving around our relationship to oil and oil's relationship to      politics, or the implications of America's wealth, of America's      dependence on oil, to the regions in which these resources occur.       GORDON:  Let me ask you this as relates to your character, Jeffrey.  And      I don't know if this speaks to the respect that people have for you      individually as an actor, if it speaks to the door opening to some degree      for African-Americans in Hollywood, if it speaks to the individuals that      are producing this film solely, or if it speaks to all of the above, but      one would think that casting you in this role as an African-American      would be seen as an aberration almost in Hollywood in that you are a very      high-powered Washington lawyer, and you don't blink to think that there's      a black man sitting in that chair.       Mr. WRIGHT:  Well, I think it's probably more specific to this      production.  I wouldn't say it's necessarily, you know, a trend in      Hollywood, but I think it's the folks who were involved in this      production--were going after something complex.  And I think the film      tows the line of a lot of moral ambiguities; in my case, you know, some      racial ambiguities, and I think it, you know--it just makes for an all      the more interesting portrayal.       GORDON:  You and I have had an opportunity to talk on a number of      occasions, not only on mike, so to speak, but off, and I know that you      have received your BA in political science from Amherst College.  Talk to      me about the intrigue that this brought to you just based on your      personal likings.       Mr. WRIGHT:  Yeah, I grew up in Washington.  My mom was a lawyer for the      government for many years so, you know, this stuff is home for me.  And      I, you know, as you said, studied political science with the intention      probably of going on to be a lawyer.  But more specifically, when Steve      Gaghan gave me the script, the reason that we found ourselves kind of,      you know, on common ground is that I've been spending a fair amount of      time in the last four or five years in Africa, particularly West Africa.      And in that time it has become increasingly apparent to me how the      relationship of a region to its natural resources informs its political      climate and its social stability.  You see that what drives it is the      necessity of access to valuable resources, whether they be oil,      industrial resources; whether they be precious metals, precious minerals.      We take for granted that we have a cell phone that uses coltan or uses      aluminum or these things, but, you know, aluminum is not mined in Midtown      Manhattan, you know?       GORDON:  Right.       Mr. WRIGHT:  It's mined in places like Guinea.  And coltan is found in      the Democratic Republican of Congo.  But what are the implications of our      having access to that for the folks of that area?  I think it's really      important for us, you know, as Americans to understand, you know, the      implications of our excesses and the implications of our wealth.  And I      think the film is--obviously, it's not going to answer all the questions      about that, but it's certainly trying to dig at these issues and      hopefully inspire some more informed questions about, you know, how we      live.       GORDON:  Well, the film is \"Syriana. \"  Jeffrey Wright, as always, man,      good to talk to you.       Mr. WRIGHT:  Ed, thank you so much for having me.       GORDON:  \"Syriana\" opens nationwide today.       (Credits)       GORDON:  To listen to the show, visit npr. org.

I'm Robert Siegel.      MICHELE NORRIS, host:      And I'm Michele Norris.      The gold bugs are jittering.  Gold prices are up sharply this year,      closing today at $530 an ounce; that's the highest price in nearly 25      years.  And market observers expect that gold may keep going up in the      months ahead.  As NPR's Jack Speer reports, the reason why the precious      metal is doing so well is something of a mystery.      JACK SPEER reporting:      Our obsession with gold goes back thousands of years.  The valuable      metal, once the providence of noblemen and kings, later became a key      method of exchange.  Peter Bernstein is the author of the book \"The Power      of Gold. \"  He says almost all the gold mined through history, an      estimated 4. 4 billion ounces, is still around today.      Mr. PETER BERNSTEIN (Author, \"The Power of Gold\"):  It's fascinating      stuff because it does not tarnish, and therefore it's beautiful, and it      gives a kind of an impression of eternity.  And it's really, I think,      those attributes that made it so fascinating to people.      SPEER:  Gold for centuries has been used to make jewelry, but throughout      history it's also been seen as a hedge against uncertain times.  In the      early 1980s, when the US economy faced runaway inflation and double-digit      interest rates, gold prices briefly topped $800 an ounce.  George Gero      works for Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.  A gold trader since the      early 1970s, he thinks there's, again, unease on world markets that's      helping push gold prices higher.      Mr. GEORGE GERO (Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets):  I'm not saying      history repeats itself, but there are concerns today in the markets that      seem to indicate people need or want or think they need to protect their      purchasing power by buying gold.      SPEER:  But it's not clear why investors should be worried now.  It's      inflation that usually pushes up gold prices, and with the exception of      energy, inflation hasn't been much of a problem this year.  That's got      some people wondering how long the current rally will last.      Mr. JEFFREY CHRISTIAN (Managing Director, CPM Group):  Gold prices have      never really stayed above $500 for an extended period of time.      SPEER:  Jeffrey Christian is managing director with CPM Group, a precious      metals consulting firm.  He thinks rather than any one cause for the rise      in gold prices, he believes there are a variety of reasons gold's been      moving higher.      Mr. CHRISTIAN:  You have some investors who have been buying gold because      they're concerned about currency; others because of the stock market;      others because of bonds; others because of inflation.  You have investors      who have been buying gold as a commodity because they thought that the      time was right for the price to rise again.  And you have other investors      who have been buying it for political reasons.      SPEER:  Another factor:  Central banks, which until recently had been      selling their gold holdings, have now slowed sales.  And the companies      that mine gold have recently changed their hedging strategies; that's had      the effect of reducing the supply of gold on the market and also driving      up prices.  As for the future of gold prices, author Peter Bernstein says      that depends as much on investor sentiment as anything.      Mr. BERNSTEIN:  Buying gold in addition to not getting any income is a      costly thing to do if the world is really going to be OK over the long      run.  But if the world is not, the price of gold could go to--I don't      know; pick a number--4,000, 5,000.  A little bit of it will go a long      way.      SPEER:  Year to date the price of gold has risen 20 percent.  Over the      past five years, its price has roughly doubled.  That's caused even some      large institutional investors to begin buying gold bullion or shares in      gold-mining companies.  But analysts say there's also something of a herd      mentality among investors because gold's rise has been so much stronger      than for other types of investments.

To tell us what they're likely to do      and why, we turn to David Wessel, deputy Washington bureau chief for The      Wall Street Journal and a regular guest here.      David, good morning again.      Mr. DAVID WESSEL (The Wall Street Journal):  Good morning.      INSKEEP:  So what's the Fed likely to do?      Mr. WESSEL:  The Fed is almost certain to raise interest rates from 4      percent to 4 1/4 percent at today's meeting, and then take them another      quarter percent in January.  The Fed is like a doctor looking at a heart      patient, and they have to decide whether the heart is going too slow or      too fast.  And in order to get the heart to beat faster, they've keep      interest rates relatively low for some time, but they're getting to the      point where they don't think the patient needs much stimulus.      INSKEEP:  And there's also some change possible in the indicator as to      the direction that they're heading?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, that's right.  Everybody in the markets thinks they      know what the Fed is going to do.  What they're interested in is what is      the Fed going to say, particularly, what are they going to say about the      likely trajectory of interest rates over the next few months?  They've      been very open lately.  They've been talking about measured rate      increases.  But they're getting to the point where they want to change      the language because they're not really sure now how far rates will have      to go.      INSKEEP:  And why do people care about that language?      Mr. WESSEL:  The markets really want to know where rates are going to be      six months from now, because that's what determine what bonds are going      to do and what stocks are going to do, and the Fed has been giving them      very clear signals.  This has been an unusual period for the Fed.  But      the Fed seems to be uncomfortable with continuing to give that signal,      and most people expect them to stop, if not now, then in January.      INSKEEP:  Now, David, you've told us in past conversations that these      interest rate increases are expected because Alan Greenspan is leaving as      Fed chairman. They want to send signals that inflation will still be kept      under control even after he's gone.  But I want to ask about something      else that's happening at the same time.  What's happening with interest      rates from central bankers in other countries around the world?      Mr. WESSEL:  Well, that's interesting.  In Europe, after holding rates      steady for three years, they're now starting to move them up.  They've      moved them up a quarter percent, and there's even talk in Japan, where      rates have been at 0 for years, the time has come to begin for them to      start raising interest rates.  And what that means to the US is this:  If      other people raise interest rates too much, their economies will be      sluggish and they won't buy enough of our stuff.  But it also has a big      effect on what happens to the dollar, and it will help keep the dollar up      if interest rates overseas go up as well as ours.      INSKEEP:  So on balance, is it good that Americans are raising interest      rates at the same time as our trading partners are?      Mr. WESSEL:  On balance it's good that central bankers think the world      economy is now finally strong enough that they can all be raising      interest rates, as long as they're right.

And it's bonus season, and that means big business for the      shops that sell all things shiny and expensive.  All you have to do is      look at the pages of big newspapers to see how the market for fancy      watches is doing.  Edward Faber is of the Aaron Faber Gallery in New York      City.  He says this year, sales look good thanks to Wall Street's good      fortunes.      Mr. EDWARD FABER (Aaron Faber Gallery):  It's one of the larger bonus      periods of the last five years.      NORRIS:  Oh, do I detect a smile on your face as you say that?      Mr. FABER:  A big grin.  A large grin.      NORRIS:  Who's buying these timepieces?      Mr. FABER:  Basically, I would say they're males between the ages of 30      and 50 who are reaching a certain level in their various professions, who      have disposable income, who want some sort of edge in their daily      walkabout life. So when they meet other friends or they meet business      colleagues, they want to have this--we're calling it this power tool,      this instrument on their wrist that distinguishes them from the pack.      NORRIS:  So it's about status, it's about power and it's kind of about      bling.      Mr. FABER:  Well, it's different.  The real collector wouldn't wear a      diamond Jacob the Jeweler hip-hop watch; they want a more subtle      statement.  So that, yes, it's stainless steel, but they know that Steve      McQueen wore it in the movie \"Le Mans\" and not everyone can have the      orange hand so-called Steve McQueen Submariner.  They've got it, they      know it has box and papers.  And instead of it selling or being worth      $4,000, they know that the guy they're talking to knows it's worth 15,000      and you can't get it.      NORRIS:  I'm curious about how big the market is, because if you look at      The New York Times, it is chock full of these ads for high-end watches.      And. . .      Mr. FABER:  It's an amazing market.      NORRIS:  Is the market really that big?      Mr. FABER:  When I started--this is our 31st year--it probably was maybe      a $50 million market, globally maybe a hundred million.  Today, it's well      in excess of multibillions of dollars on an annual basis.      NORRIS:  So there is really a large market for this?      Mr. FABER:  It's huge.  You have to understand that if you have made, or      are beginning to make, a lot of money in China, or you're one of the new      breed coming out of India and you're starting to make some money and you      live in wherever you live in the world, it's not easy to demonstrate with      a car or a painting or a suit of clothes your new status, your new      wealth.  It is with a wristwatch, one of the very few things that you can      actually attach to your body that broadcasts a message, that's      acceptable.  I mean, I'm excluding the big diamond earring and the big      gold neck chain, which is most of the. . .      NORRIS:  Acceptable in some circles.      Mr. FABER:  Yes, but not as readily as the watch.      NORRIS:  Well, Mr. Faber, thanks for your time.      Mr. FABER:  It's a pleasure.  If I can be of any further help, don't      hesitate to call.      NORRIS:  Edward Faber.  He's a principal of the Aaron Faber Gallery in      New York City.

(Soundbite of \"Clocks\")       MICHELE NORRIS, host:       The money may have dried up years ago at Enron, but it's still flowing on      Wall Street.  And it's bonus season, and that means big business for the      shops that sell all things shiny and expensive.  All you have to do is      look at the pages of big newspapers to see how the market for fancy      watches is doing.  Edward Faber is of the Aaron Faber Gallery in New York      City.  He says this year, sales look good thanks to Wall Street's good      fortunes.       Mr. EDWARD FABER (Aaron Faber Gallery):  It's one of the larger bonus      periods of the last five years.       NORRIS:  Oh, do I detect a smile on your face as you say that?       Mr. FABER:  A big grin.  A large grin.       NORRIS:  Who's buying these timepieces?       Mr. FABER:  Basically, I would say they're males between the ages of 30      and 50 who are reaching a certain level in their various professions, who      have disposable income, who want some sort of edge in their daily      walkabout life. So when they meet other friends or they meet business      colleagues, they want to have this--we're calling it this power tool,      this instrument on their wrist that distinguishes them from the pack.       NORRIS:  So it's about status, it's about power and it's kind of about      bling.       Mr. FABER:  Well, it's different.  The real collector wouldn't wear a      diamond Jacob the Jeweler hip-hop watch; they want a more subtle      statement.  So that, yes, it's stainless steel, but they know that Steve      McQueen wore it in the movie \"Le Mans\" and not everyone can have the      orange hand so-called Steve McQueen Submariner.  They've got it, they      know it has box and papers.  And instead of it selling or being worth      $4,000, they know that the guy they're talking to knows it's worth 15,000      and you can't get it.

I'm Alex Chadwick.      Cost-cutting efforts continue at big US automakers.  Ford has struck an      agreement with the United Auto Workers union to lower health-care costs.      GM is taking some retirement benefits away from its white-collar workers.      From Los Angeles, \"Marketplace's\" Tess Vigeland is here.      Tess, first the agreement at Ford.  What are the workers there giving up?      TESS VIGELAND reporting:      Well, it's not so much that they're anything up, it's that they're going      to have to pay more, much more, toward their own health care, and this is      a trend we're seeing everywhere these days.  But union officials have      agreed to a deal in which the employees have to put 99 cents an hour of      any future wage increases toward a health-care fund.  This year, the      average wage hike is around 3 percent.  Insurance deductibles for them      will rise by as much as 33 percent, and the costs for current retirees      will go up.  They'll be paying upwards of $750 a year per family.  The      union membership, of course, still has to ratify all this.      CHADWICK:  So a dollar, essentially, of new wage increases for Ford      workers, it's going to come out of their pay and go into health-care      costs?      VIGELAND:  Yes, a dollar per hour of their pay.      CHADWICK:  Wow.  How much money is this going to save forward?      VIGELAND:  According to the company, it's going to save about $850      million a year, and their total health-care bill this year is about $3      1/2 billion. Under the deal, Ford will contribute to that health-care      fund that I mentioned earlier; $108 million by the year 2011.  And all      this, by the way, very closely mirrors the deal between the UAW and      General Motors that they struck a couple of months ago.      CHADWICK:  And what is that?  What about benefit changes at--not at UAW,      but the white-collar workers there?      VIGELAND:  Right.  General Motors--they say that they are no longer going      to contribute to the retirement plans for white-collar workers, folks on      salary. They have been participating in a 401(k) savings plan.  That's      where the company usually matches some portion of the employee's      contribution to the plan.  Up until now, the company was giving 20 cents      for each dollar that employees themselves put into that fund, to their      401(k) fund.  And, in fact, that's down from just a year ago when they      got 50 cents on the dollar.  Now they're not going to make the match at      all.  Now they did leave open the possibility that they would reinstate      those contributions at some point.      And one other change that could benefit employees in this 401(k) program,      GM is no longer going to require them to invest 3 percent of the fund in      GM stock.  More and more companies have been dropping that requirement.      And, frankly, given the recent performance of GM stock--down almost 50      percent this year--this might be somewhat of a relief for those workers.      And, Alex, later today on \"Marketplace\" we're looking at the decision by      a judge in Illinois to reverse a $10 billion verdict against Philip      Morris.      CHADWICK:  All right.

Seems that      China's economy is even bigger than anybody thought.  By switching to a      better counting method, the Chinese have discovered 300 billion missing      dollars in their economy.  NPR's Adam Davidson found out what that means.      ADAM DAVIDSON reporting:      It turns out it's not that hard to lose track of $300 billion, at least      not for China, where about 900 million people still live on farms or      remote villages.      Mr. CARL WEINBERG (High Frequency Economics):  Out of the city, out of      the banking system, not necessarily using money or credit cards or checks      for their transactions, it's not at all surprising that a big chunk of      their activity might be missed by statistical sampling techniques.      DAVIDSON:  Carl Weinberg, with High Frequency Economics, says China is      still trying to modernize an accounting system first developed in the      Soviet era. The new techniques, revealed this week, are a huge step      forward in allowing bureaucrats to keep track of the ever-growing private      sector.  China will release the first revised economic data next week.      Many expect China's economy will be about 20 percent larger than      previously thought.  Nick Lardy is a China specialist at the Institute      for International Economics.  He says that over the past decade, China's      accounting practices have become much more sophisticated.      Mr. NICK LARDY (Institute for International Economics):  You know, on a      scale of one to 10, if the US is 10, you know, China's probably a seven      or eight. Technically, this is difficult, and it's a pretty massive      effort when you're talking about one of the largest economies in the      world.      DAVIDSON:  The old data showed that China's economy has been growing at      nearly 10 percent a year for the past decade.  Some have called this      growth `the China miracle. '  The new data might confirm that number, or      reveal that China has been growing even faster than that, something that      might alarm Americans who fear China's growing economic strength.  On the      other hand, the new data seems likely to show that Chinese consumers are      spending more.  This should be welcome news to US manufacturers hoping to      sell products in China. Manufacturers need good news, especially now, the      same week that the US trade deficit with China reached a record high.      Adam Davidson, NPR News.

LYNNE TRUSS:      A friend of mine back in England works in a store called Poundland.  As      the name so cunningly suggests, everything sold in this store is priced      at 1 pound.  My friend, whose name is Ronnie, is quite resigned to      working in Poundland, and I think he gets a lot of pleasure from doing      his Christmas shopping every year without leaving his workplace.  Many's      the Christmas Eve that he's turned up at my house with an interesting      item, such as a brightly colored garden ornament in the shape of a frog,      and said, as he placed it down, `Merry Christmas, Lynne.  You'll never      guess how much I paid for that. '      I've been thinking a lot about Ronnie and Poundland over the past few      weeks, because I've been talking about my book on rudeness and reminding      people that rudeness, while one decries its increase, is nevertheless      sometimes wonderfully cathartic as well as hilarious, as, for example,      when a woman customer recently returned a faulty wristwatch to Poundland      and demanded her money back.      `Do you remember how much you paid for it? ' asked Ronnie carefully.  `I      think it was a pound,' said the woman.  `And was there a five-year      guarantee with it? ' he said.  `No, I don't think so,' she said.  `Should      there have been? ' And he said, `No, of course there shouldn't have been.      It cost a bloody pound! '      Just before I set off for the States, Ronnie opened the store one morning      to find a man hammering on the door.  `What time do you call this? ' the      man said. `I call it 8:33.  You're supposed to be open at 8:30 sharp! '      Ronnie shrugged. `Where are the bath cleaners? ' the man demanded, without      a please or thank you, an omission that did not pass unnoted.  Ronnie      pointed.  `Over there, sir, in the corner. '  The man returned and      demanded to be shown the bath cleaners.  Then at the cash register, he      said, `You don't have much of a range. '  This was too much.  Ronnie      looked at him, took a deep breath, and then said, `I think you're      laboring under a misapprehension, sir. '  The man looked suspicious.      `What misapprehension? ' the man asked.  `That this is Harrods,' said      Ronnie, `and that you're the bloody Duke of Westminster. '      What a perfect moment, worth getting the sack for, I should think,      although as far as I know, Ronnie is still at Poundland, and that I'll be      getting a set of light-up drink coasters for Christmas, price 1 pound,      because I admired them in his house.  Last year it was a box set of      classical CDs that had somehow failed to make an impression on the      commercial music charts, perhaps because it was the personal selection of      Sven-Goren Eriksson, manager of the England soccer team.      Sometimes people come to the cash register with five items, incidentally,      and try to offer 4 pounds.  Ronnie doesn't have much time for them,      either.

'  The man looked suspicious.      `What misapprehension? ' the man asked.  `That this is Harrods,' said      Ronnie, `and that you're the bloody Duke of Westminster. '       What a perfect moment, worth getting the sack for, I should think,      although as far as I know, Ronnie is still at Poundland, and that I'll be      getting a set of light-up drink coasters for Christmas, price 1 pound,      because I admired them in his house.  Last year it was a box set of      classical CDs that had somehow failed to make an impression on the      commercial music charts, perhaps because it was the personal selection of      Sven-Goren Eriksson, manager of the England soccer team.       Sometimes people come to the cash register with five items, incidentally,      and try to offer 4 pounds.  Ronnie doesn't have much time for them,      either.

I'm Steve Inskeep.      If you factor out inflation, energy prices reached new highs in the year      that's now ending, and forecasters say 2006 may not bring much relief.      This crunch is not limited to the United States.  In a moment, we'll hear      about an entire country that is under pressure to pay more for natural      gas, a lot more. The same pressures are affecting the United States, as      NPR's Scott Horsley reports.      SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:      Antoinette Stark(ph) keeps her thermostat at 66 degrees, and her house is      well-insulated.  But the Longmont, Colorado, woman still got an      unpleasant surprise when she opened her most recent natural gas bill.  It      was $185, about double what she paid last year.      Ms. ANTOINETTE STARK (Colorado):  I'm 82 years old, and so my income is      under a thousand a month.  I scrimp along, and when something like this      happens, then you scrimp a little bit more.      HORSLEY:  Many people will find themselves scrimping to pay for heat this      winter.  The Energy Department warns heating costs could jump up to 38      percent from a year ago.  Higher fuel prices were made worse in Stark's      case by an early December cold snap.      Ms. STARK:  It's been like a real bitter, bitter cold.  Even at my age, I      don't get cold that easy, but I keep a supply, like sweaters and      sweatsuits and stuff, around home.      HORSLEY:  The seeds of this costly winter were planted, in part, last      summer by the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast.  Even now, months later, more      than 20 percent of the offshore oil and gas production remain shut down.      Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates says that affects a      big chunk of the nation's energy supply.      Mr. DANIEL YERGIN (Cambridge Energy Research Associates):  When people      build offshore platforms, they build them for a hundred-year storm.  2005      was a year that you had not one but two hundred-year storms within a      matter of weeks of each other, and the result was one of the biggest      energy shocks since the 1970s.      HORSLEY:  And the shock came at a time when energy supplies were already      stretched thin.  Even before the hurricanes, consumers around the world      were using oil almost as fast as producers could pump it.  And that was      pushing prices in one direction:  up.      MICHELE NORRIS (\"All Things Considered\"):  The price of oil climbed to a      new high today before dropping back a bit in the afternoon.      ROBERT SIEGEL (\"All Things Considered\"):  The price of crude oil set a      new record today.  It was $58. 40. . .      Unidentified Reporter:  Another day, another record for oil prices.      HORSLEY:  The worldwide market for oil is coming to look more and more      like a busy shopping mall the week before Christmas, and that other car      jockeying for the last parking space may have a Chinese driver at the      wheel.  Yergin says Americans are just now waking up to China's growing      appetite for oil, as illustrated by the Chinese company CNOOC's aborted      bid for Unocal.      Mr. YERGIN:  Ten years ago the thought that would happen in a Chinese oil      market could possibly have had an impact on what motorists in America pay      at the gasoline pump would have seemed just unrealistic.  Today we now      see that it's a reality.      HORSLEY:  The average price of gasoline topped $2 a gallon back in March,      and it hasn't fallen below that level since.  That gets expensive for      cabdriver Ezer Herdawi(ph), who's waiting for a holiday fare outside the      San Diego Airport.      Mr. EZER HERDAWI (Cabdriver):  This is like number one on the list, the      gas is number one.  They hope the prices will come down a little bit.      That will help us a little bit as well.      HORSLEY:  Gas prices have come down from the $3 range, reached just after      Katrina, but even now the average price is some 40 cents a gallon higher      than a year ago; 70 cents higher than in 2003.  Another cabbie, Kassam      Kalil(ph), echoes the sentiment of many fatalistic drivers.      Mr. KASSAM KALIL (Cabdriver):  We depend on the gas to run the cars, you      know, so was the idea.  There's no other choice.  We have to buy it.      HORSLEY:  Americans have kept buying gasoline at a fairly steady pace,      although demand has fallen for the biggest SUVs.  And the US economy has      also proven surprisingly resilient in the face of high energy prices.      While prices are not likely to stay this high forever, they're no longer      expected to fall as low as they once were.  This year's prices have also      fueled concern that the world may be close to running out of oil.      Yergin, who's studied the long history of the industry, notes that      predictions in the past have been premature.      Mr. YERGIN:  This is the fifth time that we've run out of oil, and the      last time we ran out of oil was in the 1970s, and since then, we've      increased production by about 60 percent.  It may get harder.  The scale      may get bigger. It may cost a lot more money, but that's probably what's      going to happen once again.      HORSLEY:  Yergin says over time innovation and new exploration will      supply the energy we need.  But most innovators and explorers are now      betting on higher prices than they were a year ago.  Scott Horsley, NPR      News, San Diego.

Yesterday, for the first time      in five years, interest on long-term bonds dropped below interest on      short-term notes.  It's not supposed to work that way.  If you assume the      added risk of lending your money for a longer period of time, you should      be able to demand a higher rate of interest.  So what does this so-called      inversion mean?  That's our question for John Lonski, who's chief      economist at Moody's Investors Service.      Mr. Lonski, what's your explanation of this inversion?      Mr. JOHN LONSKI (Chief Economist, Moody's Investors Service):  Well, the      historical record shows that as investors become more worried or      concerned about future economic prospects, the Treasury yield curve tends      to flatten; that is, the 10-year Treasury yield moves down closer to the      two-year Treasury yield.  So this latest flattening of the Treasury yield      curve reminds us that investors are less than convinced that 2006 will be      yet another year of above-average economic growth.      SIEGEL:  Less than convinced. . .      Mr. LONSKI:  Right.      SIEGEL:  . . . you say?      Mr. LONSKI:  Yes.      SIEGEL:  I mean, we've had so many economic reports of big economic      growth in 2005.  We're under the impression that we're in full recovery      in the economy. Where does all of this uncertainty come from?      Mr. LONSKI:  The uncertainty's coming from worry regarding the ability of      consumers to continue to spend at a rate that is well in excess of the      rate of personal income growth.      SIEGEL:  You mean--we just heard an interview about credit card      restrictions. If Americans get sober with their plastic, that could throw      the economy into a tailspin is what you're telling me.      Mr. LONSKI:  Yes.  That would imply a slower rate of growth for consumer      spending and in all likelihood the same for the overall economy.      SIEGEL:  Well, how certain an omen is this sort of inversion?  The Wall      Street Journal reports that when it happens, it often precedes a      recession.  Often? Always?  Sometimes?  What would you say?      Mr. LONSKI:  Sometimes.  Thus far the inversion of the yield curve has      been neither severe nor especially long-lived.  So it's far too early to      conclude that a recession will necessarily strike hard at the US economy      during the next 12 months.      SIEGEL:  So on a scale of one to 10--these are my own metrics.  On a      scale of one to 10, where one is pretty flaky day in December and 10 is      `Watch out, the crash is coming in the next year,' what number do you      assign what's happened here?      Mr. LONSKI:  I would give it a three.      SIEGEL:  A three.  Well, Mr. Lonski, thank you very much for talking with      us.      Mr. LONSKI:  My pleasure.

I'm Farai Chideya.      More evidence today that the red-hot housing market is beginning to cool      down. The National Association of Realtors reports just under seven      million existing homes were sold in November.  That's down 1. 7 percentage      points from the previous month, the lowest level of sales since March.      Joining us is John Dimsale from \"Marketplace. \"      John, even with this recent slowdown, the housing market has had a good      year, hasn't it?      JOHN DIMSDALE (\"Marketplace\"):  It sure did, Farai.  Home sales will set      a record for the fifth year in a row, and prices have been booming.  You      know, the housing market is a closely watched indicator of the entire      economy.  It means construction jobs and sales of materials and furniture      and appliances. Plus, home ownership is a big factor in consumer      confidence.  That's why there's real concern about prices coming down too      quickly.      CHIDEYA:  So let me ask you this.  What are the latest numbers saying?      Are we looking at a house bubble that's about to burst?      DIMSDALE:  No, at least not yet.  Today's drop in existing home sales was      only a little weaker than expected.  A week ago, we saw a bigger drop, 11      percent, in the sales of new homes.  There's now a five-month supply of      houses for sale, and that's the highest inventory since 1986.  And the      number of days that the average home for sale stays on the market is      going up.  But so far, this could be a soft landing for the high-flying      market, and economist David Wyss at Standard & Poor's thinks the gradual      decline will continue.      Mr. DAVID WYSS (Economist, Standard & Poor's):  We expect housing starts      and sales to soften next year.  Mortgage rates are up, they're going to      go up farther, and that's going to slow down the housing market.  And      when you slow down the housing market you slow down things like      appliances, furniture, rugs, carpets, all those other things that your      wife insists on buying as soon as you move into the new house.      CHIDEYA:  David Wyss talked about higher mortgage rates.  What's the      outlook for home prices?      DIMSDALE:  Well, so far the sales slowdown hasn't taken much of an edge      off of rising prices.  The median cost of an existing home was $215,000      in November. That's up more than 13 percent over the year.  But price      increases have been slowing a bit in recent months, and mortgages are      getting more expensive.  But you have to keep that in perspective.      Research by Economy. com finds that a family earning the median national      income buying a median-priced house would spend 22 percent of its yearly      income to buy that home.  It only took 17 percent of a family's income in      the late '90s.  But you go back 20, 25 years when mortgage rates were in      the double digits and a house cost 30 percent of family income.      Today on \"Marketplace,\" we have what should be good news for oenophiles.      A bumper crop of California grapes is likely to leave US wineries      drowning in their product.      CHIDEYA:  John Dimsdale of public radio's daily business show      \"Marketplace,\" produced by American Public Media.      Thanks, John.      DIMSDALE:  You're welcome.

Mortgage rates are up, they're going to      go up farther, and that's going to slow down the housing market.  And      when you slow down the housing market you slow down things like      appliances, furniture, rugs, carpets, all those other things that your      wife insists on buying as soon as you move into the new house.       CHIDEYA:  David Wyss talked about higher mortgage rates.  What's the      outlook for home prices?       DIMSDALE:  Well, so far the sales slowdown hasn't taken much of an edge      off of rising prices.  The median cost of an existing home was $215,000      in November. That's up more than 13 percent over the year.  But price      increases have been slowing a bit in recent months, and mortgages are      getting more expensive.  But you have to keep that in perspective.      Research by Economy. com finds that a family earning the median national      income buying a median-priced house would spend 22 percent of its yearly      income to buy that home.  It only took 17 percent of a family's income in      the late '90s.  But you go back 20, 25 years when mortgage rates were in      the double digits and a house cost 30 percent of family income.       Today on \"Marketplace,\" we have what should be good news for oenophiles.      A bumper crop of California grapes is likely to leave US wineries      drowning in their product.       CHIDEYA:  John Dimsdale of public radio's daily business show      \"Marketplace,\" produced by American Public Media.       Thanks, John.       DIMSDALE:  You're welcome.

Tomorrow, Russia      assumes the chairmanship of the Group of 8 leading industrial      democracies.  On the face of it, Russia doesn't seem to meet the criteria      for membership in this influential club.  In terms of gross domestic      product, Russia ranks 15th in the world and there are growing concerns      about President Vladimir Putin's commitment to democracy.      To find out how Russia came to the helm of the G8, we've called Fred      Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.      Welcome to the program.      Mr. FRED BERGSTEN (Director, Institute for International Economics):      Glad to be here.      ELLIOTT:  So the roots of this date back to the '90s when it was then      called a Group of 7 and the Group of 7 invited Boris Yeltsin to come to      their summit as an observer.  Why did that happen?      Mr. BERGSTEN:  There were two reasons.  One was to thank Russia for      accepting the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe.  The other was to      reward Yeltsin for moving Russia in the direction of democracy.  And as      he took steps, sometimes halting but seemingly irreversible in the      direction of Russia's becoming a democracy, the observers say they      shifted into full membership. That incidentally has been somewhat debated      within the group, and whereas the Germans view the Russians as a full      member from early on, the US never quite did so.  That's why this year's      chairmanship of the G8 is so significant. Obviously, if you chair the      group, you're a full member of the group.      ELLIOTT:  Now we should be clear that the reason Russia is chairing the      G8 this year is because it's a rotating chairmanship.      Mr. BERGSTEN:  That is right.  The traditional members rotate annually.      They're now in--I think it's the fifth or sixth cycle and Russia, since      it became a member or partial member, has wanted to get in the queue.      What happened this year is that the Germans who were next in line      graciously volunteered to step aside for a year to let Russia have the      chair in 2006.      ELLIOTT:  But the Russians don't participate in all of the G8 sessions I      understand.      Mr. BERGSTEN:  That is correct.  In fact, the most important operational      part of the G7, G8 really occurs at the level of the finance ministers      and central bank governors.  They meet several times a year and are the      closest thing we have to a steering committee for the world economy.      They don't always function too effectively, but they have the      responsibility for trying to manage world economic stability, growth and      the like.  The Russian participate only in a very limited way in that      group.  They may attend one of the sessions in a full day or two-day      meeting, they may come to a dinner, but they do not get engaged in the      most sensitive parts of those discussions.      ELLIOTT:  Why don't they participate fully?      Mr. BERGSTEN:  The reason is simply that their economic weight does not      justify it.  They're too small.  They're, in fact, in many senses still a      developing and fairly poor country.  They don't have much to say on the      big global issues of growth, trade, finance, exchange rates and all that.      So they're basically kept at arm's length from that key operational      group.      ELLIOTT:  So doesn't that make it a bit odd that they're now assuming the      chairmanship of this organization?      Mr. BERGSTEN:  It's quite odd.  Here they are becoming the chair of the      group just at a time that there's increasing concern around the world      that Russia is moving in an anti-democratic direction.  Indeed, there      have been a lot of people, including in the United States, who have      suggested that Russia should be kicked out of the G8, far from being      allowed to chair the group.  So there's a real tension in the process.      I'm sure the other countries will try to use Russia's chairmanship to      wean them back in the democratic direction and counter some of the things      that have seemed to be happening in Russia lately, but it is a very      embarrassing situation for the group as a whole and it raises fundamental      questions about how serious an operation it is.      ELLIOTT:  Fred Bergsten is director of the Institute for International      Economics.      Thanks you, sir.      Mr. BERGSTEN:  Good to talk.
