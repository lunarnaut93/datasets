The tax bill that President Trump signed into law before Christmas contains new restrictions on what homeowners can deduct, how much mortgage interest and property taxes. NPR's Jim Zarroli looks at what that could mean for the housing market. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Kari Pinto and her husband are recently retired, and they're looking to move from Iowa to a state with a warmer climate. She says the new tax law will limit how much they can deduct on the home they buy, and she's been calling up local tax offices in different states to try to understand what the impact will be. KARI PINTO: Now we just have another wrinkle in trying to determine where to go and how much it's going to cost us. ZARROLI: The new tax law is forcing a lot of people to reconsider whether they want to buy a home and how much they can pay. The bill bars homeowners from deducting interest on mortgages bigger than $750,000. Before now, the cap was a million dollars. Real estate economist Sam Chandan says this change probably won't have much of an impact on sales except at the high end. What will make a difference, he says, is the doubling of the standard deduction on federal income tax. SAM CHANDAN: That means that for a lot of people around the country, it just won't make sense to itemize and take advantage of that mortgage interest deduction any longer. So that doesn't really hurt housing directly, but it does take away one of the advantages. ZARROLI: Another change facing homeowners is the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, says some 95 percent of homeowners fall below that amount. So the new cap won't have much of an impact on housing prices in most places. LAWRENCE YUN: We don't anticipate too much change for the middle part of the country where home values are fairly affordable. ZARROLI: But in high-cost states such as New York, Maryland and California, the impact could be considerable. YUN: The homeownership rate is falling in California because of the unaffordable condition. Now with the tax reform, it will make it even more unaffordable than before. ZARROLI: Over time, that could bring down prices at the upper end of the market. Richard Wight owns a real estate brokerage firm in New Jersey where home prices and property taxes are among the most expensive in the nation. He thinks the new law could affect properties costing a half million dollars or more. RICHARD WIGHT: My gut tells me that it's going to have an impact at some level. That is, I think it's probably going to be in the 450-plus range. ZARROLI: On the other hand, Wight says housing prices have been pretty strong lately. And with unemployment low, a lot of people still want to buy houses. And they're likely to keep doing so even if it's not as economical as it used to be. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

Its manufacturing sector is really strong. But that's not so in the U. S. where manufacturing jobs have crept back up only slightly after a steady decline over the past quarter century. So how does Germany pull this off? NPR's John Ydstie visited the country recently and joined us for the first of a series of reports on this issue. Hey, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So how much better is German manufacturing doing than American manufacturing? YDSTIE: Well, here's a data point. Manufacturing is nearly a quarter of the German economy. That's twice the share in the U. S. CHANG: Twice? That's huge. YDSTIE: Twice. CHANG: Why is there such a big difference? YDSTIE: Well, one big difference is the strength of the small and mid-sized German companies called the Mittelstand. The U. S. has lost a lot of these kinds of companies in past decades as firms have moved overseas looking for cheap labor. When I was in Germany, I visited several of these Mittelstand firms to find out what makes them so successful. And Schmittenberg Metal Works was one of them. I got a tour of their factory in Wuppertal where their machines stamp out millions of small metal parts mostly for the auto industry. CHRISTIAN RIEDER: On the left side, you get the coil in. And step by step, it runs through the tool and the good part on the other side. YDSTIE: That's Christian Reider, head of sales for Schmittenberg. And here's Yvonne Schmittenberg, the boss. YVONNE SCHMITTENBERG: They put it into a machine that softens a bit the edges. YDSTIE: Schmittenberg is the third generation of her family to run this company. SCHMITTENBERG: My grandfather was an engineer and toolmaker, and he had the technologic know-how, and my grandmother supplied the money. So, I mean, this was, yeah, a dream team, yeah (laughter). YDSTIE: Schmittenberg was founded in 1932. It survived the Second World War and right afterward began supplying parts for Germany's recovering auto industry. SCHMITTENBERG: Starting with Volkswagen, the Beetle - the first Beetle - was supplied by Schmittenberg company with the first weld nuts. YDSTIE: Weld nuts are small but critical auto parts. They're still Schmittenberg's specialty. Yvonne Schmittenberg is a petite woman with long, blond hair - an unusual CEO in the male-dominated industry. She was working in France in the 1990s when her grandmother, who was running the family business then, called and said it would be sold if Yvonne didn't come back home and take over. SCHMITTENBERG: I was working as an investment banker, which I liked a lot. However, blood is thicker than water, and after all, I was very much tempted by the entrepreneurial challenge, yes. YDSTIE: This is one of the strengths of German Mittelstand companies. They're often family-owned and focus on long-term success and not maximizing short-term profits. The part Schmittenberg makes are used by most of the world's automakers. Your car likely has some. Most are about the size of a silver dollar. They're welded to a car's body and used to bolt on things like seats and seat belts, says Christian Rieder. RIEDER: So they need to be resistant to really high-strength impacts, like a crash, for example. YDSTIE: The parts look simple, like the kind of thing you could make more cheaply in some low-wage country, but actually, they're very highly engineered. In fact, these weld nuts, or threaded plates, no bigger than the palm of your hand, are incredibly strong, says Rieder. RIEDER: On this threaded plate, you can hang four Mercedes S-Classes on. YDSTIE: Think about that. You could weld this small, threaded plate to a steel girder, then hang four large cars on it - the equivalent of eight tons - and the threads would not strip, the part would not fail. That attention to engineering and quality is a hallmark of German manufacturing, and it's what makes Schmittenberg and companies like it competitive. SCHMITTENBERG: Obviously, we are under pressure, and we have to fight for market shares every day, but we would never, ever shift to anywhere when the quality is in slightest question. YDSTIE: So what's the takeaway for U. S. companies? Focus on quality and take a long-term view. And Yvonne Schmittenberg has one more piece of advice - pay attention to your workforce. Don't presume every kid should go to college. Get them interested in making things. SCHMITTENBERG: I think this is so important to keep the youngsters interested in manufacturing, and this starts at the schools, to have the kids running around with open eyes, being interested in technical issues, see how things get done and really get them motivated to want to do that. YDSTIE: Now, the U. S. has struggled to make this kind of vocational training widely available, Ailsa. CHANG: Yeah. YDSTIE: We'll hear more about how the Germans do it tomorrow. CHANG: All right. So lots of examples here about what makes German manufacturing so strong, but can the U. S. embrace these same qualities and boost manufacturing here? YDSTIE: Well, I asked that question to Martin Baily, who studied this. He's an economist at the Brookings Institution and a former White House economic adviser. Baily says he thinks it would be a good thing if the U. S. had more manufacturing jobs and could provide work for people who aren't highly educated, but he thinks it would be very difficult to achieve. MARTIN BAILY: I would not advise U. S. companies or U. S. policymakers to try to replicate what's happened in Germany. In fact, I would look at Germany and say, you're going to have a tough time going forward. In fact, you, to some extent, already are having a tough time as some of the production shifts to Eastern Europe. CHANG: So he's saying even Germany won't be able to hang onto these manufacturing jobs. YDSTIE: Right. And Baily says a big reason is technology. It's advancing so fast that it will continue to replace even highly skilled manufacturing workers. And some Germans are also worried about this. Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a former economic official in the German government, now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Germany may soon find that it's too reliant on manufacturing. JEROMIN ZETTELMEYER: There is a very serious worry that we might lose our manufacturing edge over the next 10, 20 years and then be much in the same position that the U. S. is now except without having grown a new growth engine like the IT sector in the meantime. YDSTIE: So it's sort of grass looks greener situation. Even if Germany is really good at manufacturing, maybe it needs to try to emulate the U. S. and start looking beyond manufacturing to find post-industrial jobs to drive its economy. Still, this begs the question for the U. S. - how are we going to provide decent jobs for workers who once have been employed in manufacturing? CHANG: A question that's very hard to answer. That's NPR's John Ydstie. Thank you very much. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Ailsa. (SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN DOLLAR'S \"WUDAO\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Germany's economy is strong.

In the U. S. , it's about half that. American presidents have long envied Germany's ability to generate well-paying manufacturing jobs. NPR's John Ydstie found that a key element of Germany's success is their apprenticeship training program. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Nineteen-year-old apprentice Henrik Tillmann is sitting at a workbench at Hebmuller Aerospace. HENRIK TILLMANN: I prepare it for you, OK? YDSTIE: So you're going to build it from bottom up here. Oh, I see. TILLMANN: Yes. Yes. YDSTIE: Yeah. Tillmann is assembling a valve that will be used in a commercial aircraft galley kitchen or lavatory. Do you know what it - where it goes in the airplane? TILLMANN: Yeah, it's for the galleys. YDSTIE: Tillmann is training to be an industrial clerk. Valve assembly will not be part of his job, but he will be a better clerk, says his boss, Axel Hebmuller, because he'll know this valve inside out when he describes it for customers. AXEL HEBMULLER: I think it's much easier for the young people to understand what they're learning when they get a little practical work with it because then they can seeing what they learn at school. YDSTIE: As an apprentice, Tillmann spends 3 1/2 days here at work each week and 1 1/2 days at a government-funded school. Hebmuller, a co-founder of this firm, located near Dusseldorf, says small companies like his rely on apprentices. In fact, that's how he started his career. HEBMULLER: I was an apprentice at the local bank. This was where I got my economy degrees. YDSTIE: Hebmuller says only three of the 16 people who work for his company went to university. HEBMULLER: Even in some of the big, big companies in Germany, in the upper management levels, you have a lot of people that only had an apprentice and don't have any university degree. YDSTIE: Every year, about half a million young Germans enter the workforce in apprenticeship programs. They provide a steady stream of highly qualified industrial workers that help Germany maintain a reputation for producing top-quality products. Felix Rauner, a professor at the University of Bremen, is one of the world's leading authorities on apprenticeships and vocational education. He says U. S. presidents have noticed Germany's success. FELIX RAUNER: Every president of United States in the last 30 years, after becoming elected, said, oh, we should implement the apprenticeship system. YDSTIE: And Donald Trump is no exception. Last June at the White House, Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting the number of U. S. apprenticeships by nearly tenfold to 5 million. But experts doubt the move will have much impact because of a lack of funding. Professor Rauner says historically, the U. S. approach to vocational education has been ineffective, partly because it's often not directly connected to specific jobs at real companies. Also, says Rauner, U. S. society has stigmatized vocational education, so most American parents see college as the only path to status and a good career for their children. But in Germany, there's still lots of prestige attached when someone trained through apprenticeship achieves master status. RAUNER: If, for example, someone gets a master title, it would be published in the local newspaper, and there is a huge celebration. It is an important event. No one in Germany is interested if someone gets a master degree in a university. YDSTIE: Dr. Ludger Deitmer, Rauner's colleague at the University of Bremen, suggests the failure of the U. S. to widely provide this kind of training has hurt U. S. manufacturing. LUDGER DEITMER: Vocational training should be one of the medicines - a key medicines in how to make America great again. Why not? This is exactly what the country needs. YDSTIE: But one hurdle is getting American companies to buy in because of the cost of training an apprentice. In Germany, a firm bears the cost of in-house training and pays the apprentice a modest wage. DEITMER: But in the second year, they're already doing 60 percent of the workload of a fully skilled worker. So there is a return. YDSTIE: Deitmer says that cheap apprentice labor reduces the net training cost to the company to a little over $10,000. And he says the real payoff for the companies is that after three years, they've got a highly skilled worker. U. S. firms often complain about a lack of skilled workers, but the U. S. has struggled to create widespread apprenticeship programs. Felix Rauner says growing a viable American apprenticeship system will be difficult, partly because the U. S. has historically had a barrier between schools and business, and partly because of the fractured nature of U. S. education, with 50 states in charge. John Ydstie, NPR News.

You submit your resume. The interview goes well. And then the company asks, how much are you making in your current job? Well, states have started passing laws that ban companies from asking that question. California's law went into effect this week. Noel King from our Planet Money team looked into the history of this expanding legal trend. NOEL KING, BYLINE: Here's what I've always wondered - if a company asks, how much do you make at your current job, why not just lie, tack 20 grand onto your salary? I asked Emily Martin of the National Women's Law Center. EMILY MARTIN: So it's possible that a company could seek to confirm that information with your employer. And certainly if the new job found you had lied could take that into account and think, I actually don't want to - I want to rescind this offer because this applicant has shown herself to be untrustworthy. KING: OK, that is the public service portion of this story. Don't lie. You might get caught. The reason I called the National Women's Law Center is that this push to ban the salary question is part of the fight for equal pay. Here's what supporters say - asking women about their previous salaries gets them stuck making lower wages than men because they are often already making less than men. We know that. And if a new salary is based on a previous salary. . . MARTIN: It's one way in which the wage gap follows women and grows over time. KING: There's been an idea around for a long time to stop this - just don't let companies ask how much you're making. In Massachusetts in the mid-'90s, a woman named Ellen Story thought this should be a law. She'd recently been elected to the Statehouse. It was a big change from her town, Amherst. ELLEN STORY: Amherst, you know, everybody wears blue jeans and Birkenstocks. The Statehouse is very formal. I almost always wore a suit. So I was very conscious of dressing the part. KING: And she was very consciously trying to get this law passed. She and a co-sponsor started reaching out across the aisle, getting local business leaders on board. But she says some business groups like the National Chamber of Commerce didn't like the idea. They couldn't really say it publicly. STORY: I mean, you would just look like a fool if you said men always do a better job than women, so they have to be paid more. You know, that's just so blatantly untrue. KING: So they just said, we don't want politicians making rules on how and who we hire. So the bill got stuck in committee, where it stayed for nearly 20 years. Ellen kept it up. She got the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce on her side. And after years of this, she and her allies in the Statehouse got the speaker to put it up for a vote. STORY: If the speaker of the House had not been in favor of this it would never have come to the floor. KING: And who was the speaker? How did you get him or her on your side? STORY: Well, of course it's a him. KING: The answer, of course - she persisted. And times were changing. There were more women in the legislature. Hillary Clinton had run for president. In August 2016, the Massachusetts bill finally passed into law. And then other states followed - New York, Delaware, Oregon, also Puerto Rico.

The idea was to pay what they owe for the upcoming year ahead of the new tax law that limits the amount that they could deduct. Local governments were overwhelmed. And as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, there's still confusion. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The week after Christmas is usually a short and slow one for town officials in New Paltz, N. Y. , but not this time. Daniel Torres is the deputy town supervisor. DANIEL TORRES: When we opened town hall on Wednesday, we had almost a hundred voicemails from people inquiring about how they could prepay their taxes. ARNOLD: And the phone kept ringing. People were showing up. Torres says the town clerk's office only has a few people working in it. TORRES: The clerk's office was so overrun, after a certain while, we couldn't even pick up the phones anymore. ARNOLD: And there was a lot of confusion. The governor had said that people could prepay their taxes, but the IRS issued a statement saying that would only work if your taxes had already been assessed. Torres says, in New Paltz, the assessments had been done, but they were still at the printing facility in another town, and they hadn't been mailed out. So he and another town official scrambled over to the printing company. TORRES: It was 14 boxes that we threw in the back of a town car. It's actually an old police car, to be honest. And, you know, we drove them down. And by the time we did them, there was already hundreds of phone calls that had come in inquiring about it. ARNOLD: The reason that people want to prepay so badly is that it will save them money on next year's taxes. The tax act caps deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000. In states with higher tax rates like New Jersey, California and New York, even many middle-class and upper-middle-class people pay more than that $10,000. And those states also happen to vote more often for Democrats.

It's that state and local taxes are too high in states like New York, New Jersey and California. Meanwhile, many people who tried to prepay their taxes aren't sure if the IRS will recognize the move. Amanda Carew lives in Bloomingdale, Ill. Her husband, who works on a grounds crew at a federal laboratory, went down to the assessor's office last week to prepay their property taxes. AMANDA CAREW: He bundled up my son. They drove down there. They got there. And there was about 700 people in line. ARNOLD: But Carew says since the town only had a preliminary tax assessment, she's not sure whether the IRS will be OK with them prepaying. The family actually just moved into a smaller house to live in a town with a better school district. They're paying more taxes there. But because they can't deduct all of them, Carew estimates that she and her husband will be paying about $750 more in taxes under the new rules. CAREW: And knowing that we're going to be punished, to an extent, for picking a good school district - it feels incredibly unfair.

S. trade partner that's been criticized by President Trump. The president complains about German products sold in the United States much as he complains about China. Germany's exports do make almost half of the country's economic output compared with just 12 percent for the United States. So how does Germany pull that off? NPR's John Ydstie concludes a series. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The shipping area at Beko Technologies is a busy place. Boxes filled with filters, condensate drains and monitoring devices for compressed air systems are headed all over the world. Where is this going? RAINER STUTZEL: Italy, Italy. YDSTIE: Italy. Rainer Stutzel, a marketing executive at Beko, is giving us a look around the company's main location in Neuss, Germany, across the Rhine River from Dusseldorf. STUTZEL: Here we have the area where our compressed air filters are being produced. YDSTIE: Stutzel says compressed air is used everywhere in the global economy from gas stations to paint shops to hospitals. In the early 1980s, Beko's founder developed a condensate drain that removed corrosive moisture from compressed air systems. The company, which now has about 500 employees, later developed filters and other products that eliminate impurities from compressed air. STUTZEL: Actually, if you think, OK, you leave the condensate inside a compressed air system and the compressed air goes to a paint job place, like painting cars with spray guns, not only would the paint come out of the spray gun, but lots of drops of oil and water and dirt. And your car would look like hell. YDSTIE: That's why the world wants Beko's products. And the company provides them through four factories and several marketing subsidiaries spread across the globe. The result - half of Beko's production ends up outside Germany. Thousands of small and mid-sized German companies, like Beko technologies, are big exporters. They've helped create a $280 billion annual surplus in the export of goods for Germany. Meanwhile, the U. S. has a $750 billion deficit. Martin Baily, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it's partly because Germany decided after World War II to rebuild its economy through manufacturing and exports. Also, says Baily, German firms are more motivated to export than U. S. firms. MARTIN BAILY: Partly because it is a smaller economy. So their companies are much more oriented towards exporting, whereas, our companies are much more oriented towards selling in the domestic market. YDSTIE: The big U. S. domestic market is an advantage in many ways, says Baily. BAILY: But from a trade point of view, it means that most companies are sort of, like, oh, yeah, exports. Why would we export? YDSTIE: German exporters have also benefited from China's rapid growth, says economist Jeromin Zettelmeyer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. JEROMIN ZETTELMEYER: Germany is lucky that it has the type of industrial structure that produces goods that China needs. YDSTIE: Like high-quality machines for China's factories. So, in part, German companies have simply out competed companies from other countries. But what about the Trump administration's claim that Germany is cheating at trade? ZETTELMEYER: Yes, it's not cheating (laughter). YDSTIE: Zettelmeyer, who is also a former economic official in the German government, says the Trump administration does have a point about one advantage Germany has. ZETTELMEYER: You know, the only sense in which I think Germany could be accused of cheating - in quotation marks - is by being a member of the euro. YDSTIE: The euro has been Germany's currency since 1999. But if Germany still had the deutsche mark, its products would almost certainly be more expensive and less competitive in global markets. That's because the deutsche mark would reflect the real strength of the German economy. The euro doesn't. It reflects the less robust economy of the whole euro area, and therefore, German products priced in euros are less expensive and more competitive. There is another force that supports Germany's big trade surplus. Germany saves more than the U. S. , both at the personal and government level. The German government balances its federal budget or runs a surplus, while the U. S. government runs huge budget deficits. In other words, the U. S. borrows massively instead of saving like the Germans do, says Martin Baily. BAILY: They are very disciplined on that, so they don't run those deficits. Their saving is high so they get the conditions right under which they can have a trade surplus. YDSTIE: The U. S. has urged Germany to spend more on its infrastructure and other programs which could draw more imports into Germany and reduce its surplus. But many Germans are proud that what they produce is in demand around the world, and they're not inclined to save less or spend more to mollify their critics. John Ydstie, NPR News.

Venezuela has dubbed its version the petro. Analysts say cryptocurrencies may be a way for both Venezuela and Russia to sidestep financial sanctions. We're joined in the studio now by Monica de Bolle. She's senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Thanks so much for being with us. MONICA DE BOLLE: Thanks for having me. SIMON: What would give these cryptocurrencies any value? DE BOLLE: So the cryptocurrencies, as we call them - they don't have any intrinsic value. Their value is basically attached to trust and to, you know, the ability of being able to use them for online transactions. So this is the rationale for bitcoin, for Ethereum and for a host of other so-called cryptocurrencies out there. SIMON: And what would be the interest of the Russian and Venezuelan governments in doing this now? DE BOLLE: So the reason why they're interested in doing this is that cryptocurrencies - they basically operate outside the traditional payment system, as it were. So in the traditional payment system, if you want to follow the money, you know, whenever a transaction takes place, it's going to have some kind of reflection in the banking system. When you're in a cryptocurrency environment, things are totally different because all transactions are encrypted in such a way - and this is why they're called cryptocurrencies - you can no longer identify exactly the parties to a transaction, at least not by any, you know, sort of usual tracking ability. And, additionally, these are completely decentralized transactions. So they're extremely hard to track. So for countries like Venezuela and Russia that have had sanctions imposed on them, it's interesting to contemplate, you know, the hypothesis of operating in a cryptocurrency environment because then the kinds of transactions that they would conduct would not be able to be seen or followed in the typical way. SIMON: So in theory, if there's a company that wants to do business with Venezuela or Russia but can't because of sanctions, conceivably, they could if they did it in one of these cryptocurrencies. DE BOLLE: Yes, exactly. SIMON: Isn't that a risk for the companies involved? DE BOLLE: Well, it's certainly a risk. And then we have an additional level of questions. What Venezuela has actually announced in terms of its plans is that it would issue its own so-called cryptocurrency, the petro, and it would back this virtual currency by barrels of oil. SIMON: And they have a lot of that. DE BOLLE: And they have a lot of that. The problem from the point of view of a company or an investor that actually wants to buy, you know, or invest in this virtual currency - how do you actually ensure that the value of that currency is what it is because, again, you need trust in order for that to happen. And how can you trust, you know, a government such as the Maduro government? SIMON: Is Venezuela hoping to be able to do business but not be compelled to pay off the huge foreign debt they owe? DE BOLLE: It may be a bit of that, but it's also sort of trying to tap into the cryptocurrency craze. And so the Venezuelan government is basically trying, in a way, to capitalize on that by launching its own so-called cryptocurrency and therefore saying to investors, here. We also have a cryptocurrency for you to invest in. So in that way, they would be able to get the financing that they desperately need in order to keep, you know, the country going. SIMON: Does this strike you as practical? DE BOLLE: No. SIMON: For both countries? No? DE BOLLE: No. And the main reason - again, it goes back to trust because as a country, you can have whatever intent you wish. But you need somebody at the other end of this transaction to actually want to finance you. So you're back to the age-old question of, who's going to finance Venezuela, and who's going to finance Russia? SIMON: Monica de Bolle is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Thanks so much for being with us. DE BOLLE: Thanks for having me.

So this is the rationale for bitcoin, for Ethereum and for a host of other so-called cryptocurrencies out there. SIMON: And what would be the interest of the Russian and Venezuelan governments in doing this now? DE BOLLE: So the reason why they're interested in doing this is that cryptocurrencies - they basically operate outside the traditional payment system, as it were. So in the traditional payment system, if you want to follow the money, you know, whenever a transaction takes place, it's going to have some kind of reflection in the banking system. When you're in a cryptocurrency environment, things are totally different because all transactions are encrypted in such a way - and this is why they're called cryptocurrencies - you can no longer identify exactly the parties to a transaction, at least not by any, you know, sort of usual tracking ability. And, additionally, these are completely decentralized transactions. So they're extremely hard to track. So for countries like Venezuela and Russia that have had sanctions imposed on them, it's interesting to contemplate, you know, the hypothesis of operating in a cryptocurrency environment because then the kinds of transactions that they would conduct would not be able to be seen or followed in the typical way. SIMON: So in theory, if there's a company that wants to do business with Venezuela or Russia but can't because of sanctions, conceivably, they could if they did it in one of these cryptocurrencies. DE BOLLE: Yes, exactly. SIMON: Isn't that a risk for the companies involved? DE BOLLE: Well, it's certainly a risk. And then we have an additional level of questions. What Venezuela has actually announced in terms of its plans is that it would issue its own so-called cryptocurrency, the petro, and it would back this virtual currency by barrels of oil. SIMON: And they have a lot of that. DE BOLLE: And they have a lot of that. The problem from the point of view of a company or an investor that actually wants to buy, you know, or invest in this virtual currency - how do you actually ensure that the value of that currency is what it is because, again, you need trust in order for that to happen. And how can you trust, you know, a government such as the Maduro government? SIMON: Is Venezuela hoping to be able to do business but not be compelled to pay off the huge foreign debt they owe? DE BOLLE: It may be a bit of that, but it's also sort of trying to tap into the cryptocurrency craze. And so the Venezuelan government is basically trying, in a way, to capitalize on that by launching its own so-called cryptocurrency and therefore saying to investors, here. We also have a cryptocurrency for you to invest in. So in that way, they would be able to get the financing that they desperately need in order to keep, you know, the country going. SIMON: Does this strike you as practical? DE BOLLE: No. SIMON: For both countries? No? DE BOLLE: No. And the main reason - again, it goes back to trust because as a country, you can have whatever intent you wish. But you need somebody at the other end of this transaction to actually want to finance you. So you're back to the age-old question of, who's going to finance Venezuela, and who's going to finance Russia? SIMON: Monica de Bolle is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Thanks so much for being with us. DE BOLLE: Thanks for having me.

MICHAEL HOBBES: There's really very little evidence that millennials are any more spoiled or any more entitled than any generation of young people that came before. But there is a mountain of evidence that things are objectively harder for us. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hobbes wrote about the challenges his generation faces in a December article for Highline, which is put out by the Huffington Post. Its headline, \"Millennials Are Screwed,\" caught our attention this week. And we asked Hobbes to explain his pessimistic prediction. HOBBES: Healthcare, housing and education are more than five times more expensive than they were for our parents. There are fewer steady jobs. Wages have stagnated since the 1970s. I mean, I can go on and on and on. And so its weird that we're constantly talking about how millennials should do this differently, and millennials should do that differently. But we dont talk that much about - hey, the country around us can do some things differently, too. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you obviously believe that the baby boomers messed up your life? How did they do that? HOBBES: Well, I've gotten a lot of emails since the article came out from boomers that are saying, we've fallen off the ladder, too. And if you're 55 years old, there's a lot of discrimination for getting back into the workforce. But what we're seeing is that those impacts are concentrated on the young. So I think there's really three paradigm shifts. The first one is work has become much lower quality, basically - that there's fewer decent jobs now. Many of the jobs that are available are contingent work or sort of have been farmed out to contractors. Many fewer jobs provide things like pension, benefits or health care these days. The second big paradigm shift was this whole idea of personal responsibility - that to get any help from the government, you really have to earn it. And so starting in the 1980s, we started looking really, really, really closely at, what are welfare beneficiaries doing to earn their benefits? Meanwhile, of course, the boomer generation protected, very fiercely, their own benefits, right? So people over 65 have socialized medicine, and they get free money every month. Meanwhile, anybody under 65, there's almost no benefits available anymore. And the only benefits that are available are only available to people that have full-time work - things like unemployment benefits or the Earned Income Tax Credit. The third paradigm shift is around housing. If you want a high-skilled, high-paying job, you really have to move to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Boston - one of these areas. But housing costs have gotten so high in those cities, that it really swallows up any higher wages that you earn when you get there. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But let's look at another set of numbers. And I know this is not about everyone. But millennials control $2 trillion in liquid assets, and they can still look forward to a massive wealth transfer from their parents who are boomers. HOBBES: I think there are millennials that are doing fine. I think that when you talk about wealth transfer, what's really interesting is Americans over 62 are 80 percent white. And so when you look at these wealth transfers, white millennials are five times more likely to receive an inheritance than millennials of color. Forty-five percent of millennials are non-white. That's going to exacerbate inequality within the millennial generation. And so we're already seeing this where cities are becoming concentrations of wealth. Cities have better social services, better hospitals, better schools. And it's only the kids whose white parents can get them into those engines of opportunity, that are able to access those better services. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you think the responsibility of the boomer generation is at this moment? HOBBES: I think, really, to think about the ways that their kids have it harder than them. Right now, the growth is going to people primarily who own land, who own homes, who own stock. Those are all people that are disproportionately old. And we need to find ways, systematically, to share those gains with people that are younger. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And I hesitate to ask this, but what is the responsibility of the millennial generation? HOBBES: Well, I think there's a lot of anger from a lot of these people, especially who graduated during the recession. And so what we really need to do is channel that anger into systemic improvements to our situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Give me an example. HOBBES: Well, like, you think about welfare, for example. I mean, we talk a little bit about something like universal benefits or these kind of new forms of welfare. And we need to put these things in place. It's not impossible. Most other countries have this. A lot of it comes down to voting, but millennial turnout is very variable depending on the state. So in some places, it's as low as 30 percent, and in some places, it's as high as 70 percent. So what that really means is that there's procedures that keep us from voting, and we need to reform those and make it a lot easier for young people to vote. There's tons and tons and tons of systemic things that we can start doing and kind of unraveling everything that's happened in the last five decades. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Michael Hobbes is a contributing writer for Highline magazine from the Huffington Post. Thanks so much. HOBBES: Thanks.

More and more people pay for everything with a card or an app on their phones. In Philadelphia, that trend has led some restaurants to stop taking cash at all. Aaron Moselle reports from our member station WHYY. AARON MOSELLE, BYLINE: It's a sleepy morning at Bluestone Lane cafe in downtown Philly. A few customers are sitting. But most of them are in line to grab a latte and light snack before work. SAM FOOTE: I got the banana toast. It's really good. MOSELLE: Sam Foote is a Bluestone regular. He's a social worker in the same office building. So it's convenient. He also likes knowing it's cash free because he almost never has cash. FOOTE: I can't remember the last time I took out cash - probably, like, a few weeks ago, a month ago maybe, something like that. And it was, like, to give money to my father, I think, who, like, doesn't have Venmo. MOSELLE: Venmo is a popular mobile app that links to your bank account. General Manager Erica Ritchie says not having to handle cash is easier for her, too. ERICA RITCHIE: At the end of the day, not having to count out a drawer, worry about change. Someone runs out of quarters, you're running to the bank. MOSELLE: Bluestone went cashless last fall. A big reason, nearly 90 percent of customers were like Sam Foote, they never paid in cash. Bluestone's founder and CEO Nick Stone also says lines move faster when employees don't have to make change. NICK STONE: We're talking about someone ordering and paying roughly in 40 seconds, versus with cash, which is around a minute. MOSELLE: Stone says shaving that kind of time doesn't make him more money. His bottom line has actually increased because he's paying more debit and credit card fees. He does think it's better customer service. Ben Fileccia is president of Philadelphia's chapter of the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association. He says people are also using cash less often at more expensive restaurants. BEN FILECCIA: Going back 20 years, I would say 30 percent of your revenue would come in through cash, 70 percent would come in through credit cards. In my past few years, I would say that number has dropped to 5 to 10 percent. MOSELLE: Still, Fileccia says cash will never completely disappear from the food scene. FILECCIA: You know, we see a lot of guests that will pay for a meal with a credit card but will always leave a cash tip. And I think people like doing that. People like palming a bartender a 20 or palming their server a 10 or palming the busboy a couple of bucks. MOSELLE: Fileccia says there are also people who use cash to keep their meal off the books, say, if they're having an affair.

Tenant advocates worry that the problem could get worse under the new tax law, along with potential cuts in housing aid. NPR's Pam Fessler recently went to Wisconsin, where the supply of affordable housing is getting squeezed. HEINER GIESE: If you look at this huge vacant lot, this was all occupied at one time. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: Heiner Giese is driving around an old neighborhood on the north side of Milwaukee past modest single-family homes and duplexes. But almost every block also has a few empty lots, and many of the houses that are still standing are boarded up, waiting to be torn down or worse. GIESE: Yeah. This place burned right here to the next. This place burned, I think. FESSLER: Giese is a local landlord. He says in recent years, many other landlords have lost or abandoned houses here because they can't pay their mortgage and other bills. GIESE: I don't know what this is here. This one says for sale. FESSLER: He says it's especially hard for landlords to maintain these houses if tenants get behind on their rent. And that's a big problem around here. A recent census found that more than 50,000 families in Milwaukee County had to spend more than half their income on housing. And that's increasingly the case for low-income families nationwide as the stock of affordable housing shrinks. ROB DICK: There is no county in the U. S. where you can work a minimum wage job and afford a two-bedroom apartment. FESSLER: Rob Dick runs the housing authority in nearby Dane County, home of Madison, the state capital. Average rent for a small apartment there is almost $1,100 a month. So he does the math. DICK: Seven twenty-five times 40 times four. . . FESSLER: And comes up with this. DICK: Three minimum wage jobs full time can't afford a two-bedroom in Dane County. FESSLER: Dick says the county needs to build a thousand new affordable units a year to keep up with demand, but that there's no way that's going to happen. And he fears the new tax law will make matters worse. Lower tax rates mean credits used to encourage developers to build affordable housing are less attractive. On top of that, subsidies for renters are also at risk. House Speaker Paul Ryan has been eager to impose work requirements and time limits on federal housing aid, which he spoke about recently on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAUL RYAN: People want able-bodied people who are on welfare to go to work. They want us to get people out of poverty, into the workforce. That's good for them. That's good for the economy. It's good for the federal budget. FESSLER: President Trump threw some cold water on that proposal this past weekend, saying that any welfare changes would need Democratic support, which is highly unlikely. Still, the Trump administration has proposed cutting billions of dollars in housing aid for low-income families, and Congress is under pressure to reduce spending because of growing deficits. Sue Popkin of the Urban Institute says as it is, there isn't enough housing aid to go around. SUSAN POPKIN: Only 1 in 5 households in the country who are eligible for assistance actually get it. FESSLER: And Popkin thinks those numbers could get worse. She notes that most rental housing built today is for the high-end market, not for low and middle-income families. U. S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson has said that more affordable housing might be funded in a new infrastructure bill, but Popkin is not optimistic. POPKIN: Everything that is coming out of this Congress and this administration is about cuts and shrinking and moving people off. And right now, I worry there's nowhere for them to go. FESSLER: Heiner Giese, the landlord, is also worried and thinks some government or nonprofit help is needed. He understands that some people just don't have enough money to pay the rent, but he says all sides are being pressured. GIESE: It's obviously very difficult for the tenants. It's very difficult for the landlords also because it's stressful. And ultimately, the landlords lose money. FESSLER: And if they lose enough, he says, that's one less affordable place to live.

That's what two economics professors are proposing, that Uncle Sam provide each American newborn with a trust fund. The amount would vary depending on the parent's wealth, with an average of about $20,000. NPR's John Ydstie reports the professors floating this idea say it could help boost opportunity. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Duke University professor William Darity Jr. says there's a huge wealth gap in the United States. He points out that the richest 1 percent of Americans hold nearly 40 percent of the nation's wealth. Meanwhile, nearly a third of Americans have no accumulated wealth outside the value of their home. And wealth gives you opportunity, says professor Darity. WILLIAM DARITY JR: Wealthier families have the capacity to purchase homes in higher amenity neighborhoods. They have the capacity to provide their kids with higher quality education. YDSTIE: And he says wealthier families have assets they can draw on to handle emergencies like the loss of a job or a serious medical condition, emergencies that can devastate families with no assets. Darity says there's often a bias against providing help for those struggling families because they're viewed as having been irresponsible or having made bad choices. That's why he says providing a trust fund for infants makes sense. DARITY JR: You can't blame the infants for the condition that they are born into. And so let's do something about that when they have an opportunity to reach adulthood. YDSTIE: Darity and his partner, Darrick Hamilton of The New School in New York City, suggests providing trust funds of between $500 and $50,000, depending on the wealth of the family. The trust funds would be guaranteed to grow at the rate of inflation plus 1 percent a year. When a child reached 18 years of age, he or she would get access to the funds. DARITY JR: My general impulse is to be non-paternalistic and to give the young people as much discretion as possible. I think it would be vital in this context for them to be given training and preparation for management of their accounts. YDSTIE: Darity acknowledges that politically it might be necessary to limit use of the funds to things like paying for education, purchasing a home or starting a business. Tyler Cowen, an economics professor at George Mason University, is skeptical of the idea. He thinks the money would be more useful for children at a younger age. TYLER COWEN: By the time a lot of people reach 18, they're already in quite a disadvantaged position. So I would instead prefer to extend the earned income tax credit, say, for working parents who had young children at home. I think that would help more. YDSTIE: The earned income tax credit, which supplements low-wage work, has been part of the U. S. social safety net since 1975. Cowen is also skeptical of giving the money to 18-year-olds. COWEN: I don't think there's a case for arguing we would do better to let everyone be spending the money at 18. That's really the age when you're often most irresponsible. YDSTIE: Professor Darity says he'd be open to delaying access to the trust fund until the young adults are a bit older. As for just increasing the earned income tax credit, Darity says that's an income program that doesn't necessarily build wealth, which is the focus of his proposal. DARITY JR: Wealth gives you a much wider range of opportunities and options than income. Wealthier families can have a greater impact on the political process. Greater economic wealth gives you greater civic wealth. YDSTIE: Darity says he estimates his proposal would cost around $80 billion a year, or about 2 percent of the federal budget. But he argues it would increase skills, investment and business creation that would boost the economy. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

But his budget proposal last year floated steep cuts to many federal rural economic development programs. NPR's Kirk Siegler has been visiting a remote corner of Idaho timber country where federal dollars have been used to diversify the economy. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Logging will always be in Jeff Borders' blood. JEFF BORDERS: One of the things I love to hear is the trucks, you know? SIEGLER: He grins with pride watching the rigs rumble down the mountain into the river-cut canyon here onto Highway 12. Next stop - the mills down in Lewiston. BORDERS: I started getting into it when I was just out of high school - so 18. Dad got me in on the company that he was working for, hooking logs. SIEGLER: His dad, his grandpa - everyone around here worked in the woods. It's what you did. BORDERS: Growing up, when I got out of school, it was - you worked in the sawmill. You drove log truck, or you worked in the woods, you know, logging unless you wanted to drive to Lewiston or find something else to really do. There wasn't a whole lot for guys to do. SIEGLER: I've met a lot of guys like Jeff Borders here over the last year who've told me there's been a lot of changes in the industry, though. Mechanization has eliminated jobs. Cheaper Canadian logs flooded the market. Two mom and pop saw mills near Orofino, Jeff's hometown, recently closed. BORDERS: You know, it's kind of a dying industry in some sense. I mean, there's. . . SIEGLER: So when the opportunity came along to get on as a welder at a newer manufacturing company in town, Jeff's dad urged him to take it. BORDERS: He was happy to see that I got out of the woods, though. You know, he spent his whole life working in the woods. And you know, there's not much for retirement. You really got to make your own retirement. (SOUNDBITE OF WELDING)SIEGLER: Jeff Borders builds jet boats. That's his welding you hear. These are the boats that go really fast, skimming over shallow water, perfect for the wide Clearwater River here. He had to be retrained, he says, but it was pretty quick, and he likes the more steady paycheck. (SOUNDBITE OF WELDING)SIEGLER: SJX Jet Boats is one of several businesses that Orofino attracted as the town has tried to diversify away from just timber and into what locals call recreation manufacturing - jet boats for Idaho's trout streams, rifles and scopes for elk hunting. SJX shares space with other newer companies in a building called the Orofino Business Park. The town built it with the help of a grant from the U. S. Economic Development Administration. CHRIS ST GERMAINE: And that has been full since construction. So it has complete occupancy, and it's generating 40 jobs in the community. SIEGLER: And that's a big deal in a town of 3,000 that's in one of the poorest counties in Idaho. Chris St. Germaine runs the county's one-person economic development office. They've leveraged a lot of federal rural development aid lately - money to retrain laid-off mill workers - USDA Rural Development grants that helped finance a wastewater treatment plant. ST GERMAINE: When these infrastructure projects - you're talking about $3, $5 $10 million projects. It's unattainable for communities without assistance. And these aren't all grant programs, either. They're loan and grant programs. SIEGLER: Most years, the USDA spends some $30 billion on rural development. In President Trump's preliminary budget last year, he proposed a 20 percent cut to the agency. The administration also wants to cut some rural grant and loan programs and eliminate the agency that helped build the Orofino Business Park. ST GERMAINE: I think there's a gap in the understanding in Washington, D. C. , and policymakers of what rural needs really are. SIEGLER: In remarks this week aimed mostly at farmers, the president talked about his push to expand rural broadband and promoted the tax cuts that he says will spur investment in rural America. This kind of talk resonates in the Idaho mountains where there's a long history of fights with the federal government over logging on public land. Clearwater County voted 75 percent for Trump. And despite the timber declines, you still see mills running and lumber yards with big cranes stacking hundreds of ice-covered logs. (SOUNDBITE OF CRANE CLANKING)SIEGLER: People work long, hard hours, and they talk proudly about supplying the wood that helps cities boom. But Tom Vilsack, the former Democratic Iowa governor and agriculture secretary, says the federal government plays a huge role in making this happen. TOM VILSACK: It takes an understanding of how to speak about folks in rural areas, not speaking down to them, not saying, I'm from the government; I'm here to help. SIEGLER: A frustrated Vilsack left Washington last year feeling like the federal government, no matter who's in charge, couldn't communicate all the good it does in rural America. At SJX Jet Boats, the extremely busy owner, Steve Stajkowski, says he got federal grant money to go to a big boat show in Germany, which he credits for a boon in his overseas exports. STEVE STAJKOWSKI: These grants were, you know, giving us the opportunity to reach well beyond the streets and mountains of Idaho. SIEGLER: But the talk of proposed cuts from Washington aren't really being followed that closely here. Stajkowski mostly shrugs them off. STAJKOWSKI: The budget cuts - yeah, I mean, they're going to affect some but benefit in other directions, I'm sure. SIEGLER: As he sees it, when one door shuts, another one tends to open.

But that good news story was undercut later in the same day when word trickled out that Walmart is closing 63 of its Sam's Club warehouse stores and laying off thousands of workers. We've asked NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie to join us to sort this out. So, John, thanks for joining us, first of all. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Happy to be here, Michel. MARTIN: Well, Walmart seems to be feeling generous with some of its employees and laying off others. And what role is the tax cut playing in this, if any? YDSTIE: Well, there's no doubt that Walmart and many other companies are very happy that the top corporate tax rate was slashed from 35 to 21 percent. It'll save Walmart billions of dollars a year. And it certainly makes it easier for the company to raise its minimum wage to 11 bucks an hour. But there are other forces at work here that have little to do with the tax cut. MARTIN: Well, what are those forces? YDSTIE: Well, the U. S. unemployment rate is down to just over 4 percent, very close to full employment. So Walmart needs to raise wages just to attract and hang onto employees. And there's evidence that that helps. Walmart boosted wages and training back in 2015. And according to the analysts, that helped them increase same-store sales continuously since then. MARTIN: Well, that invites the question of why Walmart is closing 10 percent of its Sam's Clubs, and as we understand it, that that means laying off some 11,000 workers. YDSTIE: Yeah. Well, even though the overall economy is strong, for traditional retailers, there are challenges like online shopping. Walmart says those Sam's Club stores were underperforming. The company does say it is going to convert about a dozen of them to e-commerce fulfillment centers, so some of those workers may be rehired. MARTIN: But as we said earlier, it's not just Walmart saying the tax cut is motivating them to boost wages and investment. AT&T and Wells Fargo, just to name a couple of companies that people may have heard in the news, are saying the same things or similar things. How should we assess what they're saying? YDSTIE: Well, I think in the case of both of them, there are additional factors at play. For one thing, both have a reason to try to curry favor in Washington. MARTIN: Because Wells Fargo is being penalized by the government for deceiving customers. And President Trump has threatened even more punishments. YDSTIE: Exactly. So Wells Fargo has an interest in saying the tax cut is the reason it's boosting wages for its employees, precisely what the president predicted would happen, in order to gain favor with Trump and avoid more penalties. That said, Wells Fargo is also competing for workers in a strong economy, so they might have boosted wages whether there was a tax cut or not. MARTIN: But what about AT&T? YDSTIE: We don't know for sure. But remember, AT&T wants to buy Time Warner, but the Trump administration is blocking that deal in court. So AT&T could be thinking that saying the tax cut motivated the company to pay big bonuses to workers might just get the Trump administration to ease its opposition to the deal. MARTIN: So the economy is pretty strong right now. Is that the result of these tax cuts? YDSTIE: Well, business confidence in the U. S. has risen in the past year, partly anticipating the tax cut and also in response to regulatory restraint by the Trump administration. So that may have boosted the U. S. economy a bit, but the economy was already on a solid foundation. And a good deal of the recent pickup is due to the very positive global economic picture, which has little, if anything, to do with U. S. taxes. MARTIN: That's NPR economic correspondent John Ydstie.

But first, we want to talk about the cost of a government shutdown, so we called David Wessel. He is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. That's a centrist research institution here in Washington, D. C. , and he was nice enough to let us call him at home. David Wessel, thank you so much for joining us. DAVID WESSEL: Good to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: So we're hearing that it actually costs money to shut the government down, which seems counter-intuitive on some level. So first, is that true? And if it is, why does it cost money? WESSEL: Well, it is true. Of course, there's a lot of time spent getting ready for a shutdown - just like if you have a vacation house and you shut it down for the winter, you have to turn off the water to the pipes. The federal government is a huge machine, and if you want to stop it in mid-action, it - you have to spend time turning the dials and figuring out who works and making sure that the right people are working and the right ones aren't. And I found a Government Accountability Office report from 1990, which if you adjusted for inflation, says that if the shutdown is three weekdays, it costs $80 million in administrative costs and $320 million in lost revenue to the government. MARTIN: So those are actual hard costs. Are there economic impacts that go beyond the actual apparatus of the government? WESSEL: Yes. Of course, the biggest impact is on the federal employees themselves. Even those people who are required to work will not get paid in real time. In the past, Congress has always said, well, we'll pay you later. That may happen this time. We don't know. But then if you look beyond that, there are government services that are not being provided. You can't sell an airplane, for instance. You can't get a question answered at the Internal Revenue Service. There are all sorts of services that people can't get. The economists who add this up say it works out to about $2 billion a day in lost output to the economy every day the shutdown persists. MARTIN: Now what if this is resolved before Monday, when most people go to work? I mean, obviously, all kinds of people work throughout the weekend. But let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that the bulk of the workforce works that normal Monday-through-Friday schedule. If they somehow manage to figure all this out today before most people go to work, does the same thing apply? WESSEL: No, it's basically a blip. It's unfortunate. It's disruptive, but it won't make much difference. It matters if this thing persists, particularly if it persists through February 1 when the next payday comes. MARTIN: The last time the government shut down was 2013. So presumably, you know, we know what there is to know from that experience. Do you think that the same factors will apply or is there anything different about this that would cause us to have a different outcome? WESSEL: Well, one thing is that the Trump administration has allowed more people to go to work and allowed more things to happen. The national parks are apparently open. They just don't have staff. So that would mute the effect. But basically, economists estimate that it'll shave about a tenth of a percentage point off of growth of GDP each week the government's closed - $2 billion a day. I don't see any reason why that should be any different than it was in 2013. MARTIN: Before we let you go, David, do you have any sort of international comparison here? Is there any other developed economy - a peer economy of the United States - that has experienced this kind of disruption to government operations in the last - I don't know - whatever time frame you want to pick - five years or 10 years? WESSEL: I think the answer is no. This is a case of American exceptionalism. MARTIN: That's David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. David, thanks so much for speaking with us. WESSEL: You're welcome.

That is 32 million people. What's more, it's expected that half of American workers will either be freelancers or contractors within a decade. These figures come from an NPR/Marist poll released today, and they represent a remarkable shift in nearly every industry, a shift that means many workers will lose the benefits associated with full-time employment. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports as part of our weeklong look at the rise of the freelance workforce. DARYL SHETTERLY: This was a stamping factory back in the early 1900s. I think the building itself is a little more than a hundred years old. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Amid the relics of an old factory in Wheeling, W. Va. , a law firm called Orrick has set up a new business model for how to get legal work done. Daryl Shetterly is director of Orrick's analytics division. On the way to his office, he points to faded photos. SHETTERLY: And these are folks - none of whom I've met - but they've all clearly had some history in the building. NOGUCHI: The photo captions show the workers' years of service measured in decades. In the building today, workers can be hired for just a few days. SHETTERLY: Contractors are hired by the hour. We pay them when we're using them, and that is our ability to scale. And so we might have 30 people working today, and tomorrow we might have 80. NOGUCHI: This used to be, like, a factory, right? And do you consider it sort of a factory now? SHETTERLY: It is a factory in that we work to drive efficiency and discipline into every mouse click. NOGUCHI: This division of Orrick was set up as a kind of processing center. Using artificial intelligence and cheaper lawyers speeds up routine tasks such as sorting and tagging documents. The operation is a testament to how contract work is expanding into every corner of the economy. More lawyers are temping or using online platforms to match them with clients. The legal field, in other words, is fragmenting. Gillian Hadfield studies legal markets at the University of Southern California. GILLIAN HADFIELD: Lots of people go into law expecting that they're headed to a secure, well-paying, intellectually satisfying, high-prestige job. And lots of those people find out that's not what they're headed to. NOGUCHI: Hadfield says the speed with which business evolves these days forces everyone else to respond quickly. Employers need specialized expertise on demand, just not for the long term. It's not just business driving the trend. The NPR/Marist poll found a large majority of freelancers are free agents by choice. John Vensel is a contract attorney at Orrick who grew up a few miles from Wheeling on the other side of the Pennsylvania state line. In his 20s, he was a freelance paralegal by day, gig musician by night. JOHN VENSEL: I actually wanted to be a rock star (laughter). NOGUCHI: Now 47, there are no edgy vestiges of a former rocker, only a family man cooing over cell phone photos. VENSEL: Those are my babies. That's Grace, and that's Gabe. NOGUCHI: In the two decades in between, Vensel worked full-time corporate jobs, but he was laid off in 2010 on the eve of his graduation from his night school law program. That year, he graduated with huge piles of debt into one of the worst job markets in decades. VENSEL: It was terrible. It was like a nuclear bomb went off when, you know, my son had just been born. It was pretty bad. You know, we've been kind of recovering ever since. NOGUCHI: For a time, Vensel commuted three hours round-trip for a full-time job in Pittsburgh. But more recently, he quit and took up contracting to stay near home in Wheeling. VENSEL: So like, my father - he's in the hospital right now, which is, like, five minutes away. And I'm getting updates on my phone. Now it's just buzzing. And if I need to be there, I can be there in five minutes. NOGUCHI: He says contract work is today's economic reality. VENSEL: You're trading for that flexibility. You're trading for these opportunities to get your feet wet in certain areas and to try them out as they're trying you out. NOGUCHI: And is that something you would like to do - is ultimately get a full-time position? VENSEL: Yeah, absolutely. NOGUCHI: But that may be increasingly difficult. Within a decade, many labor economists believe freelancers will outnumber full-timers. VENSEL: My father retired from the post office after 35 years. Yeah, I mean, that's just - we don't live in that world anymore. He has a pension. You know, we don't have pensions anymore. It's a totally different world. NOGUCHI: A short distance from Orrick's offices, Glenn Elliott is thinking about the implications of that different world. Elliott is the mayor of Wheeling, who himself once worked as a contractor at a law firm. GLENN ELLIOTT: I only got paid if I did work. NOGUCHI: He says contract work holds both great promise and great peril for the city. On the plus side, Elliott sees more economic opportunities if it can attract more companies like Orrick. On the other hand, Mayor Elliott worries how this also changes the relationship between employers and workers. ELLIOTT: I don't think that loyalty necessarily exists between employers and their employees that used to be there. NOGUCHI: Those looser ties also shift more responsibility to the contract workers. They must handle retirement saving and health insurance on their own. ELLIOTT: But some people, like, despite their best efforts just aren't going to be successful in doing that. And what's going to happen to those who fall through the cracks? The 1950s model of retirement and getting your pension check every year from your company is not a realistic model for a lot of people increasingly. NOGUCHI: Elliott says the public safety net is already strained by the area's opioid problems, among other things. A future where fewer workers have benefits won't help. The country needs to be having these discussions, he says, but isn't. And with the workforce changing so quickly, the need to answer those questions is urgent. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Wheeling, W.

This emerging workforce is primarily male. And according to an NPR/Marist poll, 65 percent of such workers are men. Young contract workers and not just men start their careers in a very different place than their parents did, one that's more flexible but a lot more unpredictable, as NPR's Uri Berliner reports. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Alex Belfiori has a big day coming up later this week about his job and his future. He'll walk into a conference room with his boss. ALEX BELFIORI: At that point, we're going to sit down and have a discussion about it. I was told initially when I took this job that there were no guarantees for me getting hired on full-time. A lot of it has to do with if there's money in the budget or not. BERLINER: For the past eight months, Belfiori has been taking care of tech needs at the DICK'S Sporting Goods headquarters near Pittsburgh. He likes the job pretty well. It's hands-on, making sure that projectors, TVs, computers and audio equipment are all working properly - pays decent, about $20 an hour - but not great. So when he sits down with his boss, he hopes to find out that he's nailed a staff position, a job that's more challenging and financially rewarding. BELFIORI: I am nervous about it, but at the same time, I'm always looking for new jobs and keeping my options open. And there are a lot of tech jobs in Pittsburgh, so I'm not afraid to move something else if the timing's right and if it pays more. BERLINER: The 28-year-old Belfiori is like a lot of millennial workers. BELFIORI: I'm actually on my fifth job since graduating college. BERLINER: He earns enough to pay the rent, make his car and student loan payments and put up to $50 a month into a retirement account. Belfiori's experience mirrors what other contract workers told us in the NPR/Marist poll. There's plenty of work available, but careers with a solid future, something to build a life around - that's much more elusive. ANTHONY CARNEVALE: Yes, it is the way of the world now. BERLINER: That's Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. CARNEVALE: Everybody - the employers and the workers - have to be more selfish in this economy. If you're an employer, you don't want responsibility for people. You want contract employees so that when business is good and production is up, you use those people. BERLINER: When production goes down, Carnevale says, contract workers are shown the door. CARNEVALE: They live in a world in which when times are good, they do very well as contractors - in fact, do better than line workers and have more independence and more entrepreneurial opportunities. But when business goes down, they are the first fired. BERLINER: This is a volatile, new world, and it mostly affects men. Nearly two-thirds of contract workers in the NPR/Marist poll are male. That's a much bigger proportion than in the overall workforce. Researchers don't know exactly why this is happening. One reason seems to be that contract jobs are more common in male-dominated fields like construction, finance and IT. Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton, says discrimination against women may also play a role. ALAN KRUEGER: Traditional workers are covered by the Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex and other factors. Independent contractors are not covered by the Civil Rights Act. BERLINER: That's just one of many areas where contractors don't enjoy the same protections or benefits as people in traditional jobs. Contract workers don't get unemployment pay or worker's comp if they're hurt on the job. If they do get benefits like health care or a retirement plan, they're skimpy. Georgetown's Carnevale says contract workers have to build their own safety net. CARNEVALE: You are on your own, and the convenient and tempting assumption to believe that your employer - that the boss will take care of you is not something the boss has the power to do even if he or she wants to. BERLINER: Alex Belfiori, the 28-year-old contract worker - he's taking a couple of steps to build some financial security, one that's very practical and another that's riskier, more adventurous. BELFIORI: I help fix computers on the side, and I'm also invested in cryptocurrency. BERLINER: Cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In June, he took the plunge. BELFIORI: So I was looking at that and decided to put a couple thousand into it from my savings. BERLINER: Since then, prices have bounced around a lot. Belfiori is still ahead on his investment. He's not counting on cryptocurrency to achieve the American dream or fund his retirement. Maybe it'll pay for a nice vacation. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

But when business goes down, they are the first fired. BERLINER: This is a volatile, new world, and it mostly affects men. Nearly two-thirds of contract workers in the NPR/Marist poll are male. That's a much bigger proportion than in the overall workforce. Researchers don't know exactly why this is happening. One reason seems to be that contract jobs are more common in male-dominated fields like construction, finance and IT. Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton, says discrimination against women may also play a role. ALAN KRUEGER: Traditional workers are covered by the Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination based on race, sex and other factors. Independent contractors are not covered by the Civil Rights Act. BERLINER: That's just one of many areas where contractors don't enjoy the same protections or benefits as people in traditional jobs. Contract workers don't get unemployment pay or worker's comp if they're hurt on the job. If they do get benefits like health care or a retirement plan, they're skimpy. Georgetown's Carnevale says contract workers have to build their own safety net. CARNEVALE: You are on your own, and the convenient and tempting assumption to believe that your employer - that the boss will take care of you is not something the boss has the power to do even if he or she wants to. BERLINER: Alex Belfiori, the 28-year-old contract worker - he's taking a couple of steps to build some financial security, one that's very practical and another that's riskier, more adventurous. BELFIORI: I help fix computers on the side, and I'm also invested in cryptocurrency. BERLINER: Cryptocurrency like bitcoin. In June, he took the plunge. BELFIORI: So I was looking at that and decided to put a couple thousand into it from my savings. BERLINER: Since then, prices have bounced around a lot. Belfiori is still ahead on his investment. He's not counting on cryptocurrency to achieve the American dream or fund his retirement. Maybe it'll pay for a nice vacation.

Some 32 million Americans now rely on freelance or contract work for their primary income. That's according to an NPR/Marist Poll released this week. And fewer than half of these workers receive benefits like sick leave or retirement savings. NPR's Yuki Noguchi explores what that means for the future of the social safety net. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Matt Nelson has learned to love his freelance Web developer life. It allows him to split time between pursuing passions and making a living. But it didn't start out that way. MATT NELSON: I didn't get into freelancing personally by choice, you know? I could not find a job for the life of me. I couldn't get an email back or a phone call for the life of me. NOGUCHI: Nelson volunteers as leader of the Madison Wisconsin chapter of Spark, a networking group started by the Freelancers Union. His group is made up of 350 varied freelancers. NELSON: Lawyers, realtors. We've got a guy that does bug farming consulting. We had an astrobiologist. NOGUCHI: They exchange tips and share stories, often of the indignities they suffer. NELSON: I was stiffed by an NGO that was out of state for not quite enough money to make it worth my while to go to small claims court Nebraska. (Laughter). And, as a freelancer, that's tough. NOGUCHI: Nelson, who is 41, says he and his freelance and contractor friends often feel they're flying solo without support to fall back on. NELSON: We really don't have much of a social safety net. And, you know, that's terrifying. NOGUCHI: This is a vexing problem for freelancers and policymakers. Virginia Senator Mark Warner worries workers without benefits will strain tight public budgets even more. He says freelancers ought to be able to get benefits that they can keep, regardless where they work. Warner sponsored a bill to encourage experimentation with those types of programs. MARK WARNER: If we don't have a social contract for this workforce, if we don't have social insurance that moves with the workers then I feel like the economic discontent and economic insecurity that comes from working with no safety net under you would rise dramatically. NOGUCHI: Rene Flores, a Los Angeles freight truck driver, is living that reality. Trucking deregulation turned most drivers into contractors four decades ago. But Flores says the company didn't treat him as a free agent. RENE FLORES: (Through interpreter) They always assigned me the work they wanted to do. They would always send me where they wanted to go. They always set the price. I never did. NOGUCHI: Being a contractor, he says, only meant he had to pay for his own gas and truck repairs, and the company didn't give him health insurance, which became a huge problem when he fell on the job three years ago. FLORES: (Speaking Spanish). NOGUCHI: Flores developed a giant hernia but endured the pain without medical care. He complained about the lack of benefits in a newspaper interview and got fired. He took a new job but found he couldn't work without surgery. So Flores borrowed $10,000 from friends to get a cheaper surgery in Mexico. He returned to work still bandaged and bleeding. FLORES: (Through interpreter) I'm also worried about my family. I don't have the resources to keep going for two more weeks and pay my rent and my bills. NOGUCHI: The toll of insecurity isn't just financial. CAROLINA SALAS: Being a freelancer, you really have to, really have to be on top of your emotional and mental health. NOGUCHI: Carolina Salas is 32 and freelances in New York City helping medical practices attract new patients. Salas says the stress and demands of freelance work pinched her sciatic nerve, immobilizing her for six months. SALAS: As a contractor, the expectations of you are much higher than if you were an employee. They're moving so quickly, and they have so little consideration or awareness for you that they sometimes forget that you're actually human. NOGUCHI: She says defending one's humanity is hard. Clients control the purse, after all, and there are fewer legal protections for contractors compared to full-time employees. SALAS: People are not talking about this because people say it's the sexy thing to do, everybody's doing it. It's, like, actually, no. If you just start talking to people and you start talking to them about their emotional state and their sense of self-worth, they'll tell you that they've taken a hit and that it's hard. NOGUCHI: Salas emigrated from Venezuela and has freelanced for eight years. In that time she's learned to track her time and expenses, push back on unrealistic deadlines and save for retirement and emergencies. But she says not all freelancers are equally equipped. SALAS: That is what concerns me because I come from a place where there was not much of a middle class, and I know what that looks like. And so I'm not saying that, you know, the United States is going in that direction, but I'm very familiar with inequality. NOGUCHI: Those worries are not unfounded, says Sara Horowitz, founder of the Freelancers Union. SARA HOROWITZ: There are really big risks in freelancing because the income is so episodic and freelancers aren't entitled to unemployment insurance, and this is really bad for low-wage workers in particular. NOGUCHI: Horowitz says freelancers need to band together. She's an advocate for things like union-sponsored health insurance. The Freelancers Union, for example, has offered it to its members for two decades. HOROWITZ: The answer is to build this safety net that's universal for everybody, not to say, this is only for very low-wage workers, nor is it to say, this is for highly skilled professional workers, but actually, they're all going through this together. NOGUCHI: The best antidote to fear, she says, is to create a new social safety net where freelancers can rely on each other. And with a growing group of tens of millions of Americans freelancing, she says, that's also a powerful voting bloc. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

A new NPR/Marist poll finds that 20 percent of American workers are contract workers. That means they can see their pay vary greatly from month to month. NPR's Jim Zarroli caught up with a Colorado family trying to keep up with the bills in a world where their incomes regularly fluctuate. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Tom Hansen and Gina Barr are frying mozzarella sticks for their two teenage sons in their kitchen in the Denver suburb of Englewood. TOM HANSEN: And I have prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella sticks. I don't know if you've had one of these, but. . . ZARROLI: The boys have just come home from school, and the two-bedroom apartment suddenly seems a lot louder. One of the parents is almost always around when the kids get home. Gina, who's 37, works as a shift manager at Starbucks and starts work way before dawn. GINA BARR: I start work at 4:30 (laughter). Adjusting to that schedule was - you know, there definitely was an adjustment period. But I quickly adapted to it. ZARROLI: Tom, at 39, works evenings as a banquet server at a nearby restaurant. It's not a full-time job. He works when he gets called in. He usually knows a week in advance what shifts he'll get but not always. HANSEN: I probably pick up I'd say about a quarter of my shifts on a - kind of a last-minute basis where there's two days' or less knowledge. ZARROLI: It sounds like you almost always say yes. Why is that? HANSEN: It's - you know, the money per hour is really just too lucrative to say no. ZARROLI: Tom likes the job, and the pay with tips is really good. But Gina says the irregular hours make it hard to predict how much he'll bring in. BARR: I mean, during Christmas, during December, it was - oh, my gosh, he was working, like - I think he worked, like, 17 or 19 days in a row, which was wonderful for our children. We had a great Christmas (laughter). But when you drop into January and that income now slices in half, that's a little bit harder to deal with. ZARROLI: When times are slow like now, Tom has other ways to make money. HANSEN: So just go into the app. ZARROLI: He drives for Lyft. It's a quick way to make cash. HANSEN: You know, a lot of times I'll know that I am $70 short on rent or whatever the bill I'm trying to pay is. And so I'll just drive until I have $70 and then cash it out, and then I'm done. ZARROLI: But in the suburbs, driving isn't that lucrative, so they're selling off some of their possessions on Facebook Marketplace. It's not just about money. They're trying to declutter. They've kept only what's important - family photos, favorite books, a Jimi Hendrix poster. Until last year, the Hansens lived in Utah. They worked incredibly long hours. Gina had a telecom job, and Tom managed fast food restaurants. But they both grew up in Colorado and wanted to be closer to family. The move back home has meant less money. Diana Farrell is president of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, which has studied families whose incomes vary a lot. She says a lot of people like this kind of lifestyle. The problem is that many of them don't maintain much of a cash buffer. DIANA FARRELL: Because most households don't have a cushion, meaning that if you have a dip in income, you can go into your cash buffer to take care of any expenses you weren't expecting. . . ZARROLI: That means they're unprepared when an emergency occurs like an accident or a health problem. The Hansens get health insurance and other benefits through Gina's job at Starbucks, but they don't have much money put away. Last year, they did really well, so they took a family vacation to California. Gina says they had a great time. BARR: And we came back. And then all of a sudden, there was no work, and we couldn't even pay rent. It was very (laughter) difficult. And then we were scrambling. And we're like, was it us? Did we just spend too much? You know, and you kind of question and doubt yourself I think at moments. Am I doing the right thing? ZARROLI: Then there are the unexpected bills that come up - braces for the kids' teeth, a car that breaks down. Tom gives Gina credit for getting the family through the rough times. She's the one who's good at planning inexpensive meals or calling the doctor to ask for more time to pay bills. HANSEN: She's definitely the planner in the family. And through her survival brilliance, (laughter) I'll call it, we've gotten through a lot of tough months when the shifts have dropped off and we've made a lot less money. ZARROLI: But Gina says the constant juggling, the robbing Peter to pay Paul, takes a toll. BARR: You know, as I put it to Tommy several times, it's like nails in my brain. Like, I hate doing it. That's the part I don't like because I prefer to just let everything get paid when it needs to get paid. We're not frivolous people. We don't spend a lot of money. ZARROLI: The Hansens are pretty optimistic. Gina is angling for a promotion at Starbucks where she'll earn more money. But for now, their income bounces around, and that can sometimes drive them both crazy. Jim Zarroli, NPR News. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  This week on NPR, we're looking at the changing American workforce.

Then he took the U. S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. It was part of his America First policy, which he lauded yesterday at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Mr. Trump was well received at that meeting of world leaders in the titans of industry, but his protectionist message has its critics. One of them is Philip Levy, an economist who served in the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Levy is now with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and joins us from there. Mr. Levy, thanks so much for being with us. PHILIP LEVY: It's very good to be with you. SIMON: And let's start with the president at Davos. He said there's never been a better time to do business in America. That seemed to go over pretty well, didn't it? LEVY: Yes. It was part of his talk, which was very much a sales pitch. And so he was peddling tax cuts and regulatory reform. And I think for business people, those are quite welcome. SIMON: But you have great reservations about his policy overall. LEVY: I do. And I think that many of the world leaders who were listening were perhaps unpersuaded because with this president especially, there can be a gap between what he says on occasion and how that translates into policy. SIMON: Well, the president has said - and, in fact, I want to quote, if I may, Gary Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council - that \"America First doesn't mean America alone. \" And the president just signaled that he's certainly open to bilateral trade agreements. LEVY: He has. And yet he's done a number of things on the international scene which are very worrisome. You mentioned the withdrawal from the TPP. I think you have a lot of countries trying to see what he means by all this rhetoric and watching closely the NAFTA renegotiations. And those have been very problematic. We just had some new protection applied to solar cells and washing machines this week. Plus, there's concerns about things he's doing with the World Trade Organization. So if you look at the rhetoric that he deployed at Davos, it was probably the friendliest spin towards trade that we've heard from him. The question is how that's going to translate into new policies. SIMON: Well, as you see it, Mr. Levy, what does the U. S. lose by not being a TPP member? Because as the president sees it, it's the other countries who lose out. LEVY: Yes, although oddly enough, the president for the first time said, we might join the TPP if it turns out that it's in everybody's interest. I think it is in everybody's interest. And the TPP countries have tried to hold the door open for us. You ask, what do we lose by not being there? We lose this chance to shape the rules of the global trading system in our favor and to get all the benefits that come from crafting a global trading system that has been very beneficial to the United States over the years. SIMON: You do understand, I'm sure, that there are a lot of Americans throughout the country who feel that that beneficial trade has maybe come at the cost of their jobs as labor relocates overseas to places where the labor pool might be cheaper. LEVY: I certainly understand that sentiment. And I in no way sort of downplay the difficulties that a lot of Americans have had. The really important thing, though, is that we're careful in how we explain those difficulties. Are those difficulties because of trade agreements, or are they because of changes in technology, for example, in the manufacturing sector? To me, perhaps the most telling statistic is if you look at the share of the U. S. labor force in manufacturing, it's not a - went on a fairly steady downward trend starting in the mid-1960s. You can stare at that graph, and you don't even see a blip in the mid-'90s when NAFTA or the latest, you know, round of global trade talks came online. SIMON: Philip Levy, senior fellow with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, thanks so much for being with us. LEVY: It's been a pleasure. Thank you.

He said there's never been a better time to do business in America. That seemed to go over pretty well, didn't it? LEVY: Yes. It was part of his talk, which was very much a sales pitch. And so he was peddling tax cuts and regulatory reform. And I think for business people, those are quite welcome. SIMON: But you have great reservations about his policy overall. LEVY: I do. And I think that many of the world leaders who were listening were perhaps unpersuaded because with this president especially, there can be a gap between what he says on occasion and how that translates into policy. SIMON: Well, the president has said - and, in fact, I want to quote, if I may, Gary Cohn, who heads the National Economic Council - that \"America First doesn't mean America alone. \" And the president just signaled that he's certainly open to bilateral trade agreements. LEVY: He has. And yet he's done a number of things on the international scene which are very worrisome. You mentioned the withdrawal from the TPP. I think you have a lot of countries trying to see what he means by all this rhetoric and watching closely the NAFTA renegotiations. And those have been very problematic. We just had some new protection applied to solar cells and washing machines this week. Plus, there's concerns about things he's doing with the World Trade Organization. So if you look at the rhetoric that he deployed at Davos, it was probably the friendliest spin towards trade that we've heard from him. The question is how that's going to translate into new policies. SIMON: Well, as you see it, Mr. Levy, what does the U. S. lose by not being a TPP member? Because as the president sees it, it's the other countries who lose out. LEVY: Yes, although oddly enough, the president for the first time said, we might join the TPP if it turns out that it's in everybody's interest. I think it is in everybody's interest. And the TPP countries have tried to hold the door open for us. You ask, what do we lose by not being there? We lose this chance to shape the rules of the global trading system in our favor and to get all the benefits that come from crafting a global trading system that has been very beneficial to the United States over the years. SIMON: You do understand, I'm sure, that there are a lot of Americans throughout the country who feel that that beneficial trade has maybe come at the cost of their jobs as labor relocates overseas to places where the labor pool might be cheaper. LEVY: I certainly understand that sentiment. And I in no way sort of downplay the difficulties that a lot of Americans have had. The really important thing, though, is that we're careful in how we explain those difficulties. Are those difficulties because of trade agreements, or are they because of changes in technology, for example, in the manufacturing sector? To me, perhaps the most telling statistic is if you look at the share of the U. S. labor force in manufacturing, it's not a - went on a fairly steady downward trend starting in the mid-1960s. You can stare at that graph, and you don't even see a blip in the mid-'90s when NAFTA or the latest, you know, round of global trade talks came online. SIMON: Philip Levy, senior fellow with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, thanks so much for being with us. LEVY: It's been a pleasure.

That's where we dig into a story that will be in the news by focusing on a single word or phrase. Today, we're going with an acronym, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was signed during the Clinton administration, but President Trump vowed to renegotiate it during his presidential campaign. Now he's making good on that promise. The U. S. has put forward a number of controversial changes, and negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the U. S. are meeting in Montreal to discuss the deal. Their representatives are expected to make some kind of announcement about their progress tomorrow, so we thought this would be a good time to look at the State of the NAFTA talks. We called Chad Bown for that. He is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He previously served on President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, where he focused on international trade. He's with us now in our Washington, D. C. , studios. Sorry. I misspoke his name. It's Chad Bown - like town. Thank you so much for being here. CHAD BOWN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: A lot of people have heard President Trump, especially during the campaign, complaining about NAFTA. But what exactly is the U. S. trying to renegotiate and what are the major points of contention? BOWN: Well, that is still a little bit unclear. President Trump's primary concern seems to be with countries with which the United States has a bilateral trade deficit, so countries with which we export less to them than we import from them. But how it is that he's going to try to rectify that imbalance through these negotiations is still a little bit up in the air. He has a number of controversial proposals that he's put out there. I think. . . MARTIN: What are they? I think people would like to know. BOWN: So one of them is to introduce what's called a sunset clause. And he's proposed that after every five years, we should vote again as to whether the three countries - the U. S. , Canada and Mexico - actually want to stay in the agreement or not. Now, most people would look at that and say the primary purpose of a trade agreement in the first place is to get rid of uncertainty, to lock in these low trade barriers. If I'm a company or I'm a worker trying to sell my goods and services into a foreign market, I want to know that that deal is going to be there five years from now. By introducing a sunset clause and having to go through this really contentious set of negotiations potentially every five years, that removes that. And so this is really kind of a nonstarter from Canada and Mexico's perspective. MARTIN: And what are the other two? BOWN: The second really controversial one is for automobiles and what's called rules of origin. So the concern from the Trump administration is too many cars are being produced in Mexico and not in the United States. And so they want to demand that more content of these cars that are getting zero tariffs when they cross the borders are actually American content. And so they've proposed that - a new rule that would demand that 50 percent of the value of any car that would be sold tariff-free within NAFTA should have to be American content. MARTIN: What's the final thing that's particularly controversial? BOWN: The third really big one is the Trump administration has proposed eliminating a lot of the legal enforcement protections that are in the agreement that are particularly important for Canada and Mexico especially because they're smaller economies, smaller countries, much more reliant on the U. S. market. They can't really bully their way around to getting things that they want when things don't go their way, so they need to rely on the rule of law and courts to help enforce the provisions that are actually in these agreements. But the Trump administration - that's not their general approach. They like to throw their weight around, and they're proposing stripping out those courts from the agreement. MARTIN: And President Trump has said that if he isn't happy with the negotiations, he might pull the U. S. out of NAFTA. First of all, can he do that? Can he do that on his own authority without approval from Congress? BOWN: So on the legal question, we don't really know. There's a big legal debate going on amongst the experts in this area. But there is a sense that President Trump likes to push the limits on executive authority. We have seen him do that on a number of occasions in his first year in office. And so we wouldn't be surprised to see him try. MARTIN: Chad Bown is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He's also cohost of a weekly podcast about international trade. It's called \"Trade Talks. \" He was kind enough to join us here in our Washington, D. C. , studios.

(SOUNDBITE OF CORDUROI'S \"MY DEAR\")GARCIA-NAVARRO: This week, we're talking about gentrification. Middle-class people move in. Property values and rents rise. Things change and improve but not for everyone. Roslyn Williams has lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant for years. She watched her neighborhood change. ROSLYN WILLIAMS: For example, there's a Waldorf school down the block from a public school. And this Waldorf school, of course, is for those gentrifiers that are not interested in integrating or being part of the public school system. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Angel Poventud bought his home in Atlanta, Ga. , in 2011 for $14,000. Now he says they're going for as much as 400,000. ANGEL POVENTUD: We do really have this potential to displace everybody that's here now. And, really, even in the next five or 10 years, myself could get displaced. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's that displacement that often changes communities of color. We're going to take a closer look now at one of those neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. It's called Inglewood, and it's been mostly black for decades. Here's Anna Scott from the podcast There Goes the Neighborhood. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ANNA SCOTT, BYLINE: You can't see it looking around this street of single family houses, but home values here went up more than 15 percent in the past year. ERIN AUBRY KAPLAN: Five is kind of a handful. SCOTT: Writer Erin Aubry Kaplan (ph) shares a home here with five dogs. She says her neighbors worry that even more black residents will leave. KAPLAN: I got an email from my neighborhood Listserv - some, you know, someone just sent out a message - don't sell your house. Don't sell your house. Stay put. SCOTT: Thirty years ago, Inglewood was about 50 percent black and 40 percent Latino. Since then, those numbers have flipped. It's hard to pinpoint one reason. In the past, black residents left to escape high crime and failing schools. Now it's rising housing costs. KAPLAN: If we're out of here, there's really nowhere in LA County to go. It's just too expensive. SCOTT: We've been talking to black residents in Inglewood about the changes. By LA standards, Inglewood is still relatively affordable. Even though home prices have gone up, you can still find a house for less than $500,000. But the city has made new development a priority. The biggest project is a $3 billion NFL stadium. It will be home to the LA Rams and the Chargers. WOODROW CURRY: From here, you can actually see construction on the new stadium site. SCOTT: Woodrow Curry (ph) rents an apartment nearby and started a group called Uplift Inglewood. Their goal is for current residents to share in the new amenities. CURRY: I mean, our city in general has experienced so much disinvestment. Now that we're seeing investment coming in, we want to be able to take advantage of those investments, right? We see it as we want a home court advantage. SCOTT: The stadium plan includes new shops, restaurants, and thousands of new apartments and townhomes. Curry wants some of those designated for people with lower incomes. But new money coming in is already creating winners and losers. Anna. HENRY MANOUCHERI: Hi. SCOTT: Nice to meet you. MANOUCHERI: Nice to meet you, too. SCOTT: I met up with one of the winners, real estate investor Henry Manoucheri at his office. His company is called Universe Holdings. They're like bloodhounds for undervalued property. And they've sniffed it out in Inglewood, where they now own seven buildings. MANOUCHERI: Inglewood looks like a great buy. SCOTT: Because it's just a short drive from the area known as Silicon Beach, where hundreds of tech companies have opened offices. Manoucheri predicts those jobs will mean more tenants and higher rents for years to come. MANOUCHERI: We look at this as a growth stock. We think there's a lot of room to grow because we're starting at the ground level. SCOTT: As black neighborhoods gentrify, often, there's a racial change, and they become whiter often. I guess I wonder just what you think about that and how you think about your role in gentrification. MANOUCHERI: I think it's nice that the area gentrifies because people learn to coexist amongst other racial types. SCOTT: And for those priced out. . . MANOUCHERI: If people can't elevate themselves economically by working harder and getting better jobs, there's going to be no choice for them but to move to the less affluent neighborhoods. STEPHANIE WARREN: I can no longer afford this high rent. SCOTT: Stephanie Warren (ph) used to live in one of Manoucheri's buildings. Her rent went from about $1,200 a month to more than 2,000. So we met at a doughnut shop close to her new place, which took her months to find. She says it's hard not to see the changes through a racial lens. WARREN: Because the feeling that we really have there is they're trying to get the black people out because the new residents that was coming was younger white couples. I know a lot of African-Americans don't make that much money like that. SCOTT: According to census data, black families in the U. S. possess just 5 percent of the wealth of white families. Then again. . . LEROY CLEAVON: I'm into construction, so I have been making a lot of money in the last year and a half off of this. I ain't going to lie. SCOTT: Leroy Cleavon (ph) is also African-American. On Sundays, he comes to this Inglewood parking lot to race radio-controlled cars. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO-CONTROLLED CARS RUNNING)SCOTT: My colleague Saul Gonzalez talked to him there. SAUL GONZALEZ, BYLINE: So for you it's good. Bring the boom on if there's a boom. CLEAVON: Bring it on. Bring it on. Now, it's going to price the poor people out. You know, you got to give and take somewhere. SCOTT: Inglewood's mayor, James Butts, who's African-American, says there isn't any deliberate plan to push out black residents. Whoever can afford to buy in Inglewood should. But back at Erin Aubry Kaplan's house, she says race always plays a part in who wins and who loses. Her home value is going up, but it's also changing the community. She can't think of an LA neighborhood that's gotten the benefits of gentrification, the new shops or restaurants, and stayed largely black. KAPLAN: Populations expect certain amenities when they live there. It's kind of - you know, it's the American sense of entitlement I guess. And we've never been able to share on that, and that's real equality. When you move somewhere, Trader Joe's comes to you. That's equality. SCOTT: She calls it retail justice. It's not the same as racial justice, she says. But it's a kind of equality she'd like to see here in Inglewood. OnChanera Avenue, I'm Anna Scott for NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF CORDUROI'S \"MY DEAR\")GARCIA-NAVARRO: Anna's story is part of a collaboration between member stations WNYC and KCRW and the NPR Cities Project. When you hear a report like that, what goes through your mind? JOHN SCHLICHTMAN: How complex this issue is. I hear keywords such as disinvestment, devalued, reinvestment, revalued, retail justice. I mean, these are all very important things that have quite a history to them. GARCIA-NAVARRO: John Schlichtman is an urban sociologist at DePaul University. He's also co-author of the book \"Gentrifier. \" He told us more about the history of those words and why you can't decouple race from gentrification. SCHLICHTMAN: Race is, at its heart, a class issue. A gentrifier is a middle-class person who moves into a disinvested context at a time when other people are doing the same. And that has a huge effect on the fabric - the economic fabric, the political fabric, the social fabric. And that effect occurs regardless of the racial, religious, class background or, you know, class upbringing of that individual. But they're entering into a context in which that devaluing occurred through decades and decades of unjust policies - defunding by the government, redlining, racial covenants, blockbusting. And so in order to consider just reinvestment, there has to be an eye towards the disinvestment, the devaluing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is the responsibility of the gentrifier, though, that comes into one of these communities? SCHLICHTMAN: So we hear a lot about gentrifier guilt, but that guilt is felt because there is a perception that someone is benefiting from an unjust gap. The first question I ask in regards to gentrifier guilt is, what is the just context for a middle-class housing consumer? Is it the suburb? Is it the devalued neighborhood? Is it the bottom of a middle-class enclave in the city that has never had the devaluing? Is that the just context? And so, number one, I would argue that we have painted ourselves into a corner because of our history in the United States, where there isn't a just housing choice. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What advice do you have for people moving into these neighborhoods and people already living there? SCHLICHTMAN: You can't behave your way out of gentrification, right? So I just want to say that off the bat. But you can be a kind person. Much of the pain that occurs as a result of gentrification is the result of people who move into neighborhoods, and they're imagining a future neighborhood. So no, supporting businesses that are currently existing - that's not going to stop gentrification, but it is going to - it is going to make people like you more, right? So I think people need to own - people need to own where they live. Don't say you can't live somewhere else - if you're middle class. Of course you could live somewhere else. You could live in that suburb that isn't gentrifying, but there's other things that you're looking for. You're looking for class diversity, a racial diversity, an ethnic diversity. You're looking for restaurants. You're looking for a specific type of architecture. So be honest about your housing choice. And finally, this needs to be fought with large-scale things. We need to put pressure on our city governments as a community to not put profit and investment as the No. 1 priority. It can be balanced with other priorities of community. (SOUNDBITE OF CORDUROI'S \"MY DEAR\")GARCIA-NAVARRO: John Schlichtman wrote \"Gentrifier\" along with Marc Lamont Hill and Jason Patch. (SOUNDBITE OF CORDUROI'S \"MY DEAR\")GARCIA-NAVARRO: Next week on the Call-In, Super Bowl Sunday is coming, but football has had a bumpy year.

When you hear a report like that, what goes through your mind? JOHN SCHLICHTMAN: How complex this issue is. I hear keywords such as disinvestment, devalued, reinvestment, revalued, retail justice. I mean, these are all very important things that have quite a history to them. GARCIA-NAVARRO: John Schlichtman is an urban sociologist at DePaul University. He's also co-author of the book \"Gentrifier. \" He told us more about the history of those words and why you can't decouple race from gentrification. SCHLICHTMAN: Race is, at its heart, a class issue. A gentrifier is a middle-class person who moves into a disinvested context at a time when other people are doing the same. And that has a huge effect on the fabric - the economic fabric, the political fabric, the social fabric. And that effect occurs regardless of the racial, religious, class background or, you know, class upbringing of that individual. But they're entering into a context in which that devaluing occurred through decades and decades of unjust policies - defunding by the government, redlining, racial covenants, blockbusting. And so in order to consider just reinvestment, there has to be an eye towards the disinvestment, the devaluing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is the responsibility of the gentrifier, though, that comes into one of these communities? SCHLICHTMAN: So we hear a lot about gentrifier guilt, but that guilt is felt because there is a perception that someone is benefiting from an unjust gap. The first question I ask in regards to gentrifier guilt is, what is the just context for a middle-class housing consumer? Is it the suburb? Is it the devalued neighborhood? Is it the bottom of a middle-class enclave in the city that has never had the devaluing? Is that the just context? And so, number one, I would argue that we have painted ourselves into a corner because of our history in the United States, where there isn't a just housing choice. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What advice do you have for people moving into these neighborhoods and people already living there? SCHLICHTMAN: You can't behave your way out of gentrification, right? So I just want to say that off the bat. But you can be a kind person. Much of the pain that occurs as a result of gentrification is the result of people who move into neighborhoods, and they're imagining a future neighborhood. So no, supporting businesses that are currently existing - that's not going to stop gentrification, but it is going to - it is going to make people like you more, right? So I think people need to own - people need to own where they live. Don't say you can't live somewhere else - if you're middle class. Of course you could live somewhere else. You could live in that suburb that isn't gentrifying, but there's other things that you're looking for. You're looking for class diversity, a racial diversity, an ethnic diversity. You're looking for restaurants. You're looking for a specific type of architecture. So be honest about your housing choice. And finally, this needs to be fought with large-scale things. We need to put pressure on our city governments as a community to not put profit and investment as the No. 1 priority. It can be balanced with other priorities of community.

Polls show Americans are feeling better about the economy than at any time in the last 17 years although they are not necessarily giving Trump the credit for that. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Trump has been calling himself a cheerleader for the U. S. economy. In Davos, Switzerland, last week, he told wealthy investors there's never been a better time to hire and do business in the United States. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth. HORSLEY: Just about the time Trump was speaking, though, the Commerce Department reported growth actually slowed somewhat in the final months of 2017. For the full year, the economy grew by about 2. 3 percent. That's faster than 2016 but slower than the two previous years. The U. S. is still adding jobs at a healthy pace, albeit slower than in President Obama's last year. That's not surprising since the economy is close to full employment. U. S. economist Joel Prakken of IHS Markit says the overall picture is pretty good. JOEL PRAKKEN: We're entering 2018 with pretty good momentum and some fiscal stimulus coming from the tax cut. All of that suggests to me that 2018 should be a solid year. HORSLEY: Wall Street, as the president likes to point out, has done especially well. Last year, the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ all logged their biggest gains in four years. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The stock market is smashing one record after another and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election. HORSLEY: That's great for investors and anyone with stock-based savings. But nearly half of all Americans don't own any stocks. Workers in that category are still waiting for their big pay raise. Wages rose by an average of 2 and a half percent last year, barely keeping ahead of inflation as they've done throughout the recovery. Prakken says the newly signed tax cut will provide a modest boost in workers' take-home pay this coming year. He's doubtful, though, it will provide the long-term windfall that the president and his allies have been promising. PRAKKEN: I can see no way to get to the sorts of figures that the administration has advanced, and I don't know many people in my line of work who do either. HORSLEY: President Trump is also likely to tout the success of America's gas and oil industries. Energy historian Dan Yergin says thanks to technological gains, the U. S. could soon become the biggest oil producer in the world. DANIEL YERGIN: Global energy market has been turned upside down by what's happening in the United States in terms of shale gas and shale oil. HORSLEY: Cheap natural gas has been a boon for U. S. manufacturers. American factories added nearly 200,000 jobs last year, their strongest showing since 2014. In a sign of how far the economic recovery has come, some employers now say they're having trouble finding enough workers to fill the available jobs. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue warned in his own annual recap that labor shortage could get worse if the administration follows through on plans to limit both legal and illegal immigration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM DONOHUE: We can't strengthen and sustain economic growth if we don't expand and support our workforce. HORSLEY: Donohue also worries about the president's trade policies and his threats to pull out of trade deals like NAFTA. Last week, Trump ordered new tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels. And he warned more protectionist measures could be coming.

Yellen and her Fed colleagues held interest rates steady and officially elected Jerome Powell to succeed her as chairman. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, Yellen is getting high marks for her four years at the helm of the nation's central bank. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The Fed's mandate from Congress is to maximize employment while keeping inflation under control. When Yellen became chair early in 2014 - the first woman ever to do so - the unemployment rate was 6. 7 percent. As she leaves, it's 4. 1 percent, and inflation remains very low. That's a stellar achievement, says former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder. ALAN BLINDER: If you asked anybody, including Ben Bernanke, four years ago whether we could achieve that without rising inflation, almost anybody would have said no. So this is a gigantic success. YDSTIE: And economist Julia Coronado says it's important to remember it could have been very different. Coronado, who is president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, points out that inflation was well over the Fed's 2 percent target in 2011 when Yellen was serving as the Fed's vice chair. With inflation rising, she says the historical Fed playbook would have dictated raising interest rates rapidly to crush it. JULIA CORONADO: But the unemployment rate was still very high, and Yellen encouraged the Fed not to overreact to that - what turned out to be a blip in inflation. YDSTIE: And raising interest rates could have slowed the jobs recovery and hurt millions of workers. Yellen highlighted the plight of the unemployed during a speech in Chicago shortly after becoming Fed chair. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: The recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans. The numbers of people who've been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago. YDSTIE: It would be nearly two years into Yellen's term before the Fed lifted interest rates from near zero where they'd been since the Great Recession. But Yellen's determination to keep rates extremely low produced criticism, especially from Republicans, including Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey, who confronted Yellen at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAT TOOMEY: The financial and economic crisis is over. It's been over for years - at least six or seven years - and yet we still maintain crisis-level interest rates. YDSTIE: Toomey said the Fed was risking an outbreak of rapid inflation. Of course, inflation didn't accelerate. In fact, it remains below the Fed's target. Glenn Hubbard, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers for George W. Bush, also criticized Yellen for keeping interest rates extremely low. He still thinks that may be fueling dangerous asset bubbles. Hubbard also says Federal Reserve bank regulation was sometimes counterproductive on Yellen's watch and may have restrained economic growth. But Hubbard, who's now dean of Columbia University's business school, gives Yellen high marks anyway. GLENN HUBBARD: I would give Chair Yellen an A-minus. She inherited a difficult situation and I think has done a good job. YDSTIE: President Trump has also given Yellen high marks, but he declined to give her a second term. Alan Blinder, now a professor at Princeton, says she should have gotten one. BLINDER: She was fabulously successful and wanted a second four years and yet was not given another four years. YDSTIE: And that's unusual. Going back to Ronald Reagan, every president has crossed party lines to reappoint Fed chairs. Julia Coronado says it's disappointing partly because Yellen is the first woman to lead the Fed. CORONADO: It was inspirational when she got named Fed chair. You know, mentors matter. YDSTIE: Yellen's last day is Saturday. She'll be replaced by Fed governor and former investment manager Jerome Powell. He will be sworn in on Monday. It's expected Powell will continue Yellen's gradual approach to raising interest rates. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

He praised the Republican tax overhaul that was passed last year. He took credit for the booming stock market and for a record number of jobs in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF 2018 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Since the election, we have created 2. 4 million new jobs, including. . . (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: . . . Including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. MARTIN: Is the president right? Let's ask NPR business editor Uri Berliner. He's in our studio this morning. Hey, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Is the president right? BERLINER: Well, he's right about the number of new jobs. But jobs have been growing steadily for a number of years now. And in fact, job growth in the first year of President Trump's administration was a little bit weaker than in the last year of President Obama's administration. MARTIN: All right. So President Trump made this big show of saving more than a thousand jobs at that Carrier plant in Indiana, if you'll remember back. That plant was going to close and move the jobs to Mexico. It didn't happen. That factory has had a couple round of layoffs since then. And I say this because last night, we actually spoke with one of the employees who was laid off at Carrier. Her name is Renee Elliott. She voted for Trump in 2016. And we asked her what we - what she thought of the speech last night. RENEE ELLIOTT: I think that it was pretty pathetic that he mentioned the manufacturing jobs. I would've liked to have heard him say, I'm sorry that I didn't own up to my promises that I made to all the Carrier workers. He forgot about us, and he pretty much scooped us under the rug like it didn't happen. MARTIN: So how far has the president gotten, Uri, to making the U. S. a manufacturing powerhouse again? BERLINER: Well, some setbacks, like layoffs at Carrier, but last year was a pretty good year for manufacturing hiring. And the economy added 200,000 jobs, which is a pretty good turnaround from the previous year. MARTIN: Overall, the president - is he correct to say the economy is pretty strong right now? I mean, we know the stock market's been sky-high. How is the economy doing right now by other metrics? And how much is the president - how much credit should he get for that? BERLINER: Well, you know, economies are big, complicated things. And presidents always take credit when they're going well, and they get the blame when the economy is doing poorly. But presidents can't command the economy. They're just so complex. There's so many other things that go into an economy, things from interest rates to the psychology of employers, to consumer confidence, to what's going on overseas. So, you know, in so many ways, the first year of President Trump's economy looked a lot like President Obama's economy in terms of job growth. The stock market did well. Consumer confidence was getting a little better. But in so many ways, it's not really that different from President Obama's economy, except, perhaps, maybe in the confidence of employers. MARTIN: So what about wages? Because we've heard for years that wages have been stagnant. Last night in his State of the Union, the president said that wages are rising. Are they? BERLINER: Barely. MARTIN: But they are. BERLINER: They - barely. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: So barely - you're saying barely. BERLINER: I'm saying barely. Wages have been stagnant in the U. S. for a really, really long time. The average worker's wages really hasn't grown much since the mid-'70s. So last year, once you adjust for inflation, the average worker's pay increased by less than one-half of 1 percent. So that's a pretty meager increase. It is an increase, but it's not - there's - it's very hard to make the case that these years and years of wage stagnation have been reversed. MARTIN: Right. All right, NPR business editor Uri Berliner breaking down the president's State of the Union address last night. Thanks so much, Uri. BERLINER: Thank you, Rachel.

(SOUNDBITE OF 2018 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Together we are building a safe, strong and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2. 4 million new jobs. KELLY: An NPR/Marist poll, though, finds 1 in 5 are contract workers, and almost a third of Americans with full-time jobs are moonlighting. NPR's Emily Sullivan caught up with one of them. EMILY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Emily Doherty has a full-time job at a history museum. When she gets out of work, she switches from slacks to a petticoat. It takes her a good half an hour to carefully tie each of the knots of the long colonial skirt. Once she's ready, she heads to her second job. EMILY DOHERTY: I have a second career as a first-person theatrical historic interpreter. SULLIVAN: Meaning the 28-year-old plays a character from the colonial era. She tells stories and sings. DOHERTY: (Singing) I'll dye my petticoats. SULLIVAN: Doherty gets off from her day job around 5 and rushes home to heat up dinner and change into her costume. Then her second shift can last for hours. Dorothy finally hits bed around 11, and she does it all again the next day. And on weekends, she can perform another eight hours. In today's economy, almost everyone has a job that wants one. But as our poll shows, nearly a third of full-time workers moonlight. And for many young people, student debt leaves them no choice. DOHERTY: My graduating class, I have noticed a lot of people have had some unusual career paths. I fully expect my federal loans to not be paid back before I die. I expect to have those for the rest of my life. SULLIVAN: Doherty says that her long hours take a major toll on her social life. She's missed out on everything from beers with friends to weddings. DOHERTY: You start sometimes losing your support system, which is one of the most incredibly important things you can have if you're working this much. Invitations stop happening. SULLIVAN: She also worries that the financial pressure means she'll have to put off having kids. And she's got a point - moonlighting does put pressures on families, according to Susan Lambert. She studies work life at the University of Chicago. SUSAN LAMBERT: People are doing these long hours because they need the money to earn a decent living and to support their family in a basic, adequate way. Often they are faced with that very hard decision of whether they take on another job or they spend time at home, having dinner with their children. JON JACOBS: I just decided eventually it just really wasn't worth it. SULLIVAN: Jon Jacobs knows exactly what that means. He has two small kids and works full time as a substance addiction therapist in Milwaukee. He, too, has student loans from grad school. Jacobs worked a second job as a bartender for 10 years, but he missed putting his kids to bed. So for more flexibility, he started driving for Lyft. JACOBS: It didn't line up with our life goals and who I wanted to be as a parent. I can see the difference, especially with my son who's almost 2, is Daddy's home at night. SULLIVAN: Jacobs makes less money than he did bartending, but for him it's more than worth it. But Doherty doesn't have a choice. Each month, she faces a student loan bill of $500. She doesn't regret borrowing all that money to study history in college. But like many moonlighters I spoke to, Doherty says that she's working toward financial peace of mind. DOHERTY: I hope that in the future I am able to come to a place where I am financially stable enough to do just what drives me and what makes me happy. SULLIVAN: And what would make her happy is seeing her family back in Maine. She hasn't seen them in three years. Doherty's saving up for a plane ticket home to watch her younger sister perform in a local play. Emily Sullivan, NPR News.

S. Virgin Islands so hard. Let's travel there now with NPR's Greg Allen to see how people on the islands are doing. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: At the beach in Magens Bay, the party is back on. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALLEN: Open-air taxis bring loads of visitors direct from the cruise ship docks for a day of swimming, sunbathing and people-watching on St. Thomas's most popular beach. Chris Dimopoulos runs the bar, serving up margaritas, rum punches and something called The Painkiller. Today, he says, the first cruise ship passengers began arriving before 10:00 a. m. CHRIS DIMOPOULOS: We're seeing a recovery slowly but surely, and every day gets a little bit better. ALLEN: On St. Thomas and St. Croix, the power is mostly back. The cruise ship ports are in good shape. Restaurants and shops are open. But Gary Beck, visiting with his family from Toronto, says the impact of the storms is still obvious. GARY BECK: When we were driving here, we saw a boat in the water - underwater. We saw some of the buildings with no roofs on them. We saw homes that were pushed together. ALLEN: In early September, Hurricane Irma hit the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm with wind gusts as high as 225 miles per hour. Irma's high winds tore out roofs and windows across the islands. Two weeks later, Hurricane Maria, another Cat 5 storm, slammed into the Virgin Islands with a storm surge followed by weeks of rain. Joel Kling rode out those storms at the hotel he manages, the Emerald Beach Resort. JOEL KLING: We have water rising in the rooms, sand in the roads. Building 3 and 4, we have mud running from the hill, filling the entire floor with mud. ALLEN: Four months later, Emerald Beach is back. Using his own staff, plus some island contractors, Kling cleared the hurricane debris, repaired the rooms and replanted the gardens. He shows me the beachside bar, restaurant and pool - all were wrecked in the storms. KLING: We've got new shutters. Our sound system is up and running. The bar was totally redone. The pool was totally redone. ALLEN: Kling's 90-room hotel is once again hosting weddings. Nicole Lore was here from Maryland for her best friend's wedding, planned before the hurricanes. NICOLE LORE: We were pretty nervous about it. She thought about switching it, but then she decided to stay. We're glad that we stayed, though. It's really nice. ALLEN: Throughout the Virgin Islands, many of the small and midsize hotels have reopened. And there are villas and timeshares available. But that said, nearly three-quarters of the hotel rooms remain out of commission. That's because most of the large resorts, which took the most damage, will remain closed for the rest of this season and maybe much of the next. Lisa Hamilton, with the Virgin Islands Hotel and Tourism Association, says the airlines responded to the decline in available rooms by cutting the number of flights. LISA HAMILTON: We went from over 13 direct flights a day from the mainland U. S. to three, and they're slowly coming back. American added a second one. They're looking at the hotel rooms and the demand. I do know the planes are full coming in here, so people are ready to come back. ALLEN: The government here says direct spending on tourism accounts for nearly a third of the economy. Adding indirect revenues, one estimate puts tourism at 60 to 80 percent of the island's economy. But many here say it will likely be two years or even longer until all the resorts reopen. Andrew Klutz with the island's economic development authority says, on the plus side, resorts now can redesign their properties and upgrade them. That's important, he says, as the Virgin Islands competes with other Caribbean destinations. ANDREW KLUTZ: This is an opportunity for VI properties to basically reinvent themselves and reinvest and have a completely new product on the market. ALLEN: The owners of St. Thomas's largest resort, Frenchman's Reef, are the island's second-largest employer. They're planning a $200 million rebuild but have an uncertain timetable for reopening, which for now leaves hundreds out of work. Until the resorts rebuild, the economy in the Virgin Islands won't bounce back. Greg Allen, NPR News, St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands.

Even with all the recent debate about the sport, tomorrow's game is certain to have a huge audience, and because of that, so will the ads. That's why the ads - creating them, watching them, rating them - is almost a sport of its own. And no doubt you will see many aimed at 18-to-34-year-old males. It used to be thought that they have an outsized influence on purchasing decisions but no longer. Charles Lane from member station WSHU reports that many advertisers have been noticing a shift. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Gareth Evans is a market researcher for Flamingo, a London-based company that researches fashion trends. And about a year ago, he was running a focus group. GARETH EVANS: Quite regular, quite sporty guys - and rather than talking to me about soccer players, basketball players, they were really switched on to a number of kind of female style influences. LANE: He looked at their Instagram feeds and saw that these guys weren't influenced by other men but women. EVANS: When I step back and look at the male 18-to-34 demographic, I see a lessening of their ability to influence. LANE: He took these findings to his data team. They said what's really happening is that the power of certain groups, like young men, is being diluted by the proliferation of new age and gender brackets online. Flamingo isn't the only research group seeing this, major brands are too. Lucas Galan runs data forensics at Flamingo. LUCAS GALAN: Today, corporations are no longer coming to us and saying, we want to target males 18 to 34. That's very anachronistic. LANE: These changes are happening at a time when women are graduating from college at higher rates than men and when traditionally-male jobs, especially those in manufacturing, are harder to find. Scott McDonald heads The Advertising Research Foundation. SCOTT MCDONALD: You kind of have a shift in the occupational structure of the country that corresponds with some segments of the male population losing their buying power. LANE: But overall, McDonald is skeptical that men 18 to 34 are less influential in advertising. He says there's not much research available. Also, he says, the 18 to 34 age group will continue to be important because of its sheer size. Millennials outnumber even baby boomers. Slaine Jenkins is a market researcher for Insight Strategy Group. She says it's not that males 18 to 34 are less influential, it's that as advertising dollars shift online, traditional demographics are less important. Advertisers these days are more interested in a consumer's past behavior and psychological makeup. SLAINE JENKINS: In market research, we've seen a great need to explore influence beyond demographics and really dig into the psychographics to understand audiences and their behaviors. LANE: Instead of breaking consumers up by age or gender, companies are targeting values and passions. Big data sets of past purchases, Internet searches, GPS locations - these give companies a scalpel instead of a sledgehammer in order to find their customers. But there is a downside to these more highly-targeted advertisements. Chris Jackson is a pollster for the market research company Ipsos. CHRIS JACKSON: That's sort of this sort of narrow, this is the view they have of you from your online behavior. But who knows if that's actually the totality of your life or your experience? LANE: For example, political junkies who mostly visit news sites might miss out on major cultural trends, while fashionistas on Instagram risk never seeing political ads.

S. banking system who helped right the economy coming out of the financial crisis steps aside today. Janet Yellen served four years as chair of the Federal Reserve. She was an appointee of President Obama. She's the first woman to hold that position, but she was not reappointed to serve another term. President Trump appointed Jerome Powell to take Yellen's place. We wanted to look back on Yellen's career, so we called Rana Foroohar. She is a columnist at The Financial Times, and she was kind enough to join us from New York. Rana, thanks so much for speaking with us. RANA FOROOHAR: Hey. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So let's start with the basics. What does the head of the Federal Reserve do? FOROOHAR: Well, the Federal Reserve is the country's central banker, which means that it controls the money supply in America. It controls where interest rates are set, which has a big impact, of course, on everything from your home mortgage to what you might be paying on your auto loans or any other kind of loans you might have outstanding. And it's also the regulator in chief of the financial sector. The Fed regulates other banks in America. MARTIN: So tell us about the scene she inherited when she moved from being vice chair of the Fed to becoming Fed chair. FOROOHAR: She inherited what might have been one of the most tricky economic situations in Fed history. You know, we weren't in the middle of the financial crisis at that point, but the Federal Reserve had, in the previous few years, dumped an unprecedented amount of money into the economy - $4 trillion in all since the financial crisis - to try and get the economy going. And it was Janet Yellen's job to keep that process steady and then eventually start to turn the taps of that easy money off. Now, why is that such a hard thing? Because financial markets loved all that money, but when you start to turn the taps off, you tend to get volatility. You can get stock crashes. You could potentially get another recession if you do things wrong. So she inherited a really, really tricky job. MARTIN: You wrote that back in 2014, when she first came into office, that she focused on the human impact of economics, and that she really wanted to be sure that policy helped ordinary households. How did we see that play out in economic policy? FOROOHAR: Yeah, absolutely. It was such a diametric shift. Fed chairs usually come in and they care a lot about Wall Street, and they typically come from Wall Street - Janet Yellen did not. She grew up in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Her father was a family physician who used to treat dockworkers. And coming into the position after the financial crisis, she thought a lot about what was going to help ordinary workers as opposed to Wall Street. MARTIN: What do you think she'll be known for? I mean, when this chapter of the Fed's history is written, how do you think she'll be described? FOROOHAR: Well, it's interesting. I think that she'll be described as absolutely a safe pair of hands, someone that gave us security and stability at a time when the economy really needed it. There is one interesting juxtaposition though. You know, I mentioned earlier that she cares very much about working people, and having interviewed her personally a number of times, I know that to be the case. At the same time, the policy of keeping interest rates low, which was designed to create pressure at the bottom end of the job market and help people, you know, making $15 an hour, maybe help the employment in that part of the job market, it also created, ironically, wealth inequality. Because when interest rates are low, asset prices like stocks and bonds and so forth go up in value, and so that actually created inequality. And that's something that we're all having to struggle with now, today, in our economy. And it's going to be a big question as to how to handle this for the Fed going forward. MARTIN: That's Rana Foroohar. She's a columnist and an associate editor for The Financial Times. She was kind enough to join us from the studios at the Financial Times in New York. Rana Foroohar, thanks so much for speaking with us. FOROOHAR: Thank you for having me. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The head of the U.

You could potentially get another recession if you do things wrong. So she inherited a really, really tricky job. MARTIN: You wrote that back in 2014, when she first came into office, that she focused on the human impact of economics, and that she really wanted to be sure that policy helped ordinary households. How did we see that play out in economic policy? FOROOHAR: Yeah, absolutely. It was such a diametric shift. Fed chairs usually come in and they care a lot about Wall Street, and they typically come from Wall Street - Janet Yellen did not. She grew up in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Her father was a family physician who used to treat dockworkers. And coming into the position after the financial crisis, she thought a lot about what was going to help ordinary workers as opposed to Wall Street. MARTIN: What do you think she'll be known for? I mean, when this chapter of the Fed's history is written, how do you think she'll be described? FOROOHAR: Well, it's interesting. I think that she'll be described as absolutely a safe pair of hands, someone that gave us security and stability at a time when the economy really needed it. There is one interesting juxtaposition though. You know, I mentioned earlier that she cares very much about working people, and having interviewed her personally a number of times, I know that to be the case. At the same time, the policy of keeping interest rates low, which was designed to create pressure at the bottom end of the job market and help people, you know, making $15 an hour, maybe help the employment in that part of the job market, it also created, ironically, wealth inequality. Because when interest rates are low, asset prices like stocks and bonds and so forth go up in value, and so that actually created inequality. And that's something that we're all having to struggle with now, today, in our economy. And it's going to be a big question as to how to handle this for the Fed going forward. MARTIN: That's Rana Foroohar. She's a columnist and an associate editor for The Financial Times. She was kind enough to join us from the studios at the Financial Times in New York. Rana Foroohar, thanks so much for speaking with us. FOROOHAR: Thank you for having me.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

How would you. . . WEISBERG: Too much. SHAPIRO: Too much - well, how does what happened today compare to what you've seen over those decades? WEISBERG: Well, it's never fun when they go down. It's obviously always much more pleasant when they go up. And clearly we've been on a bit of a whirlwind adventure here certainly since the election. But you can even go back to many of the Obama years. I mean, the markets have not really had any kind of major correction. You could probably go back almost as far as March of '09 when the market started to improve after the financial crisis. It's never fun, Ari. It's always painful, and everybody wishes they had sold yesterday. But unfortunately they don't ring a bell. They don't tell us when to do that. And that's part of - you know, it's just part of stock trading. SHAPIRO: You describe this as a correction. The market had been going up pretty steadily over the last year. Why do you think this happened? WEISBERG: Well, with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, I think part of the reason could be actually the very positive economic news that we got out of the government last week and. . . SHAPIRO: Friday's jobs report saying hundreds of thousands of jobs and wages had gone up, yeah. WEISBERG: Exactly. And then you had some comments from an (unintelligible) Fed that they were - you know, that they thought the possibility we might even see 5 percent GDP growth. Well, the one thing that the stock market has ridden the back of over the last eight or nine years has been zero or very, very low interest rates. And anything that would even smell like interest rates are going to move up higher and faster than the Fed has already telegraphed to investors sent - clearly sent a very nervous shockwave through the markets. And you saw the 10-year bonds start to sell off, and the interest rates went higher - 30 year. And, you know, with a market that's been on a bit of a tear and not had any kind of correction, clearly overbought - trees don't grow to the sky - all the cliches, you know, there's always something. SHAPIRO: Yeah. WEISBERG: And it's never what one expects. But there you are. I think that's as good a reason as any. SHAPIRO: You know, Ted, you've been a trader since before computers were the ones doing all the trading. Do you think that makes a difference in a day like today? WEISBERG: Well, yeah, I do. I mean, listen; I remember the crash of '87. We were down 22 percent in one day - quite dramatic certainly compared to today's selloff. SHAPIRO: Make today's 4. 5 look not quite so bad. WEISBERG: Right, right, not quite so bad, exactly. And the reason with the benefit of hindsight then was portfolio insurance, which is a fancy word for computer trading. And the markets have changed dramatically over the last 8 to 10 years. The markets have become more opaque, more volatility, more computer trading than ever, algorithms driving the train. I mean, if you look at the screen today - I'm looking at the screen as we speak. I mean, every stock on there is down between 2. 5 and 5. 5, some even 6 percent. SHAPIRO: Wow. WEISBERG: Every one with no exception. SHAPIRO: That's the market. We're going to have to leave it there. Ted Weisberg of Seaport Securities, thanks so much for joining us. WEISBERG: Bye-bye.

To be frank, each blip in the market tells us nothing that we really need to know, but the trend of the last few days is pretty dramatic. On Monday, stocks dropped 1,175 points, and the market is off to a volatile start today. And that's after, of course, last week's down week. Joining us to sort some of this out is NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: And also our business reporter Jim Zarroli is with us. Jim, good morning to you. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Scott, we're here in Washington. Is the Trump administration saying anything about the markets the last few days? HORSLEY: Not a whole lot. The treasury secretary was on Capitol Hill today, and Steven Mnuchin didn't volunteer anything about the market's volatility. He was pressed on the subject by Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling. Here's what the treasury secretary had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVEN MNUCHIN: We are very focused on the long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we've enacted including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth. The stock market is up significantly, over 30 percent, since President Trump was elected. We're monitoring the stock markets. They're functioning very well. And we continue to believe in the long-term impact of the stock market. HORSLEY: So that's an echo of what we heard from the White House yesterday, focus on the fundamentals - jobs, wages, corporate earnings still pretty good. INSKEEP: Which is, you know, good advice for any president, although of course the president was crowing about the stock market just a few days ago. Jim Zarroli, you're there in New York. You're monitoring this. And you talk to a lot of businesspeople and investors. Even though we are reassured that a brief change in the market is not that big a deal, is it psychologically important for some investors, or even financially important for some? ZARROLI: You know, it can be. It can cause people to lose confidence in the stock market, especially small investors. And remember, it's been a while since we've seen this kind of volatility. I think people have been maybe lulled into thinking that, you know, everything was great, the market was going to keep going up for a while. Every now and then we get this kind of bracing reminder that that's not necessarily the case. INSKEEP: Let's think about the big drops of recent years. There was the financial crisis, 2007, 2008. Huge drops from time to time and over time. Big drops in 2011 at the debt ceiling crisis. Is there some worry in the broader economy now that you would link to this drop? ZARROLI: I mean, I think this can be linked back to the unemployment report on Friday morning which said that wages were going up at a pretty significant clip. And that just got people worried about inflation, about prices going up and about what the Federal Reserve would do. And that's always - you know, wage growth is a wonderful thing if you're a worker, but if you're a company trying to sell stock, you know, that makes you worry about the bottom line. And I think that's what this is. I mean, there's no reason to think that there's any real major shift in the economy. It's just people coming to terms with inflation and fears about interest rates. INSKEEP: And we should mention that stocks are just slightly down at the moment. Every second we are looking at these TV screens. The Dow Jones Industrial's down about 71. Now down about 80, which is moderately down compared to more than a thousand dropping yesterday. So you're saying that this good news for workers may be somewhat edgy news at best for for employers. And this is something that would cause people to realize that stocks are a little overvalued, which is what people have been saying for a while anyway? ZARROLI: Yeah. For sure. I mean, the market has been going up so much. January was such a good month. I mean, if you've got a retirement fund and you, you know, track the amount of money in it, you know that. It's just been a really good time to be in the stock market, and that's why President Trump has been bragging about it so much, which is, you know, kind of unusual for a president to do, but, it's been a wonderful time. And now people, every now and then they, I guess, they need to be reminded that, you know, what goes up can come down. INSKEEP: Scott Horsley, I want people to know that you have covered both the White House and the economy for many, many years. With the longer view that you have, what's on your mind as you watch all of this this morning? HORSLEY: It's going to be interesting to see if President Trump takes a lesson from this and stops talking about the stock market because as Jim points out, it is a fickle barometer. Politicians generally don't talk a whole lot about it because it can go down as well as up, and also because it's only about half the country that owns any stocks. There are more wage earners than investors so it's a kind of a narrow slice to be talking about. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley and Jim Zarroli, thanks to you both. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

S. stock markets are open this morning, and things are volatile. Markets are moving in and out of positive territory. We are joined now by financial columnist Barry Ritholtz. He writes for Bloomberg View and is the chairman and chief investment officer at Ritholtz Wealth Management firm. Thanks so much for being with us this morning. BARRY RITHOLTZ: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So we are of course talking because it has been a rollercoaster over the past couple of days. Yesterday was the single largest point drop in stock market history. What's going on? How are you reading this? RITHOLTZ: So let's put all of this in a little bit of broader context. Yes, yesterday was the largest single point drop. But you have to recognize this in percentage terms because when the markets fell, the most they ever fell, in 1987, in one day, 22 percent, it was about 600 points. So this turned out to be the 108th worst single day. That's bad, but it really isn't terrible compared to what it could be. If yesterday looked like 1987, we would've been down closer to 6,000 or 7,000 or points, not a thousand points. MARTIN: Right. There's so much more trading that happens. It's so much larger. RITHOLTZ: And everything is worth so much more. Here it is, it's 30 years later. Obviously things have a much higher valuation than they did way back when. MARTIN: So what do you tell people, nervous investors, who look at this and they know that they're supposed to not panic but it's still hard when you see this kind of fluctuation? RITHOLTZ: Sure. Well, you have to put this in a little bit of context. Over the past almost 10 years, the market has tripled. Over the past year and a half, it's up over a third. And, shockingly, over the past four months, this market has gained more than 14 percent. Now, for a little bit of context, the average market gains for any given year over the past century have been between 8 and 10 percents with dividends. So when you're up almost 50 percent more than that in a fraction of a year, that's just a case of too far, too fast. I think the enthusiasm over the tax cuts, the expectations of continued profits from corporations around the world and the economic recovery that is not just in the United States but we're seeing it in Europe, we're seeing in Japan, we're seeing it in emerging markets, people just kind of got way too excited about this. And the market is coming back to trend, coming back to where it should be. MARTIN: And so overall, the economic fundamentals are still good, right? Low unemployment, rising wages. So those are good indicators. RITHOLTZ: You know, a lot of the bond traders have been suggesting that because the economy has gotten as good as it has, it means that these years of low-cost, easy money, very, very low rates, that's good for corporate profits, that's good for mortgages - anyone who wants to go buy a house, rates are still cheap. MARTIN: Yeah. RITHOLTZ: That actually has caused people to get a little nervous - hey, maybe we're no longer in the Goldilocks zone. Maybe the Fed is going to take rates up, and things are going to become a little more pricey. MARTIN: Things go down. Financial markets columnist Barry Ritholtz, chairman of Ritholtz Wealth Management, thanks for your time this morning. RITHOLTZ: My pleasure. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  U.

If yesterday looked like 1987, we would've been down closer to 6,000 or 7,000 or points, not a thousand points. MARTIN: Right. There's so much more trading that happens. It's so much larger. RITHOLTZ: And everything is worth so much more. Here it is, it's 30 years later. Obviously things have a much higher valuation than they did way back when. MARTIN: So what do you tell people, nervous investors, who look at this and they know that they're supposed to not panic but it's still hard when you see this kind of fluctuation? RITHOLTZ: Sure. Well, you have to put this in a little bit of context. Over the past almost 10 years, the market has tripled. Over the past year and a half, it's up over a third. And, shockingly, over the past four months, this market has gained more than 14 percent. Now, for a little bit of context, the average market gains for any given year over the past century have been between 8 and 10 percents with dividends. So when you're up almost 50 percent more than that in a fraction of a year, that's just a case of too far, too fast. I think the enthusiasm over the tax cuts, the expectations of continued profits from corporations around the world and the economic recovery that is not just in the United States but we're seeing it in Europe, we're seeing in Japan, we're seeing it in emerging markets, people just kind of got way too excited about this. And the market is coming back to trend, coming back to where it should be. MARTIN: And so overall, the economic fundamentals are still good, right? Low unemployment, rising wages. So those are good indicators. RITHOLTZ: You know, a lot of the bond traders have been suggesting that because the economy has gotten as good as it has, it means that these years of low-cost, easy money, very, very low rates, that's good for corporate profits, that's good for mortgages - anyone who wants to go buy a house, rates are still cheap. MARTIN: Yeah. RITHOLTZ: That actually has caused people to get a little nervous - hey, maybe we're no longer in the Goldilocks zone. Maybe the Fed is going to take rates up, and things are going to become a little more pricey. MARTIN: Things go down. Financial markets columnist Barry Ritholtz, chairman of Ritholtz Wealth Management, thanks for your time this morning.

Joining us now, NPR business reporter Jim Zarroli. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So market futures were signaling that the Dow was going to start way down today. What happened? ZARROLI: Yeah. It did go down. It fell 567 points. And then right now it's come back quite a bit. So. . . MARTIN: So volatile. ZARROLI: Yeah. And then that's not unusual. I mean, you know, in this kind of a period, the market can be very unsettled. We've seen drops all over the world this morning, a lot of markets down in Asia, in Japan and Hong Kong, in Europe. So this kind of uncertainty is really sort of all over the world right now. MARTIN: And as we watch the ticker right now, I guess it's 50 points up. So this thing is, like, up and down. ZARROLI: Right. And this kind of thing is - that is what happens at a time like this. The market, investors are just trying to sort of decide what direction things are going in. Lots of uncertainty. It's not unusual. I mean, we have to point out that in the past couple of trading sessions, much of the decline happened in the afternoon. So we have a long day ahead of us, and we don't know what's going to happen. MARTIN: Is there a particular sector of the market we should be paying extra attention to today? ZARROLI: You know, when something like this happens, it tends to affect every sector of the economy, every sector of the financial markets - commodities, bonds, everything. The dollar. The value of the dollar fluctuates. I think the real question right now is what's going to happen with interest rates? You know, we've had low interest rates for a very long time. They're still low, but when we had this unemployment report on Friday which suggested that wages have gone up significantly, that sort of revived concerns about inflation, got everybody wondering again what the Fed is going to do. MARTIN: Can you make that connection, Jim? Just because people will hear that and think, wages are going up. That's a good thing. How can that mean that my retirement fund is going down? ZARROLI: I think - right, it is a good thing for workers. It's something everybody's been waiting for a long time. You know, and it gives a lot of people something to be happy about. But the markets see that, stock investors see that and think, you know, how much are interest rates going to go up? How much is the Federal Reserve going to crack down? Are we going to see rates go up? And that can hurt a company's bottom line, and it gets people wondering sort of, you know, what overall direction the economy is going in. MARTIN: Can you give us some historical perspective on this? I mean, when you look at yesterday, it was a 1,175 point drop. That's a lot, but it still represented less than 5 percent in market value, right? ZARROLI: Yeah. I mean, that is a lot in points, of course. But, you know, when the Dow is at 10,000, as it was not all that long ago, that's a really big drop. But when it's at 25,000, you know, in percentage terms that's not so much. This is the kind of thing, you know, it's happened many times. It will happen again. The market goes up and, you know, usually over time, and sometimes it falls back again. MARTIN: So it's a natural correction, you're saying. ZARROLI: Yeah. MARTIN: So far. ZARROLI: And I don't think there's anything in the economy that's, you know, major that's really changed right now to suggest that, you know, things are weaker than they were. We have this question about the tax cuts and bringing money into the economy and what that will mean for businesses and consumers, but I don't think there's anything that should lead us to think that the economy has suddenly gotten substantially, you know, stronger or weaker than it was. I mean, we're just kind of - things are still pretty stable, and I think this will, you know. . . MARTIN: This too shall pass, Jim? ZARROLI: Well. . . MARTIN: (Laughter). ZARROLI: . . . It always does. Let's say that. MARTIN: Investors, drink your antacid and stay the course, I guess, is the message. NPR business reporter Jim Zarroli. Thanks so much, Jim. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

A few down days on the stock market may mean nothing over the course of a year or a decade. Of course, if it's your employer's stock value or your retirement fund that just went down, it is hard not to look. And the volatility of the market this morning is making it especially hard not to look. Austan Goolsbee chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, and when we reached him earlier today, we asked what he made of the stock market drop in recent days. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: You know, it's - you get that pit in your stomach. It feels like it's 2008 again or something. But, you know, everybody's got to remember that the markets go up and the markets go down. On average, they tend to go up, but there's a lot of volatility. You know, in 1900, the Dow was at 50. So over time. . . INSKEEP: (Laughter). GOOLSBEE: . . . You're doing fine. But, you know, you've got to just try to - I don't know. It is a bit like the weather. You're going to have a whole lot of nice days in a row. The worst time to leave your house is to say, oh, my goodness, we're having a big storm, let's get out of here. INSKEEP: You mentioned the financial crisis in 2008. There were broader, deeper, huge problems with the economy then. Do you see a problem with the economy now that we should be thinking about over the next year or two? GOOLSBEE: I mean, it certainly doesn't feel to me like the kind of - we had such a big increase in consumer debt. We had a housing price bubble that was coming apart. There were a lot of things that led to a worldwide financial crisis that let's hope - and, it doesn't seem like that's what this is. We've had really a historic run-up. It's probably the second-longest bull market in history, or, at least, in the United States. So it seemed like stocks had gotten expensive by the - relative to earnings by historical measures. It doesn't feel like the fundamentals are the same as 2008. INSKEEP: Let me ask a question a little bit more long-term. Even before the declines of the past week or so, people were asking, naturally, the question of when the next recession will arrive. Aren't we about due for one, given the sheer length of the economic expansion we've had? GOOLSBEE: Yes and no. You know, as the economists say, recoveries don't tend to die of old age. So how long you've been going is not a great historic indicator that you're about to have a recession. That said, the stock market and the economy are not the same thing. And we saw a decent jobs number this last time, and we have seen in the last couple of years wages starting to inch themselves upward. So what happens in the stock market does not have to be an indicator for what's happening to everyday people in the economy if you can just turn the knob off so that there's not the volume. If you can't help yourself looking and saying, oh, no, I'm losing my retirement money, you're going to have indigestion because when these drops and fluctuations go like this, there isn't really anything you can do. The No. 1 rule is don't panic. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about the guy who's supposed to do something when there is a crisis, Jerome Powell, the brand-new Fed chair - first day on the job. Is it way too early for him to be doing anything? GOOLSBEE: Probably. Welcome to the Fed, Mr. Powell. INSKEEP: (Laughter). GOOLSBEE: You know, the thing is, you would hope that the Fed chair would not be primarily looking at gyrations in the stock market and certainly not day-to-day gyrations in the stock market when determining monetary policy. INSKEEP: Austan Goolsbee, always a pleasure. Thank you very much. GOOLSBEE: Thank you. INSKEEP: He chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.

Restauranteurs John Besh and Mario Batali have stepped away from their businesses amid similar allegations. These men gained prominence in industries where the staff is largely female, low-paid and where sexual harassment runs rampant. Here's NPR's Yuki Noguchi. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Isabel Escobar recalls climbing the stairs carrying cleaning supplies at a client's home in Chicago. The owner's adult son stood waiting for her on the landing naked. Escobar turned and fled. ISABEL ESCOBAR: (Through interpreter) That was etched in my person. It cannot be erased - the fear, the distrust and my lack of confidence. NOGUCHI: That was 15 years ago. Escobar, now 59, survived domestic violence at home and harassment as a housekeeper. She says speaking out sometimes met with threats. One client told her he would report Escobar, illegal immigrant, to immigration. ESCOBAR: (Speaking Spanish). NOGUCHI: \"I fight because I don't want this to happen to other women,\" she says. The campaign to speak out against such abuse began with women in Hollywood and in the media, those in positions of relative power and privilege. Now, women in retail, agriculture and domestic work, where harassment rates run very high, say they too are starting to feel the impact of the Me Too movement. VALERIE BIEGA: Yeah, the vibe is definitely that this is our shot to make a change - like, a lasting change. NOGUCHI: Valerie Biega is 25 and a sous chef who has worked across the U. S. BIEGA: I had co-workers who - sorry, talking about it just got me a little jittery. NOGUCHI: Biega fielded comments about her backside every time she bent over or was alone in a walk-in cooler. BIEGA: It's at the point where it's happened so much that I instinctively shoot up as soon I hear a walk-in door open behind me. NOGUCHI: She's perfected a stone-faced response she calls gray rock and says she's sharing these tips with other female kitchen workers online. Outside Cleveland, Moriah Montalvo is a social work student and concession stand cashier whose mother also faced harassment in the restaurant industry. MORIAH MONTALVO: She quit because of it, and she, like, says she never would go back. NOGUCHI: Her mom never spoke up. Montalvo does, but wants to see more than just talk. MONTALVO: Social movements are awesome, and they need to happen. However, they can be short-lived. And so it's not about just speaking out, it's about something else has to come behind it and sustain it. NOGUCHI: Indeed, Lita Farquhar worries such systemic change won't come. For the last decade, she has waitressed in New Orleans, home of Chef John Besh, who faces numerous charges of sexual harassment. LITA FARQUHAR: I mean, he just got to retire early. There weren't really any consequences for him. NOGUCHI: Farquhar notes managers can retaliate by assigning bad shifts or less-desirable work. It's also not easy to defy a culture where the customer is always supposed to be right. FARQUHAR: It's really hard when a customer sexually harasses you because, as a server, I make 2. 13 a hour, and I really rely on tips. NOGUCHI: A majority of states allow restaurants to pay waitstaff who earn tips less than the minimum wage, as low as $2. 13 an hour. For Saru Jayaraman, president of the Restaurant Opportunities Center United, that is the main problem. SARU JAYARAMAN: Seventy percent of these workers who live on the tip minimum wage are women and they suffer from three times the poverty rate and the highest rates of sexual harassment of any industry because they must put up with all kinds of inappropriate customer behavior. NOGUCHI: Seven states do not permit a subminimum wage, and according to a 2014 study by Jayaraman's group, harassment rates there are half that of states that permit the lower wage. There are additional policy changes other worker advocates say could help in many sectors, not just restaurants. One is to eliminate fine print employment contracts that require workers to keep harassment claims private. Farmworker Teresa Arredondo says she wants to see changes making it easier to report harassment. Arredondo, who is 49, last April survived an attempted rape by her supervisor. After she reported the incident, she says the farm's owner fired her attacker but also cut Arredondo and the 50-woman crew she oversees in the fields. She anguished over the loss of work but says she doesn't regret speaking out. TERESA ARREDONDO: I feel good because he doesn't get more girls. This is my compensation. NOGUCHI: Monica Ramirez says, for women who work in isolation, rewarding whistleblowers and bystanders for reporting incidents is critical. MONICA RAMIREZ: In the criminal justice realm, people are told that if they see something, they should say something. NOGUCHI: Ramirez is president of farm workers group Alianza Nacional de Campesinas. She says she wants to see changes that benefit everyone. RAMIREZ: We can't just say we're going to address this problem in one industry and then forget about all the others that have been impacted. Farmworker women have been left behind for many, many, many years. NOGUCHI: The biggest gift of the Me Too movement, she says, is that it has united women across industries to demand change.

NOGUCHI: Ramirez is president of farm workers group Alianza Nacional de Campesinas. She says she wants to see changes that benefit everyone. RAMIREZ: We can't just say we're going to address this problem in one industry and then forget about all the others that have been impacted. Farmworker women have been left behind for many, many, many years. NOGUCHI: The biggest gift of the Me Too movement, she says, is that it has united women across industries to demand change.

President Trump has not said much about this rollercoaster. This morning I spoke with Kevin Hassett, who is the top economic adviser at the White House. Thanks for joining us. KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, it's great to be here again. SHAPIRO: President Trump's first public comment about this stock market jitteriness was a tweet this morning where he said, in the old days when good news was reported, the stock market would go up. Today when good news is reported, the stock market goes down - big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy. Could you clarify what he means by that? HASSETT: Well, I guess the president can always clarify what he means. And the fact is that the fundamentals for the economy are very sound. The wages are going up a lot even in the employment report that came out last week. We saw the highest rate of wage growth in about a decade. You know, over the last few days, there's been a lot of volatility, but it's not related to the fundamentals, which, as the president notes, are very strong. SHAPIRO: It actually seems somewhat predictable that when the job market looks good, investors fear interest rates rising, and the stock market drops. It seems that this is what we saw in the old days. HASSETT: I think it depends on which old days you're talking about. But there have been times when, you know, we're pretty close to a recent recession where when we had positive job news, it's a real positive. There have been other times where we're advanced as we are now into a recovery. And when we get lots of positive news like we're seeing, it's viewed by markets as good news as well because the market has a lot of clarity about the future of interest rates and Fed Reserve policy. SHAPIRO: I want to ask you about whether the tax law is playing any role in this. This is something that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a Politico podcast back in October when the law had not yet been passed. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"POLITICO MONEY\")STEVEN MNUCHIN: To the extent we get the tax deal done, the stock market will go up higher. But there's no question in my mind. If we don't get it done, you're going to see a reversal of a significant amount to these gains. SHAPIRO: Kevin Hassett, what did the treasury secretary get wrong there? HASSETT: Oh, he got nothing wrong there. In fact, I think if you go back and count the stock market change from when he said that, you'd see that it's up quite a bit. Here's the way to think about it. A lot of the equity market movement from last year clearly was related to the fact that equity markets started out with some probability in their heads about whether the tax bill would pass. And along the way that was going on, equity markets were clearly heading up. And now that the tax bill has passed, then the market has factored in that change in the tax rate into prices. And really what happens next is that the evolution of the economy of earnings and interest rates will continue as they always do to affect valuations. SHAPIRO: As you know, since the election, President Trump has often said he's responsible for the growth in the stock market. There are plenty of statements like this one that he made at a rally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The stock market's gone up so much because of us. (CHEERING)SHAPIRO: Is he also now responsible for the trillions of dollars that have been wiped out in stock market losses over the last week or so? HASSETT: Well, I think you're focusing right now, as one shouldn't, on day-to-day fluctuations. The fact is now if we go back to the day he was elected, I'm guessing - I haven't updated the numbers that we're looking at - a medium-term trend of the market being up 35 percent. It's not up 35 percent because of mysterious factors. It's up 35 percent because of substantive policy changes that. . . SHAPIRO: So you don't agree that there is a political risk for the president tying his political fate to the stock market? HASSETT: Well, I mean, there are going to be day-to-day fluctuations. Markets do that. But the fact is that there's been a very, very large trend upward since he was elected that, you know, any economist who runs the math would tell you is what you would expect given the policy changes that we've seen. SHAPIRO: We saw another risk of mixing politics with economics last week. President Trump said this on Tuesday in his State of the Union address. (SOUNDBITE OF 2018 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: Something I'm very proud of - African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. SHAPIRO: And three days later on Friday, the jobs report showed that African-American unemployment jumped from 6. 8 percent to 7. 7 percent. HASSETT: Right. It's still - last year was still the best year on record. You have to understand that the jobs report is based on a sample that has sampling variation that goes up and down every month. And there's a very positive trend for employment for people of all races. And that blip really looked quite a bit different from the rest of the report, and it's something that our statisticians think is related to the sampling properties of the jobs report. And it'll be reversed next month or two. And, you know, at the next jobs report, I'm happy to come back and talk about it. SHAPIRO: Kevin Hassett, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, thanks for joining us today. HASSETT: Oh, it's an honor to be back. Thank you.

Riding high on the oil boom in the late 2000s, the state slashed taxes - but the promised prosperity never came, and now state lawmakers are trying to find a way out.

Last year, highway patrol officers were given a mileage limit because the state couldn't afford to put gas in their tanks. And Medicaid provider rates have been cut to the point that rural nursing homes and hospitals are closing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARY FALLIN: We can continue down the road - the path of sliding backwards. Or we could choose a second path, which is to say enough is enough. We can do better. We deserve better. Our children deserve better, too. HUBBARD: That's Republican Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin on Monday during her final State of the State address. She spent most of it touting a plan from a large coalition of business leaders to raise taxes and enact reforms. David Rainbolt, a banker, is a leader of the group known as Step Up Oklahoma. DAVID RAINBOLT: You can look at the problems we have and realize that this problem will occur over and over and over again unless we create revenue streams that create stability. HUBBARD: But there's a problem. When you pass a tax cut in the state of Oklahoma, it may as well be permanent. In the early 1990s, in reaction to a tax increase, voters passed a ballot measure that requires 75 percent of the legislature to vote in favor of any revenue hike. That supermajority requirement has given the tiny Democratic minority in Oklahoma the power to derail any plan. And even though the Step Up Oklahoma plan meets many of their demands, House Minority Leader Steve Kouplen says it's just not enough. STEVE KOUPLEN: The drowning man will grab any lifeline, whether it's a good one or not. One has been thrown to us. We think it needs to be tweaked, and we think some true compromise needs to take place to change it. HUBBARD: Democrats believe oil and gas companies have gotten rich while cuts to state services have fallen on poor Oklahomans, and they shouldn't bear the cost of fixing a mess they didn't make. Rainbolt says when Step Up created its plan, business leaders from competing industries sat down at a table. Everyone had to give. RAINBOLT: We'd created something that no one in the room liked every part of but that everybody in the room agreed would move us forward. And we thought it was salable to the legislature, and it appears that it is. HUBBARD: The spirit of compromise hasn't reached lawmakers yet. They're now in their second special session, trying to pass a budget for the current fiscal year. And lobbying is fierce for the Step Up plan that's supposed to provide a more permanent revenue fix. Leaders in the legislature say they're hoping to vote on it as soon as it can pass. The Democratic minority in the Oklahoma House of Representatives says it still needs more work before they'll support it. At this point, the gridlock continues.

U. S. stock markets opened higher this morning, gaining back a little bit of the territory that was surrendered during Thursday\u2019s dismal performance on Wall Street. If you were to look up a chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it went through the various hours yesterday, it looks like one of the ski slopes at the Winter Olympics - down, down, down. To talk more about this, we've reached Liam Halligan, who is an economics commentator for The Telegraph and is also an economist himself. Welcome to the program, sir. LIAM HALLIGAN: Very nice to be on NPR. INSKEEP: And I don't mean to insult you in any way by calling you an economist. I know that it can be a dirty word in some ways. HALLIGAN: (Laughter) It's something I have to live with. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Anyway, it's good to talk with you. How does the U. S. market decline look from where you are in London? HALLIGAN: Well, I'm speaking from BBC here in London. And this is my take - I've got a cover story on The Spectator magazine this week. It says it's the crash we need. Look, if you're trading these markets and your savings are totally tied up in them or if you recently entered the markets at the start of this year, it is painful. But these - even though these are large points crashes, they're quite small in percentage terms - a 4. 6 percent fall on Monday and then a 4. 1 percent fall just now as you said. Back in 1987, Black Friday, the Dow lost a quarter of its value. These markets have been pumped up by lots of printed money since the Lehman collapse. Valuations are very stretched. Shares are too expensive. If we can get back to reality with a series of small, downward corrections rather than a huge dive, then that will be much better for America and the rest of the world. INSKEEP: Oh, so what you believe is happening is we're letting a little bit of air out of a bubble without popping it. HALLIGAN: That depends. I certainly hope so, and I think every - all observers should hope that that's the case. A lot of this comes down to the world's central bankers. I actually think Janet Yellen has been the best head of the Federal Reserve since Paul Volcker back in the 1980s. She's increased interest rates five times - deftly. She's communicated fairly and squarely with financial markets, and as such, those rate rises haven't led to a crash. INSKEEP: Oh. Well, now, let me ask you about this because Janet Yellen's last day was Friday just as the market was starting to decline, and our economics correspondent John Ydstie raised the possibility that one thing that may be happening in the market is just a bit of uncertainty about her successor, Jerome Powell - exactly what is he going to do, exactly how much confidence should people put in him. HALLIGAN: That's right. I think that's exactly right. We don't know much about Jerome Powell. He's a Trump appointee. Ordinarily, a Republican president would leave a Democrat head of the Federal Reserve there - a Democrat-appointed head of the Federal Reserve to serve out her two terms. That didn't happen with Janet Yellen. I think that was a mistake. Will Trump have more power over Powell than he should have given that this is meant to be an independent appointment? Will Powell feel that he can't raise interest rates as much as he wanted to? That will please the markets in the beginning, but it could lead to those valuations getting too juiced up all over again, leading to dangers. INSKEEP: Oh, no, you're raising a question, not making an accusation but raising a question. . . HALLIGAN: Absolutely. INSKEEP: . . . Of whether Powell would feel independent enough to raise interest rates the way that the Fed might want because that's the kind of thing that would slow down the economy in the way that an elected official might not love. HALLIGAN: That's right. Either he won't raise rates when he should, as Yellen has said they will be raised, which could lead to valuations spiraling upward and out of control. Or he may raise rates too quickly, leading to too much downward pressure on equities. Both things are bad. The market liked what Yellen was saying. She liked the pace at which she was raising rates. The market doesn't want that to change. It would have been much better if the president had kept, in my view, Janet Yellen where she was at this crucial time. INSKEEP: So let me just ask you. You've mentioned President Trump. We have just finished talking about a bit of chaos, or near chaos, as Congress briefly let the funding authority for the government expire. There was another shutdown. There have been many months of debates. Something seems to be somewhat resolved for the moment. But does the political situation in the United States affect in any fundamental way the global view of the United States as an investment? HALLIGAN: Oh, absolutely. And it must be said in the president's credit - to the president's credit that at Davos, the gabfest of the world's elite so-called in Switzerland. . . INSKEEP: Yeah. HALLIGAN: . . . In January, a lot of central - a lot of investment bankers, the Democrats (ph) who don't like Trump, were toasting him because of his tax cuts. They seemed to be business friendly. On the other hand, it may be if you cut taxes when the economy is really getting going - and the U. S. economy is motoring ahead at about 3 percent now - again that may be a little too rich for the market. It may juice up valuations too much to cut taxes just when the American economy is really getting going. That is a question for future historians. INSKEEP: Liam Halligan, pleasure talking with you. Thank you very much. HALLIGAN: And you - thank you for having me. INSKEEP: He writes for The Telegraph and other publications in London. (SOUNDBITE OF FLOFILZ'S \"SIPPIN\") STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  OK.

S. stocks seem to be back on a rollercoaster this morning. This follows a dramatic drop in the markets on Thursday. That decline of just over a thousand points officially made this recent slump a correction. That's the financial term for when the stock market falls at least 10 percent from a recent high. Now, we should keep things in perspective here. These are not historically bad days for the market, which had been on quite a hot streak. But this has been enough to spook foreign markets and also raise some questions about the health of the U. S. economy more broadly. I want to bring in NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie. Hi there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So more volatility today, it sounds like - so far this morning. YDSTIE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. The market opened substantially higher, so I think there was a little sigh of relief. But then it dropped steeply down into negative territory, and we had a 600-point swing - so more volatility today. Analysts say it's going to be that way for a time. Right now, it looks like we're in the green just a little bit - or, that is just in the positive area. But we'll see what the day brings. We have corrected. . . GREENE: Really up and down. YDSTIE: Yeah, up and down again today. We have corrected down 10 percent overall for this past week, including Friday. But some analysts are saying we could reach that bottom again and maybe even go a little bit lower before things stabilize. GREENE: What's causing all of this? YDSTIE: Well, several things. Stocks have been overvalued. I'm sure you've talked about that lots on MORNING EDITION. . . GREENE: Yeah. YDSTIE: . . . Over the last year or so. Too much exuberance - enthusiasm for the tax cuts contributed. That helped drive stocks up 7 percent in January, a really steep rise, all of which has now been given back. And then interest rates are moving higher. We were near zero for years. That helped make stocks the only place you could get a decent return on your investment. Now investors are concerned that rates may move higher faster. A week ago, we got a strong wage growth number in the jobs report. That suggested the Fed might raise rates even faster, and that actually triggered this sell-off. And you know, David, the market is worried a little bit about the Fed. We have a new chair, Jerome Powell. He says he will follow Janet Yellen's gradual approach to raising rates. But there are several open seats on the Fed's policymaking board. And. . . GREENE: And open seats means uncertainty, which markets don't always like (laughter). YDSTIE: Exactly. We don't know who's going to fill those seats and whether they'll want to raise rates faster. And then there's this other thing. People who were involved in this investment scheme - betting on low volatility in the market - they're still selling off stock to cover their losses. At least we think they are - it's not a very transparent process. And that along with highly automated trading and stocks may be fueling these deep dives. GREENE: God, there's just a whole list of factors coming together to do this. YDSTIE: A whole bunch of things going on. GREENE: What about what's happening in Washington? I mean, we had the president sign this spending bill into law this morning. And the feeling in Washington, I know, is with some sense of relief that maybe - maybe - the string of shutdown debates is over. Could that settle things down on the market? YDSTIE: I don't think so. In fact, you know, what we're seeing in this deal is several hundred billion dollars added to budget deficits in addition to those being created by the tax cut - about a trillion dollars. So the market doesn't like that. It's not going to affect prices significantly now, but it will weigh on the market because big deficits can hurt the economy. GREENE: Well, speaking of the economy - I mean, you're saying could hurt the economy in, you know, later years - what about right this moment? I mean, does the volatility on Wall Street suggest that this economy is not as strong as we thought it was? YDSTIE: No. The - Wall Street is not the economy. And the economy is very strong. In fact, maybe it's a little bit stronger than had been anticipated. And that's part of the reason people are concerned that rates are going to go up faster. But we've got a strong economy. What's happening is really a stock market issue. GREENE: OK. That's NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie talking us through what seems like another volatile day on Wall Street. John, we'll be following what happens with you. Thanks. YDSTIE: All right, David. Thanks. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Well, after a strong start, U.

He's now professor of the practice of economic policy at Harvard's Kennedy School and joins us now. Thanks very much for being with us, professor. JASON FURMAN: Thanks for having me. SIMON: Is this stock market down because wages reportedly are up? FURMAN: I think that is part of the story. Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that for private sector workers, wages were up 2. 9 percent for the year. The market appeared to have taken that quite seriously. I'm a little bit less certain because they reported some other wage data that showed slower growth than that. But looking at the totality of recent releases, it does seem that wage growth probably has firmed somewhat - maybe not as much as that headline indicator would lead one to think. SIMON: The majority of Americans don't own stock, even when you add in 401(k)s. So how concerned should Americans be with the stock market and the volatility we've seen? FURMAN: I - the thing most Americans should care the most about is how the actual economy is going. What is the unemployment rate? What is the rate of wage growth? What is overall income growth like? The stock market, as you said, doesn't matter directly for an awful lot of households. And you could have weird things happen. Something that President Trump actually complained about was correct. You can get good news in the economy. And because of that, people get nervous that interest rates are going to go up, and the stock market goes down. So I think it's much more important to look at what's actually happening for people in the economy than markets because they do crazy things all the time for all sorts of reasons. SIMON: And yet we report them every day every hour. FURMAN: I've always thought that was a bit of a problem. The statistic that I care about most in the economy - the two statistics - are median household income and the poverty rate. And we report those once a year because we only get them once a year. We get the S&P every minute of every day, and we hear it all the time. And I think that leads people to focus a little bit too much on these gyrations in the market minute to minute and a little bit too little on the underlying trend for incomes in the economy. SIMON: As the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, how do you see the responsibility of the administration in times like this when we're so sensitive to what's happening on Wall Street? FURMAN: I think the administration should be focused on job growth, wage growth. And in particular, we have much less of a short-term problem now because we have a 4. 1 percent unemployment rate. So I think the administration should be more focused on making sure that that growth is sustainable for the medium and long run, for example, without skyrocketing deficits and also making sure that we're increasing our productivity growth by, for example, making investments in infrastructure, education and the other things you need to undergird stronger growth over time. SIMON: Does there need to be massive federal government investment in infrastructure at a time when the unemployment rate is so low? FURMAN: Having more roads, having more ports, having a better train system will mean, over the next five, 10, 20 years, our economic growth can be stronger. We don't need to increase the deficit to get that, though. We could, for example, do what the trucking association and the Chamber of Commerce would like us to do, which is to have a higher gas tax to pay for more investments in our roads. That would make us richer over time. SIMON: Jason Furman, who is former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, thanks so much for being with us.

He said, companies do not care how they abuse us just so the executives get their bonuses. Due to the huge numbers of cars available with desperate drivers trying to feed their families, they squeeze rates to below operating costs and force professionals like me out of business. They count their money, and we are driven down into the streets we drive, becoming homeless and hungry. I will not be a slave working for chump change. I would rather be dead. Later that day, Douglas Schifter took his life outside of City Hall in Manhattan. His suicide has underscored the financial and emotional challenges for professional drivers, whose industry has been disrupted, as they put it, by companies like Uber and Lyft.

DESAI: You know, Doug really summed up the reality of a vicious race to the bottom. It's a business model that's specifically aimed at turning a full-time profession into part-time poverty pay gigs. And no driver wins a race to the bottom. SIMON: Are the days gone when a man or woman can drive a cab for 8 or 10 hours and make a living, support a family? DESAI: Yes. I had a member tell me yesterday this is his typical day - he works, you know, he sleeps for 7 hours, says he has 2 hours for himself to take a shower, eat a meal at home, say hi to his wife and kids if they happen to be at home. And then he's out driving. He hasn't had a day off in three years - long shifts, increasingly isolating. Sometimes, you take home 25, maybe 50 bucks at the end of your 12 hours. And the thing is it feels like there's no end in sight. SIMON: What two or three things would you do if you could? DESAI: Well, first and foremost, there really doesn't need to be a cap on the number of vehicles, you know? And I think it'll give, you know, workers a fighting chance at earning a decent living, and it won't clog the streets anymore, so others can get around. Also, we need to establish one metered rate. Imagine if across the economy, there is no minimum wage to protect the workers. It would be slave-like conditions. Third, we need to see an increase in the rate that we have today for drivers. SIMON: The loss of Douglas Schifter is obviously a tragedy. Without getting hyperbolic, do you think his suffering and depression is symptomatic of what a lot of people are feeling? DESAI: I've been organizing taxi drivers for - since 1996, and I've never seen the level of desperation. I started to receive so many calls from drivers seeking resources for suicide prevention and talking about homelessness and, you know, eviction notices. And so something has to be done here. You know, people - we don't - this is not accidental. Working people have a right to be protected. We have a right to work with dignity and justice, and that can be done through proper regulation.

That's kind of what happened to President Trump. The president unveiled his budget proposal this morning, offering a detailed blueprint of how he thinks the government should spend its money next year, but members of Congress who actually control the purse strings had already come up with their own bigger spending plan last week. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from the White House. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: So a presidential budget is usually seen as a political document rather than an actual binding financial plan. Is that even more true this year? I mean, what do you get out of this budget? HORSLEY: You're right. Lawmakers often ignore the White House budget when it comes out. This year, lawmakers acted even before the budget came out and agreed to their own top-line spending levels for both this year and next. Now, there is one area where the White House is in sync with Congress, and that's defense spending. Trump's budget seeks $716 billion in defense spending next year, which, by coincidence, is exactly what lawmakers agreed to last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our military was totally depleted, and we will have a military like we've never had before. HORSLEY: There's more of a disconnect, though, on the domestic side, where Trump wants spending cuts but Congress has authorized more money next year - $68 billion more for discretionary nondefense programs. SHAPIRO: If Congress is going to go its own way on the budget anyway, what difference does this proposed budget from the president make? HORSLEY: Well, it's a signal of the White House priorities. For example, Trump wants more money for border security, including $18 billion for his border wall plus additional money for Border Patrol agents, ICE officers and tens of thousands of detention beds. Now, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney was pretty frank this afternoon in saying Congress is not likely to approve that kind of money except as part of a broader agreement on immigration. But Mulvaney says the point of this exercise is for the administration to put a marker down on spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICK MULVANEY: The executive budget has always been a messaging document. What are the messages this year? Number one, you don't have to spend all of this money, Congress. But if you do, here is how we would prefer to see you spend it. HORSLEY: For example, the White House is calling for a 34 percent cut in EPA spending, a 26 percent cut in State Department spending and a 16 percent cut in spending by the Agriculture Department, which, by the way, includes some steps on welfare reform - for example, more stringent work requirements for people receiving food stamps. SHAPIRO: Scott, any budget is going to have the revenue element and the spending element. And Congress has not only agreed to spend more money. Lawmakers have also cut taxes by $1 and a half trillion. What does that do for the federal deficit? HORSLEY: The deficit is expected to balloon. The White House is predicting that it's going to grow this year to more than $800 billion or more than 4 percent of the overall economy. Next year, the deficit is projected to hit 4. 7 percent of GDP. Now, it'd be one thing to see deficits that big in a time of recession, but it's really remarkable to see that much red ink when the economy is doing well as it is right now and we're near full employment. And what's more, the White House may actually be lowballing the deficit figure because this budget assumes fairly robust economic growth. They expect growth to grow from 2. 3 percent last year to 3 percent this year, 3. 2 percent next year and then to hold at 3 percent or higher all the way through 2024. A lot of independent economists think that's overly rosy. And if they're right, the federal deficits could get even bigger. SHAPIRO: NPR's Scott Horsley speaking with us from the White House.

For example, Trump wants more money for border security, including $18 billion for his border wall plus additional money for Border Patrol agents, ICE officers and tens of thousands of detention beds. Now, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney was pretty frank this afternoon in saying Congress is not likely to approve that kind of money except as part of a broader agreement on immigration. But Mulvaney says the point of this exercise is for the administration to put a marker down on spending. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICK MULVANEY: The executive budget has always been a messaging document. What are the messages this year? Number one, you don't have to spend all of this money, Congress. But if you do, here is how we would prefer to see you spend it. HORSLEY: For example, the White House is calling for a 34 percent cut in EPA spending, a 26 percent cut in State Department spending and a 16 percent cut in spending by the Agriculture Department, which, by the way, includes some steps on welfare reform - for example, more stringent work requirements for people receiving food stamps. SHAPIRO: Scott, any budget is going to have the revenue element and the spending element. And Congress has not only agreed to spend more money. Lawmakers have also cut taxes by $1 and a half trillion. What does that do for the federal deficit? HORSLEY: The deficit is expected to balloon. The White House is predicting that it's going to grow this year to more than $800 billion or more than 4 percent of the overall economy. Next year, the deficit is projected to hit 4. 7 percent of GDP. Now, it'd be one thing to see deficits that big in a time of recession, but it's really remarkable to see that much red ink when the economy is doing well as it is right now and we're near full employment. And what's more, the White House may actually be lowballing the deficit figure because this budget assumes fairly robust economic growth. They expect growth to grow from 2. 3 percent last year to 3 percent this year, 3. 2 percent next year and then to hold at 3 percent or higher all the way through 2024. A lot of independent economists think that's overly rosy. And if they're right, the federal deficits could get even bigger. SHAPIRO: NPR's Scott Horsley speaking with us from the White House.

And that, according to a report from the Commerce Department, is a threat to national security. Last week, department officials recommended that President Trump impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. That plan certainly has critics, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The Commerce Department report portrayed a steel industry that's lost enormous ground to foreign competitors. The U. S. imports four times as much steel as it exports. China alone produces as much steel in a month as the U. S. does in a year. And the picture was just as dismal for aluminum, where jobs fell by 58 percent between 2013 and 2016. Scott Paul of the Alliance for American Manufacturing says import tariffs could reverse some of the damage that's been done to these industries. SCOTT PAUL: There's a real opportunity for the president to make a difference for some of those forgotten men and women that he talked about for so long on the campaign trail in states like Pennsylvania. ZARROLI: But the question of whether to impose tariffs, which are a kind of tax on imports, isn't as simple as it seems. While tariffs may save steel jobs, they would increase costs for other manufacturers. REMY NATHAN: This is a complex set of problems and possible solutions with potential for unintended consequences. ZARROLI: Remy Nathan is vice president of the U. S. Aerospace Industries Association. He says U. S. aviation manufacturing is an export success story. It provides nearly 2 1/2 million American jobs, and it depends heavily on steel and aluminum imports. Take, for instance, the fasteners that are used to connect airplane parts. Tariffs would drive up the cost of manufacturing them in the U. S. he says. NATHAN: Now, multiply that impact across every possible piece of an aircraft that connects to an aluminum or a steel part, and you could have a cascading effect that has pretty significant impacts on our industry's global competitiveness. ZARROLI: And tariffs could have a ripple effect in other ways. Mark Vaughn is president of Nashville-based Vaughn Manufacturing, which makes parts for appliance and automakers. Vaughn buys the steel he uses from U. S. suppliers, but he's concerned about the broader disruption that tariffs would cause in manufacturing. Vaughn says, if tariffs take effect, some of the big companies he sells to could start doing more of their manufacturing abroad. MARK VAUGHN: All of them concentrate on cost, and if the cost of their product goes up, then that would create the environment where they may look elsewhere as far as how they go about supplying their plants. ZARROLI: And there's another worry - the tariffs will most likely be challenged at the World Trade Organization, which mediates disputes. The U. S. could argue that it needs aluminum and steel industries for making tanks and planes for defense purposes, but if it does, other countries can follow suit and end up imposing tariffs of their own. Scott Paul of the Alliance for American Manufacturing says that's pretty unlikely. No other country has the huge trade imbalances that the U. S. has. PAUL: The difference is, in the past, we've kind of just sat back and taken it when countries violated our trade laws and have dumped into our market. This time, we're standing up. ZARROLI: In fact, he says, tariffs could benefit the U. S. economy by smoothing out the distortions caused by trade imbalances. But to impose them, President Trump would end up alienating a lot of other manufacturers, and that may be a risk he doesn't want to take. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

S. , Mexican and Canadian trade officials are back at it. They are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. It's their seventh round of talks in the past six months. Now, progress has been made on small technical details. But as NPR's Sonari Glinton reports, some of the big sticking points involve the auto industry and one key number. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: When you think about NAFTA and the car industry, it's important to know that not all auto companies are the same. Let's start with Ford. Now, no matter how you look at it, Ford is not really a car company. Ford makes trucks. That's what it sells the most of and that's what it's best at. It's where the money comes from. And pickup trucks are where Ford gets most of its profits. Here's Joe Hinrichs. He's in charge of Ford's North and South American operations. JOE HINRICHS: You know, Ford - we make over 80 percent of our production. Our sales in the U. S. are already built in the U. S. , so we make more of a higher percentage of our vehicle production in the U. S. than anybody else. GLINTON: The Trump administration wants to change how a vehicle qualifies under NAFTA, meaning it's not subject to taxes and tariffs. Right now, sixty-two point percent of a vehicle has to be made in Mexico, the U. S. and/or Canada. Now, here's the number that's causing the anxiety - 85 percent. So 85 percent of the content would have to come from NAFTA countries with half the content coming from the U. S. So Ford being the most American car company for these purposes has the least to lose, which is why Joe Hinrichs sounds almost upbeat. HINRICHS: So we're in a good position to make all our trucks here. We're bringing the Ranger and Bronco here. We're adding capacity at Flat Rock to build the automic (ph) vehicle here. So we're actually in a relatively good position as far as U. S. content. And we're looking forward to modernization of NAFTA that works for everybody. GLINTON: If we look at Fiat Chrysler, it's a bit different from Ford. Fiat Chrysler is both an American and a European company. SERGIO MARCHIONNE: I sincerely hope that some of the demands that are being pushed by the U. S. administration are going to be retuned. GLINTON: That's Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler's CEO. He says you don't need to tear up NAFTA to bring more jobs to the U. S. He points to his and other company's investments. MARCHIONNE: I don't think we need to go to the 85 number to try and address what President Trump's concerns are. I'm hopeful. And I think we'll see a more rational number going forward. GLINTON: Now, take the case of Toyota, a company that makes a lot of vehicles in the U. S. and sells many of them overseas. JIM LENTZ: We export 136,000 vehicles to almost 40 countries around the world. We can only do that and be competitive with NAFTA. GLINTON: Jim Lentz is Toyota's North American CEO. LENTZ: And I'll give you the perfect example. We export Highlanders to China. If losing NAFTA raises my cost, Russia's going to say, do I want to buy a Highlander coming out of the U. S. ? Or maybe it's less expensive to buy it out of another plant coming out of China. GLINTON: Monica de Bolle is an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a D. C. think tank that's pro-trade. She says that 85 percent number for content would upend the entire industry. MONICA DE BOLLE: This would basically force carmakers to rethink their entire production structure. GLINTON: De Bolle says even if the administration got everything it wanted, change would take time. DE BOLLE: The jobs and the, you know, bringing back the factories, bringing back all the stuff that the administration says it wants to bring back - that wouldn't happen within a timeframe of one, two, three years. It would take much, much longer than that. GLINTON: De Bolle says by the time those low-wage jobs come back from Mexico, they'll likely be done by robots. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

Democrats have long argued for a federal policy of paid family leave, and now Republicans, including President Trump's daughter Ivanka, are talking up their own proposals. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The discussion around paid leave in Washington, D. C. , in some ways mirrors what happened last year in Washington state. Joe Fain, a state senator, says the legislature and business community there acted after cities adopted ballot measures to expand leave. JOE FAIN: There were a number of businesses that were looking at proposals out of the city of Seattle that really weren't affordable for businesses to be able to pay. And I think there was a desire by some to say, hey, let's get together, let's create a framework for a state-wide plan. NOGUCHI: Fain, a Republican, took paid leave when his son was born and became an advocate. Just as cities pushed Washington state to act, he says states like his are now pressuring federal lawmakers. FAIN: A number of states are in a position to act immediately, and I think they should do so. NOGUCHI: Congressional Republicans have a couple of proposals. Most recently, Florida Republican Marco Rubio has said he is drafting a plan to allow workers to draw on Social Security funds to cover leave for the birth or adoption of a child in exchange for delaying payments at retirement. A House Republican bill would set a minimum number of paid leave days employers could offer in exchange for not having to comply with other state or local leave laws. Ellen Bravo is executive director of Family Values @ Work, a national coalition of paid leave advocates. ELLEN BRAVO: We're glad to see the conversation get sparked, but we're also committed to a policy that works that isn't a step in the wrong direction. NOGUCHI: She says Republican proposals to date falls short. The problem, she says, is they don't cover enough and don't require employers to offer paid leave. Instead, Bravo supports the FAMILY Act, a Democrat-backed proposal that splits the cost of leave between employers and workers. It would increase payroll taxes by a few dollars a week to pay for up to 12 weeks of parental or medical leave. Marilyn Watkins of Seattle says policies need to cover a broad range of life events. MARILYN WATKINS: Three years ago, my mother died, and my sister and I were able to drop everything and spend the last weeks of her life caring for her. That was really important for our family. NOGUCHI: Watkins is policy director for the Economic Opportunity Institute and had paid leave from her employer but says she knows plenty of workers who don't. WATKINS: The only way to make these programs universal is through social insurance. NOGUCHI: But for some conservative groups and business interests, a universal federal paid leave requirement or an increase in payroll taxes to pay for it are unwelcome. Carrie Lukas is president of the Independent Women's Forum, an advocate for free market policy. CARRIE LUKAS: Mandating that all companies must provide paid leave to their workers - well, the problem with that is it makes hiring more expensive. It reduces job opportunities. NOGUCHI: Last month, Lukas' group published the idea of tapping into Social Security early, inspiring the proposal from Senator Rubio. Critics of her group's proposal say that would delay retirement, especially for low-wage workers. Lukas doesn't agree. LUKAS: I don't think it's a tremendous hardship to delay receiving retirement benefits from 67 to 67 1/2 if you decide to use a bunch of parental benefits. NOGUCHI: If a federal policy does pass, one of the big questions is how it would affect state and local laws. Lisa Horn, director of congressional affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management, says uniform policy is a key point for employers. A patchwork of different laws, she says, makes compliance difficult for them. LISA HORN: Sometimes they can find themselves trying to comply with one law, maybe the state law, and running afoul of the local law.

SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Things have been good in the car industry for quite a while. 2017 was one of the best years ever, but it was a comedown from all-time records. MARK SCARPELLI: I can tell you that coming off a plateau in the last couple years for sure. GLINTON: That's Mark Scarpelli. Now, he runs the Raymond Auto Group, a group of dealerships in the Chicago suburbs, with his father Raymond Sr. and his brother Raymond Jr. Scarpelli says with the forecast for slowing sales for 2018, normally he'd be worried. But he says the car companies are making much more money off of each car. They cut labor costs. They're more efficient. All that has caught on, he says. SCARPELLI: Same could go for local automobile dealers such as ours. We have made sure that we keep our budgets in line - marketing, inventory, handling costs. You know, we carry what we need. We don't go in excess to carry things on our lot. GLINTON: Scarpelli says one of the reasons the industry is doing well is that the customers are buying SUV and trucks, and those are really profitable. SCARPELLI: You know, there has been a seismic change in our industry in people's wants and needs. You know, a few years back, the sedan or a coupe was quite popular. GLINTON: All that cash coming in from SUVs and trucks means that employees of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler group all took home fat profit-sharing checks. Kristin Dziczek is with the Center for Automotive Research. KRISTIN DZICZEK: I'm just going to pull up my profit-sharing spreadsheet here, if you don't mind, to put it in some perspective of where we've been over time. Just take a second here - sorry. GLINTON: OK, while she looks for the answer, it's actually $11,750 for General Motors assembly line workers. And that represents about 30 percent of their salary for the lower paid workers. But those are not higher wages. Dziczek says holding down salaries and relying on profit-sharing means that the companies can cut costs or make changes in production without resorting first to massive layoffs. Dziczek says there are a whole list of things to be worried about in the near future. Consumer credit appears to be slowing, and the default rate on auto loans is rising, and gas prices are at their highest since 2014, and that could hurt an industry increasingly dependent on SUVs and trucks. Despite all that, Dziczek says about the car companies. . . DZICZEK: They're much, much more ready to weather a downturn in automotive sales. GLINTON: Jessica Caldwell is an analyst with edmunds. com. She says the car companies have become nimbler and more responsive to consumer tastes. Caldwell says today's SUVs are more fuel efficient, making them more immune to the price at the pump. She says car companies are in a very good position to survive a downturn or even a recession. But coming changes in technology, the self-driving car thing, that could be a whole different story. JESSICA CALDWELL: And now we're looking at something that's so much larger. You know, can my business essentially stay relevant in the next two decades? Which I don't think was ever a fear in the past 20 years. GLINTON: Apparently, the car business can't take anything for granted - not anymore. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

Trump may have fired the opening shot this week when he announced plans to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In this battle, as with any war, some people get the spoils, while others get caught in the crossfire. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The tariffs are intended to protect America's domestic steel and aluminum industries, which Trump said ruefully used to be a lot bigger. Scott Paul, who runs the Alliance for American Manufacturing, knows. Steel employment has dropped more than a third in the last two decades, while aluminum job shrank nearly 60 percent in just three years. SCOTT PAUL: The thing about those jobs is that they're hard to replace in those communities in the industrial Midwest. It's likely that the workers who lose those jobs will never find another job. Or if they do, it'll be at a much, much lower pay grade. HORSLEY: Paul's group has been running TV ads urging the administration to crack down on imports. He was delighted by the president's surprise announcement, which calls for even bigger tariffs than the Commerce Department recommended. PAUL: It's been a crazy 36 hours or so (laughter). HORSLEY: But while U. S. steel and aluminum makers were buoyed by the president's move, much of the rest of the economy was rattled by the prospect of higher prices for products that use steel and aluminum, as well as retaliation by America's trading partners. The White House downplayed the effect on prices, saying the tariffs would add perhaps a penny to the cost of an aluminum can. But Jim McGreevey of the Beer Institute says it's not good for Joe Six-pack when the price of a six-pack goes up. JIM MCGREEVEY: Those pennies add up. Last year, American brewers bought more than 36 billion beer cans. HORSLEY: Multiply that by dozens of other metal-consuming industries. As the Wall Street Journal noted, U. S. steel mills employ 140,000 people. Companies that use steel employ 6 1/2 million. MCGREEVEY: We're really hoping that the president will hear the concerns that the aerospace, soft drink, automobile manufacturers have raised and take a different course before next week. HORSLEY: Other countries have promised to fight the U. S. tariffs with import restrictions of their own, targeting Kentucky bourbon, for example, or Harley Davidson motorcycles. U. S. agriculture could also take a hit. KRISTIN DUNCANSON: Farmers oftentimes get stuck in this tit-for-tat retaliation kind of scenario. And it just is not good for American agriculture. HORSLEY: Kristin Duncanson raises soybeans, corn and hogs in south central Minnesota. She and her farm neighbors are heavily dependent on export markets in Europe and Asia. DUNCANSON: We figure here in Minnesota, about one in every third row of soybeans get exported. HORSLEY: At a commodity conference in California this week, Duncanson says many farmers have been buttonholing the secretary of agriculture, hoping Sonny Perdue might persuade the president to change course. DUNCANSON: We'll ask him to make sure that the president realizes what these kind of actions mean to America's farmers and ranchers. And I can tell you there are some phones ringing off the hook in congressional offices, too, today. HORSLEY: Trump doesn't need a green light from Congress to impose tariffs, but the crackdown on steel and aluminum imports is controversial even within the White House. The president announced his plans yesterday before aides even had time to craft a formal order. Tariff supporter Scott Paul acknowledges things still could change. PAUL: We're not taking anything for granted yet because we realize there's a few days before the president said he would finally sign something.

President Trump made that announcement at the White House yesterday. The state of Ohio has a long, proud history of steel manufacturing. Cleveland has the most productive steel mill in the U. S. We wanted to see how the new tariffs might affect the industry in the state, so we've called Ned Hill. He's an economist at Ohio State University who studies manufacturing. Welcome to the program. NED HILL: Well, Ari, thank you so much and appreciate you calling. SHAPIRO: President Trump has been saying since his campaign that tariffs like this will revitalize the American steel industry. Do you think that's true? HILL: No. SHAPIRO: No. OK, thank you for joining us today. It's been a pleasure. HILL: (Laughter) Well, so the president makes the claim that a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum import will revitalize the industry, and it's just nonsense. There are two things that will happen. One is the current plants will indeed be able to sell and make more steel. When you look at steel, though, you have to look at where it sits in the supply chain of manufacturing. Steel is used by everything else in the economy. So if you increase the price of imported steel by 25 percent, that means the price of domestic steel will go up. The end result is domestically made products which are internationally competitive - their prices will go up. SHAPIRO: Let's imagine for a moment that the tariff does go into effect. Prices on imported steel go up. Prices on domestic steel go up. Is the short-term consequence of that more jobs for steelworkers, fewer jobs for steelworkers? What's the immediate consequence for the U. S. steel industry, specifically in Ohio? HILL: Well, for steelworkers, hours will go up. There will be some increase in employment. I doubt you'll see new plants come online because those are very expensive. For example, when U. S. Steel in Lorain shut down their pipe plant last year, they had to write off $850 million. There's an electric arc steel factory in Mingo Junction that's trying to start up. They'll love it. But it's taken them 2 1/2 years to get that plant to the point where it can be operating again. SHAPIRO: We're talking about manufacturers of steel and aluminum. But there are other big manufacturing plants that use steel and aluminum, whether it's GE or car companies. What's this going to do to them? HILL: For Ohio, it will be devastating. One of the largest manufacturing employers in the state is GE jet engines down in Evendale. So what that will do - it will increase the cost of their jet engine compared to Rolls-Royce, and you'll see the market shift. The backwash effects will be huge. SHAPIRO: You're an economist who studies manufacturing. You spend all day every day thinking about these issues. For some of the blue-collar workers in these plants, do you think there is an appropriate level of skepticism, or are they celebrating that this is going to mean a return of American steel and aluminum, whether or not that's what it actually turns out to be? HILL: It depends how close they are to their retirements. If they're going to retire in the next two to three years, they should be doing high fives and dancing in the streets. If they're part of the new, young group of workers who are coming into the plants because the plants have been hiring for the past two and a half years, their life just got a lot dicier because if you look 30 years out, you can look forward to recession and look forward to a trade war. SHAPIRO: Tell me more about the potential trade war here. We're talking specifically about aluminum and steel, but Ohio exports a lot of other things, agricultural products. Do you think other countries might retaliate in ways that would harm those exports? HILL: Oh, I think it's inevitable. Agriculture is still a very important part of Ohio. Corn exports and soybean exports are critical. And if we put a large tariff on Canadian or Mexican steel, and they retaliate with a tariff on agricultural products knowing that Argentina and Brazil, our competitor, can fill the hole, all of a sudden you blow a hole in the inner important part of the economy of the state. I think of this as the president doing a cannonball into the low end of a swimming pool. The water's going to go everywhere, and you just don't know where it's going to hit.

He is the director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. That's a research institute here in Washington, D. C. He's also a longtime economics reporter and editor. And he's with us now. Good to have you back with us. Thanks for joining us. DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome. Good to be - talk to you. MARTIN: Well, you heard our conversation with Congressman Costello. I mean, is the debate about this as ambivalent as he was? I mean, is - are the - sort of the sides fairly evenly matched? WESSEL: No, I don't think there's a lot of ambivalence. Although as the congressman points out, the president kind of blurted this out, and a lot does depend on the details. Will he, for instance, exempt steel from Canada, which doesn't seem like our greatest enemy in the world? Will there be exemptions for some kind of steel which we don't make in the United States? So it's very hard to tell exactly what the president is going to do. And I suspect there's a lot of maneuvering about it. But basically the world is divided between people who think America's getting a raw deal on trade - and they like tariffs, and President Trump clearly has a number of supporters who think that - and other people - most economists, a lot of members of Congress - who are horrified that the president is starting a so-called trade war that'll end badly. MARTIN: And who would be the - and I hate to put it so bluntly, but who would be the winners and losers here? WESSEL: Well, in general, the winners should be the people who make steel and aluminum and the people who work for them. That's what this is meant to do. It's meant to protect them from imports, allow them to raise their prices. The losers would be pretty much everybody else. So for instance, if you look at the data, there's very few people - only about 140,000 - who make steel in the United States. There's 6 1/2 million people who work for companies that buy steel. So small number of winners, a lot of losers. MARTIN: Why did the stock market react so negatively? WESSEL: That's a great question. Basically steel and aluminum are a very small part of the American economy, so I don't think you can explain it - the tariffs on them. I think what the stock market is worried about is this is the beginning of a cascading series of very harsh measures on trade. The president has felt strongly about this. His staff has held him back until now. He makes a move. The European Union is already talking about putting retaliatory taxes on U. S. exports of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon and blue jeans. And who knows what the Chinese and the Canadians will do? So I think the market's worried that this is the beginning of a series of adverse effects that'll hurt the U. S. economy and hurt U. S. businesses. MARTIN: Well, President Trump tweeted earlier today, quote, \"the United States has an $800 billion yearly trade deficit because of our\" - quote, \"very stupid,\" unquote - \"trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more,\" exclamation point. End of tweet. Well, let's just take out the - sort of the invective for a minute and just ask the question, is it a fact that there is an $800 billion trade deficit, and that this does contribute to, say, job loss in the United States, and that that's a worthy reason to consider a measure like this? WESSEL: Most economists would argue that the point of trade is to benefit both parties - both the United States and China. The president seems to look at this as every time we win, they lose and vice versa. That's the fundamental disagreement here. But that's not to say that the president is wrong that there are some trade practices by other countries that do hurt American workers. And so the question really isn't, could we do a better job of protecting our workers from unfair trade practices? The question is, is this the right way to do it? I mean, the president is trying to blow up agreements that the United States has struck with other countries to try and set rules for trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement, the agreement that created the World Trade Organization, the agreement to set up the Trans-Pacific trade partnership - all those things were designed to make the rules fair. There's a lot of criticism of those rules, and they probably could be better. I don't think very many sober people think that slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum, which seems kind of like a 1950s kind of thing, is going to solve the problem. MARTIN: Before we let you go, what are some of the things that you are going to be looking at and that other people like you who watch the economy closely are going to be looking at in the coming weeks to see what long-term effect this might have if, in fact, the president follows through on this threat? WESSEL: One thing is the details. What exactly is it going to do? Two, what are other countries going to do? Are they going to laugh at the United States and say, you have a paper tiger as president and we're just going to sit by? Or do they start to fight back? And three, how do the Chinese handle it? It's really interesting. The president is very angry at China and says they're not trading fairly. We import very little steel from China, so this won't hurt them. But it suggests - and I think he's using this as a negotiating tactic to say to the Chinese, I'm going to be different than all my predecessors. We'll see. Do they react by being more conciliatory? Or do they react saying, we can play that game, too? MARTIN: That's David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution and Wall Street Journal contributor. David, thank you. WESSEL: You're welcome.

Will he, for instance, exempt steel from Canada, which doesn't seem like our greatest enemy in the world? Will there be exemptions for some kind of steel which we don't make in the United States? So it's very hard to tell exactly what the president is going to do. And I suspect there's a lot of maneuvering about it. But basically the world is divided between people who think America's getting a raw deal on trade - and they like tariffs, and President Trump clearly has a number of supporters who think that - and other people - most economists, a lot of members of Congress - who are horrified that the president is starting a so-called trade war that'll end badly. MARTIN: And who would be the - and I hate to put it so bluntly, but who would be the winners and losers here? WESSEL: Well, in general, the winners should be the people who make steel and aluminum and the people who work for them. That's what this is meant to do. It's meant to protect them from imports, allow them to raise their prices. The losers would be pretty much everybody else. So for instance, if you look at the data, there's very few people - only about 140,000 - who make steel in the United States. There's 6 1/2 million people who work for companies that buy steel. So small number of winners, a lot of losers. MARTIN: Why did the stock market react so negatively? WESSEL: That's a great question. Basically steel and aluminum are a very small part of the American economy, so I don't think you can explain it - the tariffs on them. I think what the stock market is worried about is this is the beginning of a cascading series of very harsh measures on trade. The president has felt strongly about this. His staff has held him back until now. He makes a move. The European Union is already talking about putting retaliatory taxes on U. S. exports of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon and blue jeans. And who knows what the Chinese and the Canadians will do? So I think the market's worried that this is the beginning of a series of adverse effects that'll hurt the U. S. economy and hurt U. S. businesses. MARTIN: Well, President Trump tweeted earlier today, quote, \"the United States has an $800 billion yearly trade deficit because of our\" - quote, \"very stupid,\" unquote - \"trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more,\" exclamation point. End of tweet. Well, let's just take out the - sort of the invective for a minute and just ask the question, is it a fact that there is an $800 billion trade deficit, and that this does contribute to, say, job loss in the United States, and that that's a worthy reason to consider a measure like this? WESSEL: Most economists would argue that the point of trade is to benefit both parties - both the United States and China. The president seems to look at this as every time we win, they lose and vice versa. That's the fundamental disagreement here. But that's not to say that the president is wrong that there are some trade practices by other countries that do hurt American workers. And so the question really isn't, could we do a better job of protecting our workers from unfair trade practices? The question is, is this the right way to do it? I mean, the president is trying to blow up agreements that the United States has struck with other countries to try and set rules for trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement, the agreement that created the World Trade Organization, the agreement to set up the Trans-Pacific trade partnership - all those things were designed to make the rules fair. There's a lot of criticism of those rules, and they probably could be better. I don't think very many sober people think that slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum, which seems kind of like a 1950s kind of thing, is going to solve the problem. MARTIN: Before we let you go, what are some of the things that you are going to be looking at and that other people like you who watch the economy closely are going to be looking at in the coming weeks to see what long-term effect this might have if, in fact, the president follows through on this threat? WESSEL: One thing is the details. What exactly is it going to do? Two, what are other countries going to do? Are they going to laugh at the United States and say, you have a paper tiger as president and we're just going to sit by? Or do they start to fight back? And three, how do the Chinese handle it? It's really interesting. The president is very angry at China and says they're not trading fairly. We import very little steel from China, so this won't hurt them. But it suggests - and I think he's using this as a negotiating tactic to say to the Chinese, I'm going to be different than all my predecessors. We'll see. Do they react by being more conciliatory? Or do they react saying, we can play that game, too? MARTIN: That's David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution and Wall Street Journal contributor. David, thank you. WESSEL: You're welcome.

It's a move that could have a profound effect on prices in the U. S. and on trade and diplomatic relations with the U. S. And the move is making some strange bedfellows as some Democrats and union groups are applauding the president's decision while members of his own party are criticizing it. We're gathering different points of view about this all weekend, and we're going to start with Congressman Ryan Costello. He is a Republican. He's in his second term representing Pennsylvania's 6th District, which is northwest of Philadelphia. You might remember that reviving the steel industry was one of President Trump's campaign promises, and that's one of the factors cited in Mr. Trump's victory in Pennsylvania in the 2016 election. But he didn't win Mr. Costello's district, where Hillary Clinton won narrowly. And Congressman Costello is with us now. Congressman, thanks so much for speaking with us. RYAN COSTELLO: Great to be with you. Strange bedfellows is an apt description for sure. MARTIN: Well, tell me about this. I mean, and let's set the table first if you can. Your district still has steel manufacturing in it. Am I right about that? COSTELLO: On the circumference of it, yes. Additionally - little known fact - the only domestic keg company in the country is in my district. And I spoke with them yesterday, and they are extremely happy with the decision because of what the price of aluminum from China is. So there's a lot of crosscurrents in terms of who supports this as well as - some who would normally support the president's economic policies have very deep-seated concerns over it. MARTIN: Well, tell me yours. What's your reaction to it? COSTELLO: Well, this is certainly doubling down to those who supported him. And he's consistent here with whom he is looking out for. It does remain to be seen what the actual policy is. This is - this could - may at the moment be similar to withdrawal of the Paris accord - right? - which pleased his supporters but has not yet happened. So it remains to be seen formally what steps are taken. The concern, though, is the unpredictability and the market uncertainty associated with what European Union and WTO nations will do as retaliation. They can be very, very sophisticated in terms of the types of industries, even the types of states or constituencies that they might like to send a message to with tariffs on us. The other element here that's deeply concerning is the president's very simplistic notion that trade wars are good, that we will win them, that it's easy and that if they don't come to play, then we just won't ship anything to them. Well, then that country is going to go somewhere else, and it means that our main domestic manufacturing could suffer as a result. So there's a lot more at play here, and it's not a simplistic, we're going to put tariffs down, and that's going to solve all the problems. It's likely to create some problems as well. MARTIN: I take it from your comments here that you're just not sure how you feel about this yet. Am I right about that? COSTELLO: Because it's so new - it's very nuanced, and it remains to be seen. He may - look; whether the president even follows through with the 10 and 25 percent tariffs remains to be seen. What retaliatory measures European Union countries take remains to be seen. Whether we can even go through with a 232 process under the realm of national security - which, by the way, is the only way that the president is able to do this - remains to be seen. So I think that there's a lot of question marks. The politics of it, though, are very idiosyncratic because it is going to bring some labor constituencies, some historically Democratic constituencies as well as those who may have never voted before - say, this is the president; he's doing what he said he was going to do. And there are a lot of people in this country that feel that and see that. At the same point in time, what you might call free market Republican constituencies - and I have a lot of businesses that would fall into that category; I myself probably would be coined that - do see the potential harm associated with this if it is carried out because our trading policies are not in a vacuum. MARTIN: So let me just say this. One of the things that's interesting about your district and one of the reasons we called you is that you're kind of in the middle. I mean, on the one hand, you do have steel makers on one side in part of the district. Just to your west, you've got a lot of farmland, for example. COSTELLO: Yes. MARTIN: I mean, just heading toward Hershey, you've got a lot of farmland, and agriculture is one of the places that trading partners tend to retaliate. So. . . COSTELLO: Absolutely. MARTIN: And adding to that is your district is kind of 50/50. I mean, it's almost - it's, like, evenly split between Republicans and Democratic voters. At least in 2016 it was. COSTELLO: That's right. MARTIN: So the question for me is, how are you going to thread that needle? I mean, at the end of the day, at some point, you're going to have to take a position. How do you think you're going to weigh your views on this? COSTELLO: Some of it's going to be based on the facts. Look; I'll say this to you. I'm not going to agree with the president if I don't agree with him. The problem here is the market uncertainty that's created as well as this came out of nowhere. And those sorts of things are not the way to lead on an issue like this. That's my bottom line at the moment. I - and I just don't see a scenario where the EU cooperates or allows this to happen without retaliatory measures that are going to have an impact on a lot of consumers in this country. That's what they're going to have to do as a retaliatory measure. I just think it also remains to be seen on what is the process that the president actually undertakes. You know, a speech and a couple tweets does not effectuate the policy. So we do have to see what the Commerce Department ultimately does here. I don't mean to hem and haw, but there's just - there are more facts that are going to have to develop here for me to get a true appreciation for what the implications are going to be. MARTIN: That's Representative Ryan Costello. He represents the 6th District of Pennsylvania. We reached him in Chester County. Congressman, thanks so much for speaking with us. COSTELLO: Thank you.

John, thanks so much for being with us. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: My pleasure, Scott. SIMON: Let's begin with cost to consumers. Metals are used in thousands of products. . . YDSTIE: Thousands. SIMON: . . . Soup cans to airplanes. YDSTIE: Candy wrappers. SIMON: Well, how much is it going to raise prices then? YDSTIE: Well, you know, we really don't know for sure. The president is saying essentially that imported steel will be taxed at 25 percent and imported aluminum will be taxed at 10 percent. That's going to raise the price of all steel and aluminum in the U. S. And that's going to boost the cost of all the products that are made from those metals. Now President Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, played down the effects on consumers on CNBC yesterday while holding up a can of Campbell's soup. So let's listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILBUR ROSS: In the can of Campbell's soup, there's about 2. 6 pennies' worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that's about six-tenths of one cent on the price of a can of Campbell's soup. SIMON: OK, not much. But that's for a can of soup. YDSTIE: Right. And Ross added that the price of an average automobile could increase a couple of hundred dollars. So for a lot of people, the cost increases could offset much of President Trump's tax cut. And Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, a big supporter of those tax cuts, criticized the president's decision. Hatch called the tariffs a tax hike the American people don't need and can't afford. SIMON: John, what are the chances that other countries will now retaliate with their own tariffs? YDSTIE: Well, it's very good. In fact, the European Commission president has singled out Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon - American-made bourbon and Levi's blue jeans as potential subjects for retaliation. The Chinese have threatened to put tariffs on U. S. soybeans. And, you know, this is the big danger, that this spirals into a tit-for-tat trade war that hurts American producers and workers and consumers and really hurts the whole global economy. SIMON: But President Trump tweeted Friday morning trade wars with other countries would be good and easy to win. YDSTIE: Yeah, but he's getting a lot of pushback from former economic advisers to both Republican and Democratic presidents. And in fact, Gary Cohen, Trump's own top White House economic adviser, reportedly opposed the tariffs. And in addition, a lot of Republican lawmakers - dozens of companies have warned that the tariffs are going to be harmful. SIMON: One of the ideas behind tariffs for those who approve of them is that it will open up more jobs in the U. S. steel and aluminum industries. Is that realistic? YDSTIE: Well, U. S. steel and aluminum companies say they will hire more workers. But one study shows that for every worker in the steel industry, there are 80 Americans working in steel-using industries like the auto industry and the aircraft industry. And they could be hurt. And studies of previous efforts to create steel jobs with tariffs like one during the George W. Bush administration found they didn't work. So I think it's likely this move will cost more jobs than it saves or creates. SIMON: Is it clear to you, John, that this will go through at all because it hasn't been signed, right? And we don't have the final details. YDSTIE: That's right. The president gave the headline numbers. But it was clear that the rest of the administration wasn't really on board yet. And the details are apparently still being worked out. There are certainly serious lobbying going on from countries and companies who want exemptions. We'll see.

There's already been considerable pushback from members of their own party, who say that this proposal, which he announced suddenly last week, could trigger a trade war that will hurt American consumers. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro defended the president's proposal this morning on \"Fox News Sunday. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\")PETER NAVARRO: First of all, the reason why the president is doing this is because if he doesn't do this, we will lose our aluminum and steel - aluminum industry very quickly and our steel industry very quickly thereafter. MARTIN: This weekend, we've been calling people with different perspectives on this issue. In a few minutes, we'll hear from someone whose company relies on American steel. But first, somebody who was at the table the last time steel tariffs were in play, Carlos Gutierrez. He was confirmed as President Bush's commerce secretary after steel tariffs were rolled back in 2002. Carlos Gutierrez was kind enough to come by our studios in Washington, D. C. Mr. Secretary, good to have you on again. CARLOS GUTIERREZ: Thank you. Always a pleasure. Thank you. MARTIN: So first of all, can I just ask your initial thoughts about President Trump's proposal? GUTIERREZ: I think it's very unfortunate. It is a - the opening salvo to what could be a trade war. We're talking about tariffs for all steel and all aluminum imports from everywhere in the world. And the justification for that is a national security mechanism that allows the president to claim that these imports are hurting national security. It's hard to do that when you realize that the Department of Defense only consumes about 3 percent of what we produce and less if you take into account imports. Our biggest exporter or our biggest source of aluminum and steel happens to be Canada, who's an ally. So it's not as if though there is an obvious national security circumstance here, and that just makes the probability of retaliation a lot greater. MARTIN: Well, let's talk about a couple of those things that you mentioned. First of all, President Trump, as candidate Trump, has been talking about this for some time now, even before he was a candidate actually. So it's a promise that he has been making, and he has seemed to imply that, you know, China is the source of this. But as you just pointed out, you know, the U. S. imports - what? - maybe 2 percent of its total imports from China. GUTIERREZ: Oh, yeah, exactly. MARTIN: So what would be the point, given that the majority of the imports come from - what? - like, Brazil, Canada, Germany? GUTIERREZ: Exactly. It really is designed to protect U. S. steel and U. S. aluminum. That's the theory. What we have learned over the years is that protectionism doesn't protect. Protectionism actually harms. And this is so much bigger than steel and aluminum because what we're doing is challenging the world trade system that we played an important part in bringing together. So that's a problem. MARTIN: Well, the president seems to agree with that. I mean, he said - he tweeted on Friday morning, for example. The president tweeted that, quote, \"trade wars are good and easy to win. \" What is your response to that? GUTIERREZ: I would say trade wars are bad. No one wins. And they're very difficult to stop. That's what history has shown us. If we go back to the - probably one of the biggest economic mistakes we made in the 20th century was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff - ironically, also done by a Republican president. And the rationale was if we raise tariffs 25 percent, we will protect our industry. We will protect our jobs. And everything will be fine. What we didn't expect is that everyone else around the world raised tariffs 25 percent, and the whole global economy went into a recession - actually a depression. So this is not good. MARTIN: You know, on the other hand, this country has lost thousands of jobs in the steel industry. President Trump has been saying for years that something needs to be done here. If this is a bad idea, what's the better idea to address that problem? GUTIERREZ: Well, if there are actors dumping steel into our market or using their excess capacity to be able to do that, then we should be surgical about how we target as opposed to a blanket tariff. And the justification that it's national security - we can use that justification for a lot of things. The world changes. The world moves on. Let's remember that, one time, we had an agriculture economy. Yes, steel is important, but steel regrettably is not as important today as it once was. And when someone promises that we're going to go back to a scenario that existed in the 1980s, I would be a little bit suspicious of that. MARTIN: That's former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. He was kind of to speak to us from our studios in Washington, D. C. Mr. Secretary, thank you. GUTIERREZ: Thank you very much, Michel. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Members of President Trump's administration have been out and about this weekend, promoting the president's proposal to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. There's already been considerable pushback from members of their own party, who say that this proposal, which he announced suddenly last week, could trigger a trade war that will hurt American consumers. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro defended the president's proposal this morning on \"Fox News Sunday. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\") PETER NAVARRO: First of all, the reason why the president is doing this is because if he doesn't do this, we will lose our aluminum and steel - aluminum industry very quickly and our steel industry very quickly thereafter. MARTIN: This weekend, we've been calling people with different perspectives on this issue. In a few minutes, we'll hear from someone whose company relies on American steel. But first, somebody who was at the table the last time steel tariffs were in play, Carlos Gutierrez. He was confirmed as President Bush's commerce secretary after steel tariffs were rolled back in 2002. Carlos Gutierrez was kind enough to come by our studios in Washington, D. C. Mr. Secretary, good to have you on again. CARLOS GUTIERREZ: Thank you. Always a pleasure. Thank you. MARTIN: So first of all, can I just ask your initial thoughts about President Trump's proposal? GUTIERREZ: I think it's very unfortunate. It is a - the opening salvo to what could be a trade war. We're talking about tariffs for all steel and all aluminum imports from everywhere in the world. And the justification for that is a national security mechanism that allows the president to claim that these imports are hurting national security. It's hard to do that when you realize that the Department of Defense only consumes about 3 percent of what we produce and less if you take into account imports. Our biggest exporter or our biggest source of aluminum and steel happens to be Canada, who's an ally. So it's not as if though there is an obvious national security circumstance here, and that just makes the probability of retaliation a lot greater. MARTIN: Well, let's talk about a couple of those things that you mentioned. First of all, President Trump, as candidate Trump, has been talking about this for some time now, even before he was a candidate actually. So it's a promise that he has been making, and he has seemed to imply that, you know, China is the source of this. But as you just pointed out, you know, the U. S. imports - what? - maybe 2 percent of its total imports from China. GUTIERREZ: Oh, yeah, exactly. MARTIN: So what would be the point, given that the majority of the imports come from - what? - like, Brazil, Canada, Germany? GUTIERREZ: Exactly. It really is designed to protect U. S. steel and U. S. aluminum. That's the theory. What we have learned over the years is that protectionism doesn't protect. Protectionism actually harms. And this is so much bigger than steel and aluminum because what we're doing is challenging the world trade system that we played an important part in bringing together. So that's a problem. MARTIN: Well, the president seems to agree with that. I mean, he said - he tweeted on Friday morning, for example. The president tweeted that, quote, \"trade wars are good and easy to win. \" What is your response to that? GUTIERREZ: I would say trade wars are bad. No one wins. And they're very difficult to stop. That's what history has shown us. If we go back to the - probably one of the biggest economic mistakes we made in the 20th century was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff - ironically, also done by a Republican president. And the rationale was if we raise tariffs 25 percent, we will protect our industry. We will protect our jobs. And everything will be fine.

Unlike employees, contractors are not entitled to certain rights and benefits, like unemployment insurance and workers compensation. Several lawsuits working their way through the courts allege that companies are misclassifying workers as independent contractors in order to skirt their employer obligations. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Raef Lawson, an aspiring Los Angeles actor, sued the food delivery service Grubhub where he was a part-time driver. The company classified him an independent contractor, but, he said, exerted significant control over when and where he delivered food during his shifts. He argued he should be considered an employee with rights to minimum wage, overtime pay and reimbursement of expenses. Last month, a U. S. district judge disagreed, ruling Lawson was an independent contractor. Attorney Richard Meneghello says Grubhub prevailed by arguing Lawson was unlike a traditional employee in many ways. RICHARD MENEGHELLO: He didn't receive performance evaluations. He didn't have to go through trainings or orientation. He didn't have to wear a specific uniform. Those are all the kinds of things that are really hallmarks of a typical employee-employer relationship. NOGUCHI: Grubhub's is the first of dozens of similar cases across the country to reach a trial verdict. Some of the others involve Uber, Lyft and Instacart. Meneghello represents companies in some of those cases and says a loss for Grubhub would have been a big deal. MENEGHELLO: Because it would open up a whole range of benefits, not only potentially increase pay for minimum wage and overtime, but also protection under civil rights laws and workers compensation and a whole raft of benefits. NOGUCHI: The judge, Jacqueline Scott Corley acknowledged the ruling was a close call, noting how a booming class of gig workers have attributes of both employees and contractors. However, the law forces her to choose between two stark designations in what she called an all-or-nothing proposition. Meneghello says each case is going to depend on particular circumstances. MENEGHELLO: It's a real roll of the dice every time a gig economy company has a case like this that is heard before a court. NOGUCHI: Employers and workers alike are embracing the greater flexibility of temporary or episodic work arrangements. But this raises concerns for David Weil, who fears workers are getting the short end of the stick. Weil is a former Labor Department administrator under President Obama who enforced fair wage laws. DAVID WEIL: Businesses can get all the benefits of closely controlling everything that happens in the delivery of a service or the creation of a product. And yet when it comes to responsibility for basic employment conditions like health and safety or like compliance with labor standards, our laws let them off the hook completely. NOGUCHI: People who work as contractors cannot sue for workplace violations under most federal laws, he says, making them vulnerable to exploitation. WEIL: The probability of violation was very high where you had subcontracting, outsourcing relationships. NOGUCHI: Even if there is no clear violation, many contractors say the legal structure gives employers the upper hand. Seth Dudzinski, for example, has worked in quality control for two San Francisco-area pharmaceutical companies as a contractor for the last five years. Dudzinski feels he should be classified an employee because he does the same work as employees, except he wears a different color ID badge. SETH DUDZINSKI: There's a shuttle that only full-time employees can use that is six blocks from my house. But I would have to pay to use it. That's a little messed up. Instead, I would just use the public transportation here. It takes, on bad days, two hours. The shuttle would have been, you know, 45 minutes. NOGUCHI: Dudzinski says he desperately wants to be hired so he can be eligible for things like stock options and employer retirement contributions. But he feels he can't push for it.

The United States still produces most of its own steel, we should be clear. But the industry has faced pressure from cheap Chinese imports. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, China's long-term increase in steel production has driven down steel prices all over the world. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Steel has long occupied a special place in the way countries see themselves. In this industry film from the '50s, steel was portrayed as a source of national pride, a symbol of a country's industrial might. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Many, many things are vital to our living and to our standard of living. Only one - but a big one - is steel. We could do without it, but not as well because it does a lot of things for us. Try naming them sometime. . . ZARROLI: When President Trump announced tariffs last week, he said manufacturing steel is essential to a nation's defense. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When it comes to a time when our country can't make aluminum and steel - and somebody's said it before, and I will tell you - you almost don't have much of a country. ZARROLI: This veneration of steel happens all over the world, says economist Linda Lim of the University of Michigan. Lim says every emerging industrial power wants to make steel. The problem is no one wants to buy it. And Lim says this is especially true in China. LINDA LIM: Way back in the '50s and '60s, it was such a fetish of theirs that they had what were called backyard furnaces. People melted down their silverware in order to produce steel for the national good. ZARROLI: Lim says China's preoccupation with steel wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that China is so very big. Over the past two decades, China has greatly increased its steel production so that it now dominates the industry, says Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution. ESWAR PRASAD: China now accounts for about half of the world's production of steel. China now produces in one year as much steel as the entire world used to produce back in 2000. ZARROLI: Prasad says China uses most of the steel it produces itself for bridges and buildings and autos. But it still has a lot left over. PRASAD: It needs to export about 10-15 percent of its steel. And given how much steel China produces these days, that tends to have a pretty big effect on world steel prices. ZARROLI: What it's done, he says, is keep prices low, and that has angered other steel-exporting countries. Washington imposes duties on Chinese steel, which is why the U. S. actually imports relatively little of the product from China today. Still, China's overproduction has hurt U. S. steelmakers. The U. S. share of the global steel market is only 5 percent today. Linda Lim says countries have held talks aimed at scaling back steel manufacturing, but it's been hard to come to an agreement. LIM: Everybody agrees global excess capacity must be cut. But nobody can agree on who's to be cut. ZARROLI: Like a lot of economists, Lim doesn't think Trump's tariffs are a good idea. They will drive up prices, which will hurt other industries that use steel. She says because steelmaking is so automated today, tariffs are unlikely to produce many jobs. And even if they do, it won't necessarily be in the Rust Belt towns where the jobs used to be. But, she says, that's not really the point of the tariffs. LIM: That's why I think it's not really about jobs, and it may not even be really about politics. It's about something deeper. ZARROLI: What it is, she says, is an effort to shore up an industry still widely seen as essential to a country's identity and demonstrate that the U. S. remains an industrial power.

And there were other signs of improvement in today's report, as NPR's Chris Arnold tells us. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The U. S. economy is chugging along and in good shape with employers confident enough to do plenty of hiring. And they brought on so many people last month that it caught experts by surprise. JUSTIN WOLFERS: Wow. It's a very, very, very healthy report. ARNOLD: Justin Wolfers is a labor economist at the University of Michigan. He says another good sign here is that workers who've been on the sidelines - not even looking for a job, some of them discouraged - a lot of them are back either finding jobs or at least looking. And this is a very dramatic number. That helped to bring 806,000 people into the workforce last month. That's one of the biggest increases in nearly 35 years. WOLFERS: And that's great because the recession after the financial crisis booted millions out. The big question for economists has been, how many of those people are going to return? ARNOLD: Wolfers says today's report shows that a lot of them are returning. Richard Burkhauser, a White House economic adviser, agrees. RICHARD BURKHAUSER: Those people who have been on the sidelines are moving back into the labor force. And this month certainly demonstrates that they're out there and ready to work. ARNOLD: Still, the reality is there's a long way to go. John Silvia is the chief economist at Wells Fargo. He says this past month is a step in the right direction, but. . . JOHN SILVIA: We need about a dozen more steps. ARNOLD: Silvia says labor force participation is still low by historical standards. And he says in prior recoveries, we've been able to get more of these people back to work faster. SILVIA: One of the great comments that you always heard about the economic expansion under Bill Clinton is they kept on bringing more and more people into the labor force from the sidelines. And we really need to get those numbers up. ARNOLD: Economists say still having so many workers in the wings is a big part of what's been keeping wage growth overall pretty sluggish for millions of American workers. After an uptick a month ago, wages in this report returned to a more modest growth rate. Too much wage growth can create problems and spark inflation. But speaking on CNBC today, Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed Reserve Bank, said that the economy could handle bigger wage increases than we're seeing.

With the unemployment rate at 4. 1 percent it's lower than what most of us think is a sustainable long-run unemployment rate, but it doesn't seem to be leading to wage pressures yet. ARNOLD: Another positive from today's report - job growth was broad-based across many sectors, including construction. John Silvia says that companies are building a lot of office parks and warehouses. That's leading to strong hiring and, at least in that industry, wage growth that's solidly above the national average. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

When he was young, he had to walk to and from school - uphill both ways, of course - in the snow. But, he could also buy a Coke for about a nickel. Now a Coke is going to cost you around $1. 75. That change in the price of a Coke is in part because of inflation. From 1997 to 2017, the overall rate of inflation was 55. 6 percent. Put another way, if all the stuff you were buying in 1997 costs around a hundred bucks back then now it's going to cost a hundred and fifty-five dollars. Let's bring in Cardiff Garcia of NPR's new podcast, The Indicator, from Planet Money. Hey, Cardiff. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Fifty-five point six percent inflation. What does that mean? Is that a good thing or a bad thing for the economy? GARCIA: That's actually quite normal because that just means a little bit more than 2 percent inflation. And, of course, it's fluctuated. Sometimes it's more than that. Sometimes it's less than that, like it is right now. The more interesting story is in the details because the inflation rate is just an average in the change of prices of things that a typical American buys, but some of those things get more expensive and some of them get a lot cheaper. MARTIN: What stuff has gotten cheaper? GARCIA: Mostly tangible stuff. The stuff you can touch, like goods. So if you look at TVs, toys, computer software, things that have to do with the information technology revolution, these things all cost way less than half of what they did 20 years ago. Furniture, clothes, these are also becoming more affordable because they've stayed about the same price during a period in which incomes have continued to go up and the overall inflation rate has gone up. But when you look at services, that is a totally different story. So services, of course, the things that require human-to-human interaction, right? Medical care services. So the treatment you get at hospitals, nursing homes, dentists. And the cost of health insurance, that's gone up. Child care has gone up. And then there's the big one, which is college tuition. The sticker price of college tuition has more than tripled in that time. MARTIN: So why? Why are goods cheaper and services more expensive? GARCIA: It's a pretty simple story. Goods are easier to trade across borders, and that means that we have the option of buying the cheapest good from the country where those goods are made more cheaply. Services are a little bit harder to do. If you need a babysitter, it's hard to contract one from another country to watch your kids this Friday. And the other reason is technological innovation. It's just easier to automate the making of tangible things, of goods, than it is services. MARTIN: So bottom line, goods cheaper, services more expensive. What does that mean for us? What does that mean for how we live our lives? GARCIA: If you look at some of the things that have gotten much more expensive, those are the things that low-income and middle-income people in particular need in order to elevate themselves in the labor market. So expensive college tuition is the kind of obvious example because we know that people who graduate from college make more money throughout their careers. But the same thing applies for child care services, which allows parents, young parents, to keep working while also raising kids. And so we have these amazing new gadgets, and they're becoming more and more affordable. Health care, child care, education - these are all the things associated with families, with starting a family and providing for a family, and that has become increasingly daunting.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I need a job, and I don't have a skillset other than flying. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: One day, you might be cleaning the toilet. The next day, you might be doing some potentially Nobel Prize-winning science. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: In 1979, I started my trucking career. And I wanted to have the American dream. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Today, we're going to hear about how sometimes the expectations for a new job don't always live up to the reality. LIZ STEPANSKY: So I first thought about being a teacher in high school. MARTIN: That's Liz Stepansky. She says that, growing up in a family full of teachers, she always thought of the profession as a means to a stable, yet meaningful life. STEPANSKY: My dad actually was my teacher in high school. Both of my parents were teachers, and that's how they had originally met. MARTIN: Stepansky says she loved seeing the warm, lasting relationships her father built with his students, many of whom were her own classmates. STEPANSKY: They would come up to me when I was in the hall and say, Liz, I love your dad. I love his class so much. You know, my dad would have students that would come back and visit him even years after they graduated high school. MARTIN: So when it came time for Stepansky to choose her own career, she decided to follow in her parents' footsteps. And after college, she landed her first job as a middle school teacher. STEPANSKY: I couldn't wait. In my mind, I had ordered all the books and planned out my classroom and how I was going to have things organized. And I was ready. I was ready to begin my teaching career. But I had no idea what I was in for. A student dialed 911 in my classroom. Students started bringing in water balloons. Then the students decided that water wasn't exciting enough, and so they started filling balloons with more interesting substances like bleach and ink and started throwing those. One day, we walked through a hallway, and there were all these raw eggs on the lockers. Another teacher had a dead mouse put on her chair. I had a student put a dead frog in my coffee. And probably sometime from February to May, we almost constantly every day had a fire alarm pulled. And four of those occasions were actual fires started by students. At that point, I was just thinking this is way different than I thought it was going to be. This is so much harder. And you really do work a lot of hours. It's not an 8 to 3:30 job and then you just skate home. You're there calling parents. You they're doing lesson preps. And I go home, and sometimes I'd spend an hour grading papers. And then I go back and do it all over again the next day. And after taxes, I remember my paycheck being 800 and something every two weeks. And I started thinking, well, maybe, maybe I don't just need a different teaching job. Maybe I need a different career. So we're going up to the second floor, which is a stroke recovery unit. So I've been working at National Rehabilitation Hospital in D. C. as a speech language pathologist now for just over a year. And what I would start off making as a first year speech language pathologists was well over what I would be making as a teacher. So I'm taking the patient in his wheelchair for a patient therapy. I forget when - I think I got a friend request from someone that I was best friends in fifth grade. And I noticed that she was a speech pathologist. And I knew about speech pathology because growing up as a child, I went to a speech pathologist at our school. I couldn't pronounce my R's or my S's. And I loved speech pathology as a kid. We would play fun games. We'd play card games. We would do these funny, silly songs that would warm up our lips and our tongue. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Singing) I'm going to let it shine. STEPANSKY: (Singing) I'm going to let it shine. And I started thinking, maybe that would be an option to consider. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Singing) I'm going to let it shine. STEPANSKY: And actually, as we're singing this, I want you to look at my lips. I've made a change in the people that I see, but at kind of at the heart of it, I'm doing the same thing. I'm showing someone how to do something and eventually do it without me. How about this? It's still in the wrapper. That's why it's making that noise. You realize that being able to communicate is this key essential part to your quality of life. Yeah. You use it every single day. You know what it is. You're just having a hard time accessing that word. And we don't give a second thought to the fact that I can go to a restaurant and order exactly what I want. You know, I can call up someone I love and tell them that I love them. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: You brush your teeth with. . . STEPANSKY: You brush your teeth with a - you brush your teeth with a. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: . . . A toothbrush. STEPANSKY: . . . A toothbrush. When I see a patient who's had a stroke that's affected a language area, they're so much more appreciative because they know the difference. You want to start with \"Amazing Grace\"? OK. (Singing) Amazing grace. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Singing) Amazing grace. . . STEPANSKY: I think as I was teaching, I kind of was looking at my friends who had a established career and knew what they wanted to do, thinking, gosh, I wish that were true for me. And through all of this, I'm almost more thankful because I'm more grateful. I know what it is like to have a job that I hate every day. And so to be in a job where I love what I'm doing is kind of a gift, actually. And it makes going through this whole process and this whole transition more than worth it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Singing) But now. . . STEPANSKY: (Singing) But now I see. Let me hear you say see. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: See. STEPANSKY: Good. MARTIN: Liz Stepansky is a former school teacher.

S. say the Trump administration's tariffs will let them create jobs. But on the West Coast, many ports rely on steel from Pacific Rim countries that are subject to the tariffs. Oregon Public Broadcasting's Molly Solomon takes us to a northwest Republican stronghold that's bracing for an economic hit. MOLLY SOLOMON, BYLINE: It's a normal day at the Port of Vancouver. That means by noon, piles of steel slab fill the work yard at the docks on the Columbia River. Abbi Russell is the communications manager for the Port of Vancouver in Washington state. It's the second-largest importer of steel products on the West Coast. ABBI RUSSELL: Steel is tied to about a third of our revenue. So, of course, we're definitely watching it very closely. SOLOMON: What she and other local manufacturers are watching is a 25 percent tariff President Donald Trump recently placed on imported steel. It's drawn criticism from factories, economists and even Republican Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler. She represents southwest Washington, a region where many counties flipped for Trump and voted Republican in 2016, some for the first time in nearly a century. In a letter to the president, Herrera Beutler urged the administration to reconsider the tariffs. She says they will drive up costs for companies in nearby towns that make products from imported steel. One of them is Steelscape, a steel coating plant with facilities in southern California and Kalama, Wash. SCOTT COOLEY: So these coils that are in these metal wrapping are from Australia. SOLOMON: Scott Cooley walks through the assembly line at Steelscape's Washington plant where he's a vice president. Steelscape is one of three large facilities on the West Coast that are co-owned by a parent company in Asia. COOLEY: None of us make our own steel. So we're totally reliant on raw materials coming in. SOLOMON: Steelscape turns those raw materials into components of buildings and large appliances. Cooley says the tariffs could hit his company hard and may force Steelscape to look across the Rockies for domestic steel in the Midwest. But the company says transporting steel by rail costs $65 more per ton than steel arriving by ship from Asian countries. COOLEY: It's why none of the mills back east really supplied any of the mills out west. SOLOMON: Cooley says the impacts of the tariffs will be felt far beyond his own company. COOLEY: You're talking about all the customer base that's on the West Coast that's reliant on steel produced in market. You know, if all that has to start coming from the East, I mean, it is going to cause prices to go up. SOLOMON: At the Port of Vancouver, longshoremen are unloading a ship from Korea that's filled with giant rectangular slabs of steel. Forklift driver Rick Anderson says for the past three weeks, all he's hauled is steel. And while he understands the benefits to the steel industry in Rust Belt states, he worries it will translate into layoffs for workers in the west. RICK ANDERSON: We're all about putting Americans to work. We'd love to export more than we import. The problem is it's just not going to work here in the northwest where we don't have a supply of steel. SOLOMON: Anderson says that a lot of his colleagues have been on edge since the president announced the tariffs. One, he says, even decided to put off buying a home.

The legislation had broad bipartisan support, but it doesn't go nearly as far as Republicans in the House had wanted. From member station WSHU, Charles Lane reports. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: The bill's author, Senator Mike Crapo, says the financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank went too far when it was passed in 2010. He says it made loans more expensive and drove small banks out of business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE CRAPO: This bill, Mr. President, is a bill designed to protect community banks and credit unions. And that's why we have such bipartisan support for it. LANE: The bill raises the threshold for what's considered a systemically important bank, which causes regulators to look at a bank's balance sheet and test how well it could weather another financial crisis. Originally, Dodd-Frank set that line at $50 billion in assets. But the new bill raises it to $250 billion. At the higher threshold, the number of banks required to go through rigorous annual stress tests would drop to just 12. This invoked the ire of more liberal Democrats, but ultimately, 17 moderate Democrats joined Republicans. Now, the bill has to be reconciled with one that passed the House last year. That bill went much further toward scrapping Dodd-Frank. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment bank Compass Point, expects the House to go along with the Senate version. ISAAC BOLTANSKY: This bill enshrines permanently the Dodd-Frank Act. Look, with this bill becoming law, we are sure that the skeleton of the Dodd-Frank Act is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. LANE: And that's enough of a win for one of Dodd-Frank's authors, former Congressman Barney Frank. BARNEY FRANK: That's why the House Republican conservatives hate the bill, I mean, even more than some of the liberals. I think we wrote such a good bill that it has been impossible to demonize. LANE: Frank points to a key provision in the latest Senate bill, which gives regulators the flexibility to conduct stress tests on banks if they see trouble. For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane. (SOUNDBITE OF SENA & DJ VADIM'S \"MORNING LIGHT\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The Senate has approved a bill that eases regulations on banks. The legislation had broad bipartisan support, but it doesn't go nearly as far as Republicans in the House had wanted. From member station WSHU, Charles Lane reports. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: The bill's author, Senator Mike Crapo, says the financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank went too far when it was passed in 2010. He says it made loans more expensive and drove small banks out of business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MIKE CRAPO: This bill, Mr. President, is a bill designed to protect community banks and credit unions. And that's why we have such bipartisan support for it. LANE: The bill raises the threshold for what's considered a systemically important bank, which causes regulators to look at a bank's balance sheet and test how well it could weather another financial crisis. Originally, Dodd-Frank set that line at $50 billion in assets. But the new bill raises it to $250 billion. At the higher threshold, the number of banks required to go through rigorous annual stress tests would drop to just 12. This invoked the ire of more liberal Democrats, but ultimately, 17 moderate Democrats joined Republicans. Now, the bill has to be reconciled with one that passed the House last year. That bill went much further toward scrapping Dodd-Frank. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment bank Compass Point, expects the House to go along with the Senate version. ISAAC BOLTANSKY: This bill enshrines permanently the Dodd-Frank Act. Look, with this bill becoming law, we are sure that the skeleton of the Dodd-Frank Act is the law of the land for the foreseeable future. LANE: And that's enough of a win for one of Dodd-Frank's authors, former Congressman Barney Frank.

Larry Kudlow will be the new head of the National Economic Council. This is a critical role in developing American economic policy. The person in that job is supposed to be an honest broker and tee up many points of view for the president to consider. And let's turn now to Adam Davidson, who's a staff writer for The New Yorker who covers economics, also a well-known voice on NPR's air. Adam Davidson, nice to talk to you again. ADAM DAVIDSON: Yeah. Hey, David. Great to hear from you. GREENE: Yeah. Well, let's talk a little bit about Kudlow. I mean, I know he served in the Reagan administration. He's sort of known as a supply-sider when it comes to economics. So, I mean, I guess one big question - do he and Donald Trump see eye-to-eye on the economy? DAVIDSON: Oh, absolutely not. I think they have fundamentally different views of how the economy works. GREENE: OK. DAVIDSON: Kudlow is an interesting character. I mean, he really developed a very firm set of ideas very early and has not changed them at all even when the facts on the ground - you know, recessions, deep financial crises, a general lack of wage growth for the middle class - have proved him wrong, at least in the eyes of many others. He has stuck to a very narrow set of prescriptions for the economy. No matter what's going on - cut taxes, lower regulation. Now, Donald Trump, of course, likes that. GREENE: He likes those two things, yeah. DAVIDSON: Yeah, those two things he likes. But Kudlow is very much, in Donald Trump's horrible phrase, a globalist. He believes that the best approach to the U. S. is to be extremely open to the world to trade as freely as possible, that global trade is a - is not a zero-sum game where one side wins and the other side loses. GREENE: So no fan of tariffs, as we've been hearing - I mean, the president has proposed some that he has already spoken out against. So what is that relationship going to be like if that's going to be - tariffs are going to be in the news in coming weeks and months? DAVIDSON: This is going to be very interesting to watch because Kudlow, just two weeks ago, wrote a column in The National Review gently - very respectfully and gently telling Donald Trump, you are wrong about tariffs. Tariffs are disastrous. They're what we do to North Korea and call them sanctions. And his job is going to be to implement Trump's tariffs. It's going to be a grim, grim job. He's going to be spending much of his time on the phone with - and in person meeting with trade ministers from other countries and arguing and representing this pro-tariff Trump view. And Kudlow, you know, this is a big personality. This is a famous guy. I don't see him enjoying the role of suppressing his lifelong beliefs in favor of Trump. I expect this one to be pretty interesting to watch. GREENE: Well, he has been slammed by critics, A, for not having any Ph. D. in economics. He's not an economist. And a lot of his critics have said that he's made these bold economic predictions in the past that just don't pan out. So given that record, what is President Trump looking for if he's bringing him in? DAVIDSON: Yeah. A lot of people consider Kudlow the wrongest (ph) man in the field of economics, and it's a field he might not even be in. Just a delightful, amazing list of every time he's been wrong. The problem is how he's wrong. Every economic forecaster is wrong a lot. You know, it's the kind of thing where if you're right 10 or 20 percent of the time, you could consider yourself doing pretty well. It's that Kudlow has the exact same view no matter what. He sees cutting taxes as the solution and the only solution. And if there's economic growth, it's because someone at some point cut taxes. If there is economic malaise, it's because someone didn't cut taxes. GREENE: All right, Adam, we'll sadly have to stop there. Adam Davidson from The New Yorker. Thanks a lot, Adam.

S. could soon be the largest oil producer in the world. It's already pumping out more than 10 million barrels of crude a day. That breaks a previous record set back in 1970. Despite this, climate change activists who oppose more fossil fuel production insist that they are making progress. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Here's the idea underpinning the Keep It In The Ground movement. Activists figure that if they can stop pipelines from being built, it's more likely that crude will stay in the ground where it won't contribute to climate change. A key tactic is protests, like this one in Louisiana last month. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Shouting in French). UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Shouting in French). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Shouting in French). UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Shouting in French). BRADY: They're shouting, water is life, in French. The pipeline is called the Bayou Bridge, and environmental groups sued to stop it. But if it goes ahead, protest organizer Cherri Foytlin says she's prepared to physically block construction. CHERRI FOYTLIN: We're poor people. We don't have a lot of money like they do. So all we have is, all I have, is this old body. Right? So I'll use this old body now to do what I have to do to stop it. BRADY: Protesters say President Trump's pro-fossil fuel agenda makes their job harder, but he also motivates the base. A day after Trump failed to mention climate change in his State of the Union speech, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders fired up a crowd of activists at George Washington University. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: What we are about is telling Donald Trump and the Koch brothers that their days are numbered. Fossil fuels' days are numbered. We are going to transform our energy system. (APPLAUSE)BRADY: Activists also are petitioning cities to become fossil free, and they're encouraging institutions, especially colleges, to withdraw investments in oil companies. But people in the fossil fuel business don't sound impressed. STEVE EVERLEY: Keep It In The Ground as a movement has been a failure. BRADY: Steve Everley is with Texans for Natural Gas and says the current boom is proof of failure. Domestic drillers have doubled oil production in the past decade, and natural gas is up by about 1/3. The country is on track to produce even more oil than Russia and Saudi Arabia. EVERLEY: We're not going to undermine the most significant shift in global energy power in a generation to pursue a job-destroying, fringe political campaign like Keep It In The Ground. BRADY: Still, the industry has responded to the movement with ads like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: America's pipelines bring American energy to American families. BRADY: Seth Whitehead leads the industry-backed Energy In Depth campaign, and says stopping domestic oil and gas production makes no sense because demand continues to rise. SETH WHITEHEAD: It's better for us to produce it here in the United States rather than imported from countries with much more lax regulations, environment regulations, in countries that are hostile towards the United States. BRADY: The activists can point to one key victory as proof their strategy works, Canada's oil sands. Just a few years back, there were big plans to expand production. Opponents point out oil sand's crude emits more pollution because it requires more energy to produce than traditional drilling. They have successfully delayed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, says Steven Kretzmann, with Oil Change International. STEPHEN KRETZMANN: And now because investors, because companies recognize that there is virtually no way to get a new pipeline that would get that oil to market, we're seeing people be less interested in growth in the dirtiest source of oil on the planet. BRADY: That invigorates Keep It In The Ground activists. They're promising more campaigns, more protests, even as analysts predict the U. S. is on track to break even more oil production records.

As Baby Boomers age, home health aide worker has become the third-fastest growing occupation in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the need is only expected to grow. Now some families take care of their elderly and ailing relatives themselves, and they can receive compensation from federal Medicaid and state funds. CELINA RADDATZ: I was very excited (laughter). I was happy to hear that the government has such a program because we're in so much need. MARTIN: That is Celina Raddatz of San Diego, Calif. After her mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2006, Raddatz took over her care. She came to the task with more experience than most, more than 30 years working in nursing homes. As Raddatz tells it, she was raised in a culture that expects children to take care of their elders in old age. RADDATZ: I was born in Mexico, down the coast of Ensenada. And my mom, she was a widow. When I was 2-years-old with nine children, she would sell tamales, menudo, pozole. She married this nice American gentleman that was in the Army and immigrated us all into the United States. And they had two more kids. When I was a kid, I had different dreams. I was an athlete. I wanted to be a PE teacher. Also, I wanted to join the Army. But I did neither. I took care of my grandmother when I was 16. After school, I would stay and help my grandma with her meals and help bathe her and take care of her. And that's how I got into caring for the elderly and the handicapped. When I graduated from high school, I worked for a nursing home. I was a certified nurse assistant for 25 years, and then I became an activity director. I did enjoy the job because the residents love to hear about your past and your stories. And I love to hear about their stories. When my mother was sane, she made us promise never to put her in a nursing home. And of course, us young kids said, OK, Mom, we will never - it's in our culture as well. We don't put our families in nursing homes. We take care of them ourselves. But we never, ever once ever thought that she would get sick like this. The Alzheimer's and dementia was diagnosed back in 2006 by her doctor. My mother, she used to work for the court house as a housekeeper, and she fell, and she bumped her head pretty bad. I don't know if that's what caused it, but she kept telling the story that she fell at work, and her head fell on her lap, and she picked it up and put it back on her shoulders. We kept telling her, Mom, that's impossible. And she would get upset. And that's when we noticed that she was not right. This is my mother. Her name is Guadalupe Pena Villegas. Mama. See how easy she gets agitated? She's walking away (laughter) angry. She gets agitated really easy. I left my job in 2014 to take care of my mom. All my brothers and sisters pointed fingers at me - we think you're the best candidate for this job. And I said, you know, it's a lot easier doing it at work because you get a break. And when you go home and you work, taking care of your own parent, you don't get a break. It's 24/7, nonstop. It's just constant, constant work. This is our room where my mom and I sleep. I have to sleep with her because she wakes up at night all the time or I have to help her to the bathroom or she wants to go to the living room and just sit and - so I have to redirect her to come back into the room. A social worker friend of mine told me about it - there's programs that can pay you for taking care of your mom. I said really? And once I was cleared, then the social worker came out and evaluated my mother, and she qualified for in-home care services. OK this is our living room here - our family room where we spend a lot of time. My sister has, Rosa (ph), is being generous of letting my mom and I stay here because when I first started taking care of my mom, I lost my job, my apartment. Being a caregiver at home - it's more than a job because I feel it's a family responsibility because of the promises we made her when she was younger. I am determined to take care of my mom to her last day because it is more important than money. And after that, yes, definitely, I will go back to being an activity director or a caregiver. There's been some patients at work that were so sweet, and they had dementia Alzheimer's. No families would come around, and we would say, jeez, this lady's so sweet. They have families. Why don't they visit? Wow. They're not, like, your mom and dad anymore. They're, like, somebody else. And I can relate more to these families, and my heart goes out to them even more so now than before.

A White House adviser says the president's goal is to shrink the U. S. trade deficit with China by at least $50 billion a year. The move marks a significant escalation of Trump's America First trade policy, and it prompted a nervous reaction on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 700 points. In a moment, we'll hear about how U. S. companies doing business in China feel about the president's action. But first we're joined by NPR's White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So why did the president take this action today? HORSLEY: Well, U. S. businesses have complained for a long time about the way China treats their intellectual property. They say they're often forced to share their technology know-how as a price of doing business in China and that sometimes their tech secrets are stolen outright. Now, the White House says that the U. S. administrations have been trying to talk with China about that for years, going back to the George W. Bush administration, but that talk was not producing the desired change in Chinese behavior. So President Trump said this afternoon it's time to get tough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, which likewise is hundreds of billions of dollars. HORSLEY: Administration economists spent months studying this and came up with what they say is a conservative estimate that China's unfair practices of technology cost the U. S. economy some $50 billion a year. And so that's what they're trying to counteract with these tariffs. The president has directed his top trade negotiator to come up with a list of Chinese products to target over the next 15 days. And he's also directed the Treasury secretary to look at new limits on China's investment in the United States. CHANG: We saw a really sharp sell-off on Wall Street today. I mean, it seems like investors are pretty worried about this move. Why is that? HORSLEY: Yeah. It was a sharp sell-off. All the major market indices were down more than 2 percent. The Dow is off nearly 3 percent. You know, even though a lot of business people agree with the president that China needs to change its conduct, they're worried about this tariff tactic that the president is using. They say it's going to bring higher prices here in the U. S. and possible retaliation by China against U. S. exports. That's why you saw dozens of trade groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, farm groups, writing the president last weekend, urging him not to impose tariffs. And you've heard similar concerns from members of Congress, including the president's fellow Republicans. Here's Senator Orrin Hatch, who was speaking this week at a forum sponsored by the Business Roundtable as well as a farm group. He says the tariffs might backfire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ORRIN HATCH: Chinese companies don't pay U. S. tariffs. Rather American companies and American consumers get the bill. This is a tax hike, pure and simple. HORSLEY: China was also quick to criticize the president's move. A statement from the Chinese embassy here in Washington said China does not want a trade war with anyone, but it will not recoil from one. It added, if a trade war is initiated, China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests. CHANG: Are there concerns beyond the economy? HORSLEY: There are certainly strategic concerns. This is another case where the president is sort of acting on his own and runs the risk of alienating U. S. allies, even those who share his concerns about China's conduct. And also when it comes to North Korea, you know, Trump has been counting on support from Chinese President Xi Jinping, and he's been getting good cooperation. That's one reason he hasn't taken tough trade action until now. He now runs the risk of losing that cooperation as a result of this move. CHANG: You know, this move is just the latest provocative trade move by the Trump administration. Just a couple weeks ago, the president ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. What's happening with those? HORSLEY: Yeah, those tariffs are due to take effect tomorrow, but they've been watered down a good deal. Canada and Mexico were already exempted. And today we learned that the administration is exempting the European Union, South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil. So it's going to be interesting to see if something similar happens with the China tariffs over the next 15 days. CHANG: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome.

President Trump announced $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports. Shortly thereafter, China responded with $3 billion in tariffs on U. S. products. Will the back-and-forth break out into a trade war? David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent for The Washington Post, joins us now. Mr. Lynch, thanks so much for being with us. DAVID J. LYNCH: Sure. SIMON: President Trump, of course, announced these tariffs after the U. S. trade representative conducted an investigation of China's practices against U. S. companies operating in China. The complaints have been around for years. But what are the Chinese practices that President Trump in particular doesn't like? LYNCH: Sure. Well, the tariffs are aimed in particular at a practice referred to as force technology transfer. The Chinese government for years has treated foreign companies, U. S. companies in particular, with what the U. S. regards as discriminatory practices. If an American company wants to enter the Chinese market, they need to do so with a Chinese partner. The Chinese partner controls the joint venture - 51 percent. And they're required - the U. S. company is - to turn over their trade secrets, their advanced technology as a condition of market entry, as a cover charge, if you will, for getting in. And that puts the U. S. in the long run at a disadvantage. SIMON: Yeah. But at the same time, why do so many people seem to believe that tariffs are not a good way to address that problem? LYNCH: Well, because at the end of the day, tariff is just a fancy word for a tax, and it's a tax that's paid by Americans. The people who pay the tariff are the ones who are bringing the Chinese products into the United States. And those are American companies and, ultimately, American consumers. SIMON: Why do you think the Chinese government responds to $60 billion in tariffs with just $3 billion in tariffs? LYNCH: I think the Chinese are playing a very savvy game thus far or trying to. And the objective is to be firm enough to look as if they're responding and not taking any guff from an outside power. . . SIMON: Three billion dollars is $3 billion. LYNCH: Three billion dollars is $3 billion. And to the la bai sheng (ph), the average guy in the streets of Beijing, he'll hear that the Chinese government has stood tall. But the Chinese also want to look like the adults in the global room. They want to look like the guardians of the global trade regime, the rules-based international order that the U. S. built in the post-war era. And they want to try and avoid this getting out of hand. As the Chinese ambassador to the U. S. said yesterday, we don't want a trade war. But if you push us into a trade war, we'll fight it. SIMON: Do you foresee this escalating, or will both sides take an opportunity to say, what were we thinking? LYNCH: You know, I've been wrong with most of my predictions about Donald Trump for two and a half years. But I think you saw language in his statement Thursday that indicates the aim of this, despite all the disparagement by the administration of negotiations and statements that the way that presidents of both parties have tried to bring China into the international system through endless dialogue. Despite the disparagement of that, you know, Wilbur Ross said yesterday, I think we're going to be negotiating over these, not fighting over them. SIMON: Mr. Ross, the secretary of commerce? LYNCH: Yes. And the president said more than once, we're engaged in a big negotiation. And so I think there are - certainly, some people are hoping, fingers crossed, that that's what this is ultimately all about. SIMON: So the tariffs are a way of essentially negotiating debt? LYNCH: Possibly. I mean, there's precedent for that with the tariffs that the president put on just two weeks ago on steel and aluminum imports, which he's already walked back. SIMON: David J.

They have to exchange them for something, and she says what they do is use them to buy U. S. assets, such as government bonds and stock.

Drake says economists have been making promises about trade for years. They've said foreign markets would open up and U. S. companies would begin exporting more.

U. S. markets are closed for Good Friday. Stock prices were up today after two days of losses, and the month as a whole was pretty bruising. For the first time in years, technology companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon are leading the way down. NPR's Jim Zarroli explains why. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Ever since the Great Recession, the U. S. economy has been growing at a pace that can usually be described as tepid. Sameer Samana of Wells Fargo Investment Institute says the one big area of promise has been technology companies. SAMEER SAMANA: If you think about social media, if you think about e-commerce, basically technology is the backbone of all of those different things. And for those corporations it's driven incredible profit growth. ZARROLI: And this has made tech stocks such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google soar. Over the year ending on March 5, for example, Apple was up 29 percent. Juli Niemann, an analyst at Smith Moore and Company, says even when other stocks have underperformed, the love affair between Wall Street and tech stocks never waned. JULI NIEMANN: Oh, tech stocks have been the dominant area. This is one thing that consumers - investors have jumped all over simply because they can understand them. They love these stocks. ZARROLI: They love them, that is, until about two months ago. Niemann says there's no single reason for what's happened. Each company has had its distinct set of problems. Apple faces questions about its growth. How long will people keep buying bigger and better iPhones? Amazon is being attacked in tweets by President Trump. Tesla is facing production issues. And then there's Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: This morning, Facebook under fire, the pressure intensifying in the wake of that Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal affecting up to 50 million users. ZARROLI: The uproar over Facebook's breach of user data is generating calls for strict government regulation of the social media giant. Since the beginning of February, Facebook's shares are down by 20 percent. Taken together, these problems have raised questions about the tech sector as a whole. Again, Juli Niemann. NIEMANN: The market has a psychology right now of when in doubt, get out. We'll figure it out later what happened. And when you have a market that's that shaky, especially when the valuations are really high at this point, it's not happy Harry's house of bargains out there. ZARROLI: The tech fallout isn't the only problem plaguing the stock market right now. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, which is sparking fears about a trade war. And the Fed and other central banks are raising interest rates, something stock investors never like. But the tech crowd is especially problematic because tech stocks make up a huge portion of the shares traded every day. About 25 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are in tech. They make up a big proportion of the stock in most mutual funds and retirement accounts. Sameer Samana thinks the downturn is temporary. After all, he says, tech is still a relatively new industry. SAMANA: We're still trying to figure out, you know, how things like social media fit into our lives and how data should be managed and all those different things. So I think this is just part of the growing pains of how do we regulate these companies? ZARROLI: But for now, a lot of investors are reassessing whether tech stocks are the great bet they once thought they were. And until that changes, it's going to hurt the market as a whole.

And then there's Facebook. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: This morning, Facebook under fire, the pressure intensifying in the wake of that Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal affecting up to 50 million users. ZARROLI: The uproar over Facebook's breach of user data is generating calls for strict government regulation of the social media giant. Since the beginning of February, Facebook's shares are down by 20 percent. Taken together, these problems have raised questions about the tech sector as a whole. Again, Juli Niemann. NIEMANN: The market has a psychology right now of when in doubt, get out. We'll figure it out later what happened. And when you have a market that's that shaky, especially when the valuations are really high at this point, it's not happy Harry's house of bargains out there. ZARROLI: The tech fallout isn't the only problem plaguing the stock market right now. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, which is sparking fears about a trade war. And the Fed and other central banks are raising interest rates, something stock investors never like. But the tech crowd is especially problematic because tech stocks make up a huge portion of the shares traded every day. About 25 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are in tech. They make up a big proportion of the stock in most mutual funds and retirement accounts. Sameer Samana thinks the downturn is temporary. After all, he says, tech is still a relatively new industry. SAMANA: We're still trying to figure out, you know, how things like social media fit into our lives and how data should be managed and all those different things. So I think this is just part of the growing pains of how do we regulate these companies? ZARROLI: But for now, a lot of investors are reassessing whether tech stocks are the great bet they once thought they were. And until that changes, it's going to hurt the market as a whole.

The next day, you might be doing some potentially Nobel Prize-winning science. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: In 1979, I started my trucking career, and I wanted to have the American dream. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MCCAMMON: One of the big economic stories of the past decade has been the rapid growth of private contract work across the United States. According to a recent NPR-Marist poll, 1 in 5 jobs in the U. S. is currently held by a contract worker. Now, the gig economy has been criticized for failing to provide workers the benefits and stability of full-time employment, but it has also allowed many people to supplement their income on a flexible schedule. Ajmal Faqiri has experienced both. AJMAL FAQIRI: I don't like working as an Uber driver but I have to. MCCAMMON: Since Faqiri, his wife and their two children emigrated from Afghanistan in 2013, he's worked numerous jobs as he's tried to get a foothold in the U. S. labor market. This isn't the first time that Faqiri has had to navigate a drastically new economic landscape. Growing up in Kabul, he dreamed of becoming a doctor. The war against the Taliban derailed those plans, but it also brought new opportunities. And the whole reason Faqiri has been able to resettle in the U. S. is because of the job he chose in Afghanistan - as an interpreter for the U. S. military. FAQIRI: I could help save American lives, train Afghan National Army, be the cultural adviser for them and be - talk their language. I started as a translator at the beginning of 2006 all the way to the end of 2013, so almost eight years. But the first four years, I was in the frontline fighting against terrorism, Taliban. And it was very tough job because it was scary. Definitely, you could see bullets crossing your head. And you could see it, but still, you had to go there. The remaining of the time as a translator, I was in the training centers as a trainer translator between United States troop and Afghanistan troop. When I started working as a translator, there was not even the rumor that they would bring us to the United States. And then things changed. I got some phone calls. A couple of times, people called me and said, you are infidel. You're not Muslim anymore. We will kill you. You're working with the Americans and so on and so on. But that didn't stop me from what I was doing. It's all about - insurgent - we'll kill any American, any the people who work for them, especially, especially, especially the translators. Once the United States decided to withdraw some of their troops, a lot of people lost their job. I didn't lose my job, but a lot of people did. That was the first thing that was like, OK, once I lose my job, then my duress will be much more higher. MCCAMMON: The U. S. government enacted the Special Immigrant Visa or SIV program in response to threats on the lives of Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters assisting the U. S. military. But by 2009, the number of visas available through the program was capped at 50 per year. FAQIRI: I applied for a visa in 2010, and then it took almost three years. And they gave my visa on December 29, 2013. We left Afghanistan the next day, and we came straight to United States. I was happy. And I was sad. I was happy that I was going to go to safety. It was sad because I had to get away from my family, from my loved one, from the people that raised me. They educated. They always supported me. Unfortunately, I had to say bye to them. When I was in Afghanistan, we were told that we will give you a job. We will give you almost everything. But unfortunately, most of those things, they didn't come through. Seems like I had to do everything by my own. First job I found was in a car wash. And then I had to get the job to start my life in the United States. MCCAMMON: Since then, Faqiri says he has worked more than 10 different jobs, always on the lookout for better opportunities. FAQIRI: I worked in construction, mobile furniture store, package delivery man, car sales associate, a realtor, real estate agent. MCCAMMON: Faqiri still works as a real estate agent but depends on driving for Lyft and Uber to supplement his income. Neither job alone is enough to make ends meet. He says he doesn't always enjoy driving, but his previous job has made it easier. FAQIRI: It's kind of helped me to improve my English. And also, it kind of like educated me because that's how I learned a lot of things about the United States before coming to the country. MCCAMMON: Faqiri's now enrolled in college courses and hopes to get a degree in IT. For the time being, he's got a more practical goal. FAQIRI: I want to have - instead of three, four jobs, I want to have only one job. My biggest hope in the future is I want to send my children to finish their education. As a father, I want to take that responsibility to make sure that I facilitate everything for them that they want. That's the most important thing in my life. MCCAMMON: That's Ajmal Faqiri, a former U. S. military interpreter from Afghanistan. In addition to his jobs, Faqiri works for No One Left Behind, a non-profit that helps translators and interpreters from Iraq and Afghanistan settle in the U. S.

One of the great things about science is that it can change the way we see the world. Today, we have an episode from March 2017 that I still think about all the time. It's a story that will change the way you think about many things - poverty, loneliness, time, even hunger. It's a tale about the psychological phenomenon of scarcity. It affects nearly everything in our lives and connects people who appear to have nothing in common. The story of scarcity is a story of how not having enough of what you need can become the only thing that matters to you. SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: That, I think, is the basic scarcity instinct. We're hungry. And then this thing starts going off in the head saying, do you realize we're hungry? Have I mentioned we're hungry? We're hungry. VEDANTAM: The scarcity trap, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. BRANDY DREW: My name is Brandy Drew (ph). I'm from Detroit, Mich. VEDANTAM: Brandy Drew has a story that may sound familiar to you, a story of poverty and debt. It's the kind of story that may lead people to quick conclusions. So pay attention to your own. Brandy is now 37. Six years ago, her life unraveled. At the time, she ran the dining services department at a senior living facility. She'd been with the company that ran it for more than a decade. One day, she made a mistake. DREW: I was just in a rush to get home. That was all - because day care closes at 6. I get off at 5. It was, like, maybe a 10-mile drive, busy traffic area. And I knew I had to pick up diapers, and the easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick them up before I picked the baby up. VEDANTAM: So Brandy stopped at a store, ran in and grabbed the diapers. She swiped her credit card at the self-checkout station and raced out. It turns out, she used the wrong card - not her own, but the company credit card. DREW: But what's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment. I didn't realize until my supervisor called me in and said, hey, what's this purchase? So had she not said anything, I don't think I would have realized that. VEDANTAM: Brandy carried the card in case she needed to buy dining supplies for work. She'd never had a problem before, never been reprimanded. She thought an apology and an explanation would do. DREW: And her response was, well, you know we have to terminate you. And I'm like, no, I didn't know that. Like, can I just pay you back? It was only - what? - 12 bucks. And she said, no, in cases like that, you automatically have to terminate the employee. I just cried. I cried for, like, a whole day because I couldn't believe it. I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened. I didn't want to tell my husband what had happened. I just didn't know what to do at that point. I felt like - I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a good example, even though it was a mistake. VEDANTAM: Brandy earned more than her husband, so the loss of the job hit hard. She felt like a loser. She tried to bring in money doing odd jobs, like cooking takeaway meals. But the stress grew. Brandy and her husband began fighting. She had supported him when he'd been laid off a few years earlier. And she'd expected he'd do the same for her. But he felt a layoff was different. He was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake. DREW: The final argument was that I left out the house that morning. I was going to job interviews. I had two interviews that day. And I didn't purchase toilet paper. So when he got home from work that day, there was no toilet paper. When I came in with the kids, he just immediately started yelling, you can't keep yourself together. You can't do this. You can't do that. So I walked right back out the door, and I never looked back. VEDANTAM: Without steady employment and a husband to help with bills, Brandy watched anxiously as her household supplies dwindled. She worried constantly about money. To make ends meet, she ordered a new credit card. The day it arrived, Brandy tore open the envelope. She grabbed the card and ran out the door. DREW: I went straight to Wal-Mart. And I bought, like, a family size of toilet paper, family size of laundry detergent. Like, I stocked up on things all at once whether than keeping it handy just in case. So I, like, maxed it out within the first couple of days that I had it rather than holding on to it for emergency purposes. VEDANTAM: And in that moment, as she was maxing out the credit card on the household supplies she needed, Brandy forgot about things that were slightly less pressing. DREW: What I didn't think about is, what about gas money? I didn't consider what gas would cost. That was, like, the biggest thing. It was always hard to have gas. VEDANTAM: And of course, there was the credit card bill itself. DREW: The first two months, I paid the minimum payment. And then I just stopped paying because I couldn't afford to pay. I didn't pay that card off until I got my tax refund the following year. By the time I paid it off, it was over $800 for a $500 card. VEDANTAM: More and more, Brandy felt trapped by debt. She no longer had options. It came down to, pay the bills or feed the kids. DREW: It's just overwhelming trying to juggle all of those things and still maintain a certain state of mind so that my children wouldn't see me struggle. VEDANTAM: In retrospect, Brandy can see the mistakes she made. If she had made a budget for the whole month, she might have remembered she needed to account for gas. If she had focused on the big picture, she might not have maxed out a credit card she couldn't afford to pay back. Why did Brandy make these mistakes? It's easy to say she was being irresponsible. But here's the thing. She had always been careful and conscientious. Did something cause her to behave differently? MULLAINATHAN: When you have scarcity and it creates a scarcity mindset, it leads you to take certain behaviors which, in the short term, help you manage scarcity but in the long term only make matters worse. VEDANTAM: When we come back, how the scarcity trap changes the way we think. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: After she lost her job, Brandy fell deeper and deeper into debt. One big reason is that she made a series of decisions that improved her life in the moment but made it worse in the long run. She could have used the new credit card only for emergencies, but instead, she maxed it out in a couple of days. To understand why she did this, I want to take you to a completely different time and place because it reveals something important about Brandy's story. It's 1944. World War II is nearing its end. Europe is on the verge of mass famine. Aid workers desperately need guidance on how to bring people back from the brink of starvation. Researchers at the University of Minnesota thought they could help. They launched a year-long experiment. As a 2002 documentary made by the university explains, the volunteers were conscientious objectors who still wanted to serve their country. The experiment, the volunteers had to go on a starvation diet. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Thirty-six young men, most of them Quakers, Mennonites or Church of Brethren members, moved into the south tower of the Memorial Stadium, which would be their home for a year. Many took courses at the university, even as they grew thinner and thinner. VEDANTAM: The young men became walking scarecrows. Some grew so weak and bony, they couldn't sit without cushions or raise their arms to wash their hair. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)HENRY SCHOLBERG: I remember being a little bit critical of guys in (unintelligible) who would lick their plates. I thought that was really pretty crude. VEDANTAM: Henry Scholberg was one of the volunteers. He recalled the experience in the documentary. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)SCHOLBERG: By the time we were into about the second month of it, I was doing it myself. You just needed every single calorie you could get your hands on. VEDANTAM: The results of the starvation experiment were eventually published and remain an important academic reference on nutrition, famine and eating disorders. But recently, two researchers became intrigued with the 70-year-old study for a completely different reason. They were interested in what the lack of food did not to the body, but to the mind. MULLAINATHAN: I think this type of scarcity is almost like an alarm that goes off in the head that's saying, hey, we really need this thing addressed. We really need this thing addressed. VEDANTAM: This is Sendhil Mullainathan, an economics professor at Harvard. He and a colleague, Eldar Shafir, a psychology professor at Princeton, had a theory brewing. It went like this. When you feel that something important is missing in your life, your brain starts to focus on that missing thing. When you're really desperate for something, you can focus on it so obsessively, there's no room for anything else. The researchers were just beginning to explore their hypothesis when a colleague mentioned the long-ago Minnesota starvation experiment. Eldar remembers being immediately fascinated by the study and how the lack of food affected the minds of the men. ELDAR SHAFIR: They basically were very hungry and could - couldn't stop thinking about eating. You know, in some sense, you'd think, given that they cannot eat, they'd rather be distracted with other things. But in fact, both subconsciously, the level of need-it (ph) reaction, and their choice of conversation largely was around food. Actually, it was sort of tragicomic. I mean, they planned to open restaurants, to become restaurateurs. They memorized recipes. They compared food prices of different newspapers. That's what they were doing. The whole time, they sat around looking at food-related issues. VEDANTAM: Even intentional diversions didn't work. Hunger and food had captured their minds. SHAFIR: At some point, the experimenters just felt sorry for them and decided to distract them with a movie. And some of the testimonials were, they showed me this movie. I couldn't care less about the love scenes. I wanted to see the meals. VEDANTAM: Eldar suddenly realized he had seen the same kind of behavior in a completely different setting. He'd done a lot of research on the effects of poverty. And he knew poor people who sometimes behaved like the starving men in Minnesota. SHAFIR: The poor, people who are lacking financial resources, find it very hard to think about anything but money or at least spend a lot of their cognitive resources, a lot of their attention, on financial juggling. VEDANTAM: If starvation made people obsess over food, poverty made people obsess over how they were going to make ends meet, how to make it to next week. SHAFIR: What's in common in both cases is your head is busy with the thing you don't have enough of. VEDANTAM: The two researchers felt they were on to something. Maybe, they thought, the human brain is wired to respond to scarcity by tunnelling in on the thing that's missing. Sendhil says this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. MULLAINATHAN: Picture that you have somebody from 25,000 years ago who's basically a hunter-gatherer and who might need to do a variety of things such as, you know, get water, do - you know, a lot of resources are needed. When they get hungry, it's sort of the evolutionary system wants to have an alarm that says, hey, really focus on getting food into the system. And that, I think, is the basic scarcity instinct. We're hungry. And then this thing starts going off in the head saying, do you realize we're hungry? Have I mentioned we're hungry? We're hungry. And it just keeps calling out to you. VEDANTAM: For Brandy Drew, the alarm might have sounded like this. You don't have the necessities your family needs. You need to stock up. Stock up now. You need these things. And when she bought the bleach, the family-sized pack of toilet paper, the snacks and juice boxes for the kids, the alarm temporarily went silent. DREW: I felt relieved that those things - the small things I didn't have to worry about. VEDANTAM: But the reprieve from the alarm came at a huge cost. DREW: But then, like I said, two days later it's like, OK, wait a minute. Why didn't you save at least a hundred dollars for gas? VEDANTAM: The answer to that question, Sandhil and Eldar believe, has to do with what scarcity did to Brandy. She was so focused on getting the basic necessities that she didn't have the mental capacity to attend to anything else. There's a technical term for this. It's called bandwidth. If you're downloading a movie on your home Wi-Fi network, you might find your email runs a little slower. The movie is hogging all the available bandwidth. Sendhil and Eldar say our minds work exactly the same way. If your mind is consumed with thoughts about something, there isn't room to think about other stuff. Scarcity fills the mind with intrusive thoughts about what you do not have. It doesn't leave room for anything else. Eldar says there's a simple way to demonstrate this. Imagine trying to hold an eight-digit number in your head. SHAFIR: And if I simply ask you to keep in mind, you know, 2-6-7-1-7-1-6-4, that just leaves you less able to attend to other stuff. You eat less well. You pay attention to less things, et cetera. VEDANTAM: As you're saying that eight-digit number now, I didn't hear the rest of the next two sentences because I'm trying to remember that eight-digit number. (Laughter). SHAFIR: (Laughter) I won't test you. I promise. But in a sense, that's kind of the metaphor. So when you're busy juggling your resources, worrying about, you know, how am I going to pay for dinner? And if I pay for dinner, will I be able to have money for the kids' school trip? It's like keeping an eight-digit number in your head. VEDANTAM: There's a reason our minds work this way. Tunneling into something makes you focus on it. Everything inside the tunnel becomes crystal clear. The problem is you can't see anything outside the tunnel. People in the poverty tunnel are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week. Studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals, the cheap tube of toothpaste. Someone who is poor is often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems. How do I get food on the table today? I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away, like the utility bill or gas money or a credit card payment. SHAFIR: As you - as you're checking the prices and remembering the prices and figuring out if you buy two carrots, will you have enough money for breakfast, you are forgetting things. You're paying less attention to your rent, your kids' homework, to all of the other things that make life complete. VEDANTAM: The thing is, as a result of doing this, the underlying problem can become worse. If you don't pay your bills, you'll be even deeper in the hole next month. Scarcity, in other words, is a trap. MULLAINATHAN: The scarcity trap for us is all those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors, which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow. And we think it's something that poor people do, busy people do. Here's another example. We think the lonely do this. So people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way, which actually makes it harder for them to make friends. VEDANTAM: Just as the poor focus on the money they do not have, the lonely tend to focus on the friends they do not have. The result is they try too hard to be liked. In a conversation, the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being said. The conversation falters. Instead of appearing likable, he's seen as awkward or flatfooted. What happens as a result? People avoid the awkward conversationalist. And the lonely person becomes even lonelier. This lens offers a new way of thinking about why people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid. When you're in a hole, why would you dig yourself even deeper? Sendhil says we're asking the wrong question. MULLAINATHAN: What if it's not that poor people are somehow deficient, but that poverty makes everyone less capable? That it's the - it's - you and I, tomorrow, were we to become poor, would all of a sudden have the same effect, that poverty is in some sense changing our minds. VEDANTAM: How do we know this isn't some bleeding heart theory to excuse irresponsible behavior? Eldar and Sendhil wanted to test their hypothesis. MULLAINATHAN: If all this is true, one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich. So how would we test that? Well, unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich. But sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us. VEDANTAM: Yes, sugarcane farmers, specifically those in India who are paid only once a year, right after the harvest. MULLAINATHAN: The month after they get that income, they're pretty rich. But like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once, the money gets spent a little too fast. And so by the end of the harvest cycle, they're relatively poor. So now we have the same person, a month before harvest, poor, and a month after harvest, well-off. VEDANTAM: Again, you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next. Sendhil and Eldar tested the farmers on their long-term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money. The results were stunning. MULLAINATHAN: We found a huge difference. So we found that post-harvest, when they're well-off, they have much more impulse control. VEDANTAM: Farmers who were rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term. This matched other research that shows, for example, that farmers who are well-off tend to weed their fields more regularly than farmers who are poor. Farmers who were poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week, short-term thinking. To be clear, it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about. It's all they can think about. Scarcity captures the mind, like it did with those starving men in Minnesota. In fact, scarcity can actually lower how you perform on an IQ test. MULLAINATHAN: Put simply, being poor is like having just pulled an all-nighter. VEDANTAM: Now, if you've been very lucky, maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely. But there might be another form of scarcity you have experienced. KATIE: On some days, we get to leave at 4 p. m. Some days, we don't leave till 1 a. m. (Laughter). So - and then you usually start the next day at 5:30 or 6 in the morning, usually work 80 hours-ish (ph) a week. VEDANTAM: When we come back, how being overworked and exhausted can produce a form of scarcity too and the pernicious effect this can have on your life. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Eldar Shafir and Sendhil Mullainathan believe that when something you desperately need is in short supply, your brain tends to focus on that thing. This focus can be so intense that it impedes your ability to think about anything else. What happens when the thing you're missing is time, when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to breathe? Let me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie (ph). She asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment. For as long as she can remember, Katie has been driven - really driven. KATIE: When I was in high school, I was determined to be valedictorian. So I took a sophomore-level honors biology course as a freshman in high school. And I studied around the clock. I had note cards. I walked through the hallways with the note cards. If there was a holiday party, I brought the note cards. And I'd also study till 2 or 3 in the morning. VEDANTAM: Katie says she wanted to be perfect at school. She eventually got to medical school, where she excelled. She graduated at the top of her class and quickly started her residency. The new schedule was grueling. KATIE: You can get in at 5:30 or 6 in the morning, and you round on all your patients. And then you - you round with the team. That means you go to all the patients and check in on their plan and adjust medications, et cetera, as necessary. And then there's usually a lunch conference, where we have education. And then in the afternoon, we might take new patients in and keep following up on our patients. And on some days, we get to leave at 4 p. m. Some days, we don't leave till 1 a. m. (Laughter). So - and then you usually start the next day at 5:30 or 6 in the morning again. And you get one day off a week, usually work 80 hours-ish a week. VEDANTAM: As Katie's workload grew, she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment. Instead of spending any time relaxing, she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work. KATIE: When I first started, it was just, like, really busy. So I'd try to come home, and I felt like, you know, I just don't have a lot of hours. So I need to make the most of them and was like, OK, I need to make sure I'm exercising, keeping my body healthy. And I need to read and stay on top of things. So I'd come home after a pretty long day, and I might go walking for half an hour. And then I'd read. And then I'd go to sleep. But then, as the time went on, I decided to try to get in more exercise 'cause I'm like, I never know when I'll get enough exercise in. So I started spending all my free daylight hours walking or running outside or going to the gym, up to three hours a day, plus, like, working 15-hour days and then trying to read and then go to sleep. VEDANTAM: As she focused intensely on the things she believed were key to her professional success, Katie lost sight of things on the periphery. She didn't know it, but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity. In her case, it was scarcity brought on by a lack of time. KATIE: So I wasn't going to the grocery store. My house wasn't unpacked yet. And it was stressing me out. And it was just a mess. And I've - my clothes piled up. I had a lot of dirty clothes. And coming home just felt so overwhelming. I didn't want to be there. And that's part of, I think, why I was walking so much, just to get out of the house and get away from all the things I hadn't done. And I also forgot to pay a bill in the midst of all of this. VEDANTAM: What did you forget to do? What bill did you forget to pay? KATIE: It was my energy bill. VEDANTAM: The old Katie would have spotted all of this. I mean, you were just basically, at this point, almost falling apart it sounds like. KATIE: I was. I was falling apart. VEDANTAM: There was something else. Katie had battled anorexia as a teenager. She knew she had to stay vigilant about her eating. But as she started to focus ever more intensely on work, she slipped back into some old habits. KATIE: I was eating mostly vegetables and fruits. And I wasn't eating a whole lot else, maybe a cliff bar here and there. VEDANTAM: No one knows better than a doctor about the importance of nutrition. And yet, despite all of her medical training, Katie stopped taking care of herself. Here's one thing I haven't told you yet about scarcity. It can rob you of insight, insight about how your own mind is changing. Katie had no awareness that she was heading down a dangerous path. It became obvious to her only when it finally affected her work. KATIE: I started to notice that I was, like, nearly missing things as I was reviewing. For example, I admitted a diabetic. And I almost didn't order insulin for them. But I did order the insulin. But I was like, I don't think I can keep up with this anymore because if you don't give a diabetic insulin - especially if they're Type 1 - they can have very fatal circumstances in the hospital and get really high blood sugars that can cause them to have an acidosis and end up on a ventilator. So I turned myself in at the point that I saw that it was starting to affect my work. VEDANTAM: In two months of the residency program, Katie's body and mind had withered. Things had gotten so bad, she had to go to a residential treatment center. Katie struggled with two things. Her body was desperately in need of nutrition. And her mind, she had to find a way to stop the intrusive thoughts that were consuming her. She had to. . . KATIE: Learn how to just sit because we weren't allowed to exercise. We weren't allowed to stand. We weren't even allowed to do jumping jacks or squats. We had to just sit. VEDANTAM: Katie's mind was filled with angry and impatient thoughts. KATIE: At first, I felt like - I felt useless because I thought, you know, if I'm not doing something productive, what is my purpose in life? VEDANTAM: But gradually, as the program literally forced her to do nothing, she started to emerge from the tunnel. She realized she had been so narrowly, relentlessly focused on one goal, doing well at work, that she had ignored the very things she needed to succeed - moments of relaxation, like watching TV or reading a book. Katie had loved art as a child. But she had put it aside because she thought it wouldn't help her become a better doctor. KATIE: I'm kind of the type of person that just likes to study and then do after I've, like, mastered it from a study point of view. And so to just do something without instruction is - it feels very vulnerable to me. But it ended up kind of being my saving grace in my recovery. And I've actually created an art room in my house. I changed my office from a work room into an art room. And it has paints and watercolors and chalks and everything you can imagine. And I try to go in there once a week and just create something without any expectation, just for the purpose of creating it because I can. VEDANTAM: Katie eventually returned to her residency program with a new outlook. She started doing something that Eldar and Sendhil recommend to all busy people. She actually pencils time into her schedule to do nothing. KATIE: One of the big things I've done is I kind of have a date night with myself once or twice a week, where I just schedule off the night. And I won't do anything with anyone else. And it'll just be free for me to do what I feel like. It might be watching a movie. It might be taking a soak in the tub and reading a book or being in my art room and painting whatever comes to me. But I do - like, I prioritize that. And I actually won't accept plans with friends, generally, when I do this. So that's one of the things I do. VEDANTAM: Katie is consciously freeing up bandwidth. And something strange has happened as she's done so. The less consumed she feels about work, the better she does at work. KATIE: Honestly, like, it's kind of incredible. But at work, my brain has increased its capacity fourfold. I am able to hold so many more things in my consciousness at once and manage them. I've just seen a really huge improvement in my ability to enjoy being in the company of others, to enjoy, like, occasions and to enjoy my work and do well at my work. VEDANTAM: While the psychological studies into scarcity and bandwidth are relatively new, the ideas are actually ancient. Avoid tunnel vision. Keep difficult things in one part of your life from contaminating everything else. Be present. MULLAINATHAN: Say you have a big deadline tomorrow for something you've got to finish. You go home, and you're spending the evening with your kids. And in that moment, you're not present-focused at all. What you're focused on is that deadline. You - you may go through minutes where you didn't hear what your kids were saying to you because your mind keeps going to this other thing. VEDANTAM: Tunnel vision is not in itself a good thing or a bad thing. Shutting out distractions can be helpful at times. The question is, do you know when you're inside the tunnel? MULLAINATHAN: To me, that's exactly the heart of managing scarcity. It's recognizing when you're trying to do something related to your scarcity where you really want to use that instinct. And when have you made a conscious decision to do something else where what you really need to do is to not have it intrude on that something else? You're at home. You're with your kids. You chose to be a parent for that three-hour period. You really don't want scarcity to intrude then. VEDANTAM: Of course, it's easy to say, build free time into your schedule. Stay present with your family. Take a vacation. These strategies presume you have choices. MULLAINATHAN: You can't say, I've had it with being lonely. I'm going to take a vacation from being lonely. It's not a choice. And to me, loneliness and poverty are the forms of scarcity that feel the biggest because while all these forces are at play, there's no release valve. There's no escape mechanism. Eldar and Sendhil want policymakers to design solutions that recognize how scarcity creates traps from which many people may not be able to extricate themselves. And they want the rest of us to stop preaching to those in poverty. SHAFIR: If you look at programs of poverty, we often confound a little bit the attempts to help the poor with the attempts to educate them, make sure that they show up on time, that they do the right things. From the perspective we're taking with scarcity, in some sense, if I'm very busy juggling a very complicated life, insisting that I show up at the office at 8 and not 8:05 is not doing me a favor. I don't need to be educated. It's just hard to manage. I'm - you know, it's just the transportation is not reliable. My kid is not ready. I don't have a babysitter. I'm going to make mistakes. It's not clear \"educating me,\" in quotes, about things is going to help me at all. It just makes my life all the more complicated. VEDANTAM: When people in poverty fail or make mistakes, the researchers think we should respond to them the same way we respond to mistakes made by airline pilots. There was a time not long ago when we thought that airline pilots who made mistakes were just bad pilots. Sendhil says a big reason air travel has become safer in recent decades is that there has been a shift in thinking about such mistakes. Designers have made cockpits fault-tolerant. Rather than trying to find perfect pilots, cockpits are now designed to account for human error. The goal is to alert pilots when they've made a mistake and to diminish the consequences of mistakes. MULLAINATHAN: It's ironic that when we design cockpits, the entire mantra of fault tolerance seems so intuitive. But when we design social policies, nobody's out there talking about, let's make this fault-tolerant. I mean, you know, poor people have a lot on their mind. Their bandwidth is taxed. They're going to make mistakes. Let's make sure this program is robust when they do make that mistake. It's just not the way we think. If I offer a training program, I don't sit there and say, let me make sure, you know, what's going to happen? This is for low-income individuals. Surely, they're going to miss a few days because, you know, it's hard to get get to class sometimes or other things are on their mind. So let me design this curriculum so that it's in-attendance (ph) tolerant. So even if somebody misses three days in a row, they'll be able to come on that fourth day and still feel caught up. In fact, our training curriculum is often quite the opposite. If you miss three days in a row, it's an invitation to miss the fourth day because you're not going to get anything. VEDANTAM: Brandy Drew eventually turned her life around. She found a low-income assistance program that offered her help. She worked with a financial counselor who gave her strategies for budgeting her money and keeping track of long-term priorities. DREW: I actually have a calendar now that I write down everything to make sure I'm paying things on the correct day and time. VEDANTAM: It's taken time and little steps, but Brandy is no longer in the scarcity tunnel. She's been working for two years now. And she has savings. DREW: I know that if anything happens - God forbid, if I lose this job - I know that I can survive for at least six months if I have to look for another. VEDANTAM: Eldar and Sendhil themselves say they are constantly trying to keep the lessons of scarcity front and center in their own lives. As a busy academic, Eldar has come up with a rule. When an invitation to an event two months down the road comes along, he asks himself whether he would attend the event if it were tomorrow. If the answer is no, he declines the invitation because his life is not going to be any less hectic two months from now. Preserving bandwidth takes conscious effort. Most of us, Eldar included, are going to violate the Eldar rule. We'll say yes to new commitments when we don't have the time or pull out a credit card when we can't afford it. In those moments, it's important to look up to notice we are inside a tunnel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This episode was produced by Jenny Schmidt and Maggie Penman. It was edited by Tara Boyle.

SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  I'm Shankar Vedantam, and this is HIDDEN BRAIN. One of the great things about science is that it can change the way we see the world. Today, we have an episode from March 2017 that I still think about all the time. It's a story that will change the way you think about many things - poverty, loneliness, time, even hunger. It's a tale about the psychological phenomenon of scarcity. It affects nearly everything in our lives and connects people who appear to have nothing in common. The story of scarcity is a story of how not having enough of what you need can become the only thing that matters to you. SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN: That, I think, is the basic scarcity instinct. We're hungry. And then this thing starts going off in the head saying, do you realize we're hungry? Have I mentioned we're hungry? We're hungry. VEDANTAM: The scarcity trap, this week on HIDDEN BRAIN. BRANDY DREW: My name is Brandy Drew (ph). I'm from Detroit, Mich. VEDANTAM: Brandy Drew has a story that may sound familiar to you, a story of poverty and debt. It's the kind of story that may lead people to quick conclusions. So pay attention to your own. Brandy is now 37. Six years ago, her life unraveled. At the time, she ran the dining services department at a senior living facility. She'd been with the company that ran it for more than a decade. One day, she made a mistake. DREW: I was just in a rush to get home. That was all - because day care closes at 6. I get off at 5. It was, like, maybe a 10-mile drive, busy traffic area. And I knew I had to pick up diapers, and the easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick them up before I picked the baby up. VEDANTAM: So Brandy stopped at a store, ran in and grabbed the diapers. She swiped her credit card at the self-checkout station and raced out. It turns out, she used the wrong card - not her own, but the company credit card. DREW: But what's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment. I didn't realize until my supervisor called me in and said, hey, what's this purchase? So had she not said anything, I don't think I would have realized that. VEDANTAM: Brandy carried the card in case she needed to buy dining supplies for work. She'd never had a problem before, never been reprimanded. She thought an apology and an explanation would do. DREW: And her response was, well, you know we have to terminate you. And I'm like, no, I didn't know that. Like, can I just pay you back? It was only - what? - 12 bucks. And she said, no, in cases like that, you automatically have to terminate the employee. I just cried. I cried for, like, a whole day because I couldn't believe it. I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened. I didn't want to tell my husband what had happened. I just didn't know what to do at that point. I felt like - I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a good example, even though it was a mistake. VEDANTAM: Brandy earned more than her husband, so the loss of the job hit hard. She felt like a loser. She tried to bring in money doing odd jobs, like cooking takeaway meals. But the stress grew. Brandy and her husband began fighting. She had supported him when he'd been laid off a few years earlier. And she'd expected he'd do the same for her. But he felt a layoff was different. He was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake. DREW: The final argument was that I left out the house that morning. I was going to job interviews. I had two interviews that day. And I didn't purchase toilet paper. So when he got home from work that day, there was no toilet paper. When I came in with the kids, he just immediately started yelling, you can't keep yourself together. You can't do this. You can't do that. So I walked right back out the door, and I never looked back. VEDANTAM: Without steady employment and a husband to help with bills, Brandy watched anxiously as her household supplies dwindled. She worried constantly about money. To make ends meet, she ordered a new credit card. The day it arrived, Brandy tore open the envelope. She grabbed the card and ran out the door. DREW: I went straight to Wal-Mart. And I bought, like, a family size of toilet paper, family size of laundry detergent. Like, I stocked up on things all at once whether than keeping it handy just in case. So I, like, maxed it out within the first couple of days that I had it rather than holding on to it for emergency purposes. VEDANTAM: And in that moment, as she was maxing out the credit card on the household supplies she needed, Brandy forgot about things that were slightly less pressing. DREW: What I didn't think about is, what about gas money? I didn't consider what gas would cost. That was, like, the biggest thing. It was always hard to have gas. VEDANTAM: And of course, there was the credit card bill itself. DREW: The first two months, I paid the minimum payment. And then I just stopped paying because I couldn't afford to pay. I didn't pay that card off until I got my tax refund the following year. By the time I paid it off, it was over $800 for a $500 card. VEDANTAM: More and more, Brandy felt trapped by debt. She no longer had options. It came down to, pay the bills or feed the kids. DREW: It's just overwhelming trying to juggle all of those things and still maintain a certain state of mind so that my children wouldn't see me struggle. VEDANTAM: In retrospect, Brandy can see the mistakes she made. If she had made a budget for the whole month, she might have remembered she needed to account for gas. If she had focused on the big picture, she might not have maxed out a credit card she couldn't afford to pay back. Why did Brandy make these mistakes? It's easy to say she was being irresponsible. But here's the thing. She had always been careful and conscientious. Did something cause her to behave differently? MULLAINATHAN: When you have scarcity and it creates a scarcity mindset, it leads you to take certain behaviors which, in the short term, help you manage scarcity but in the long term only make matters worse. VEDANTAM: When we come back, how the scarcity trap changes the way we think. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: After she lost her job, Brandy fell deeper and deeper into debt. One big reason is that she made a series of decisions that improved her life in the moment but made it worse in the long run. She could have used the new credit card only for emergencies, but instead, she maxed it out in a couple of days. To understand why she did this, I want to take you to a completely different time and place because it reveals something important about Brandy's story. It's 1944. World War II is nearing its end. Europe is on the verge of mass famine. Aid workers desperately need guidance on how to bring people back from the brink of starvation. Researchers at the University of Minnesota thought they could help. They launched a year-long experiment. As a 2002 documentary made by the university explains, the volunteers were conscientious objectors who still wanted to serve their country. The experiment, the volunteers had to go on a starvation diet. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Thirty-six young men, most of them Quakers, Mennonites or Church of Brethren members, moved into the south tower of the Memorial Stadium, which would be their home for a year. Many took courses at the university, even as they grew thinner and thinner. VEDANTAM: The young men became walking scarecrows. Some grew so weak and bony, they couldn't sit without cushions or raise their arms to wash their hair. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY) HENRY SCHOLBERG: I remember being a little bit critical of guys in (unintelligible) who would lick their plates. I thought that was really pretty crude. VEDANTAM: Henry Scholberg was one of the volunteers. He recalled the experience in the documentary. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY) SCHOLBERG: By the time we were into about the second month of it, I was doing it myself. You just needed every single calorie you could get your hands on. VEDANTAM: The results of the starvation experiment were eventually published and remain an important academic reference on nutrition, famine and eating disorders. But recently, two researchers became intrigued with the 70-year-old study for a completely different reason. They were interested in what the lack of food did not to the body, but to the mind. MULLAINATHAN: I think this type of scarcity is almost like an alarm that goes off in the head that's saying, hey, we really need this thing addressed. We really need this thing addressed. VEDANTAM: This is Sendhil Mullainathan, an economics professor at Harvard. He and a colleague, Eldar Shafir, a psychology professor at Princeton, had a theory brewing. It went like this. When you feel that something important is missing in your life, your brain starts to focus on that missing thing. When you're really desperate for something, you can focus on it so obsessively, there's no room for anything else. The researchers were just beginning to explore their hypothesis when a colleague mentioned the long-ago Minnesota starvation experiment. Eldar remembers being immediately fascinated by the study and how the lack of food affected the minds of the men. ELDAR SHAFIR: They basically were very hungry and could - couldn't stop thinking about eating. You know, in some sense, you'd think, given that they cannot eat, they'd rather be distracted with other things. But in fact, both subconsciously, the level of need-it (ph) reaction, and their choice of conversation largely was around food. Actually, it was sort of tragicomic. I mean, they planned to open restaurants, to become restaurateurs. They memorized recipes. They compared food prices of different newspapers. That's what they were doing. The whole time, they sat around looking at food-related issues. VEDANTAM: Even intentional diversions didn't work. Hunger and food had captured their minds. SHAFIR: At some point, the experimenters just felt sorry for them and decided to distract them with a movie. And some of the testimonials were, they showed me this movie. I couldn't care less about the love scenes. I wanted to see the meals. VEDANTAM: Eldar suddenly realized he had seen the same kind of behavior in a completely different setting. He'd done a lot of research on the effects of poverty. And he knew poor people who sometimes behaved like the starving men in Minnesota. SHAFIR: The poor, people who are lacking financial resources, find it very hard to think about anything but money or at least spend a lot of their cognitive resources, a lot of their attention, on financial juggling. VEDANTAM: If starvation made people obsess over food, poverty made people obsess over how they were going to make ends meet, how to make it to next week. SHAFIR: What's in common in both cases is your head is busy with the thing you don't have enough of. VEDANTAM: The two researchers felt they were on to something. Maybe, they thought, the human brain is wired to respond to scarcity by tunnelling in on the thing that's missing. Sendhil says this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. MULLAINATHAN: Picture that you have somebody from 25,000 years ago who's basically a hunter-gatherer and who might need to do a variety of things such as, you know, get water, do - you know, a lot of resources are needed. When they get hungry, it's sort of the evolutionary system wants to have an alarm that says, hey, really focus on getting food into the system. And that, I think, is the basic scarcity instinct. We're hungry. And then this thing starts going off in the head saying, do you realize we're hungry? Have I mentioned we're hungry? We're hungry. And it just keeps calling out to you. VEDANTAM: For Brandy Drew, the alarm might have sounded like this. You don't have the necessities your family needs. You need to stock up. Stock up now. You need these things. And when she bought the bleach, the family-sized pack of toilet paper, the snacks and juice boxes for the kids, the alarm temporarily went silent. DREW: I felt relieved that those things - the small things I didn't have to worry about. VEDANTAM: But the reprieve from the alarm came at a huge cost. DREW: But then, like I said, two days later it's like, OK, wait a minute. Why didn't you save at least a hundred dollars for gas? VEDANTAM: The answer to that question, Sandhil and Eldar believe, has to do with what scarcity did to Brandy. She was so focused on getting the basic necessities that she didn't have the mental capacity to attend to anything else. There's a technical term for this. It's called bandwidth. If you're downloading a movie on your home Wi-Fi network, you might find your email runs a little slower. The movie is hogging all the available bandwidth. Sendhil and Eldar say our minds work exactly the same way. If your mind is consumed with thoughts about something, there isn't room to think about other stuff. Scarcity fills the mind with intrusive thoughts about what you do not have. It doesn't leave room for anything else. Eldar says there's a simple way to demonstrate this. Imagine trying to hold an eight-digit number in your head. SHAFIR: And if I simply ask you to keep in mind, you know, 2-6-7-1-7-1-6-4, that just leaves you less able to attend to other stuff. You eat less well. You pay attention to less things, et cetera. VEDANTAM: As you're saying that eight-digit number now, I didn't hear the rest of the next two sentences because I'm trying to remember that eight-digit number. (Laughter). SHAFIR: (Laughter) I won't test you. I promise. But in a sense, that's kind of the metaphor. So when you're busy juggling your resources, worrying about, you know, how am I going to pay for dinner? And if I pay for dinner, will I be able to have money for the kids' school trip? It's like keeping an eight-digit number in your head. VEDANTAM: There's a reason our minds work this way. Tunneling into something makes you focus on it. Everything inside the tunnel becomes crystal clear. The problem is you can't see anything outside the tunnel. People in the poverty tunnel are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week. Studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals, the cheap tube of toothpaste. Someone who is poor is often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems. How do I get food on the table today? I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away, like the utility bill or gas money or a credit card payment. SHAFIR: As you - as you're checking the prices and remembering the prices and figuring out if you buy two carrots, will you have enough money for breakfast, you are forgetting things. You're paying less attention to your rent, your kids' homework, to all of the other things that make life complete. VEDANTAM: The thing is, as a result of doing this, the underlying problem can become worse. If you don't pay your bills, you'll be even deeper in the hole next month. Scarcity, in other words, is a trap. MULLAINATHAN: The scarcity trap for us is all those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors, which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow. And we think it's something that poor people do, busy people do. Here's another example. We think the lonely do this. So people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way, which actually makes it harder for them to make friends. VEDANTAM: Just as the poor focus on the money they do not have, the lonely tend to focus on the friends they do not have. The result is they try too hard to be liked. In a conversation, the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being said. The conversation falters. Instead of appearing likable, he's seen as awkward or flatfooted. What happens as a result? People avoid the awkward conversationalist. And the lonely person becomes even lonelier. This lens offers a new way of thinking about why people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid. When you're in a hole, why would you dig yourself even deeper? Sendhil says we're asking the wrong question. MULLAINATHAN: What if it's not that poor people are somehow deficient, but that poverty makes everyone less capable? That it's the - it's - you and I, tomorrow, were we to become poor, would all of a sudden have the same effect, that poverty is in some sense changing our minds. VEDANTAM: How do we know this isn't some bleeding heart theory to excuse irresponsible behavior? Eldar and Sendhil wanted to test their hypothesis. MULLAINATHAN: If all this is true, one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich. So how would we test that? Well, unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich. But sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us. VEDANTAM: Yes, sugarcane farmers, specifically those in India who are paid only once a year, right after the harvest. MULLAINATHAN: The month after they get that income, they're pretty rich. But like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once, the money gets spent a little too fast. And so by the end of the harvest cycle, they're relatively poor. So now we have the same person, a month before harvest, poor, and a month after harvest, well-off. VEDANTAM: Again, you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next. Sendhil and Eldar tested the farmers on their long-term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money. The results were stunning. MULLAINATHAN: We found a huge difference. So we found that post-harvest, when they're well-off, they have much more impulse control. VEDANTAM: Farmers who were rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term. This matched other research that shows, for example, that farmers who are well-off tend to weed their fields more regularly than farmers who are poor. Farmers who were poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week, short-term thinking. To be clear, it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about. It's all they can think about. Scarcity captures the mind, like it did with those starving men in Minnesota. In fact, scarcity can actually lower how you perform on an IQ test. MULLAINATHAN: Put simply, being poor is like having just pulled an all-nighter. VEDANTAM: Now, if you've been very lucky, maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely. But there might be another form of scarcity you have experienced. KATIE: On some days, we get to leave at 4 p. m. Some days, we don't leave till 1 a. m. (Laughter). So - and then you usually start the next day at 5:30 or 6 in the morning, usually work 80 hours-ish (ph) a week. VEDANTAM: When we come back, how being overworked and exhausted can produce a form of scarcity too and the pernicious effect this can have on your life. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Eldar Shafir and Sendhil Mullainathan believe that when something you desperately need is in short supply, your brain tends to focus on that thing. This focus can be so intense that it impedes your ability to think about anything else. What happens when the thing you're missing is time, when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to breathe? Let me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie (ph). She asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment. For as long as she can remember, Katie has been driven - really driven. KATIE: When I was in high school, I was determined to be valedictorian. So I took a sophomore-level honors biology course as a freshman in high school. And I studied around the clock. I had note cards. I walked through the hallways with the note cards. If there was a holiday party, I brought the note cards. And I'd also study till 2 or 3 in the morning. VEDANTAM: Katie says she wanted to be perfect at school. She eventually got to medical school, where she excelled. She graduated at the top of her class and quickly started her residency. The new schedule was grueling. KATIE: You can get in at 5:30 or 6 in the morning, and you round on all your patients. And then you - you round with the team. That means you go to all the patients and check in on their plan and adjust medications, et cetera, as necessary. And then there's usually a lunch conference, where we have education. And then in the afternoon, we might take new patients in and keep following up on our patients. And on some days, we get to leave at 4 p. m. Some days, we don't leave till 1 a. m. (Laughter). So - and then you usually start the next day at 5:30 or 6 in the morning again. And you get one day off a week, usually work 80 hours-ish a week. VEDANTAM: As Katie's workload grew, she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment. Instead of spending any time relaxing, she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work. KATIE: When I first started, it was just, like, really busy. So I'd try to come home, and I felt like, you know, I just don't have a lot of hours. So I need to make the most of them and was like, OK, I need to make sure I'm exercising, keeping my body healthy. And I need to read and stay on top of things. So I'd come home after a pretty long day, and I might go walking for half an hour. And then I'd read. And then I'd go to sleep. But then, as the time went on, I decided to try to get in more exercise 'cause I'm like, I never know when I'll get enough exercise in. So I started spending all my free daylight hours walking or running outside or going to the gym, up to three hours a day, plus, like, working 15-hour days and then trying to read and then go to sleep. VEDANTAM: As she focused intensely on the things she believed were key to her professional success, Katie lost sight of things on the periphery. She didn't know it, but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity. In her case, it was scarcity brought on by a lack of time. KATIE: So I wasn't going to the grocery store. My house wasn't unpacked yet. And it was stressing me out. And it was just a mess. And I've - my clothes piled up. I had a lot of dirty clothes. And coming home just felt so overwhelming. I didn't want to be there. And that's part of, I think, why I was walking so much, just to get out of the house and get away from all the things I hadn't done. And I also forgot to pay a bill in the midst of all of this. VEDANTAM: What did you forget to do? What bill did you forget to pay? KATIE: It was my energy bill. VEDANTAM: The old Katie would have spotted all of this. I mean, you were just basically, at this point, almost falling apart it sounds like. KATIE: I was. I was falling apart. VEDANTAM: There was something else. Katie had battled anorexia as a teenager. She knew she had to stay vigilant about her eating. But as she started to focus ever more intensely on work, she slipped back into some old habits. KATIE: I was eating mostly vegetables and fruits. And I wasn't eating a whole lot else, maybe a cliff bar here and there. VEDANTAM: No one knows better than a doctor about the importance of nutrition. And yet, despite all of her medical training, Katie stopped taking care of herself. Here's one thing I haven't told you yet about scarcity. It can rob you of insight, insight about how your own mind is changing. Katie had no awareness that she was heading down a dangerous path. It became obvious to her only when it finally affected her work. KATIE: I started to notice that I was, like, nearly missing things as I was reviewing. For example, I admitted a diabetic. And I almost didn't order insulin for them. But I did order the insulin. But I was like, I don't think I can keep up with this anymore because if you don't give a diabetic insulin - especially if they're Type 1 - they can have very fatal circumstances in the hospital and get really high blood sugars that can cause them to have an acidosis and end up on a ventilator. So I turned myself in at the point that I saw that it was starting to affect my work. VEDANTAM: In two months of the residency program, Katie's body and mind had withered. Things had gotten so bad, she had to go to a residential treatment center. Katie struggled with two things. Her body was desperately in need of nutrition. And her mind, she had to find a way to stop the intrusive thoughts that were consuming her. She had to. . . KATIE: Learn how to just sit because we weren't allowed to exercise. We weren't allowed to stand. We weren't even allowed to do jumping jacks or squats. We had to just sit. VEDANTAM: Katie's mind was filled with angry and impatient thoughts. KATIE: At first, I felt like - I felt useless because I thought, you know, if I'm not doing something productive, what is my purpose in life? VEDANTAM: But gradually, as the program literally forced her to do nothing, she started to emerge from the tunnel. She realized she had been so narrowly, relentlessly focused on one goal, doing well at work, that she had ignored the very things she needed to succeed - moments of relaxation, like watching TV or reading a book. Katie had loved art as a child. But she had put it aside because she thought it wouldn't help her become a better doctor. KATIE: I'm kind of the type of person that just likes to study and then do after I've, like, mastered it from a study point of view. And so to just do something without instruction is - it feels very vulnerable to me. But it ended up kind of being my saving grace in my recovery. And I've actually created an art room in my house. I changed my office from a work room into an art room. And it has paints and watercolors and chalks and everything you can imagine. And I try to go in there once a week and just create something without any expectation, just for the purpose of creating it because I can. VEDANTAM: Katie eventually returned to her residency program with a new outlook. She started doing something that Eldar and Sendhil recommend to all busy people. She actually pencils time into her schedule to do nothing. KATIE: One of the big things I've done is I kind of have a date night with myself once or twice a week, where I just schedule off the night. And I won't do anything with anyone else. And it'll just be free for me to do what I feel like. It might be watching a movie. It might be taking a soak in the tub and reading a book or being in my art room and painting whatever comes to me. But I do - like, I prioritize that. And I actually won't accept plans with friends, generally, when I do this. So that's one of the things I do. VEDANTAM: Katie is consciously freeing up bandwidth. And something strange has happened as she's done so. The less consumed she feels about work, the better she does at work. KATIE: Honestly, like, it's kind of incredible. But at work, my brain has increased its capacity fourfold. I am able to hold so many more things in my consciousness at once and manage them. I've just seen a really huge improvement in my ability to enjoy being in the company of others, to enjoy, like, occasions and to enjoy my work and do well at my work. VEDANTAM: While the psychological studies into scarcity and bandwidth are relatively new, the ideas are actually ancient. Avoid tunnel vision. Keep difficult things in one part of your life from contaminating everything else. Be present. MULLAINATHAN: Say you have a big deadline tomorrow for something you've got to finish. You go home, and you're spending the evening with your kids. And in that moment, you're not present-focused at all. What you're focused on is that deadline. You - you may go through minutes where you didn't hear what your kids were saying to you because your mind keeps going to this other thing. VEDANTAM: Tunnel vision is not in itself a good thing or a bad thing. Shutting out distractions can be helpful at times. The question is, do you know when you're inside the tunnel? MULLAINATHAN: To me, that's exactly the heart of managing scarcity. It's recognizing when you're trying to do something related to your scarcity where you really want to use that instinct. And when have you made a conscious decision to do something else where what you really need to do is to not have it intrude on that something else? You're at home. You're with your kids. You chose to be a parent for that three-hour period. You really don't want scarcity to intrude then. VEDANTAM: Of course, it's easy to say, build free time into your schedule. Stay present with your family. Take a vacation. These strategies presume you have choices. MULLAINATHAN: You can't say, I've had it with being lonely. I'm going to take a vacation from being lonely. It's not a choice. And to me, loneliness and poverty are the forms of scarcity that feel the biggest because while all these forces are at play, there's no release valve. There's no escape mechanism. Eldar and Sendhil want policymakers to design solutions that recognize how scarcity creates traps from which many people may not be able to extricate themselves. And they want the rest of us to stop preaching to those in poverty. SHAFIR: If you look at programs of poverty, we often confound a little bit the attempts to help the poor with the attempts to educate them, make sure that they show up on time, that they do the right things. From the perspective we're taking with scarcity, in some sense, if I'm very busy juggling a very complicated life, insisting that I show up at the office at 8 and not 8:05 is not doing me a favor. I don't need to be educated. It's just hard to manage. I'm - you know, it's just the transportation is not reliable. My kid is not ready. I don't have a babysitter. I'm going to make mistakes. It's not clear \"educating me,\" in quotes, about things is going to help me at all. It just makes my life all the more complicated. VEDANTAM: When people in poverty fail or make mistakes, the researchers think we should respond to them the same way we respond to mistakes made by airline pilots. There was a time not long ago when we thought that airline pilots who made mistakes were just bad pilots. Sendhil says a big reason air travel has become safer in recent decades is that there has been a shift in thinking about such mistakes. Designers have made cockpits fault-tolerant. Rather than trying to find perfect pilots, cockpits are now designed to account for human error. The goal is to alert pilots when they've made a mistake and to diminish the consequences of mistakes. MULLAINATHAN: It's ironic that when we design cockpits, the entire mantra of fault tolerance seems so intuitive. But when we design social policies, nobody's out there talking about, let's make this fault-tolerant. I mean, you know, poor people have a lot on their mind. Their bandwidth is taxed. They're going to make mistakes. Let's make sure this program is robust when they do make that mistake. It's just not the way we think. If I offer a training program, I don't sit there and say, let me make sure, you know, what's going to happen? This is for low-income individuals. Surely, they're going to miss a few days because, you know, it's hard to get get to class sometimes or other things are on their mind. So let me design this curriculum so that it's in-attendance (ph) tolerant. So even if somebody misses three days in a row, they'll be able to come on that fourth day and still feel caught up. In fact, our training curriculum is often quite the opposite. If you miss three days in a row, it's an invitation to miss the fourth day because you're not going to get anything. VEDANTAM: Brandy Drew eventually turned her life around. She found a low-income assistance program that offered her help. She worked with a financial counselor who gave her strategies for budgeting her money and keeping track of long-term priorities. DREW: I actually have a calendar now that I write down everything to make sure I'm paying things on the correct day and time. VEDANTAM: It's taken time and little steps, but Brandy is no longer in the scarcity tunnel. She's been working for two years now. And she has savings. DREW: I know that if anything happens - God forbid, if I lose this job - I know that I can survive for at least six months if I have to look for another. VEDANTAM: Eldar and Sendhil themselves say they are constantly trying to keep the lessons of scarcity front and center in their own lives. As a busy academic, Eldar has come up with a rule. When an invitation to an event two months down the road comes along, he asks himself whether he would attend the event if it were tomorrow. If the answer is no, he declines the invitation because his life is not going to be any less hectic two months from now. Preserving bandwidth takes conscious effort. Most of us, Eldar included, are going to violate the Eldar rule. We'll say yes to new commitments when we don't have the time or pull out a credit card when we can't afford it. In those moments, it's important to look up to notice we are inside a tunnel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This episode was produced by Jenny Schmidt and Maggie Penman. It was edited by Tara Boyle.

S. and China will become a full-blown trade war, but farmers in the Midwest are already feeling effects from these early skirmishes. Earlier this week, China imposed new tariffs on pork, pressuring U. S. producers who already struggle with razor-thin profit margins. Iowa Public Radio's Amy Mayer reports that if the threat to target soybeans becomes real, things for some U. S. farmers could get a lot worse. (SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)AMY MAYER, BYLINE: As Howard Hill raps on the side of his nursery barn, piglets stir inside. HOWARD HILL: We have a sow farm - small sow farm here in Nevada, Iowa. MAYER: Hill markets 7,000 hogs each year. About a quarter of them will end up overseas, and China is a major buyer. Hill says China even offers a market for parts of the pig that don't make money in the U. S. , like organs and skin. HILL: They value some of those variety meats that we don't, and it adds quite a bit to the value of each hog that we sell. MAYER: That means the new tariffs worry farmers here because they will undoubtedly lead to lower sales. Howard Hill says he's seen hog prices drop to the point where it may cost some farmers more to raise a pig than they can sell it for. The U. S. and China are continuing to draw battle lines for the next round in this fight. Now China has put soybeans on the potential tariff list, and many more farmers grow soybeans than raise pigs. HILL: That's going to have a huge impact on the farm economy. MAYER: But Iowa State University economist Wendong Zhang says talk about a big soybean tariff may prove to be bluster. The Chinese don't really want to make soybeans more expensive to import. WENDONG ZHANG: It will hurt them a lot. I feel that could be one of the nuclear option that they reserve as a last resort. They don't want to use it because it's hard to find substitutes. MAYER: But Zhang says, at $12 billion a year, soybeans are a juicy tariff target, right up there with airplanes and cars. President Trump insists these moves don't constitute a trade war. He says he's only trying to protect American intellectual property and manufacturing. But some farm-state lawmakers wonder why farmers are always in the crosshairs. Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst says she's concerned the president isn't keeping the promises he made to farmers. JONI ERNST: I support the president's efforts to protect American jobs, but I do wish that the tariffs move would be a more subtle approach where we're maybe phasing it in, we're trying to protect the interests of the American farmer. And that's not what has occurred. MAYER: Instead, farmers are once again on the front lines of a trade dispute. Threats to agriculture were an opening salvo in the ongoing negotiations over NAFTA, the free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. But the way commodity markets work, if the cost of soybeans tanks in response to possible Chinese tariffs, the cost of raising hogs will drop. Howard Hill says while some farmers may be anxious over all this, few are surprised. HILL: Farmers are used to volatile markets, you know? So you have to learn to live with it and do the best you can. MAYER: Volatility is one thing, but talk of a trade war upsets lots of farmers here in Iowa, and they're hoping for a trade armistice before anybody has to sell the farm.

The Labor Department has cited a 4. 1 percent unemployment rate - about the same as it's been for the last six months. Most economists consider the country to be close to full employment. Cardiff Garcia is here. He co-hosts Planet Money's The Indicator podcast. Hey there, Cardiff. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: And The Indicator, that's where you guys every day tell one short story that helps make sense of the economy. So we want to talk to you about this jobs report because some people are saying that this is weak growth that we're seeing. Does that sound right? GARCIA: Don't believe the negative hype, OK? This jobs report did show that there was a relatively weak pace of jobs growth in March, but that's because of a couple of weather-related industries, so construction sector lost jobs, leisure and hospitality was about flat. If they'd had even mediocre growth, which they probably will in the coming months, then this jobs report would have been fine. So for the most part, it looks like the labor market continues plugging along just as it has for the last few years. CORNISH: All right. So bypassing the hype, what stuck out to you? GARCIA: There is one number that's really intriguing to me, which is that more than 7 out of the 10 people who were newly employed in March were not even looking for work in February. And this is really kind of interesting because it suggests that companies are really going out of their way to try to find workers - right? - because the labor market has been relatively strong. And so they're even looking for workers that aren't in the labor force. They're trying to pull them into the labor force. And they can do that in a few different ways. One way is to raise wages, but another way is to pursue workers that traditionally they might have been a little bit reluctant to hire, so people maybe with big gaps in their resume, maybe people with prison backgrounds and disabled workers. Of course, companies are not supposed to discriminate against disabled workers, but it happens. And what's happening - and we see this in the numbers - is that more and more people who had cited disability as a reason for not looking for work are now in fact finding work. It suggests that companies are indeed accommodating categories of workers that in the past they might not have wanted to hire. CORNISH: Another thing I understand is that there's been a shift in the growth of middle-class jobs. What does that mean? GARCIA: Yeah, this is really interesting. Over roughly the past year, it looks like middle-wage jobs have been climbing at a faster rate than either. . . CORNISH: What's a middle wage? GARCIA: A middle-wage job is like construction or manufacturing - right? - jobs that traditionally have been, like, quite solidly middle-class jobs and that have been effectively hollowed out for the last few decades. So you've had growth in, like, very high-income jobs and growth in very low-income jobs. But in the past year, it looks like that hollowing out seems to have reversed. And that is according to an analysis by economist Jed Kolko. So there's actually been a faster pace of growth in middle-class jobs. And actually, it's a bit of a mystery as to why this is happening. It's mostly happening in the construction and manufacturing sectors. They've had a faster pace of jobs growth than other parts of the economy. CORNISH: Now, before I let you go, I want to ask you about a story we've been reporting on all week, which is the trade tariff threats bouncing back and forth between the U. S. and China. We know that it affected the stock market. Do we know if it could affect the next jobs report? GARCIA: It can certainly affect jobs growth. There is not any evidence that it has affected jobs growth yet. And in fact in March, those parts of the economy that have to rely on buying steel and aluminum to make their products actually had more jobs growth than the parts of the economy that make metals, that make steel and aluminum. But it's very early. This is all still at sort of the threat level, right? And so in terms of how tariffs might affect future jobs growth, that's all still a little bit out there. CORNISH: That's Cardiff Garcia, co-host of Planet Money's The Indicator podcast. Thank you for coming in. GARCIA: Audie, a pleasure. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The March jobs report is out today.

If they'd had even mediocre growth, which they probably will in the coming months, then this jobs report would have been fine. So for the most part, it looks like the labor market continues plugging along just as it has for the last few years. CORNISH: All right. So bypassing the hype, what stuck out to you? GARCIA: There is one number that's really intriguing to me, which is that more than 7 out of the 10 people who were newly employed in March were not even looking for work in February. And this is really kind of interesting because it suggests that companies are really going out of their way to try to find workers - right? - because the labor market has been relatively strong. And so they're even looking for workers that aren't in the labor force. They're trying to pull them into the labor force. And they can do that in a few different ways. One way is to raise wages, but another way is to pursue workers that traditionally they might have been a little bit reluctant to hire, so people maybe with big gaps in their resume, maybe people with prison backgrounds and disabled workers. Of course, companies are not supposed to discriminate against disabled workers, but it happens. And what's happening - and we see this in the numbers - is that more and more people who had cited disability as a reason for not looking for work are now in fact finding work. It suggests that companies are indeed accommodating categories of workers that in the past they might not have wanted to hire. CORNISH: Another thing I understand is that there's been a shift in the growth of middle-class jobs. What does that mean? GARCIA: Yeah, this is really interesting. Over roughly the past year, it looks like middle-wage jobs have been climbing at a faster rate than either. . . CORNISH: What's a middle wage? GARCIA: A middle-wage job is like construction or manufacturing - right? - jobs that traditionally have been, like, quite solidly middle-class jobs and that have been effectively hollowed out for the last few decades. So you've had growth in, like, very high-income jobs and growth in very low-income jobs. But in the past year, it looks like that hollowing out seems to have reversed. And that is according to an analysis by economist Jed Kolko. So there's actually been a faster pace of growth in middle-class jobs. And actually, it's a bit of a mystery as to why this is happening. It's mostly happening in the construction and manufacturing sectors. They've had a faster pace of jobs growth than other parts of the economy. CORNISH: Now, before I let you go, I want to ask you about a story we've been reporting on all week, which is the trade tariff threats bouncing back and forth between the U. S. and China. We know that it affected the stock market. Do we know if it could affect the next jobs report? GARCIA: It can certainly affect jobs growth. There is not any evidence that it has affected jobs growth yet. And in fact in March, those parts of the economy that have to rely on buying steel and aluminum to make their products actually had more jobs growth than the parts of the economy that make metals, that make steel and aluminum. But it's very early. This is all still at sort of the threat level, right? And so in terms of how tariffs might affect future jobs growth, that's all still a little bit out there. CORNISH: That's Cardiff Garcia, co-host of Planet Money's The Indicator podcast. Thank you for coming in.

Last night, the White House announced that President Trump wants the U. S. trade representative to consider an additional $100 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods. This was in response to what he said was China's unfair retaliation. Now, China - for its part - warned this morning that it was prepared to fight back, quote, \"at any cost. \" We should say, though, that President Trump, during a visit to West Virginia, did seem optimistic that this standoff with China will end well. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In many respects, I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship - long term - with China, but we have to get this straightened out. We have to have some balance. GREENE: All right, I want to bring in Glenn Hubbard. He's the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. He joined us just a matter of weeks ago on the eve of the first U. S. tariffs. Mr. Hubbard, welcome back. GLENN HUBBARD: Thank you. GREENE: So did you expect all this to escalate as much as it has? HUBBARD: I think so. I mean, President Trump has been clear from his campaign and his presidency that he feels China is a real issue. I do think it's possible to find an off-ramp, but I'm not entirely sure the administration knows where it is. It's getting some things right, some things wrong and ignoring the elephant in the room. GREENE: Well, what is the elephant in the room? HUBBARD: The elephant in the room is actually helping people be - left behind by forces like globalization and technological change. That's where the political animus toward trade comes from. And unfortunately, nothing the president is talking about helps those people, but there's a lot that we could do. GREENE: So I mean, the president, I guess, would argue that, overall, an unfair trading relationship with China does not help American workers and that the long game here is to level the playing field. Do you see it differently? HUBBARD: Well, I think that's partly what the president got right. China is a problem, but it's not the old-fashioned trade issues the president's focused on as much as it is technological transfer. China is clearly stealing intellectual property not only from American firms but others. And the right way to get at that would be through a multilateral solution and really literally interpreting the WTO tech transfer rules. So there are ways to get at this. The president's just fighting an old war. GREENE: So could it be an old war, though, that has the goal of getting China to the negotiating table as you're saying needs to happen? I mean, do you see it as possible that these threats could be effective in sending a message to China being tough? You have to come to the negotiating table and really be honest and work some of these things out. HUBBARD: I think that's possible. Yes, I think when you heard Mr. Kudlow's remarks, for example, from the White House, I think they were very much in that flavor. The problem is the president seems to. . . GREENE: That's the president's economic adviser, we should say. Yeah. Larry Kudlow. HUBBARD: Yes, the president's economic advisor. The problem is the president seems to speak from a view that thinks that China is responsible for the U. S. trade deficit. Of course that comes from the gap between investment and savings. If we weren't running it with China, we'd run it with somebody else. So I worry that while it's possible we'll find that off-ramp, I'm not sure the administration quite knows where it is. GREENE: And how bad could this get if this goes on and the administration does not find an off-ramp? I mean, we're seeing markets that seem uneasy. We have soybean farmers in Iowa, among others, who are getting deeply concerned and already seeing prices change. I mean, how much pain could people be under? HUBBARD: Well, I think it can be significant pain but more than what you're saying. I mean, the Trump administration seems to be looking at the only response as being tariffs. China has shown in dealings with South Korea and Japan it's not simply a matter of tariffs. It's a matter how they treat foreign firms within their own country. For example, General Motors makes and sells a lot of cars in China. Could a company like that be a target? That to me is the real worry. I think the administration can find the off-ramp here. I'm just, again, concerned that the president figure out what the end game is before he starts. GREENE: You helped put in place steel tariffs under George W. Bush back in 2002. And there are some members of that administration who are talking about really regretting that, including President Bush's Chief of Staff Andy Card - saying he doesn't think it was smart policy anymore. He didn't expect it to cost jobs. Once the tit for tat starts, there are unintended consequences. He said all this to The Washington Post. Do you have some regrets and some lessons? HUBBARD: Well, actually, I was one of the only people that opposed the steel tariffs at the time. So it's good to hear my colleagues have come aboard. GREENE: (Laughter). HUBBARD: And I opposed them for all the reasons you just said. I told the president they would cost more jobs than he might save. To President Bush's credit, though, I think he was playing a long game. He was concerned about getting what's called trade promotion authority or so-called fast track, the ability to negotiate. And he felt that if he did the steel tariffs, he could get it. Now, that's a political calculus. I can't say whether it's right or wrong but very different than what you're seeing now. GREENE: Glenn Hubbard is the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. He was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. He is now the dean of Columbia University's business school.

The next day, you might be doing some potentially Nobel Prize-winning science. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Maybe I don't just need a different teaching job. Maybe I need a different career. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: We begin today on a straight, flat stretch of paved road lined by lush forest just north of the Florida Everglades. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK FIRING UP)MARTIN: That's where we met up with career truck driver Jeff Runions. JEFF RUNIONS: I've done everything from working on trailers, working on trucks, being an owner-operator, being a company driver, management. MARTIN: In his latest job, Runions has found himself in the middle of a fight for the future of the $700 billion trucking industry. Companies like Uber, Google, Daimler and Volvo are all racing to get their self-driving trucks out onto the road first. Runions works for a much smaller company, Starsky Robotics. RUNIONS: It's not the space race, but it's kind of a - you know, it's new technologies like when they went to the moon, right? And we're not going to the moon, but how many people would think a semi'd be driving itself? MARTIN: Instead of trying to beat their competition to developing fully autonomous vehicles, Starsky's strategy is to develop trucks that are autonomous only on the highway, and then let remote drivers in an office take the wheel when they hit city streets. It's all still in the testing phase. Runions is is a safety driver. He sits in the driver's seat of the cab, ready to take control if the truck gets into trouble. He also works alongside his company's programmers to test and tweak the truck's sensors and software. RUNIONS: I come up with some suggestions once in a while, and they do work. I'm not a engineer like these guys are, but sometimes they listen to me. So that means I'm part of the team, too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Runions got his start in the trucking industry nearly four decades ago. RUNIONS: I've been trucking since 1979. We were like the Cowboys in the old days, but we're doing our own thing. We own our own trucks and trying to make our own lives the way it is. MARTIN: He enjoyed the freedom that came with owning his own truck and the camaraderie he found with the fellow truckers he met crisscrossing the country. RUNIONS: We're truckers, and we're young, and we're having a good time. MARTIN: But he says that as the years dragged on, life on the road began to lose its luster. He says the lifestyle was unhealthy and the schedule became grueling. RUNIONS: You just get tired of the same stuff all the time and sleeping in the truck. You're in this little box all the time. OK, you can't really go anywhere. I mean, you - the only thing you've got to do is go to sleep and get up and do it again. MARTIN: And he says that after fuel prices surged in the early-2000s, going it alone didn't make financial sense anymore. So he sold his truck and took a job with a commercial trucking company, but quickly found out that wasn't much better. RUNIONS: A normal driver that works for a company - they've got to stay out three weeks at a time, and they give them two days off when they get home. As soon as they get home, after the two days, they've got to go right back out for 21 more days. That ain't much of a life. Then you're staying in that box again. MARTIN: Runions did eventually work his way up to management, but he says despite better pay, the hours and stress were even worse. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RUNIONS: I was always in there at 3 o'clock in the morning till 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I was wore out. So I figured it's time to try something that was different, and you can get no more different than this. MARTIN: Runions came across an online ad for a technology company in search of experienced truck drivers. He says that at first, he wasn't sure about getting behind the wheel of a self-driving truck, but he says he's come to enjoy the work and the hours. RUNIONS: I'm home when I need to be. I'm a happy person now. I get to dress how I want to dress. I'm not using - I don't wear any uniform. MARTIN: Runions says that since he began as a test driver in 2017, he's heard pushback from people who doubt the safety of autonomous vehicles. RUNIONS: People are scared of this technology because they don't understand exactly what's going on with it. They think that the trucks are going to be out there with nobody in them, and they're going to be unsafe. I feel like I'm helping make this truck right, and we want to make sure it's safe as it can be being on the highway. MARTIN: He's also heard from some fellow truckers who fear that the new technology will put them out of a job, but he points out the country has tens of thousands of open trucking jobs that the industry can't even keep up with, and the growing need for remote drivers means there will be plenty of work down the road. Plus, he says, allowing drivers to work remotely will ultimately make their lives easier. RUNIONS: If you can get where you can make a 40-hour hourly job like a regular person and be home with your family, can't ask for more than that. That's like a regular life. A lot of drivers don't have that. MARTIN: That's career truck driver Jeff Runions He's now a test driver for Starsky Robotics, an autonomous trucking startup.

Bloomberg's Kim Bhasin says the jean-making industry has been just as distressed as the ripped denim of the same name. The reason - elastic knit pants, yoga pants, athleisure wear, leggings, whatever you want to call them. The U. S. Census Bureau says that last year for the first time ever, imports of elastic knit pants surpassed denim - distress, indeed. And Kim Bhasin reports that denim makers, big brands like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, are mounting a comeback. He joins us from our bureau in New York. Welcome to the show. KIM BHASIN: Glad to be here. CORNISH: So how far does this fight go back now? BHASIN: This fight goes back to about 2011, 2012. Back then, Lululemon was coming up real hard selling leggings and yoga pants to everyone. People were really wanting this kind of comfortable feeling on their legs instead of thick denim. And they would wear in the gym and slowly that trickled out of the gym and onto the streets. CORNISH: Give us some context in terms of the numbers because I don't think of the American denim industry as being one that is in trouble. But what do you see when you look at the data? BHASIN: Levi's is the most iconic brand in denim. And it's kind of a bellwether for the industry. And it had troubles in the mid-2010s. So that's 2012, '13, '14, '15. It was a slowdown. And finally, in 2017, it posted an 8 percent increase in revenue. And that was its strongest growth since 2011. CORNISH: So you know that not only are jeans being challenged because they're not as comfortable but the actual styles of blue jeans haven't really evolved over the last 10 years. Is that true? BHASIN: Skinny jeans have remained the dominant style of denim for more than a decade now. Little has changed on the silhouette front. And this is going all the way back to the, like, early 2000s back when the Britney Spears boot cut trend from back then - it's been skinny ever since. CORNISH: So what's going on in terms of innovation? I mean, where it exists, are there any wins for the denim world? BHASIN: The denim world was a little slow to react. In 2012 and '13, they started to finally realize, oh, we have to do something here. We just can't keep selling the same denim that we've sold forever. And Levi's in particular changed the way their women's jeans work. They added a lot of stretch. They added moisture-wicking properties to their jeans. They just wanted more function because that's what people demanded. CORNISH: So are you convinced the denim revival's really going to happen? BHASIN: I'm convinced that it's already happening. The rise of leggings has earned that style a place in every woman's closet. Now, that doesn't mean denim can't reclaim some of that closet space. CORNISH: Are you sure about that though? I mean, is athleisure a trend we could be seeing the end of at some point? BHASIN: I think athleisure at this point, since it's been around for five or six years now and still now increasing, it seems here to stay. And also, comfort just makes sense. CORNISH: I don't know, friend. I still wear high heels, so we do irrational things sometimes. BHASIN: Oh, yeah, of course. People are trying to fix that too. (LAUGHTER)BHASIN: It hasn't really worked yet. CORNISH: Kim Bhasin covers fashion for Bloomberg. His latest piece is titled \"Blue Jeans Are Mounting A Comeback. \" Thank you for speaking with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. BHASIN: Thanks so much. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Why write about the business of denim if you can't throw in a few puns? Bloomberg's Kim Bhasin says the jean-making industry has been just as distressed as the ripped denim of the same name. The reason - elastic knit pants, yoga pants, athleisure wear, leggings, whatever you want to call them. The U. S. Census Bureau says that last year for the first time ever, imports of elastic knit pants surpassed denim - distress, indeed. And Kim Bhasin reports that denim makers, big brands like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, are mounting a comeback. He joins us from our bureau in New York. Welcome to the show. KIM BHASIN: Glad to be here. CORNISH: So how far does this fight go back now? BHASIN: This fight goes back to about 2011, 2012. Back then, Lululemon was coming up real hard selling leggings and yoga pants to everyone. People were really wanting this kind of comfortable feeling on their legs instead of thick denim. And they would wear in the gym and slowly that trickled out of the gym and onto the streets. CORNISH: Give us some context in terms of the numbers because I don't think of the American denim industry as being one that is in trouble. But what do you see when you look at the data? BHASIN: Levi's is the most iconic brand in denim. And it's kind of a bellwether for the industry. And it had troubles in the mid-2010s. So that's 2012, '13, '14, '15. It was a slowdown. And finally, in 2017, it posted an 8 percent increase in revenue. And that was its strongest growth since 2011. CORNISH: So you know that not only are jeans being challenged because they're not as comfortable but the actual styles of blue jeans haven't really evolved over the last 10 years. Is that true? BHASIN: Skinny jeans have remained the dominant style of denim for more than a decade now. Little has changed on the silhouette front. And this is going all the way back to the, like, early 2000s back when the Britney Spears boot cut trend from back then - it's been skinny ever since. CORNISH: So what's going on in terms of innovation? I mean, where it exists, are there any wins for the denim world? BHASIN: The denim world was a little slow to react. In 2012 and '13, they started to finally realize, oh, we have to do something here. We just can't keep selling the same denim that we've sold forever. And Levi's in particular changed the way their women's jeans work. They added a lot of stretch. They added moisture-wicking properties to their jeans. They just wanted more function because that's what people demanded. CORNISH: So are you convinced the denim revival's really going to happen? BHASIN: I'm convinced that it's already happening. The rise of leggings has earned that style a place in every woman's closet. Now, that doesn't mean denim can't reclaim some of that closet space. CORNISH: Are you sure about that though? I mean, is athleisure a trend we could be seeing the end of at some point? BHASIN: I think athleisure at this point, since it's been around for five or six years now and still now increasing, it seems here to stay. And also, comfort just makes sense. CORNISH: I don't know, friend. I still wear high heels, so we do irrational things sometimes. BHASIN: Oh, yeah, of course. People are trying to fix that too. (LAUGHTER) BHASIN: It hasn't really worked yet. CORNISH: Kim Bhasin covers fashion for Bloomberg.

FORDHAM: He was deported in 2003 but went back in 2005, joining a stream of villagers who had been finding work for a few years in a meatpacking plant in the town of Postville, Iowa. He took three of his sons along with him, and says several hundred men and some women from this village and others nearby worked in the plant. And they sent portions of their wages back to relatives in the village. It's hard to overstate how much their remittances changed life here.

FORDHAM: Guatemala had lived through half a century of civil war. Rural areas like this were isolated, often hungry, with kids at least as likely to be working as in school. SANTOS: (Through interpreter) But thanks to the United States, those who knew how to think and manage their money began to build houses and vegetable plots. FORDHAM: Like many families, the remittances meant her kids got through high school, and they built a house. The village prospered, if modestly. Then one day in 2008, a shock. SANTOS: (Through interpreter) We were coming down from the mountain from our vegetable plot, and we met a woman, and she said to us, look, have you heard what happened? And I said, no. And she said, they caught our children. FORDHAM: Immigration and Customs Enforcement swooped on the plant in the town of Postville, Iowa, in a raid that would become notorious. They arrested nearly 400 undocumented workers. Most were deported, and a local leader says about 160 came back to this village where about 550 families live. Everyone here remembers that time. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)FORDHAM: I take a walk up the volcano with another villager, Juan Gonzales, who tells me about it. JUAN GONZALES: When they living over there, everything was great in this community. But when they deported, oh, this was so crazy in this community - no more money, any worker to do anything. Like, everything is coming down - you know? - breaks - you know? - for this community. FORDHAM: Some people have mortgaged their houses to pay for the journey, so they became homeless. Newly impoverished neighbors found it hard to help them. All the progress - the houses, the schooling, the land they've bought to grow food - suddenly looked very fragile.

I'm Terry Gross. Today, a lot of people throughout the West are angry that the good life is being stolen from them, writes my guest Robert Kuttner. He says, quote, \"they're not quite sure whom to be angry at - immigrants, corporations, the government, politically correct liberals, the rich, the poor. The anger is unfocused but is increasingly articulated by a neo-fascist right,\" unquote. Kuttner sees a connection between the rise of right-wing populism and the fall of a social contract that helped broad groups of people in Western democracies. He thinks a fundamental driver of this discontent is globalized capitalism. Kuttner's new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" We're going to talk about his book and about the threat of a trade war with China. Kuttner is co-founder and co-editor of the publication The American Prospect where he also writes a column. And he's a professor of public policy at Brandeis University. Robert Kuttner, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So it's kind of interesting. The right and the left seem to maybe agree on one thing. They oppose globalism. Not everyone on the right, not everyone on the left, but there is a commonality there. Do they oppose it for the same reasons? ROBERT KUTTNER: No, they oppose it for very different reasons. The progressive critique of globalization is very simple. It is a critique of the use of a certain kind of globalization to dismantle what used to be a manage form of capitalism that delivered broad prosperity. The democratic nation-state after World War II was able to regulate markets in the broad public interest so that ordinary people would have economic security and economic prosperity. Beginning in the '70s and '80s, trade deals were used to undermine the ability of governments to regulate banks. They were used to put cheap labor that had no labor standards into competition with labor in the United States and in Europe that benefited from protections. And so globalization was used to return to a more primitive version of raw capitalism. That's the progressive critique. GROSS: But can I just interrupt there. KUTTNER: Yes. GROSS: So you mean, for instance, outsourcing - that corporations could either move to a place where labor was cheaper, where there were no unions. Or they could just, like, outsource part of their operation to those other markets where labor was cheaper. And that undermined workers, like, for instance. . . KUTTNER: Yes. GROSS: . . . In the United States. Is that what you're saying? KUTTNER: Well, it's. . . GROSS: Is that part of what you're saying? (Laughter) Yeah. KUTTNER: Yeah. It's part of what I'm saying. I think the other really important part has to do with banks - that if you look at what caused the 2008 financial collapse, it was the completely promiscuous deregulation of finance. And globalization played a very major part in that because if a bank operates in New York, and London or Geneva has fewer regulations - and you deregulate global banking - well, the bank can either move to London, or it can move certain products to London, or it can threaten to move to London. And all of that undermines the ability of the government to regulate finance. So. . . GROSS: OK, so that's the left critique, right? KUTTNER: Yep. GROSS: What's the right-wing critique? KUTTNER: The right-wing critique is more crudely nationalistic. Immigrants are flooding our borders, and we don't like them. And the globalists - the people who are promoting globalization - are the same people who are promoting transgender use of bathrooms. And they're the same people who are going to take away your guns. And they're the same people who disrespect your religion. And so it's a broad critique of an elite in which a lot of ordinary people have lost confidence. GROSS: So I think a great illustration of this clash between the left and the right critique of globalism is when Steve Bannon contacted you and suggested that you interview him, which you did. What did he think you and he would have in common in your view of globalism? KUTTNER: He had read a column I had written the day before on China. GROSS: This was in August, by the way. KUTTNER: Yes, last August. So Bannon had read a column I'd written on China which argued that even Trump, for all of his nationalism, was being very naive about China. And this was the story that Bannon had been trying to sell to Trump. And so he thought he saw a soul mate. Now, you have to take all of this with a grain of salt because Bannon has a titanic ego. And he's looking for allies all over the political spectrum. But be that as it may, he thought he saw an ally in me. And I guess China is the one point where there is a little bit more convergence than there is in any other area in that Bannon and progressives both feel that the American economy is being taken to the cleaners by China. And the progressive critique goes something like this. In the '80s and '90s when China was a lot weaker and the West had a lot more leverage over China, there was a colossal amount of wishful thinking that went something like this. Inevitably, if we let China into the global economy, they will become more like us. They are more likely to evolve into a democracy. They are more likely to evolve into something like liberal capitalism. And therefore, let's just set a good example and let them in with very few conditions. Well, of course, that didn't happen. China has become more of a dictatorship, less of a democracy - fewer rights. And it's practicing the same kind of state capitalism that it always did, but it's a lot more powerful. So on that point, the Bannon kind of critique and the Bob Kuttner or liberal-Democrat critique converge. GROSS: Can you explain China's trade practices that are considered - in the West - to be unfair? KUTTNER: China has a whole development strategy that works very well for China. First thing it does is it subsidizes the creation of competitiveness in industry after industry after industry. The industries are either state-owned, or they're assisted by the state, or the state is a partner. And the banking system is the same. Well, obviously, if Chinese steel is heavily subsidized and American steel is not heavily subsidized, that's something other than free trade. That's not a level playing field. And what I find amusing but also appalling is the critique that says if you oppose the other guy's protectionism, that makes you a protectionist. So the first thing China does is that it subsidizes production. The second thing it does is it either coerces the transfer of technology, or it steals the technology. And one of the few times that Barack Obama got tough on this - he had a top-level meeting with Chinese leadership and said you got to cut this out. And China was using the techniques of espionage not just to spy on the United States - countries do this militarily - but he was - China was using techniques of espionage to steal trade secrets. And this was damped down somewhat after that high-level meeting. The third thing China does is it puts up barriers to imports of products from the West that would otherwise be competitive because it wants to shelter its own industry. Or it will say to Boeing or GE or Intel, you can come into our market but on our terms. You can only produce for export, not for domestic consumption. We want to leave that to our burgeoning domestic Chinese companies. And furthermore, you have to share trade secrets with a Chinese partner that we're going to give you, which a few years from now is going to take your technology and compete you out of business. Now, none of that is anything like a free market. And people of the Clinton era very wishfully thought that if we would just set a good example and let China in, they would evolve into a free market. Well, this has not happened. GROSS: So there's also the Made in China 2025 campaign. What is that? KUTTNER: Well, that's an effort to have Chinese industry be even more dominant. And there's one interesting statistic here. China invests almost half of its GDP. A typical country invests maybe 15 percent of its GDP. So China is on a wartime footing. The only thing comparable in the West was World War II where the United States invested a huge percentage of its GDP in a war buildup, but China is treating this like a war. And to that extent, Bannon's remarks are not hyperbole. Now, we don't want to go to war with China. We don't even want to have a trade war with China. But we do want to have a very serious diplomatic offensive where instead of alienating Western Europe by randomly throwing tariffs at their steel and their aluminum, we want to work with Western Europe. And hopefully if a Democratic president gets elected in 2020, a Democratic president will pursue a more competent measured version of a China policy than Trump does via tweets and tariffs. GROSS: So China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. How has China's presence in the organization affected their economy and our economy? KUTTNER: By becoming a member of the World Trade Organization, China was able to export to the West much more freely, and China gets to have it both ways. On the one hand, it's treated as a developing country for purposes of being allowed to use certain kinds of subsidies, which would be illegal for developed countries. But on the other hand, it's treated as a developed country in that it has the full privileges of WTO membership. At the time, I remember writing that China should have been given a provisional candidate status subject to good behavior. And I also need to say that there were lots of conflicts of interest. Robert Rubin, who was Clinton's chief adviser on economics, really wanted China in the World Trade Organization subject to Wall Street getting cut in on some of these deals. And Rubin's affiliations, of course, were with Goldman and with Citigroup. And he epitomized the revolving door. He came from one, he went back to the other. And so China was given a free pass not just because of ideological blinders or a geopolitical naivete but because of a lot of powerful people in the United States who made a lot of money off of this. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kuttner. He's an economics journalist. He co-founded, co-edits and is a columnist for The American Prospect, and he's a professor of public policy at Brandeis. His new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kuttner. His new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" So we've been talking about how China has established an unfair playing field economically. So then the question is, what kind of leverage do we have against them? The leverage that President Trump is relying on right now is tariffs. He's proposing $150 billion of tariffs. How do tariffs address the problem of an unlevel playing field? KUTTNER: Well, they make it more expensive to purchase a product made in the country on which you are levying a tariff. So if a car costs $25,000 and you add a 100 percent tariff, the car suddenly costs $50,000 and consumers buy fewer units of that car. It's a blunt instrument. It's fine to use the threat of tariffs in the context of renegotiating the entire arrangement by which China gets to interact with the rest of the world. But you've been hearing the outcry from American farmers. You've been hearing the outcry from Fortune 500 executives. A tariff war for its own sake is a loser's game because you end up hurting each other to no good effect, and it ends up in a stalemate. So I hate to make predictions, but my prediction is that both sides are going to back down and agree to talk, kick the can down the road and not much will change relative to the larger problem of China's entire economic strategy being predatory vis-a-vis the rest of the world. GROSS: One of the things China has been doing is buying Western companies. Can you give us an example of China doing that? KUTTNER: Until very recently, Chinese companies and, for that matter, the Chinese government were allowed to buy up anything they wanted to buy up unless there was a very narrowly defined national security reason to keep them from buying up a very sensitive technology. So for example, China is rapidly on track to make itself among the world's most competitive auto industries, including advanced electric vehicles. There's a Chinese company called Geely - G-E-E-L-Y - that has just been on an acquisition binge. It bought Volvo. It bought the iconic London black taxis, and it's electrifying a lot of them. And it is doing this all over the world. And until very recently, the United States essentially said, look, we're going to - even though we know that China is not an ordinary country because the state is so heavily involved in its whole economic system, we're going to pretend that it's just another country. And if a Chinese corporation wants to buy a Western corporation - no big deal. Lately, the Trump administration has taken a broader view of what strategic technologies it wants to keep out of China's hands for industrial reasons as well as for narrowly militarily reasons. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's long overdue because this is not an ordinary country. This is a country where the state is behind nominally private players. GROSS: One of the things that China can do that democracies can't is move very quickly. . . KUTTNER: Yes. GROSS: . . . On economic policy because it's an autocracy. And it's even more of one now because President Xi has declared that he can be president for as long as he wants. KUTTNER: Right. GROSS: So what kind of advantages does that give China? KUTTNER: It gives China a huge advantages for the reason you state. When the United States tries to change policy, Congress gets involved, both houses of Congress get involved, interest groups get to weigh in. And Xi just pronounces something and policy changes, so it makes it all the more imperative that we have a coherent strategy vis-a-vis China and one that works with our allies instead of alienating allies. GROSS: In your book, you make connections between global capitalism and what's happening politically in countries in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe and in the United States. And you see a connection between the rise of global capitalism and the rise of the far-right. What is the connection that you see? And we're talking about the rise of the far-right, as I said, in Eastern Europe, Europe and, you say, in the United States. KUTTNER: I think you have to go back to what happened after World War II, which was a quite remarkable moment in history when laissez faire capitalism, which brought us the Great Depression, had obviously failed. And the capitalism that was prevalent in the 1920s did not just produce the Great Depression, it produced Hitler because unemployment rates were so high and austerity policies were so perverse that people turned to fascists because they were desperate. It's very hard for democracies to survive 20 and 30 percent unemployment. So the people after World War II who founded the post-war system said, we are never going to let this happen again. And so they built a global system that was compatible with a system of managed capitalism domestically so that prosperity would be broadly distributed. Now, globalization, beginning in the '70s and the '80s, overturned that system to the point where economic insecurity increased to the point where ordinary people lost confidence in elites to the point where, in country after country after country, the far-right fill that vacuum very much the way it did in the 1920s. GROSS: Part of the goal of international trade cooperation after World War II is to try to prevent the rise of fascism again and to prevent another world war through economic cooperation. KUTTNER: Yes, but it was a form of economic cooperation and a form of - a restarting of normal commerce that was consistent with governments managing capitalism in a broad public interest. And so in the entire West, you had policies that tightly regulated banks. You had policies that protected and empowered labor. You had policies of significant public investment. And it was a very nice balance between the market part of the system and the Democratic part of the system, and it worked. It produced high rates of growth, and it produced very broadly diffused prosperity. And there was no far-right in that era because ordinary people felt that they were getting a fair deal. And when that system was blown up in the '70s and '80s in favor of a reversion to unregulated laissez faire capitalism more reminiscent of the pre-1929 period, people lost confidence in elites. And I'm sorry to say that the elites who brought us this brand of globalization were Democrats just as much as they were Republicans. This was a bipartisan consensus that if we just move to a more globalized market system, everybody will be better off. Well, in fact, everybody was not better off. The top 1 or 2 percent were significantly better off. The economy is twice as rich on average, but ordinary people feel both very insecure and they feel disrespected. And furthermore, to have this insecurity for ordinary working people at a time when you were trying to be very culturally sensitive to new groups who are asking to be let in, that's just to pour oil on the flames. GROSS: My guest is Robert Kuttner, author of the new book \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" We'll talk more after a break. Book critic Maureen Corrigan will review Meg Wolitzer's new novel about two women who represent two generations of feminists. And jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will have a remembrance of pianist and composer Cecil Taylor, who died last week. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GUILLERMO KLEIN'S \"CHILD'S PLAY\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Robert Kuttner, author of the new book \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" He's the co-founder and co-editor of The American Prospect, where he also writes a column. And he's a professor of public policy at Brandeis University. When we left off, we were talking about the connection he sees between global capitalism and the rise of the far-right in Europe and the U. S. So one thing that Europe, Eastern Europe and the U. S. seems to have in common when it comes to the far-right is a backlash against refugees. And that is being used politically by leaders on the right to activate their base. Do you see that as connected to the theme of your book, which is how the global economy has worked against democracy in some places? KUTTNER: Yes, I do. And I think in both Europe and in the United States, politically centrist leaders who were trying to be enlightened made a huge blunder. If you want to open your doors generously to refugees, as some leaders in Western Europe did, you can't at the same time ignore the plight of locals who are suffering the effects of 10 percent unemployment compounded by austerity policies. If you do that, you get Brexit, or you get the Alternative fur Deutschland, or you get Orban. You get regular people rebelling against the fact that their own economic life is going down the drain, and here we are welcoming all these foreigners. And I think the counterpart in the United States was the fact that Hillary Clinton, on the one hand, was taking large speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and identifying herself with the kind of globalism that benefits mostly elites and at the same time was really trying to be enlightened on this subject of immigrants, on the subject of transgender people. I applaud that. But I think if you want to get elected, you can't ignore the plight of ordinary working people at the same time you're asking the voters to open their hearts to immigrants and to other claimants for social justice. It's asking too much of people whose living standards have gone down the drain to expect them to be liberal on social issues. And back in the period when things were going well economically, that was the year in which the broad middle of the United States was prepared to embrace civil rights. But the two things go together. You can't take away people's livelihoods at the same time that you're demanding that they be open-hearted, or it backfires and you end up electing people like Donald Trump. GROSS: So let me move on to a different chapter here. The Congressional Budget Office reported this week that the national debt is expected to reach more than $33 trillion by 2028. I don't know if you know the answer to this, but how much of that estimate is because of the recent tax cuts? KUTTNER: Well, the reason tax cuts are $1. 5 trillion over 10 years, supposedly some of that will be made up by increased economic growth, although there's no evidence for that. The Republicans have played this game going back to Ronald Reagan. You enact a tax cut. You claim that the benefits will be so great that they will pay for the cost of the tax cut. That's known as supply-side economics. And when that turns out not to be true, you discover the peril of the deficit. And then you cut a whole bunch of domestic programs to try and fill in some of the cost of that deficit and rising debt. So that was done under Reagan, was done under Bush one, under Bush two. And now the same script is being repeated under Trump. And the obvious answer is to repeal much of the tax cut if we're really concerned about deficits and debts. GROSS: The House is going to vote on Thursday on a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets. I realize that probably won't become a constitutional amendment, but is it the same people who were behind the tax cuts that now want to ask for a balanced budget amendment? KUTTNER: Of course. And it's complete inconsistency, some might say hypocrisy that one week you increase the amount that needs to be borrowed - which is to say the national debt - by $1. 5 trillion, and then a few weeks later, you're horrified that, oh, my goodness, that's actually going to increase the deficit. And we better have a balanced budget amendment. And, of course, if you ever had a balanced budget requirement, you would never have been able to have that tax cut. I think the sponsors of the tax cut are vulnerable because voters are going to make the connection between the tax cut and the fact that Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, other popular social programs are now going to be put on the chopping block in order to pay for the tax cut. GROSS: So what does it mean to have a huge deficit? And do economists think that there's a kind of dividing line between like an OK deficit and a really problematic deficit? KUTTNER: Yes, but economists disagree on where that dividing line is. GROSS: Of course (laughter) yeah. KUTTNER: So after World War II, the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the very important concept here, how big is the debt in relationship to the economy? It was 120-something percent, more than one year's total production. And yet, after the war, because the economy was growing at a nice rate, because we had a moderate rate of inflation, the ratio of debt to GDP by the time Jimmy Carter was president came down to about 25 percent. Now that's a very low rate. I think, for the most part, the concern among economists is whether that ratio is growing or not. And if the ratio is below about a hundred percent and interest rates are not all that high, it's just not a big deal. The more important question is what you are spending the deficit on. If you're spending the deficit to invest in infrastructure or invest in green transition or invest in things that are going to make the country more productive, it's a defensible use of debt. In the same way that if you borrow money to buy a house, it's a defensible use of borrowing money as opposed to just going on a credit card binge. So the amount of debt is important, and the use of debt is important. Right now, we are increasing the debt in order to pay for tax cuts which are not going to have any significant economic benefit. And we're going to be pushing the total debt ratio to above a hundred percent of GDP, which is the area - the range that most economists start to find alarming. GROSS: So I want to get back to the conversation you had with Steve Bannon in mid-August of 2017, when he contacted you because he thought that you and he would share some kind of common base about globalism. But he kind of went on to discuss other things with you that made news. So would you give us a sense, like, experientially of what that conversation was like? First of all, tell us some of the more surprising things he said to you. And I'll preface this by saying he never said to you that it was off the record, so you assumed it was on the record and just published whatever you want to from the interview. KUTTNER: Well, I recorded the interview. And I realized about 10 minutes in that I was kind of onto the scoop of my life because Bannon had made a very surprising rookie error and had never bothered to put it off the record. And that meant, by definition, by default, it was on the record. So he started out treating me as a soul mate on the subject of China. We both agreed that America's China policy was folly. And he was trying to persuade Trump of that fact and get Trump to take a much harder line on China. But realizing that I had Steve Bannon on the phone, you know, I started asking him about the alt-right. I started asking him why a tougher line on China had to be linked to white nationalism. And he said some very incautious things about Trump's own base. He said some very incautious things about other Trump officials. As - he talked to me as if he were speaking with an old chum who was a co-conspirator rather than speaking to a journalist on the record. And so it reinforced my view of Bannon as somebody who is very narcissistic, a little bit unhinged. GROSS: When you interviewed Bannon, he said to you ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we got to help crush it. These guys are a collection of clowns. When you published what I just quoted, do you know what impact that had on Bannon? KUTTNER: Yes. About a half-hour after that piece went live on The American Prospect website, I got a very angry call from Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying, I have Mr. Bannon here and he's extremely upset. And I said, I'm not surprised. And he said he didn't think we were on the record. And I said, well, I recorded it, and he never said that. He should have said that. And that was the end of the call. And within 12 hours, Bannon had completely changed his story and was saying that yes, he had deliberately put that on the record because he wanted to have that conversation and to get these views out. Now, this was the week of Charlottesville. And this was the week that Bannon was fired a day after that interview ran. So it gives you a little bit of insight into the braggadocio, the bravado, the recklessness and also the kind of weird genius that is Steve Bannon. And so now he's going around the world talking to neo-fascist parties, far-right parties, and egging them on - telling them they have to stay the course on their ultranationalism. So if he couldn't find a client at home, maybe he can find some clients in Europe. GROSS: Well, Robert Kuttner, thank you so much for talking with us. KUTTNER: It's always a pleasure, Terry. Thanks for having me. GROSS: Robert Kuttner's new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" After we take a short break, Maureen Corrigan will review Meg Wolitzer's new novel about a young feminist who meets a feminist icon and confronts their generational differences. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF PAQUITO D'RIVERA'S \"CONTRADANZA\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today, a lot of people throughout the West are angry that the good life is being stolen from them, writes my guest Robert Kuttner. He says, quote, \"they're not quite sure whom to be angry at - immigrants, corporations, the government, politically correct liberals, the rich, the poor. The anger is unfocused but is increasingly articulated by a neo-fascist right,\" unquote. Kuttner sees a connection between the rise of right-wing populism and the fall of a social contract that helped broad groups of people in Western democracies. He thinks a fundamental driver of this discontent is globalized capitalism. Kuttner's new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" We're going to talk about his book and about the threat of a trade war with China. Kuttner is co-founder and co-editor of the publication The American Prospect where he also writes a column. And he's a professor of public policy at Brandeis University. Robert Kuttner, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So it's kind of interesting. The right and the left seem to maybe agree on one thing. They oppose globalism. Not everyone on the right, not everyone on the left, but there is a commonality there. Do they oppose it for the same reasons? ROBERT KUTTNER: No, they oppose it for very different reasons. The progressive critique of globalization is very simple. It is a critique of the use of a certain kind of globalization to dismantle what used to be a manage form of capitalism that delivered broad prosperity. The democratic nation-state after World War II was able to regulate markets in the broad public interest so that ordinary people would have economic security and economic prosperity. Beginning in the '70s and '80s, trade deals were used to undermine the ability of governments to regulate banks. They were used to put cheap labor that had no labor standards into competition with labor in the United States and in Europe that benefited from protections. And so globalization was used to return to a more primitive version of raw capitalism. That's the progressive critique. GROSS: But can I just interrupt there. KUTTNER: Yes. GROSS: So you mean, for instance, outsourcing - that corporations could either move to a place where labor was cheaper, where there were no unions. Or they could just, like, outsource part of their operation to those other markets where labor was cheaper. And that undermined workers, like, for instance. . . KUTTNER: Yes. GROSS: . . . In the United States. Is that what you're saying? KUTTNER: Well, it's. . . GROSS: Is that part of what you're saying? (Laughter) Yeah. KUTTNER: Yeah. It's part of what I'm saying. I think the other really important part has to do with banks - that if you look at what caused the 2008 financial collapse, it was the completely promiscuous deregulation of finance. And globalization played a very major part in that because if a bank operates in New York, and London or Geneva has fewer regulations - and you deregulate global banking - well, the bank can either move to London, or it can move certain products to London, or it can threaten to move to London. And all of that undermines the ability of the government to regulate finance. So. . . GROSS: OK, so that's the left critique, right? KUTTNER: Yep. GROSS: What's the right-wing critique? KUTTNER: The right-wing critique is more crudely nationalistic. Immigrants are flooding our borders, and we don't like them. And the globalists - the people who are promoting globalization - are the same people who are promoting transgender use of bathrooms. And they're the same people who are going to take away your guns. And they're the same people who disrespect your religion. And so it's a broad critique of an elite in which a lot of ordinary people have lost confidence. GROSS: So I think a great illustration of this clash between the left and the right critique of globalism is when Steve Bannon contacted you and suggested that you interview him, which you did. What did he think you and he would have in common in your view of globalism? KUTTNER: He had read a column I had written the day before on China. GROSS: This was in August, by the way. KUTTNER: Yes, last August. So Bannon had read a column I'd written on China which argued that even Trump, for all of his nationalism, was being very naive about China. And this was the story that Bannon had been trying to sell to Trump. And so he thought he saw a soul mate. Now, you have to take all of this with a grain of salt because Bannon has a titanic ego. And he's looking for allies all over the political spectrum. But be that as it may, he thought he saw an ally in me. And I guess China is the one point where there is a little bit more convergence than there is in any other area in that Bannon and progressives both feel that the American economy is being taken to the cleaners by China. And the progressive critique goes something like this. In the '80s and '90s when China was a lot weaker and the West had a lot more leverage over China, there was a colossal amount of wishful thinking that went something like this. Inevitably, if we let China into the global economy, they will become more like us. They are more likely to evolve into a democracy. They are more likely to evolve into something like liberal capitalism. And therefore, let's just set a good example and let them in with very few conditions. Well, of course, that didn't happen. China has become more of a dictatorship, less of a democracy - fewer rights. And it's practicing the same kind of state capitalism that it always did, but it's a lot more powerful. So on that point, the Bannon kind of critique and the Bob Kuttner or liberal-Democrat critique converge. GROSS: Can you explain China's trade practices that are considered - in the West - to be unfair? KUTTNER: China has a whole development strategy that works very well for China. First thing it does is it subsidizes the creation of competitiveness in industry after industry after industry. The industries are either state-owned, or they're assisted by the state, or the state is a partner. And the banking system is the same. Well, obviously, if Chinese steel is heavily subsidized and American steel is not heavily subsidized, that's something other than free trade. That's not a level playing field. And what I find amusing but also appalling is the critique that says if you oppose the other guy's protectionism, that makes you a protectionist. So the first thing China does is that it subsidizes production. The second thing it does is it either coerces the transfer of technology, or it steals the technology. And one of the few times that Barack Obama got tough on this - he had a top-level meeting with Chinese leadership and said you got to cut this out. And China was using the techniques of espionage not just to spy on the United States - countries do this militarily - but he was - China was using techniques of espionage to steal trade secrets. And this was damped down somewhat after that high-level meeting. The third thing China does is it puts up barriers to imports of products from the West that would otherwise be competitive because it wants to shelter its own industry. Or it will say to Boeing or GE or Intel, you can come into our market but on our terms. You can only produce for export, not for domestic consumption. We want to leave that to our burgeoning domestic Chinese companies. And furthermore, you have to share trade secrets with a Chinese partner that we're going to give you, which a few years from now is going to take your technology and compete you out of business. Now, none of that is anything like a free market. And people of the Clinton era very wishfully thought that if we would just set a good example and let China in, they would evolve into a free market. Well, this has not happened. GROSS: So there's also the Made in China 2025 campaign. What is that? KUTTNER: Well, that's an effort to have Chinese industry be even more dominant. And there's one interesting statistic here. China invests almost half of its GDP. A typical country invests maybe 15 percent of its GDP. So China is on a wartime footing. The only thing comparable in the West was World War II where the United States invested a huge percentage of its GDP in a war buildup, but China is treating this like a war. And to that extent, Bannon's remarks are not hyperbole. Now, we don't want to go to war with China. We don't even want to have a trade war with China. But we do want to have a very serious diplomatic offensive where instead of alienating Western Europe by randomly throwing tariffs at their steel and their aluminum, we want to work with Western Europe. And hopefully if a Democratic president gets elected in 2020, a Democratic president will pursue a more competent measured version of a China policy than Trump does via tweets and tariffs. GROSS: So China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. How has China's presence in the organization affected their economy and our economy? KUTTNER: By becoming a member of the World Trade Organization, China was able to export to the West much more freely, and China gets to have it both ways. On the one hand, it's treated as a developing country for purposes of being allowed to use certain kinds of subsidies, which would be illegal for developed countries. But on the other hand, it's treated as a developed country in that it has the full privileges of WTO membership. At the time, I remember writing that China should have been given a provisional candidate status subject to good behavior. And I also need to say that there were lots of conflicts of interest. Robert Rubin, who was Clinton's chief adviser on economics, really wanted China in the World Trade Organization subject to Wall Street getting cut in on some of these deals. And Rubin's affiliations, of course, were with Goldman and with Citigroup. And he epitomized the revolving door. He came from one, he went back to the other. And so China was given a free pass not just because of ideological blinders or a geopolitical naivete but because of a lot of powerful people in the United States who made a lot of money off of this. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kuttner. He's an economics journalist. He co-founded, co-edits and is a columnist for The American Prospect, and he's a professor of public policy at Brandeis. His new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kuttner. His new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" So we've been talking about how China has established an unfair playing field economically. So then the question is, what kind of leverage do we have against them? The leverage that President Trump is relying on right now is tariffs. He's proposing $150 billion of tariffs. How do tariffs address the problem of an unlevel playing field? KUTTNER: Well, they make it more expensive to purchase a product made in the country on which you are levying a tariff. So if a car costs $25,000 and you add a 100 percent tariff, the car suddenly costs $50,000 and consumers buy fewer units of that car. It's a blunt instrument. It's fine to use the threat of tariffs in the context of renegotiating the entire arrangement by which China gets to interact with the rest of the world. But you've been hearing the outcry from American farmers. You've been hearing the outcry from Fortune 500 executives. A tariff war for its own sake is a loser's game because you end up hurting each other to no good effect, and it ends up in a stalemate. So I hate to make predictions, but my prediction is that both sides are going to back down and agree to talk, kick the can down the road and not much will change relative to the larger problem of China's entire economic strategy being predatory vis-a-vis the rest of the world. GROSS: One of the things China has been doing is buying Western companies. Can you give us an example of China doing that? KUTTNER: Until very recently, Chinese companies and, for that matter, the Chinese government were allowed to buy up anything they wanted to buy up unless there was a very narrowly defined national security reason to keep them from buying up a very sensitive technology. So for example, China is rapidly on track to make itself among the world's most competitive auto industries, including advanced electric vehicles. There's a Chinese company called Geely - G-E-E-L-Y - that has just been on an acquisition binge. It bought Volvo. It bought the iconic London black taxis, and it's electrifying a lot of them. And it is doing this all over the world. And until very recently, the United States essentially said, look, we're going to - even though we know that China is not an ordinary country because the state is so heavily involved in its whole economic system, we're going to pretend that it's just another country. And if a Chinese corporation wants to buy a Western corporation - no big deal. Lately, the Trump administration has taken a broader view of what strategic technologies it wants to keep out of China's hands for industrial reasons as well as for narrowly militarily reasons. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's long overdue because this is not an ordinary country. This is a country where the state is behind nominally private players. GROSS: One of the things that China can do that democracies can't is move very quickly. . . KUTTNER: Yes. GROSS: . . . On economic policy because it's an autocracy. And it's even more of one now because President Xi has declared that he can be president for as long as he wants. KUTTNER: Right. GROSS: So what kind of advantages does that give China? KUTTNER: It gives China a huge advantages for the reason you state. When the United States tries to change policy, Congress gets involved, both houses of Congress get involved, interest groups get to weigh in. And Xi just pronounces something and policy changes, so it makes it all the more imperative that we have a coherent strategy vis-a-vis China and one that works with our allies instead of alienating allies. GROSS: In your book, you make connections between global capitalism and what's happening politically in countries in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe and in the United States. And you see a connection between the rise of global capitalism and the rise of the far-right. What is the connection that you see? And we're talking about the rise of the far-right, as I said, in Eastern Europe, Europe and, you say, in the United States. KUTTNER: I think you have to go back to what happened after World War II, which was a quite remarkable moment in history when laissez faire capitalism, which brought us the Great Depression, had obviously failed. And the capitalism that was prevalent in the 1920s did not just produce the Great Depression, it produced Hitler because unemployment rates were so high and austerity policies were so perverse that people turned to fascists because they were desperate. It's very hard for democracies to survive 20 and 30 percent unemployment. So the people after World War II who founded the post-war system said, we are never going to let this happen again. And so they built a global system that was compatible with a system of managed capitalism domestically so that prosperity would be broadly distributed. Now, globalization, beginning in the '70s and the '80s, overturned that system to the point where economic insecurity increased to the point where ordinary people lost confidence in elites to the point where, in country after country after country, the far-right fill that vacuum very much the way it did in the 1920s. GROSS: Part of the goal of international trade cooperation after World War II is to try to prevent the rise of fascism again and to prevent another world war through economic cooperation. KUTTNER: Yes, but it was a form of economic cooperation and a form of - a restarting of normal commerce that was consistent with governments managing capitalism in a broad public interest. And so in the entire West, you had policies that tightly regulated banks. You had policies that protected and empowered labor. You had policies of significant public investment. And it was a very nice balance between the market part of the system and the Democratic part of the system, and it worked. It produced high rates of growth, and it produced very broadly diffused prosperity. And there was no far-right in that era because ordinary people felt that they were getting a fair deal. And when that system was blown up in the '70s and '80s in favor of a reversion to unregulated laissez faire capitalism more reminiscent of the pre-1929 period, people lost confidence in elites. And I'm sorry to say that the elites who brought us this brand of globalization were Democrats just as much as they were Republicans. This was a bipartisan consensus that if we just move to a more globalized market system, everybody will be better off. Well, in fact, everybody was not better off. The top 1 or 2 percent were significantly better off. The economy is twice as rich on average, but ordinary people feel both very insecure and they feel disrespected. And furthermore, to have this insecurity for ordinary working people at a time when you were trying to be very culturally sensitive to new groups who are asking to be let in, that's just to pour oil on the flames. GROSS: My guest is Robert Kuttner, author of the new book \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" We'll talk more after a break.

I don't know if you know the answer to this, but how much of that estimate is because of the recent tax cuts? KUTTNER: Well, the reason tax cuts are $1. 5 trillion over 10 years, supposedly some of that will be made up by increased economic growth, although there's no evidence for that.

I think the sponsors of the tax cut are vulnerable because voters are going to make the connection between the tax cut and the fact that Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, other popular social programs are now going to be put on the chopping block in order to pay for the tax cut. GROSS: So what does it mean to have a huge deficit? And do economists think that there's a kind of dividing line between like an OK deficit and a really problematic deficit? KUTTNER: Yes, but economists disagree on where that dividing line is. GROSS: Of course (laughter) yeah. KUTTNER: So after World War II, the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the very important concept here, how big is the debt in relationship to the economy? It was 120-something percent, more than one year's total production. And yet, after the war, because the economy was growing at a nice rate, because we had a moderate rate of inflation, the ratio of debt to GDP by the time Jimmy Carter was president came down to about 25 percent. Now that's a very low rate. I think, for the most part, the concern among economists is whether that ratio is growing or not. And if the ratio is below about a hundred percent and interest rates are not all that high, it's just not a big deal. The more important question is what you are spending the deficit on. If you're spending the deficit to invest in infrastructure or invest in green transition or invest in things that are going to make the country more productive, it's a defensible use of debt. In the same way that if you borrow money to buy a house, it's a defensible use of borrowing money as opposed to just going on a credit card binge. So the amount of debt is important, and the use of debt is important. Right now, we are increasing the debt in order to pay for tax cuts which are not going to have any significant economic benefit. And we're going to be pushing the total debt ratio to above a hundred percent of GDP, which is the area - the range that most economists start to find alarming. GROSS: So I want to get back to the conversation you had with Steve Bannon in mid-August of 2017, when he contacted you because he thought that you and he would share some kind of common base about globalism. But he kind of went on to discuss other things with you that made news. So would you give us a sense, like, experientially of what that conversation was like? First of all, tell us some of the more surprising things he said to you. And I'll preface this by saying he never said to you that it was off the record, so you assumed it was on the record and just published whatever you want to from the interview. KUTTNER: Well, I recorded the interview. And I realized about 10 minutes in that I was kind of onto the scoop of my life because Bannon had made a very surprising rookie error and had never bothered to put it off the record. And that meant, by definition, by default, it was on the record. So he started out treating me as a soul mate on the subject of China. We both agreed that America's China policy was folly. And he was trying to persuade Trump of that fact and get Trump to take a much harder line on China. But realizing that I had Steve Bannon on the phone, you know, I started asking him about the alt-right. I started asking him why a tougher line on China had to be linked to white nationalism. And he said some very incautious things about Trump's own base. He said some very incautious things about other Trump officials. As - he talked to me as if he were speaking with an old chum who was a co-conspirator rather than speaking to a journalist on the record. And so it reinforced my view of Bannon as somebody who is very narcissistic, a little bit unhinged. GROSS: When you interviewed Bannon, he said to you ethno-nationalism - it's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we got to help crush it. These guys are a collection of clowns. When you published what I just quoted, do you know what impact that had on Bannon? KUTTNER: Yes. About a half-hour after that piece went live on The American Prospect website, I got a very angry call from Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying, I have Mr. Bannon here and he's extremely upset. And I said, I'm not surprised. And he said he didn't think we were on the record. And I said, well, I recorded it, and he never said that. He should have said that. And that was the end of the call. And within 12 hours, Bannon had completely changed his story and was saying that yes, he had deliberately put that on the record because he wanted to have that conversation and to get these views out. Now, this was the week of Charlottesville. And this was the week that Bannon was fired a day after that interview ran. So it gives you a little bit of insight into the braggadocio, the bravado, the recklessness and also the kind of weird genius that is Steve Bannon. And so now he's going around the world talking to neo-fascist parties, far-right parties, and egging them on - telling them they have to stay the course on their ultranationalism. So if he couldn't find a client at home, maybe he can find some clients in Europe. GROSS: Well, Robert Kuttner, thank you so much for talking with us. KUTTNER: It's always a pleasure, Terry. Thanks for having me. GROSS: Robert Kuttner's new book is called \"Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? \" After we take a short break, Maureen Corrigan will review Meg Wolitzer's new novel about a young feminist who meets a feminist icon and confronts their generational differences.

I'm Terry Gross. Middle-class people complain about how expensive it's become to live in cities. But for the working poor, city housing is often unaffordable. The majority of poor people spend over half their income on housing, leaving little money for everything else. And their lives often spiral further downward because of eviction. My guest, Matthew Desmond, won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book, \"Evicted: Poverty And Profit In The American City. \" He was also awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, the so-called genius award. Now he's created a new project, called The Eviction Lab, which is based at Princeton University where he's a professor of sociology. The lab has done something that's never been done before. It's gathered eviction records from across America so that we can better analyze the causes and consequences of eviction. The lab's website just went up a few days ago. You can look up your city and see the eviction rate there. As part of Desmond's research, he lived in a rooming house and in a trailer park in Milwaukee to be with and write about people who struggled each month to pay rent and faced dire consequences when they couldn't. Matthew Desmond, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, you write people think of eviction as being caused by poverty, but that you came to see it as a further cause of poverty. Explain how eviction itself is a cause of poverty. MATTHEW DESMOND: Sure. Yeah. Let's just put ourselves in a family's shoes that's getting evicted. Let's just be there in the apartment with them and think about how that would affect our life, you know, to lose our home, but often all your things, your neighborhood. Your children often lose their schools. And so eviction is a direct cause of homelessness, but it also is a cause of residential instability, school instability, community instability. Eviction comes with a mark that goes on your record, and that can bar you from moving into a good house in a safe neighborhood. But it could also prevent you from moving into public housing 'cause we often count that as a mark against your application. And so we push families who get evicted into slum housing in dangerous neighborhoods. We have studies that show that eviction is linked to job loss, and, if any of your listeners out there have been evicted, they know exactly why that is. It's such a consuming, stressful event. It causes you to make mistakes at work, lose your footing there. And then there's just the trauma of it. You know, like, the effect that eviction has on your dignity and your mental health and your physical health. We have a study, for example, that shows that moms who get evicted experience high rates of depression two years later. And so I think when you step back and take a look at that and really try to feel that, we have to conclude that eviction isn't just a condition of poverty. It's a cause of poverty. GROSS: So if a landlord wants to evict a tenant, how easy is it to do that? DESMOND: It varies a lot from city to city. In some places, you can evict someone for being a penny short and a day late. And the process is very efficient and quick. In other cities, it's a lot longer and laborious, and it's much more work. We're only also talking about formal evictions, too. These are evictions that go through the court. And there are a hundred and one ways for landlords to get a family out. You know? Sometimes landlords pay a family to leave. Sometimes they change their locks, or take their door off, as I witnessed one time in Milwaukee. And so those evictions aren't even captured in these numbers that we have, which means the estimates that we have are stunning, but they're also too low. GROSS: So would you describe for us this new project that you set up with the new website, The Eviction Lab? What questions do you want to be able to answer with all the data about eviction that you've been collecting? DESMOND: I published my book in 2016, and I went around the country talking about evictions. And I'd go to Houston, or Baton Rouge, or Kansas City and people there wanted to know, what's our eviction rate? You know, how are we doing? You know, where are evictions happening in my city? And I couldn't answer. You know, we don't have a national database of eviction in America. We have no idea how many Americans get evicted every year, where evictions are going up and down, what this problem is doing to our towns and our kids, and even just what works. You know, what laws and policies are really effective? And so I founded something at Princeton called The Eviction Lab, and we set out to build the nation's first-ever database of eviction in America that covers 48 states. It covers the District of Columbia. We were able to secure 83 million records related to eviction going back to 2000. And our hope is that we can take this problem that's been in the dark and bring it into the light. And community council members and high school teachers, concerned citizens, whoever you are, can engage with these data, learn about eviction in your own backyard and really start a conversation about housing and security in our communities. GROSS: So what's an example of something you can say now based on the eviction records that you've gotten that nobody could have said before? DESMOND: I can tell you that in 2016, there were about 2. 3 million evictions filed across America. That's four evictions filed every single minute. And let's just put that number into perspective. That's how many foreclosure starts were happening in 2009 at the height of the crisis. So it's as if renters are facing foreclosure-level crises every single year in this country. Now, not all of those evictions filings result in an actual eviction judgment. So how many do? So our estimate says about 900,000 do. That affects 2. 3 million people or about 6,300 Americans evicted every single day. So that's twice the number of Americans who die in car accidents every day. That's twice the number of people that get arrested for drug offenses every year. We heard a lot about the opioid crisis last year, and for good reason. It's an incredibly important topic. There were around 63,000 overdose deaths in 2016, and about 2. 3 million people evicted. So for every tragic overdose, there are 36 people that are pushed into the street. This is a problem of enormous scope and consequence. GROSS: And there's more evictions now than there used to be, right? DESMOND: From what we can tell. You know, when you read the historical record, you're left with this impression that evictions were rare and scandalous. You know, people protested sheriffs. Families and neighbors sat on furniture and wouldn't let the eviction take place. You get this impression that it didn't happen a lot. And we've moved from that place to a place where, you know, if you live in a struggling community, you've grown quite used to the early-morning knocks on the door and the effects on the curb. You know? Eviction is now something that is transforming the lives of Americans of modest means. GROSS: Why have we witnessed that change from something that was relatively uncommon to something that's very common in poor neighborhoods? DESMOND: So we're in the middle of a housing crisis, and that means more and more people are giving more and more of their income to rent and utilities. And so there's three ingredients to this crisis. Incomes have remained flat for many Americans over the last two decades, but housing costs have soared. So between 1995 and today, median asking rents have increased by 70 percent, adjusting for inflation. So there's just a really shrinking gap between what families are bringing in and what they have to pay for basic shelter. And then we might ask ourselves, why, wait a minute. You know, where's public housing here? And where's housing vouchers? You know, doesn't the government help? And the answer is, it does help, but only for a small percentage of families. You know, only about 1 in 4 families who qualify for housing assistance get anything. So when we picture the typical low-income American today, we shouldn't think of them living in public housing or getting any kind of housing assistance from the government. We should think of folks who are paying 60, 70, 80 percent of their income and living unassisted in the private rental market. That's our typical case today. Most poor renting families spend over half of their income on housing, and that is bringing millions of Americans incredibly close to eviction. GROSS: Right 'cause like most financial advisers say, you should be spending no more than 30 percent of your income on your rent. And you're talking about people who are spending, like, 50, 60, 80 percent of their income on rent, which means one thing goes wrong that you need money for, you're done. You can't afford your rent. DESMOND: Exactly. And, you know, when I was living in Milwaukee, I met folks like Vanetta. She was a single mom trying to raise three kids. She was working at Old Country Buffet, but her hours got cut back, you know? And she wasn't able to meet the bills, and that eventually ended her up in a homeless shelter. I met a grandma named Lorraine (ph), who was my neighbor in the trailer park that I lived in, who was paying over 70 percent of her income to rent a mobile home in a place that has so many code violations the city literally condemned the mobile home park. And so this is the face of many Americans today, 1 in 4 of all poor renting families are spending 70 percent of their income just on rent and utilities. And when you are in that position, it doesn't take a lot to get evicted. GROSS: So as part of your research for your eviction project, you rented a place in inner-city Milwaukee, a predominantly African-American neighborhood. Would you describe the apartment that you rented? DESMOND: Sure. I rented a rooming house from a landlord that I profiled in the book named Sherrena. And it was a duplex in inner city Milwaukee. I had a wonderful roommate named Officer Wu (ph) who worked many jobs as a security guard all throughout the inner city. And it was a small place. It was fairly shabby, but everything worked. Below us was also a rooming house, and it was - there was a lot more transient folks through there. So there were kind of new neighbors every week, every month coming through that place. People were friendly. We supported each other and cooked for each other, but there's often a bit of drama too. So there were two shootings on the block, for example, one time that the rooming house was hit. But I generally - I really loved the people I lived with. And I really enjoyed their company. GROSS: Just to clarify, what's the difference between a rooming house and an apartment? DESMOND: A rooming house is an apartment where you rent a room and you don't rent the entire unit. So I paid $400 for a bedroom every month. And Officer Wu also rented a bedroom. And we shared the bathroom, living room and kitchen. GROSS: So $400 to share a rooming house. And this was back in 2008 because that's when you started your research. DESMOND: That's right. GROSS: Was considered a lot of money for what you were getting? DESMOND: Right. That's a great point. And so what we can think about is why are rents so expensive in poor neighborhoods? Because they generally are. One thing that you learn when you look at the data is that rents in poor neighborhoods aren't that much lower than rents in other neighborhoods. And so poor families actually are paying more and getting less. And the rooming house that I lived in was bought for - I think it was under $20,000 the entire property. And so that meant the landlords could recoup the costs with that level of rent in a very short amount of time. We now know from looking at national data that property owners in low-income neighborhoods almost everywhere in the country had bigger profit margins than those in middle class or affluent neighborhoods. And the reason is very simple. Your mortgage and your property bills are lower, but your rents aren't that much lower. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Matthew Desmond. He's author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"Evicted\" and founder of the new project The Eviction Lab which is based in Princeton University, where he teaches. The Eviction Lab website just went up. We'll be back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JEFF BABKO'S \"NOSTALGIA IS FOR SUCKAS\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Matthew Desmond. He won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book \"Evicted. \" He's created a new project called The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, where he's a professor of sociology. The project has collected data on formal eviction records from 48 states and Washington, D. C. , in order to help document the prevalence, causes and consequences of eviction and to evaluate relevant laws and policies. And the website just went up a few days ago. So I think looking at landlords in poor neighborhoods is a very interesting thing to do - which, of course, you have done. And you talk about how powerful landlords are in poor neighborhoods. Can you elaborate on that? DESMOND: One thing that I wanted to know when I started this research was, you know, why would you buy property in some of the poorest neighborhoods of your city? Like, why would you see that as an investment? And when I finished this research, I asked, why wouldn't you do that? You know, you could make a pretty significant profit. You can make a profit that's significantly more than your competitors in better neighborhoods. And so I think that raises significant policy questions for us and moral questions for us. How much direct inequality should we tolerate? The landlords are also the ones that get to decide, do I kick you out and spare you? Should I let you in? Should I evict you when you get pregnant? So they do have a lot of control over tenants' lives. It's also an imbalance power structure in eviction court. And I just welcome your listeners to spend a day in eviction court and just see for yourselves. You know, in many places around the country, 90 percent of landlords have attorneys and 90 percent of tenants do not. There is no right to an attorney in eviction court except in New York City, which just passed recently. And so there is a certain imbalance there, too. But we have to listen to landlords. You know, we have to understand their perspective as well. We are housing most poor families in the private rental market. We have to understand what makes landlords tick and what policies they can work with and what suggestions they have about how to solve this crisis going forward. GROSS: You must have a high tolerance for pain if you're a landlord in a poor neighborhood because you must know going into this that your tenants are going to have trouble paying. That's why they're renting from you in the first place because they don't have much money. And you know you're going to have to find ways of forcing people who are poor to give you money that they don't necessarily have. So the landlord who you rented from in the rooming house, who you name Sherrena - because you changed the names of everybody in the book. DESMOND: Correct. GROSS: So she said to you, the hood is good. There's a lot of money here. So what did she own in addition to this rooming house? DESMOND: Sherrena owned 36 units all throughout the inner city. When I met her, she had been a landlord for four years. Before that, she was a public schoolteacher. She rented almost exclusively to poor people in inner city Milwaukee, and she netted about $10,000 a month after expenses. So that's more than most of her tenants made an entire year. And she was proud of her work. You know, she lived comfortably. She had a five-bedroom house. Her and her husband vacationed in Jamaica every year. And so I just - I think that raises certain questions for us, you know, about, you know, is this working? And what it helps me understand is poverty isn't just the result of low incomes. It's also the result of extractive markets. And it's rather irrelevant if she was a good or a bad landlord. Some days she was compassionate and a great listener. And some days she could be hard on her tenants. But in the end, they still had to pay that rent. And her affluence and comfort was directly related to their poverty. And I think Sherrena has a lesson for all of us. And I think some of us - it could be easy to judge a landlord or judge the tenants. But I think that we, as a nation, need to ask ourselves how our safe neighborhoods or our kids' schools are directly related to unsafe neighborhoods or failing schools in other parts of the nation or how our tax benefits are directly related to the lack of benefits of some struggling families today. I think we're all implicated in poverty, and Sherrena just helps us see that better, I think. GROSS: She would make it clear to her tenants that she had bills to pay. The landlord had bills to pay. So like, if you don't pay your rent to her, she can't pay her bill. So like, if you can't pay it, she's going to have to evict you. So she was pretty tough. Did she ever let somebody stay even though they couldn't pay? DESMOND: Absolutely, you know. Absolutely, you know. She bought tenants groceries. She worked with tenants. She was hard on some and soft on others. But, you know, the more I think about this issue, the more I think that we've really had a failure of our imagination. And maybe it's linked to a failure of our compassion. It shouldn't be obvious to us that eviction is the natural result of a family not paying their rent. It's not like the landlord gets it back after they evict a family. And some evictions are for pennies. You know, even looking at eviction data from Virginia, for example, 1 in 10 evictions in Virginia in 2016 are for less than $335. You know, $335 is separating a lot of families from being housed and homelessness. And so I think that when we ask, you know, well, what could be done if a tenant doesn't pay rent? Doesn't that tenant have to be evicted? A thousand things can be done. There's so much better ways of dealing with this issue than we currently do. GROSS: Give us some examples. DESMOND: For example, if you go to Cleveland's Community Court, you go in the court and the judge says, why are you behind? That might not sound like a radical question to you. But for folks that have been in eviction court, you know how radical it is because many times the judge just says, are you behind? And if you say yes, your case is basically over. But in a community court, this judge says, why are you behind? And you say, my kid got sick or I relapsed or my hours got cut or whatever. You know, it was the source of you falling behind. And then there's several full-time social workers in the court. And the social workers get on the case immediately. And the judge and the social worker and the tenant work together to see if they can arrive at a compromise that helps the landlord get his or her payment. It helps the tenants stay in the home and addresses the fundamental issue. Stabilizing a home has all sorts of positive benefits for a family. The kid gets to finish school. The neighborhood doesn't lose a crucial neighbor. The family gets to kind of root down and understand the value of a home and avoid homelessness. And for all of us, I think we have to recognize that we're paying the costs of eviction because whatever our issue is, whatever keeps us up at night, the lack of affordable housing sits at the root of that issue. Let me just give you a few examples. You know, we know that neighborhoods that have more evictions have higher violent crime rates the following year. And you can understand why. It rips apart the fabric of a community. We pay for that. The top 5 percent of hospital users consume 50 percent of the healthcare costs. Guess who those people are? They're the homeless and unstably housed. And so I think we can spend smart or we can spend stupid. And so I think addressing the affordable housing crisis is a win for families, for landlords and for the taxpayer. GROSS: My guest is Matthew Desmond, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book \"Evicted. \" And he founded The Eviction Lab, a new national database of eviction records. Their website just went up a few days ago. After a break, we'll talk more about evictions and hear how his parents' home was foreclosed on years ago. And Ken Tucker will review John Prine's first album of new songs in 13 years. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLIE HUNTER'S \"LOW BRIDGE\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Matthew Desmond. We're talking about the lack of affordable housing, especially for the working poor who risk being evicted when an unplanned expense leaves them unable to pay the rent. Desmond has a new project called The Eviction Lab that's created the first national database of evictions in America. Their website just went up a few days ago. The lab is based in Princeton University, where he's a professor of sociology. He won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book \"Evicted: Poverty And Profit In The American City. \" It's based, in part, on his research living in a rooming house and in a trailer park in Milwaukee. Did you witness any evictions? DESMOND: Oh, dozens and dozens. I witnessed evictions in the trailer park I lived in, in the neighborhoods I lived in. But I also went along with a sheriff many, many times on eviction moves. One is hard to shake. This was in Milwaukee, and it was a cold spring day. It was raining. And we went up to this house, and there were just kids living in the house. And we are all confused. The sheriff and the movers were confused. We eventually got in touch with the landlord, and we learned that the mom had died, and the kids had just gone on living in the house. And, you know, the sheriffs deliberated a little bit, but then they carried through the eviction like this was their job. And the movers piled the children's things on the wet sidewalk. The landlord drilled a new lock, and we were off to the next move. GROSS: What happened to the children? DESMOND: I don't know. The landlords don't know. The sheriff doesn't know. It's not their job to know. GROSS: Were the children just left there with the possessions on the sidewalk? DESMOND: That's right. GROSS: How old were the children? DESMOND: They were between - like, I think the oldest was a teenager. I remember she had these piercing gray eyes, and she was hard, you know, hardened. And the youngest, if I recall just from memory, you know, I'd put them at 7, 8, something like that. GROSS: I wonder if the sheriff contacted Child Services right afterwards or what. DESMOND: It could be possible. But, you know, I mean - you know, that's an example that's extreme, but, you know, most families that get evicted in Milwaukee have kids living with them. The average age of a homeless person in America is 9. And so when we think of this crisis, we should recognize it like the eviction crisis is a crisis borne by our children. Until recently, the housing court in the South Bronx in New York City literally had a day care inside of it because there were so many kids coming through its doors. GROSS: So just taking the landlord point of view for a second, when a family knows they're going to be evicted, do they ever kind of, like, sabotage the apartment in anger, in protest, against the landlord? DESMOND: Sure, yeah. Sure, that happens. Many landowners that I spoke with have the same story, and it starts like this. I used to be nice, but then, you know - and then - but then, you know, the tenants stuck socks down the sink and turned the water on, you know, things like that. You know, I think that those things do happen. And in my experience, those are rare but very meaningful occurrences, and you can look at this in the data actually. And if you look at landlord profit margins in low-income communities, you can see that a small number of them incur big losses, big risks but most of them don't. GROSS: One of the recommendations you make after having studied eviction in the U. S. and looking at how some other countries handle housing for the poor - you've looked at how other countries handle housing vouchers, and you recommend we try a similar system. What's the system that you think is working in other countries? DESMOND: So the good news is the systems that are working here work pretty darn well. You know, when families finally get a housing voucher after years and years on the waiting list, when they get this ticket that allows them to pay only 30 percent of their income on rent instead of 50 or 60, they do one consistent thing with it. They buy more food. You know, their kids become stronger and less anemic. They move to better neighborhoods. They don't move as often. They stay in the labor market longer. They work. But the problem is it's only for the lucky minority of poor families today, and the vast majority of our low-income families, they're not so lucky. And their kids, like, literally don't get enough to eat because the rent eats first. And so the good news is we don't need to go looking for programs elsewhere, but we do need to dose the problem bigger. We need to have a deeper investment in affordable housing in America. GROSS: So, you know, in terms of the playing field being unequal in housing, something else you point out - which other people have mentioned as well - is that homeowners get this great advantage right now that renters don't get, which is that you can deduct your interest. Now, the amount that you can deduct was limited by the new tax bill, and I think everybody's still confused about what the new rules are about that. But nevertheless, there's a tax advantage to ownership that, you know, renters don't get any kind of break like that. And I thought that was, like, supposed to be an incentive for people to buy homes because of the stability it brings to the homeowner and to the community. And you say, no, that's not what it was about. This law goes back to 1913. What was the law about when it was started, the law that allowed homeowners to deduct their interest from their taxes? DESMOND: It was a law that just started because it allowed business folks to deduct certain expenses. And it kind of caught the country off guard when mortgages were included in those deductions. And then when America started building its middle class through the G. I. Bill after World War II and expanding homeownership to middle-class families for whom it would never - it had never been a reality for those families by ensuring private mortgages and decreasing down payment sizes, you know, then we suddenly realized, oh, this is kind of a runaway deduction. But by that time, it was baked so deep in the kind of financial planning of many Americans that it was seen as kind of a third rail. You really couldn't touch it. So let's just back up - what are we talking about here? It's tax time. So the mortgage interest deduction is something that homeowners can take for their first home and even for their second home, their RV or their yacht or their ski cabin. And until recently, you could deduct up to a million dollars - a mortgage interest deduction - for your first home. And now it's capped at $750,000, so it still has a really big cap on it. And that is one of the sweetest deals in the tax code that matters a lot to homeowners. And just to give you a perspective about how huge that benefit is - so the year that Arleen was evicted from the apartment that I studied with her, we as a nation spent about $41 billion on direct housing assistance to the needy, things like public housing, housing vouchers - $41 billion. But that same year, we spent $171 billion on homeowner tax subsidies, with things like the mortgage interest deduction taking up a bigger share of the pie. That's a tremendous number. That's a colossal number. That's equivalent to the entire budgets of, like, the Departments of Education and Agriculture and the Interior and Department of Justice combined. And the thing is, most of that benefit goes to families with six-figure incomes because if you have a bigger income, you can get a bigger home. And you get a bigger home, you could take a bigger deduction for your mortgage. Most white families in America own their home. And they're eligible for this really sweet cut out in the tax code. Most African-American and Latino families, they don't because of our history of racial discrimination. So, I mean, to me, it's really hard to think of a social policy that does a better job of amplifying our economic and racial inequality than our current housing policy does. We give most of our housing benefits to families that need it the least. And we give nothing to families that desperately need it the most. And so if that's going to be our arrangement, Terry, I just feel like let's just be honest about that, you know, and own up to it instead of repeating this idea that the richest country on the planet can't afford to do more. GROSS: Well, let me introduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Matthew Desmond. He's author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"Evicted\" and founder of the new project The Eviction Lab, which is based in Princeton University where he teaches. And their website just went up a few days ago. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MARC BROUSSARD'S \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Matthew Desmond. He won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book \"Evicted. \" He's created a new project called The Eviction Lab. It's based at Princeton University, where he's a professor of sociology. The project has collected data on formal eviction records from 48 states and Washington, D. C. , in order to help document and understand the prevalence, the causes and the consequences of eviction. So your family was never evicted, but they were foreclosed on. And so before we get to your family story - it's maybe an obvious question here - but what's the difference between eviction and foreclosure? DESMOND: An eviction happens to renters, and a foreclosure happens to homeowners. So in a foreclosure, the bank or the lending institution seizes the home. And in an eviction, the landlord forces renters to leave. GROSS: OK, so your family was foreclosed on soon after you went to college. What happened? DESMOND: We had run into some financial trouble. We were unable to kind of get back into the block with the bank. And the bank started foreclosure proceedings on my family. I must have been a sophomore or junior in college. And so we went through foreclosure, you know, before it was, you know, all the rage. We were trendsetters. GROSS: (Laughter). DESMOND: And, you know, I don't remember a lot about that moment. But I do remember experiencing it with a lot of embarrassment, you know, and shame. And, you know, I blamed my parents for decisions that I didn't fully understand at that point in my life. And, you know, that's exactly how folks experience an eviction. You know, they think it's their fault. And they think that they're in it alone. And I remember talking to Arleen after my book came out. And, you know, Arleen's really. . . GROSS: She's one of the tenants that you wrote about. DESMOND: Yeah, she's a single mom and trying to raise two young boys. You know, and when I first met her, she was paying 88 percent of her income to live in a really run-down inner city apartment in Milwaukee. And we read the book together. And she said, you know, I see a lot of my strength in here, but I also see a lot of my mistakes. She was so hard on herself. And I was hard on my parents, you know, after that. And one thing I've learned - and I think that one thing that Arleen has come around to a bit - is to say, look, this is not just us. You know, we're part of a broader story here. If this is happening to millions of people, it's not something that can just be thrust on us as an evidence of our irresponsibility or missteps. There's something bigger going on. GROSS: If you don't mind saying, what kind of financial trouble did your family run into? DESMOND: My dad was between jobs. He was a preacher. And, you know, that's not a super lucrative career in a small town. And he left the church and was in between jobs and ended up finishing his career as a prison chaplain. And my mom just held down whatever job she could get in a small Arizona town where I grew up. GROSS: What did your parents do when they were foreclosed on? Where did they go? DESMOND: So my parents and my younger sister moved into a small rented home in the middle of town. We had before been a bit out of town. And they lived there for several years until they finally were able to move out by us on the East Coast. GROSS: What did it mean to you to lose the home you grew up in? DESMOND: Whenever we went back to visit them in our small town, we'd often drive by our old home. And we'd look at it. We'd criticize people's painting jobs, you know, because it still felt a bit like ours - you know, that it had been taken from us. And I remember that home fondly. I remember feeling safe in it. I remember Easter egg hunts and Christmas in it. And so there was something beyond just a financial hit. There was something about losing those memories in a way and that sense of place. We didn't lose it on our own terms. GROSS: Is that foreclosure one of the reasons why you've studied evictions? DESMOND: I don't know. I don't think so. But it's something that I felt I had to write about. In fact, I wasn't going to put that detail in the book, and my brilliant editor Amanda Cook made me because, you know, she's - you know, how could you not? And she was right, as she is about everything. And I don't know. It might have got in there somewhere. But, I mean, what I remember is going to college thinking that America worked a certain way, thinking that America was fair and that there was an even playing field. And if you worked hard, you could get ahead. And, you know, I thought I might want to be a lawyer. And I started taking classes in history and justice studies and was confronted with a set of facts that really flew in the face of my story. You know, is this how much racial inequality we have in this country? You know, is the American dream so blunted? And that's when I started spending, you know, when I wasn't working, you know, spending time in the library really trying to get after those questions. And I started spending a lot of time with homeless people that lived around my campus. And that's kind of how I got started in just like this curiosity about poverty in America. Why does this land of riches have so much poverty? Why are we the richest democracy with such severe levels of destitution? And that's the question that still propels me today. GROSS: I want to point out that when you say your editor insisted that you put your family's foreclosure in the book, it's in the epilogue and there's maybe a paragraph (laughter). You're not going into a lot of detail about it. DESMOND: That's right, yeah. Maybe I should say she nudged me to do it. GROSS: Yeah. OK. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: So one of the things you can do on your Eviction Lab website is to look at the city where you live and see rates compared to other cities when it comes to eviction. People usually like to be in the top 10. You don't want to be in the top 10 in this particular listing. I was glad Philly was (inaudible) somewhere in the 80s. But Virginia had five cities in the top 10. What's going on in Virginia? DESMOND: That's right. So I'm not going to let Philly off the hook so easily, though. You still have way too many evictions than you should. It is surprising to me that a fairly big low-cost city like Philly has so many evections. But you're right. If you look at the map, you see evictions concentrated in the Southeast. And this was surprising to us, you know. And when we talk about the housing crisis, we often usually talk about the coasts or most-expensive cities where rents have skyrocketed. But what this unveils is that eviction has this huge effect in fairly low-cost cities and communities all across the Southeast - 1 in 9 renter homes in Richmond are evicted every single year. In Norfolk, Va. , it's about that rate as well. It's a state that is hosting a tremendous amount of evictions every year. And the thing is I don't fully understand why. We don't know. And so what this eviction data allow us to do is ask questions that we couldn't ask before, look at patterns that were invisible to us before and really ask city planners, students, parents, everyone to come around the table and really try to kind of look at this problem in their community and get to the bottom of it. GROSS: Matthew Desmond, thank you so much for talking with us. And congratulations on all the work you've done. DESMOND: Thank you for having me. GROSS: My pleasure. Matthew Desmond is the author of \"Evicted\" and the founder of The Eviction Lab based at Princeton University, where he teaches. The lab's website just went up a few days ago, offering us access to its national database of evictions throughout America. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In the audio of this story, and in a previous Web version, it is incorrectly implied that there are about 3,000 traffic fatalities per day in the U. S. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports there were 37,461 fatalities caused by car crashes in 2016, or about 103 per day. ](SOUNDBITE OF YO LA TENGO'S \"WEATHER SHY\") TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Middle-class people complain about how expensive it's become to live in cities. But for the working poor, city housing is often unaffordable. The majority of poor people spend over half their income on housing, leaving little money for everything else. And their lives often spiral further downward because of eviction. My guest, Matthew Desmond, won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book, \"Evicted: Poverty And Profit In The American City. \" He was also awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, the so-called genius award. Now he's created a new project, called The Eviction Lab, which is based at Princeton University where he's a professor of sociology. The lab has done something that's never been done before. It's gathered eviction records from across America so that we can better analyze the causes and consequences of eviction. The lab's website just went up a few days ago. You can look up your city and see the eviction rate there. As part of Desmond's research, he lived in a rooming house and in a trailer park in Milwaukee to be with and write about people who struggled each month to pay rent and faced dire consequences when they couldn't. Matthew Desmond, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, you write people think of eviction as being caused by poverty, but that you came to see it as a further cause of poverty. Explain how eviction itself is a cause of poverty. MATTHEW DESMOND: Sure. Yeah. Let's just put ourselves in a family's shoes that's getting evicted. Let's just be there in the apartment with them and think about how that would affect our life, you know, to lose our home, but often all your things, your neighborhood. Your children often lose their schools. And so eviction is a direct cause of homelessness, but it also is a cause of residential instability, school instability, community instability. Eviction comes with a mark that goes on your record, and that can bar you from moving into a good house in a safe neighborhood. But it could also prevent you from moving into public housing 'cause we often count that as a mark against your application. And so we push families who get evicted into slum housing in dangerous neighborhoods. We have studies that show that eviction is linked to job loss, and, if any of your listeners out there have been evicted, they know exactly why that is. It's such a consuming, stressful event. It causes you to make mistakes at work, lose your footing there. And then there's just the trauma of it. You know, like, the effect that eviction has on your dignity and your mental health and your physical health. We have a study, for example, that shows that moms who get evicted experience high rates of depression two years later. And so I think when you step back and take a look at that and really try to feel that, we have to conclude that eviction isn't just a condition of poverty. It's a cause of poverty. GROSS: So if a landlord wants to evict a tenant, how easy is it to do that? DESMOND: It varies a lot from city to city. In some places, you can evict someone for being a penny short and a day late. And the process is very efficient and quick. In other cities, it's a lot longer and laborious, and it's much more work. We're only also talking about formal evictions, too. These are evictions that go through the court. And there are a hundred and one ways for landlords to get a family out. You know? Sometimes landlords pay a family to leave. Sometimes they change their locks, or take their door off, as I witnessed one time in Milwaukee. And so those evictions aren't even captured in these numbers that we have, which means the estimates that we have are stunning, but they're also too low. GROSS: So would you describe for us this new project that you set up with the new website, The Eviction Lab? What questions do you want to be able to answer with all the data about eviction that you've been collecting? DESMOND: I published my book in 2016, and I went around the country talking about evictions. And I'd go to Houston, or Baton Rouge, or Kansas City and people there wanted to know, what's our eviction rate? You know, how are we doing? You know, where are evictions happening in my city? And I couldn't answer. You know, we don't have a national database of eviction in America. We have no idea how many Americans get evicted every year, where evictions are going up and down, what this problem is doing to our towns and our kids, and even just what works. You know, what laws and policies are really effective? And so I founded something at Princeton called The Eviction Lab, and we set out to build the nation's first-ever database of eviction in America that covers 48 states. It covers the District of Columbia. We were able to secure 83 million records related to eviction going back to 2000. And our hope is that we can take this problem that's been in the dark and bring it into the light. And community council members and high school teachers, concerned citizens, whoever you are, can engage with these data, learn about eviction in your own backyard and really start a conversation about housing and security in our communities. GROSS: So what's an example of something you can say now based on the eviction records that you've gotten that nobody could have said before? DESMOND: I can tell you that in 2016, there were about 2. 3 million evictions filed across America. That's four evictions filed every single minute. And let's just put that number into perspective. That's how many foreclosure starts were happening in 2009 at the height of the crisis. So it's as if renters are facing foreclosure-level crises every single year in this country. Now, not all of those evictions filings result in an actual eviction judgment. So how many do? So our estimate says about 900,000 do. That affects 2. 3 million people or about 6,300 Americans evicted every single day. So that's twice the number of Americans who die in car accidents every day. That's twice the number of people that get arrested for drug offenses every year. We heard a lot about the opioid crisis last year, and for good reason. It's an incredibly important topic. There were around 63,000 overdose deaths in 2016, and about 2. 3 million people evicted. So for every tragic overdose, there are 36 people that are pushed into the street. This is a problem of enormous scope and consequence. GROSS: And there's more evictions now than there used to be, right? DESMOND: From what we can tell. You know, when you read the historical record, you're left with this impression that evictions were rare and scandalous. You know, people protested sheriffs. Families and neighbors sat on furniture and wouldn't let the eviction take place. You get this impression that it didn't happen a lot. And we've moved from that place to a place where, you know, if you live in a struggling community, you've grown quite used to the early-morning knocks on the door and the effects on the curb. You know? Eviction is now something that is transforming the lives of Americans of modest means. GROSS: Why have we witnessed that change from something that was relatively uncommon to something that's very common in poor neighborhoods? DESMOND: So we're in the middle of a housing crisis, and that means more and more people are giving more and more of their income to rent and utilities. And so there's three ingredients to this crisis. Incomes have remained flat for many Americans over the last two decades, but housing costs have soared. So between 1995 and today, median asking rents have increased by 70 percent, adjusting for inflation. So there's just a really shrinking gap between what families are bringing in and what they have to pay for basic shelter. And then we might ask ourselves, why, wait a minute. You know, where's public housing here? And where's housing vouchers? You know, doesn't the government help? And the answer is, it does help, but only for a small percentage of families. You know, only about 1 in 4 families who qualify for housing assistance get anything. So when we picture the typical low-income American today, we shouldn't think of them living in public housing or getting any kind of housing assistance from the government. We should think of folks who are paying 60, 70, 80 percent of their income and living unassisted in the private rental market. That's our typical case today. Most poor renting families spend over half of their income on housing, and that is bringing millions of Americans incredibly close to eviction. GROSS: Right 'cause like most financial advisers say, you should be spending no more than 30 percent of your income on your rent. And you're talking about people who are spending, like, 50, 60, 80 percent of their income on rent, which means one thing goes wrong that you need money for, you're done. You can't afford your rent. DESMOND: Exactly. And, you know, when I was living in Milwaukee, I met folks like Vanetta. She was a single mom trying to raise three kids. She was working at Old Country Buffet, but her hours got cut back, you know? And she wasn't able to meet the bills, and that eventually ended her up in a homeless shelter. I met a grandma named Lorraine (ph), who was my neighbor in the trailer park that I lived in, who was paying over 70 percent of her income to rent a mobile home in a place that has so many code violations the city literally condemned the mobile home park. And so this is the face of many Americans today, 1 in 4 of all poor renting families are spending 70 percent of their income just on rent and utilities. And when you are in that position, it doesn't take a lot to get evicted. GROSS: So as part of your research for your eviction project, you rented a place in inner-city Milwaukee, a predominantly African-American neighborhood. Would you describe the apartment that you rented? DESMOND: Sure. I rented a rooming house from a landlord that I profiled in the book named Sherrena. And it was a duplex in inner city Milwaukee. I had a wonderful roommate named Officer Wu (ph) who worked many jobs as a security guard all throughout the inner city. And it was a small place. It was fairly shabby, but everything worked. Below us was also a rooming house, and it was - there was a lot more transient folks through there. So there were kind of new neighbors every week, every month coming through that place. People were friendly. We supported each other and cooked for each other, but there's often a bit of drama too. So there were two shootings on the block, for example, one time that the rooming house was hit. But I generally - I really loved the people I lived with. And I really enjoyed their company. GROSS: Just to clarify, what's the difference between a rooming house and an apartment? DESMOND: A rooming house is an apartment where you rent a room and you don't rent the entire unit. So I paid $400 for a bedroom every month. And Officer Wu also rented a bedroom. And we shared the bathroom, living room and kitchen. GROSS: So $400 to share a rooming house. And this was back in 2008 because that's when you started your research. DESMOND: That's right. GROSS: Was considered a lot of money for what you were getting? DESMOND: Right. That's a great point. And so what we can think about is why are rents so expensive in poor neighborhoods? Because they generally are. One thing that you learn when you look at the data is that rents in poor neighborhoods aren't that much lower than rents in other neighborhoods. And so poor families actually are paying more and getting less. And the rooming house that I lived in was bought for - I think it was under $20,000 the entire property. And so that meant the landlords could recoup the costs with that level of rent in a very short amount of time. We now know from looking at national data that property owners in low-income neighborhoods almost everywhere in the country had bigger profit margins than those in middle class or affluent neighborhoods. And the reason is very simple. Your mortgage and your property bills are lower, but your rents aren't that much lower. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Matthew Desmond. He's author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"Evicted\" and founder of the new project The Eviction Lab which is based in Princeton University, where he teaches. The Eviction Lab website just went up. We'll be back after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JEFF BABKO'S \"NOSTALGIA IS FOR SUCKAS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Matthew Desmond. He won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book \"Evicted. \" He's created a new project called The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, where he's a professor of sociology. The project has collected data on formal eviction records from 48 states and Washington, D. C. , in order to help document the prevalence, causes and consequences of eviction and to evaluate relevant laws and policies. And the website just went up a few days ago. So I think looking at landlords in poor neighborhoods is a very interesting thing to do - which, of course, you have done. And you talk about how powerful landlords are in poor neighborhoods. Can you elaborate on that? DESMOND: One thing that I wanted to know when I started this research was, you know, why would you buy property in some of the poorest neighborhoods of your city? Like, why would you see that as an investment? And when I finished this research, I asked, why wouldn't you do that? You know, you could make a pretty significant profit. You can make a profit that's significantly more than your competitors in better neighborhoods. And so I think that raises significant policy questions for us and moral questions for us. How much direct inequality should we tolerate? The landlords are also the ones that get to decide, do I kick you out and spare you? Should I let you in? Should I evict you when you get pregnant? So they do have a lot of control over tenants' lives. It's also an imbalance power structure in eviction court. And I just welcome your listeners to spend a day in eviction court and just see for yourselves. You know, in many places around the country, 90 percent of landlords have attorneys and 90 percent of tenants do not. There is no right to an attorney in eviction court except in New York City, which just passed recently. And so there is a certain imbalance there, too. But we have to listen to landlords. You know, we have to understand their perspective as well. We are housing most poor families in the private rental market. We have to understand what makes landlords tick and what policies they can work with and what suggestions they have about how to solve this crisis going forward. GROSS: You must have a high tolerance for pain if you're a landlord in a poor neighborhood because you must know going into this that your tenants are going to have trouble paying. That's why they're renting from you in the first place because they don't have much money. And you know you're going to have to find ways of forcing people who are poor to give you money that they don't necessarily have. So the landlord who you rented from in the rooming house, who you name Sherrena - because you changed the names of everybody in the book. DESMOND: Correct. GROSS: So she said to you, the hood is good. There's a lot of money here. So what did she own in addition to this rooming house? DESMOND: Sherrena owned 36 units all throughout the inner city. When I met her, she had been a landlord for four years. Before that, she was a public schoolteacher. She rented almost exclusively to poor people in inner city Milwaukee, and she netted about $10,000 a month after expenses. So that's more than most of her tenants made an entire year. And she was proud of her work. You know, she lived comfortably. She had a five-bedroom house. Her and her husband vacationed in Jamaica every year. And so I just - I think that raises certain questions for us, you know, about, you know, is this working? And what it helps me understand is poverty isn't just the result of low incomes. It's also the result of extractive markets. And it's rather irrelevant if she was a good or a bad landlord. Some days she was compassionate and a great listener. And some days she could be hard on her tenants. But in the end, they still had to pay that rent. And her affluence and comfort was directly related to their poverty. And I think Sherrena has a lesson for all of us. And I think some of us - it could be easy to judge a landlord or judge the tenants. But I think that we, as a nation, need to ask ourselves how our safe neighborhoods or our kids' schools are directly related to unsafe neighborhoods or failing schools in other parts of the nation or how our tax benefits are directly related to the lack of benefits of some struggling families today. I think we're all implicated in poverty, and Sherrena just helps us see that better, I think. GROSS: She would make it clear to her tenants that she had bills to pay. The landlord had bills to pay. So like, if you don't pay your rent to her, she can't pay her bill. So like, if you can't pay it, she's going to have to evict you. So she was pretty tough. Did she ever let somebody stay even though they couldn't pay? DESMOND: Absolutely, you know. Absolutely, you know. She bought tenants groceries. She worked with tenants. She was hard on some and soft on others. But, you know, the more I think about this issue, the more I think that we've really had a failure of our imagination. And maybe it's linked to a failure of our compassion. It shouldn't be obvious to us that eviction is the natural result of a family not paying their rent. It's not like the landlord gets it back after they evict a family. And some evictions are for pennies. You know, even looking at eviction data from Virginia, for example, 1 in 10 evictions in Virginia in 2016 are for less than $335. You know, $335 is separating a lot of families from being housed and homelessness. And so I think that when we ask, you know, well, what could be done if a tenant doesn't pay rent? Doesn't that tenant have to be evicted? A thousand things can be done. There's so much better ways of dealing with this issue than we currently do. GROSS: Give us some examples. DESMOND: For example, if you go to Cleveland's Community Court, you go in the court and the judge says, why are you behind? That might not sound like a radical question to you. But for folks that have been in eviction court, you know how radical it is because many times the judge just says, are you behind? And if you say yes, your case is basically over. But in a community court, this judge says, why are you behind? And you say, my kid got sick or I relapsed or my hours got cut or whatever. You know, it was the source of you falling behind. And then there's several full-time social workers in the court. And the social workers get on the case immediately. And the judge and the social worker and the tenant work together to see if they can arrive at a compromise that helps the landlord get his or her payment. It helps the tenants stay in the home and addresses the fundamental issue. Stabilizing a home has all sorts of positive benefits for a family. The kid gets to finish school. The neighborhood doesn't lose a crucial neighbor. The family gets to kind of root down and understand the value of a home and avoid homelessness. And for all of us, I think we have to recognize that we're paying the costs of eviction because whatever our issue is, whatever keeps us up at night, the lack of affordable housing sits at the root of that issue. Let me just give you a few examples. You know, we know that neighborhoods that have more evictions have higher violent crime rates the following year. And you can understand why. It rips apart the fabric of a community. We pay for that. The top 5 percent of hospital users consume 50 percent of the healthcare costs. Guess who those people are? They're the homeless and unstably housed. And so I think we can spend smart or we can spend stupid. And so I think addressing the affordable housing crisis is a win for families, for landlords and for the taxpayer. GROSS: My guest is Matthew Desmond, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book \"Evicted. \" And he founded The Eviction Lab, a new national database of eviction records. Their website just went up a few days ago. After a break, we'll talk more about evictions and hear how his parents' home was foreclosed on years ago. And Ken Tucker will review John Prine's first album of new songs in 13 years. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLIE HUNTER'S \"LOW BRIDGE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Matthew Desmond. We're talking about the lack of affordable housing, especially for the working poor who risk being evicted when an unplanned expense leaves them unable to pay the rent. Desmond has a new project called The Eviction Lab that's created the first national database of evictions in America. Their website just went up a few days ago. The lab is based in Princeton University, where he's a professor of sociology. He won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book \"Evicted: Poverty And Profit In The American City. \" It's based, in part, on his research living in a rooming house and in a trailer park in Milwaukee. Did you witness any evictions? DESMOND: Oh, dozens and dozens. I witnessed evictions in the trailer park I lived in, in the neighborhoods I lived in. But I also went along with a sheriff many, many times on eviction moves. One is hard to shake. This was in Milwaukee, and it was a cold spring day. It was raining. And we went up to this house, and there were just kids living in the house. And we are all confused. The sheriff and the movers were confused. We eventually got in touch with the landlord, and we learned that the mom had died, and the kids had just gone on living in the house. And, you know, the sheriffs deliberated a little bit, but then they carried through the eviction like this was their job. And the movers piled the children's things on the wet sidewalk. The landlord drilled a new lock, and we were off to the next move. GROSS: What happened to the children? DESMOND: I don't know. The landlords don't know. The sheriff doesn't know. It's not their job to know. GROSS: Were the children just left there with the possessions on the sidewalk? DESMOND: That's right. GROSS: How old were the children? DESMOND: They were between - like, I think the oldest was a teenager. I remember she had these piercing gray eyes, and she was hard, you know, hardened. And the youngest, if I recall just from memory, you know, I'd put them at 7, 8, something like that. GROSS: I wonder if the sheriff contacted Child Services right afterwards or what. DESMOND: It could be possible. But, you know, I mean - you know, that's an example that's extreme, but, you know, most families that get evicted in Milwaukee have kids living with them. The average age of a homeless person in America is 9. And so when we think of this crisis, we should recognize it like the eviction crisis is a crisis borne by our children. Until recently, the housing court in the South Bronx in New York City literally had a day care inside of it because there were so many kids coming through its doors. GROSS: So just taking the landlord point of view for a second, when a family knows they're going to be evicted, do they ever kind of, like, sabotage the apartment in anger, in protest, against the landlord? DESMOND: Sure, yeah. Sure, that happens. Many landowners that I spoke with have the same story, and it starts like this. I used to be nice, but then, you know - and then - but then, you know, the tenants stuck socks down the sink and turned the water on, you know, things like that. You know, I think that those things do happen. And in my experience, those are rare but very meaningful occurrences, and you can look at this in the data actually. And if you look at landlord profit margins in low-income communities, you can see that a small number of them incur big losses, big risks but most of them don't. GROSS: One of the recommendations you make after having studied eviction in the U. S. and looking at how some other countries handle housing for the poor - you've looked at how other countries handle housing vouchers, and you recommend we try a similar system. What's the system that you think is working in other countries? DESMOND: So the good news is the systems that are working here work pretty darn well. You know, when families finally get a housing voucher after years and years on the waiting list, when they get this ticket that allows them to pay only 30 percent of their income on rent instead of 50 or 60, they do one consistent thing with it. They buy more food. You know, their kids become stronger and less anemic. They move to better neighborhoods. They don't move as often. They stay in the labor market longer. They work. But the problem is it's only for the lucky minority of poor families today, and the vast majority of our low-income families, they're not so lucky. And their kids, like, literally don't get enough to eat because the rent eats first. And so the good news is we don't need to go looking for programs elsewhere, but we do need to dose the problem bigger. We need to have a deeper investment in affordable housing in America. GROSS: So, you know, in terms of the playing field being unequal in housing, something else you point out - which other people have mentioned as well - is that homeowners get this great advantage right now that renters don't get, which is that you can deduct your interest. Now, the amount that you can deduct was limited by the new tax bill, and I think everybody's still confused about what the new rules are about that. But nevertheless, there's a tax advantage to ownership that, you know, renters don't get any kind of break like that. And I thought that was, like, supposed to be an incentive for people to buy homes because of the stability it brings to the homeowner and to the community. And you say, no, that's not what it was about. This law goes back to 1913. What was the law about when it was started, the law that allowed homeowners to deduct their interest from their taxes? DESMOND: It was a law that just started because it allowed business folks to deduct certain expenses. And it kind of caught the country off guard when mortgages were included in those deductions. And then when America started building its middle class through the G. I. Bill after World War II and expanding homeownership to middle-class families for whom it would never - it had never been a reality for those families by ensuring private mortgages and decreasing down payment sizes, you know, then we suddenly realized, oh, this is kind of a runaway deduction. But by that time, it was baked so deep in the kind of financial planning of many Americans that it was seen as kind of a third rail. You really couldn't touch it. So let's just back up - what are we talking about here? It's tax time. So the mortgage interest deduction is something that homeowners can take for their first home and even for their second home, their RV or their yacht or their ski cabin. And until recently, you could deduct up to a million dollars - a mortgage interest deduction - for your first home. And now it's capped at $750,000, so it still has a really big cap on it. And that is one of the sweetest deals in the tax code that matters a lot to homeowners. And just to give you a perspective about how huge that benefit is - so the year that Arleen was evicted from the apartment that I studied with her, we as a nation spent about $41 billion on direct housing assistance to the needy, things like public housing, housing vouchers - $41 billion. But that same year, we spent $171 billion on homeowner tax subsidies, with things like the mortgage interest deduction taking up a bigger share of the pie. That's a tremendous number. That's a colossal number. That's equivalent to the entire budgets of, like, the Departments of Education and Agriculture and the Interior and Department of Justice combined. And the thing is, most of that benefit goes to families with six-figure incomes because if you have a bigger income, you can get a bigger home. And you get a bigger home, you could take a bigger deduction for your mortgage. Most white families in America own their home. And they're eligible for this really sweet cut out in the tax code. Most African-American and Latino families, they don't because of our history of racial discrimination. So, I mean, to me, it's really hard to think of a social policy that does a better job of amplifying our economic and racial inequality than our current housing policy does. We give most of our housing benefits to families that need it the least. And we give nothing to families that desperately need it the most. And so if that's going to be our arrangement, Terry, I just feel like let's just be honest about that, you know, and own up to it instead of repeating this idea that the richest country on the planet can't afford to do more. GROSS: Well, let me introduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Matthew Desmond. He's author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"Evicted\" and founder of the new project The Eviction Lab, which is based in Princeton University where he teaches. And their website just went up a few days ago. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MARC BROUSSARD'S \"INNER CITY BLUES (MAKE ME WANNA HOLLER)\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Matthew Desmond. He won a Pulitzer Prize last year for his book \"Evicted. \" He's created a new project called The Eviction Lab. It's based at Princeton University, where he's a professor of sociology. The project has collected data on formal eviction records from 48 states and Washington, D. C. , in order to help document and understand the prevalence, the causes and the consequences of eviction. So your family was never evicted, but they were foreclosed on. And so before we get to your family story - it's maybe an obvious question here - but what's the difference between eviction and foreclosure? DESMOND: An eviction happens to renters, and a foreclosure happens to homeowners. So in a foreclosure, the bank or the lending institution seizes the home. And in an eviction, the landlord forces renters to leave. GROSS: OK, so your family was foreclosed on soon after you went to college. What happened? DESMOND: We had run into some financial trouble. We were unable to kind of get back into the block with the bank. And the bank started foreclosure proceedings on my family. I must have been a sophomore or junior in college. And so we went through foreclosure, you know, before it was, you know, all the rage. We were trendsetters. GROSS: (Laughter). DESMOND: And, you know, I don't remember a lot about that moment. But I do remember experiencing it with a lot of embarrassment, you know, and shame. And, you know, I blamed my parents for decisions that I didn't fully understand at that point in my life. And, you know, that's exactly how folks experience an eviction. You know, they think it's their fault. And they think that they're in it alone. And I remember talking to Arleen after my book came out. And, you know, Arleen's really. . . GROSS: She's one of the tenants that you wrote about. DESMOND: Yeah, she's a single mom and trying to raise two young boys. You know, and when I first met her, she was paying 88 percent of her income to live in a really run-down inner city apartment in Milwaukee. And we read the book together. And she said, you know, I see a lot of my strength in here, but I also see a lot of my mistakes. She was so hard on herself. And I was hard on my parents, you know, after that. And one thing I've learned - and I think that one thing that Arleen has come around to a bit - is to say, look, this is not just us. You know, we're part of a broader story here. If this is happening to millions of people, it's not something that can just be thrust on us as an evidence of our irresponsibility or missteps. There's something bigger going on. GROSS: If you don't mind saying, what kind of financial trouble did your family run into? DESMOND: My dad was between jobs. He was a preacher. And, you know, that's not a super lucrative career in a small town. And he left the church and was in between jobs and ended up finishing his career as a prison chaplain. And my mom just held down whatever job she could get in a small Arizona town where I grew up. GROSS: What did your parents do when they were foreclosed on? Where did they go? DESMOND: So my parents and my younger sister moved into a small rented home in the middle of town. We had before been a bit out of town. And they lived there for several years until they finally were able to move out by us on the East Coast. GROSS: What did it mean to you to lose the home you grew up in? DESMOND: Whenever we went back to visit them in our small town, we'd often drive by our old home. And we'd look at it. We'd criticize people's painting jobs, you know, because it still felt a bit like ours - you know, that it had been taken from us. And I remember that home fondly. I remember feeling safe in it. I remember Easter egg hunts and Christmas in it. And so there was something beyond just a financial hit. There was something about losing those memories in a way and that sense of place. We didn't lose it on our own terms. GROSS: Is that foreclosure one of the reasons why you've studied evictions? DESMOND: I don't know. I don't think so. But it's something that I felt I had to write about. In fact, I wasn't going to put that detail in the book, and my brilliant editor Amanda Cook made me because, you know, she's - you know, how could you not? And she was right, as she is about everything. And I don't know. It might have got in there somewhere. But, I mean, what I remember is going to college thinking that America worked a certain way, thinking that America was fair and that there was an even playing field. And if you worked hard, you could get ahead. And, you know, I thought I might want to be a lawyer. And I started taking classes in history and justice studies and was confronted with a set of facts that really flew in the face of my story. You know, is this how much racial inequality we have in this country? You know, is the American dream so blunted? And that's when I started spending, you know, when I wasn't working, you know, spending time in the library really trying to get after those questions. And I started spending a lot of time with homeless people that lived around my campus. And that's kind of how I got started in just like this curiosity about poverty in America. Why does this land of riches have so much poverty? Why are we the richest democracy with such severe levels of destitution? And that's the question that still propels me today. GROSS: I want to point out that when you say your editor insisted that you put your family's foreclosure in the book, it's in the epilogue and there's maybe a paragraph (laughter). You're not going into a lot of detail about it. DESMOND: That's right, yeah. Maybe I should say she nudged me to do it. GROSS: Yeah. OK. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: So one of the things you can do on your Eviction Lab website is to look at the city where you live and see rates compared to other cities when it comes to eviction. People usually like to be in the top 10. You don't want to be in the top 10 in this particular listing. I was glad Philly was (inaudible) somewhere in the 80s. But Virginia had five cities in the top 10. What's going on in Virginia? DESMOND: That's right. So I'm not going to let Philly off the hook so easily, though. You still have way too many evictions than you should. It is surprising to me that a fairly big low-cost city like Philly has so many evections. But you're right. If you look at the map, you see evictions concentrated in the Southeast. And this was surprising to us, you know. And when we talk about the housing crisis, we often usually talk about the coasts or most-expensive cities where rents have skyrocketed. But what this unveils is that eviction has this huge effect in fairly low-cost cities and communities all across the Southeast - 1 in 9 renter homes in Richmond are evicted every single year. In Norfolk, Va. , it's about that rate as well. It's a state that is hosting a tremendous amount of evictions every year. And the thing is I don't fully understand why. We don't know. And so what this eviction data allow us to do is ask questions that we couldn't ask before, look at patterns that were invisible to us before and really ask city planners, students, parents, everyone to come around the table and really try to kind of look at this problem in their community and get to the bottom of it. GROSS: Matthew Desmond, thank you so much for talking with us. And congratulations on all the work you've done. DESMOND: Thank you for having me. GROSS: My pleasure. Matthew Desmond is the author of \"Evicted\" and the founder of The Eviction Lab based at Princeton University, where he teaches. The lab's website just went up a few days ago, offering us access to its national database of evictions throughout America.

So does it have any effect on people's taxes this year? Just remind us, if you would, about, you know, what happened and what the effect is going to be. WESSEL: Well, it was a big tax cut, as you say, huge by any measure. It cut taxes for a lot of businesses and for some individuals. But this will affect how much money they pay next year. The biggest effect it's having this year is that people are seeing a smaller amount of money taken out of their check each week in withholding because that's the money that's going towards next year's taxes. MARTIN: So there's some big questions about taxes that have yet to be answered. I mean, this bill that was passed was essentially a tax cut. I'm really - I guess I'm wondering what kinds of conversations that people like yourself are having. You know what I mean? Are there still questions or issues about taxes that we still should be talking about? WESSEL: Oh, absolutely. I mean, first of all, this is not sustainable. They cut taxes, in my view, too much. At some point, they're going to have to raise them. So that's the first thing we talk about. The second thing is that they made something simpler, like they did away with the personal exemption you get for each member of your household and increased the standard deduction. But anybody who has a small business, sometimes called pass-throughs, it's incredibly complicated. And then there are some big problems in our society that we look to the tax code to address. And we didn't do anything here to help slow the growth of healthcare spending. And this tax bill will do less to narrow the gap between winners and losers in our economy than the tax code did before the big tax bill. MARTIN: So, David, before we let you go, what's the next conversation we are likely to have about taxes? WESSEL: Well, one possibility is the Democrats do really well in November 2018 and they start to try and raise taxes on businesses and the rich. That's a possibility. Another possibility is even though nobody seems to be worrying about the federal deficit and the federal debt today, at some point, something's going to happen to force that action in Congress on that. And at that point, I think they'll be weighing - how much do we want to raise taxes, and how much do we want to cut spending on retirement and health programs and so forth? And at some point, we're going to think about things like a carbon tax or other taxes that are designed to both raise money and reduce the dangers of global warming. And I think we'll get to that at some point, but I'm not very good at knowing when that will come. MARTIN: That's David Wessel. He's a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings Institution. That's a think tank in Washington, D. C. He joined us from his office there. David Wessel, Thank you. WESSEL: You're welcome. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The deadline to file federal taxes is now. And according to the IRS, a large number of Americans - about 1 in 7, or more than 20 million people - waits until the last week to file. So it's likely that some of us are thinking about the taxes that we need to file or maybe even doing the paperwork as we speak. But even if you're not, this is the time of year when taxes are on our mind, so we thought we'd take a minute to think more broadly about taxes. We called David Wessel for this. He's a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings, which he came to after spending three decades at The Wall Street Journal. David, thanks so much for speaking with us.

S. hit a specific place. Wildfires burn through Southern California. A hurricane floods Texas. Ten years ago a slow-moving disaster swamped the entire country, and it did not leave a single state untouched. The disaster had its own sounds and smells. How often do you still think about those days? SEAN HAHN: You know, I tell you; I - every time I hear a smoke detector beeping like the battery's dead, I have a flashback of the crash. (Laughter) So in my house, when the smoke detector starts beeping, I am up. And I get on a ladder, and I'm changing that thing because all's I have is visions of the past. SHAPIRO: The past meaning the financial crisis. Sean Hahn is a realtor born and raised in Phoenix, Ariz. That beeping takes him right back to those vacant homes. HAHN: There's a - usually a smell associated with it as well. It's the smell of mold because there's a dripping drain somewhere. And nobody's going to fix it because they've walked away from it. So there's a smell of mold. And it makes my throat burn and my eyes itch. SHAPIRO: Sean Hahn is sitting on the patio of a Phoenix bar as the desert heat quickly cools into night. He's been selling houses here for almost 30 years. Through the boom. . . HAHN: We'd put a house on the market, and by noon we'd have 12 offers. SHAPIRO: . . . And the bust. HAHN: People were stealing the copper pipes from the home. SHAPIRO: All year we're going to explore ripples from the financial collapse. Today, memories from people who lived through the housing crisis in Phoenix. On average, homes here lost 56 percent of their value. Foreclosures swept across the city. We talked with people in different parts of the real estate system - homeowners, buyers, locksmiths and realtors like Sean Hahn. He flashes back to the one abandoned house that stood out from the rest. The investor he was with didn't want to go in. HAHN: I go, I need to see this house. And he says, why do you want to see it? I said, 'cause that was my first house. That's the first house I ever purchased. I said, I'm going in. SHAPIRO: He and his wife bought the house in the 1980s and lived there for a few years. In 2012 he let himself in using the lockbox, and the smell of urine hit him. HAHN: They destroyed the house. It was really sad. My wife and I had so much pride in that little home. And we kept it great and painted and planted, you know, flowers and stuff. All that stuff was gone. And there was paint on the walls, like, almost like graffiti and stuff. And they just tore up the house. SHAPIRO: In some of the houses, the vandalism was an expression of rage by homeowners angry at banks that refused to modify interest rates, even drove them into bankruptcy before foreclosure. Fred Decker saw a lot of those kinds of houses. He started work as a locksmith in 2007. Soon he was spending his days changing the locks on vacant homes. FRED DECKER: You would go up to the front door, and you'd put your ear up to the door. And if you heard the beeping of the smoke alarms with low batteries, you could tell nobody lives here. SHAPIRO: He calls the sound of those smoke alarms the heartbeat. Some houses still had clothes in the closets. Some had empty beer bottles in the kitchen. DECKER: There's always Q-tips on the floor. Like, in every foreclosed house that's one thing that there's always on the ground somewhere, usually in the restrooms. But you can find Q-tips everywhere. SHAPIRO: Why? Why Q-tips? DECKER: I have no idea. I think it's just something that whenever you're leaving a house that you don't have to clean, it drops on the floor and who cares? SHAPIRO: Fred Decker had to change the locks on almost two-thirds of the houses in his own neighborhood. But he and his wife stayed in their house even though they bought in 2006 at the peak of the bubble. DECKER: I would sometimes say that if I didn't have bad luck, I would have none. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). DECKER: But, yeah, it really felt like if you could have picked the worst time to buy, we picked it, which still to this day it's making me very nervous about pursuing our next home. You think, OK, I'm finally above water. I can sell. But what if tomorrow it nosedives again and I buy a house at exactly the wrong time? SHAPIRO: Actually, Decker and his wife are still underwater. They hope to be in the black next year. Every time he walked into a foreclosed home during the bust, he thought about his own decision to stay. DECKER: It was strange honestly because I felt kind of like a sucker. Like, here I am paying my bills, and everyone else - I don't know. SHAPIRO: But people who walked away are conflicted, too, like Kristin and Justin Hege. KRISTIN HEGE: I grew up in a small town in Ohio, so the forever home thing was, like, a legit thing. You stayed in your house till, you know, your kids away went to school and that kind of thing. SHAPIRO: The Heges bought the place they thought would be their forever home in 2006. And after the crash, they had a choice - stay underwater for the foreseeable future or get out. The bank agreed to a short sale for less than half of what the Heges originally paid. Justin says it felt like much more than a financial decision. JUSTIN HEGE: I thought that we were doing something wrong personally. Just - that's just how my brain worked. SHAPIRO: Do you mean, like, morally you thought you should have stayed? J. HEGE: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Like. . . J. HEGE: We signed a contract. And so, you know, we felt like we were going back on our word. SHAPIRO: His father had helped them buy the home. J. HEGE: I think of all the things that bothered me was walking away and knowing that he helped us financially get into that house with a down payment. That actually grinded my gears. SHAPIRO: What did he say to you when you told him that? J. HEGE: He was a proponent of getting out. You know, he. . . K. HEGE: It wasn't until he said it I decided it was OK. J. HEGE: Exactly, because I was holding onto some guilt there. SHAPIRO: Today we are at a key moment in the recovery. A short sale or a foreclosure can stay on someone's credit report for seven years. So now waves of people who walked away from their homes are getting back into the housing market. K. HEGE: We have the area big enough for the pingpong table to come down. . . SHAPIRO: Yeah. K. HEGE: . . . And then the kids. SHAPIRO: And also a whole lawn over here. K. HEGE: Right. Yeah. SHAPIRO: The Heges bought their new house in Phoenix last year. This one is well within their means. Justin says they learned a lot during their seven years in credit limbo. J. HEGE: You know, anyone can make a mistake. We made a mistake. We made a dumb choice. So now we'll be able to make another choice. And we're much more fiscally responsible now. SHAPIRO: The crash created a lot of losers but also some winners. When foreclosures started rolling through the city, buyers began to gather on the steps of the Maricopa County Courthouse downtown. They bid on houses selling for a fraction of their former worth. Some of those buyers are still there today. JOHN RAY: I'm John Ray. TONY THOMAS: And I'm Tony Thomas. SHAPIRO: John started doing this in the late '90s. And Tony. . . THOMAS: And I got into it right around the boom, so probably around 2009. SHAPIRO: Now, you might be thinking 2009 wasn't the boom. That was the crash. But for people who buy and resell foreclosed houses. . . THOMAS: Yeah, it was our boom in the foreclosure industry. RAY: Yeah, it was good for us, bad for the housing industry (laughter). SHAPIRO: Back then the auctions were a zoo. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of properties were sold each day. RAY: There was probably 200 people down here, at least three or four auctioneers selling properties at the same time. THOMAS: John was making fun of me back then, calling me Spider-Man 'cause I was jumping over a fence, bidding over there, jumping back over to bid over here. RAY: Everything I bought in 2008 to 2010 within four years doubled in value. SHAPIRO: Did you ever feel, like, a psychological conflict of the fact that you are basically pulling in money hand over fist, and you walk in these houses and it's like, this was someone's life that they had to abandon? RAY: Yes and no because the way we have to look at it is even if we didn't bid and it went, you know, it's still going to sell at foreclosure auction. It's still going back to the bank. So the homeowner is not going to be able to keep the property. They're going to lose the house whether we bid or not. SHAPIRO: Many people we spoke to told us they try not to think about that time in their lives. John Ray has a different take. John, having been here through the boom and seen the crash, do you have any, like, flashback, any post-traumatic stress, any, like, oh, God, is this going to happen again? RAY: I'm actually waiting for it to happen again (laughter). SHAPIRO: He says, that's when we make money. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: So will this happen again? In parts of Phoenix right now home prices are growing 30 percent a year. And some old habits are coming back. House flipping is at an 11-year high. Tomorrow we'll ask whether that should make people worry. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Most disasters in the U. S. hit a specific place. Wildfires burn through Southern California. A hurricane floods Texas.

It's a particular problem in expensive West Coast cities like Los Angeles. A recent study by Zillow showed that for every 5 percent rent increase, 2,000 people could become homeless. NPR's Kirk Siegler introduces us to one working family living on the brink. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: On Exposition Boulevard near the USC campus, bright handmade signs are taped to the exterior windows of a worn stucco apartment building. Stop The Exposition Evictions, they read, Don't Let My Kids Go Homeless. Every few minutes, the Metro Rail whooshes past. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN ON TRACKS)SIEGLER: The train shakes the thin walls of Jimmy Mejia (ph) and his wife, Patty Garrido's (ph), living room. JIMMY MEJIA: It's not easy living in LA, actually. SIEGLER: Jimmy and Patty have four kids and a baby on the way. They both hold down good full-time service jobs as assistant managers at a local pizza chain, and they pay $1,600 a month to rent this cramped three-bedroom unit. MEJIA: Yeah. So, like, you see here? They need to seal all this here. SIEGLER: There are unpatched holes in the ceiling. MEJIA: And look, the hole has just come out. SIEGLER: The sheet rock gave way during a recent storm. There are roaches on the walls. And they pleaded with their old landlord to get things fixed, but then a few months ago, word came that the building was sold. The new owner is going to redevelop it. Everyone's being evicted. Jimmy and Patty are frantic, looking everywhere for a new place in a city where neighborhoods are exploding with gentrification. PATTY GARRIDO: And whatever we find, it's two bedrooms. And even if we want to take it, though, they won't give it to us because we have four girls plus us two. So they say we're a lot of people. SIEGLER: And anyway, they haven't found anything comparable. Most places they've seen rent for $2,500 to $3,000 a month. It would be most of their monthly income. So why don't they just move? Well, they considered it. Sixty, 70 miles outside the city is cheaper, but it's a two-hour commute one way. They only have one car. And it's also not easy leaving a place that's home. GARRIDO: We have our church. We have our family. School. My daughter's been in the same area since pre-K. One of them is in high school, and she's doing pretty good. She's in honor classes. So I don't want to move her. SIEGLER: Patty Garrido and Jimmy Mejia know they are living right on the brink of homelessness, even though they're both employed and can afford to pay their bills and make rent. GARRIDO: Are we going to have to stay in our car for a few days? Are we going to have to get a hotel? I mean, we don't know. SIEGLER: Don't think that this couple with two full-time jobs is some exception. In Los Angeles, 600,000 people are said to be extremely rent burdened, meaning they spend more than half their income on rent. More than 8,000 people here became homeless for the first time last year, and that includes working families living in their cars or in tents. TRACY ROSENTHAL: We are reaching levels of inequality that we have not seen since the Gilded Age. It's probably time to bring back some of the tactics. SIEGLER: This is Tracy Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Tenants Union. The group helps organize tenant boycotts against things like rent increases and gentrification. She says it's so bad the government needs to intervene. ROSENTHAL: We have a shortage of fairness, not a shortage of homes. SIEGLER: She says the quickest fix is tighter rent control. That's long been a touchy political topic in California, where developers have held a lot of political clout from Sacramento to the LA City Hall. ERIC GARCETTI: If you want to know California right now, this will make or break this state. SIEGLER: In an interview in his office, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti says his city needs more housing for all income levels, especially as the economy has rebounded and brought in high-paying tech companies. GARCETTI: If we don't solve our affordable housing crisis, at the bottom end, this homelessness epidemic will continue. At the top end, the middle class will leave. SIEGLER: Garcetti says there is stuff happening after a lot of years of political gridlock and budget fights. Voters recently approved a sales tax hike to build more housing and support programs to get people off the streets.

I've never been more depressed walking the street just as an everyday Angeleno and more optimistic as a policymaker. SIEGLER: Still, all that stuff isn't going to do much for Jimmy Mejia and his family right now. He's the kind of worker that the economy needs. A couple miles south of City Hall, Mejia's starting his shift as the evening manager at Blaze Pizza. MEJIA: I'm just coming in right now. SIEGLER: It's adjacent to the USC campus and about a mile from his apartment. A lot of his customers are more affluent students, and they're driving up demand for better housing in this once-blighted part of LA. Mejia is stressed, says he's losing sleep. MEJIA: I don't try to cry in front of my wife. But, emotionally it's hard for me. Very hard. And I know she cries, too. I know she does. But we try not to do it in front of the kids. SIEGLER: For now they're just focused on fighting their pending eviction in court early next month. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Los Angeles. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: And this note about former first lady Barbara Bush. After a series of health troubles, it's been announced she will not seek additional medical treatment. The office of former President George H. W. Bush shared this news in a statement over the weekend. Barbara Bush is 92 years old and has been in and out of the hospital in recent months. The statement says, quote, \"she is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving. \" RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to take a closer look now at the link between skyrocketing rents and homelessness. It's a particular problem in expensive West Coast cities like Los Angeles. A recent study by Zillow showed that for every 5 percent rent increase, 2,000 people could become homeless. NPR's Kirk Siegler introduces us to one working family living on the brink. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: On Exposition Boulevard near the USC campus, bright handmade signs are taped to the exterior windows of a worn stucco apartment building. Stop The Exposition Evictions, they read, Don't Let My Kids Go Homeless. Every few minutes, the Metro Rail whooshes past. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN ON TRACKS) SIEGLER: The train shakes the thin walls of Jimmy Mejia (ph) and his wife, Patty Garrido's (ph), living room. JIMMY MEJIA: It's not easy living in LA, actually. SIEGLER: Jimmy and Patty have four kids and a baby on the way. They both hold down good full-time service jobs as assistant managers at a local pizza chain, and they pay $1,600 a month to rent this cramped three-bedroom unit. MEJIA: Yeah. So, like, you see here? They need to seal all this here. SIEGLER: There are unpatched holes in the ceiling. MEJIA: And look, the hole has just come out. SIEGLER: The sheet rock gave way during a recent storm. There are roaches on the walls. And they pleaded with their old landlord to get things fixed, but then a few months ago, word came that the building was sold. The new owner is going to redevelop it. Everyone's being evicted. Jimmy and Patty are frantic, looking everywhere for a new place in a city where neighborhoods are exploding with gentrification. PATTY GARRIDO: And whatever we find, it's two bedrooms. And even if we want to take it, though, they won't give it to us because we have four girls plus us two. So they say we're a lot of people. SIEGLER: And anyway, they haven't found anything comparable. Most places they've seen rent for $2,500 to $3,000 a month. It would be most of their monthly income. So why don't they just move? Well, they considered it. Sixty, 70 miles outside the city is cheaper, but it's a two-hour commute one way. They only have one car. And it's also not easy leaving a place that's home. GARRIDO: We have our church. We have our family. School. My daughter's been in the same area since pre-K. One of them is in high school, and she's doing pretty good. She's in honor classes. So I don't want to move her. SIEGLER: Patty Garrido and Jimmy Mejia know they are living right on the brink of homelessness, even though they're both employed and can afford to pay their bills and make rent. GARRIDO: Are we going to have to stay in our car for a few days? Are we going to have to get a hotel? I mean, we don't know. SIEGLER: Don't think that this couple with two full-time jobs is some exception. In Los Angeles, 600,000 people are said to be extremely rent burdened, meaning they spend more than half their income on rent. More than 8,000 people here became homeless for the first time last year, and that includes working families living in their cars or in tents. TRACY ROSENTHAL: We are reaching levels of inequality that we have not seen since the Gilded Age. It's probably time to bring back some of the tactics. SIEGLER: This is Tracy Rosenthal of the Los Angeles Tenants Union. The group helps organize tenant boycotts against things like rent increases and gentrification. She says it's so bad the government needs to intervene. ROSENTHAL: We have a shortage of fairness, not a shortage of homes. SIEGLER: She says the quickest fix is tighter rent control. That's long been a touchy political topic in California, where developers have held a lot of political clout from Sacramento to the LA City Hall. ERIC GARCETTI: If you want to know California right now, this will make or break this state. SIEGLER: In an interview in his office, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti says his city needs more housing for all income levels, especially as the economy has rebounded and brought in high-paying tech companies. GARCETTI: If we don't solve our affordable housing crisis, at the bottom end, this homelessness epidemic will continue. At the top end, the middle class will leave. SIEGLER: Garcetti says there is stuff happening after a lot of years of political gridlock and budget fights. Voters recently approved a sales tax hike to build more housing and support programs to get people off the streets. And there's a new fee on developers to pay for new low-income housing for people at risk of being homeless. GARCETTI: We've never had what we have right now. I've never been more depressed walking the street just as an everyday Angeleno and more optimistic as a policymaker. SIEGLER: Still, all that stuff isn't going to do much for Jimmy Mejia and his family right now. He's the kind of worker that the economy needs.

We're looking for a small group of motivated individuals to join our real estate investing team. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: A couple of months ago, this ad started running in heavy rotation on commercial radio stations here in Washington, D. C. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Where you can learn how to make a lot of money flipping homes. SHAPIRO: Flipping homes - buy, renovate, sell, make money. I decided to call the number in the ad. Could you just tell me what this program is? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: OK, this program is a free two-hour workshop where we're going to be teaching you how to get started flipping houses right there in your local area by utilizing other people's money to finance your own deals. SHAPIRO: And these kinds of workshops are popping up all over the country right now. That's because 10 years after the housing crisis, house flipping has made a big comeback. There are dozens of shows about it made by networks like HGTV or A&E. There's \"Beach Flip\". . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"BEACH FLIP\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: We'll renovate these dated waterfront fixer-uppers. SHAPIRO: . . . \"Desert Flippers\". . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"DESERT FLIPPERS\")LINDSEY BENNETT: In this kind of heat you've got to have a pool. SHAPIRO: . . . \"Five Day Flip\". . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FIVE DAY FLIP\")CHERIE BARBER: We've got to have this whole property finished by Friday. SHAPIRO: . . . And \"Phoenix Flipped. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"PHOENIX FLIPPED\")ELISHA SANDER: The flipping business is insane. DELANEY ROTTA: I think this is what, like, Mom used to have in their old house. SANDER: Dingy, stinky basement. ROTTA: We buy, sell and renovate homes here in Phoenix. SHAPIRO: All this year we're looking at what has changed and what hasn't on the 10th anniversary of the financial collapse. Today house flipping is at an 11-year high in the United States. Last time people were flipping this many houses was during the bubble when house prices were increasing by 40 or 50 percent every year in some places. Back then, some flippers weren't even renovating houses. They were just buying and riding the housing bubble to resell for more money until the bubble popped. Phoenix, Ariz. , is an important place to look at this. DAREN BLOMQUIST: Phoenix is definitely a bellwether. SHAPIRO: Daren Blomquist is with a company called ATTOM Data Solutions. They collect real estate filings from all over the U. S. and put the information into a database so people can look for patterns nationally and locally. He defines flipping as reselling a house after less than a year. BLOMQUIST: For the year 2017, Phoenix had over 8,500 single-family homes that were flipped. And that's the most of any metro area that we analyzed nationwide, which - we looked at 174 metro areas. SHAPIRO: So I went to see what's happening and look at whether we should worry about old bad habits returning along with the flippers. We've just climbed to the top of Camelback Mountain, which is about 2,000 feet over the city of Phoenix. And we can see the sprawl stretching out in every direction. And it's dense with single-family homes. So there aren't a lot of high-rises. There aren't a lot of apartment buildings. There aren't a lot of opportunities to put more people in the central part of the city, which is where people want to live right now. And that's one of the incentives for so many people to remodel and flip homes. LAUREN ROSIN: So this was actually a courtyard. And I blew it out, expanded the roof. And that's going to be a beautiful, large kitchen. SHAPIRO: When I climbed down the mountain, I met a couple of house flippers in a partially rehabbed home in an upscale neighborhood full of yucca plants and saguaro cactuses. Lauren Rosin and Brad Pickett could easily have their own HGTV show. They look like people who do CrossFit with perfect hair and stylish clothes. And they clearly know their material. They got into real estate during the bubble. So I asked them to explain the difference between what flippers were doing then and now. BRAD PICKETT: We both used to do loans. And they had a non - no income, no asset loan called a NINA. And literally, if you had above a 700 FICO, you didn't have to prove your income or prove any assets. You could get the loan. SHAPIRO: Now he buys the houses and she rehabs them. They say it's harder to make money in flipping today. You have to really know what you're doing, and the margins are not as big. We're in a moment right now where Phoenix real estate prices in some parts of the city are growing 30 percent in a year. ROSIN: (Sighing). SHAPIRO: What does that big sigh mean? ROSIN: It's too fast. I think you're going to see a small adjustment. You're never going to - you're not going to see the crash that we saw again anytime soon. There's many reasons why. I mean, a lot of people have skin in the game right now. A lot of people have equity in their homes. SHAPIRO: She says before the crash, people bought houses and rented them out while they waited for housing prices to keep climbing. Renting out the houses wasn't the point. The point was to ride the bubble. Some people even lost money on the rental income. So when home prices went down, lots of people just walked away from those mortgages. ROSIN: And they were like, well, why are we keeping this home? I have nothing to gain from keeping it. So a lot of people threw their hands up in the air. SHAPIRO: There's new research showing that Lauren Rosin is exactly right. Yes, some of the housing crisis fell on people who bought and lived in a home they couldn't afford. But researchers are just now coming to understand that a big part of the problem was people with better-than-average credit scores who owned multiple homes. These were not subprime buyers. Some of them were landlords. Others were flippers. Stefania Albanesi is an economist at the University of Pittsburgh. She's been studying this. STEFANIA ALBANESI: These borrowers, you know, looking to buy their second, third and fourth homes would tend to go to nonconventional lenders and would tend to obtain loans through nonstandard products such as adjustable rate mortgages and so on. And so these loans are more expensive. They have higher interest rates. And so other things equal - you know, it's more likely that these borrowers might default. SHAPIRO: In other words, 10 years ago flippers were part of the problem. And today Brad Pickett says there are so many flippers in the market he has a hard time finding properties to buy. PICKETT: For example, to get one deal under contract it costs us $6,000 in direct mail. So we've gone on to other things such as voice broadcasting, Press 1 transfers. SHAPIRO: Oh, wait. You're responsible for the calls I get. . . ROSIN: Yes. SHAPIRO: . . . On my cellphone that are like. . . ROSIN: Yes. SHAPIRO: . . . Do you want to sell your home? I have an interested buyer on the line. Please hold. That's you? PICKETT: That might be me, yeah. ROSIN: That's him. Yeah. PICKETT: That's - that could probably be me (laughter). ROSIN: (Unintelligible). SHAPIRO: Glad I could meet you face to face so that I can tell you how obnoxious that is. PICKETT: Do you actually have a home for sale? SHAPIRO: I have a home. It is not for sale. PICKETT: OK. ROSIN: Yet. Everything has a price. SHAPIRO: (Laughter). PICKETT: Next time, press two. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) All right. So flippers contributed to the housing crisis. House flipping is now at an 11-year high. Should people be alarmed? Mark Stapp says probably not. He teaches real estate development at Arizona State University's business school. MARK STAPP: The issues we had previously with abuse through manipulating appraisals - that really isn't happening. SHAPIRO: So lenders are being much more cautious than they were 10 years ago. STAPP: Absolutely they are. SHAPIRO: But I see these weekend workshops that are like, learn how to flip houses and make tens of thousands of dollars in no time or HGTV shows that make it look like you can do this on a weekend and make an extra income. And I - it sounds like people are getting encouraged to dip a toe in this water who don't know how to swim. STAPP: And it drives me insane because the number of issues related to this business that affect success are far greater than those TV shows ever express. And they simplify how you deal with them to the point where it's actually dangerous. SHAPIRO: And that's not creating risk for everyone in the housing market? STAPP: I think it's such a small number, Ari. I don't think that it is to the point where it so dramatically affects the market that the market gets hurt by it. SHAPIRO: So if you want to start a side business house flipping in your spare time, the good news is you probably won't decimate the global economy, but no guarantees that you'll turn a profit either.

S. has entered into high-level talks with North Korea. The president made that announcement at his private resort in South Florida where he's meeting today and tomorrow with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two are talking about the North Korean nuclear threat as well as trade differences and their plan to sneak in a round of golf tomorrow. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from West Palm Beach, Fla. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good evening, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us about these high-level talks the president mentioned with North Korea - seems like he's come a long way from calling Kim Jong Un Little Rocket Man. HORSLEY: (Laughter) Indeed he has, Ari. You know, last month, the president surprised just about everyone really when he accepted Kim Jong Un's invitation to a summit meeting. And in anticipation of that summit, Trump says the U. S. has been engaging in some high-level diplomacy with Pyongyang. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have had direct talks at very high levels - extremely high levels - with North Korea. And I really believe there's a lot of goodwill. Lot of good things are happening. We'll see what happens. As I always say, we'll see what happens. HORSLEY: No date has been set yet for the meeting with Kim, although Trump says it could come in early June, maybe a little sooner than that. He also says the two sides are looking at five possible locations for the meeting. SHAPIRO: This worries Japan's prime minister, who is President Trump's guest at this week's summit. Explain why this is of concern to Japan. HORSLEY: Shinzo Abe worries that despite his tough rhetoric towards North Korea, President Trump might come away from his meeting with Kim having agreed to something less than a full dismantling of North Korea's nuclear and missile program. Obviously Japan is a much closer target for North Korea than the United States is. And so Abe spoke to reporters this afternoon through an interpreter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Through interpreter) I'd like to underscore the importance of achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization as well as the abandonment of missile programs of North Korea. HORSLEY: Now, White House aides say Japan has no need to be concerned, that not only is Trump himself hawkish when it comes to North Korea and its nuclear weapons, but he's got a hawkish new national security adviser in John Bolton to argue against any backsliding. SHAPIRO: The other big focus of this meeting is trade. And I know Japan's not happy with Trump's new steel tariffs. Explain the dynamic there. HORSLEY: Yeah. Japan is really feeling the pinch of those new tariffs - 25 percent on imported steel. Other big steel suppliers like Canada and South Korea got an exemption from those tariffs, but Japan did not. This could be President Trump's way of putting pressure on Japan to enter into some sort of bilateral trade talks. But so far, Tokyo has shown no interest of that - in that. Japan is party, however, to the big Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation - now 11-nation deal that Trump pulled out of. Last week, Trump floated the idea that maybe the U. S. will re-enter the TPP, but his economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, cast some doubt on that today about whether that's going anywhere. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LARRY KUDLOW: For the American side at the moment, it's more of a thought than a policy. That's for sure. HORSLEY: Trump himself has said the U. S. would only re-enter the TPP if it could get better terms, and that doesn't seem terribly likely. SHAPIRO: Also important on the agenda - golf (laughter). President Trump and Shinzo Abe are going to play a round tomorrow. HORSLEY: Yes. Aides had insisted in the run-up to this meeting that there was no time for golf, that this was a working meeting. But in a not terribly surprising development, Trump himself said they will try to sneak off and play a round tomorrow morning. He and Abe are both avid golfers. When Abe visited Trump just after the 2016 election at Trump Tower, he presented the president-elect with a fancy golf driver. And they bonded on the links both here in Florida and in Japan. Some history here, Ari - Abe's dad was also prime minister, and he once played golf with then-President Eisenhower. SHAPIRO: NPR's Scott Horsley speaking with us from West Palm Beach, Fla. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. SHAPIRO: And one final note - at this hour, The Washington Post is reporting that CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who is nominated to be secretary of state, made a secret trip to North Korea weeks ago, where he met with Kim Jong Un. NPR has not independently confirmed that report. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  President Trump said today the U. S. has entered into high-level talks with North Korea. The president made that announcement at his private resort in South Florida where he's meeting today and tomorrow with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two are talking about the North Korean nuclear threat as well as trade differences and their plan to sneak in a round of golf tomorrow. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from West Palm Beach, Fla. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good evening, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us about these high-level talks the president mentioned with North Korea - seems like he's come a long way from calling Kim Jong Un Little Rocket Man. HORSLEY: (Laughter) Indeed he has, Ari. You know, last month, the president surprised just about everyone really when he accepted Kim Jong Un's invitation to a summit meeting. And in anticipation of that summit, Trump says the U. S. has been engaging in some high-level diplomacy with Pyongyang. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have had direct talks at very high levels - extremely high levels - with North Korea. And I really believe there's a lot of goodwill. Lot of good things are happening. We'll see what happens. As I always say, we'll see what happens. HORSLEY: No date has been set yet for the meeting with Kim, although Trump says it could come in early June, maybe a little sooner than that. He also says the two sides are looking at five possible locations for the meeting. SHAPIRO: This worries Japan's prime minister, who is President Trump's guest at this week's summit. Explain why this is of concern to Japan. HORSLEY: Shinzo Abe worries that despite his tough rhetoric towards North Korea, President Trump might come away from his meeting with Kim having agreed to something less than a full dismantling of North Korea's nuclear and missile program. Obviously Japan is a much closer target for North Korea than the United States is. And so Abe spoke to reporters this afternoon through an interpreter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Through interpreter) I'd like to underscore the importance of achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization as well as the abandonment of missile programs of North Korea. HORSLEY: Now, White House aides say Japan has no need to be concerned, that not only is Trump himself hawkish when it comes to North Korea and its nuclear weapons, but he's got a hawkish new national security adviser in John Bolton to argue against any backsliding. SHAPIRO: The other big focus of this meeting is trade. And I know Japan's not happy with Trump's new steel tariffs. Explain the dynamic there. HORSLEY: Yeah. Japan is really feeling the pinch of those new tariffs - 25 percent on imported steel. Other big steel suppliers like Canada and South Korea got an exemption from those tariffs, but Japan did not. This could be President Trump's way of putting pressure on Japan to enter into some sort of bilateral trade talks. But so far, Tokyo has shown no interest of that - in that. Japan is party, however, to the big Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation - now 11-nation deal that Trump pulled out of. Last week, Trump floated the idea that maybe the U. S. will re-enter the TPP, but his economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, cast some doubt on that today about whether that's going anywhere. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY KUDLOW: For the American side at the moment, it's more of a thought than a policy. That's for sure. HORSLEY: Trump himself has said the U. S. would only re-enter the TPP if it could get better terms, and that doesn't seem terribly likely. SHAPIRO: Also important on the agenda - golf (laughter). President Trump and Shinzo Abe are going to play a round tomorrow. HORSLEY: Yes. Aides had insisted in the run-up to this meeting that there was no time for golf, that this was a working meeting. But in a not terribly surprising development, Trump himself said they will try to sneak off and play a round tomorrow morning. He and Abe are both avid golfers. When Abe visited Trump just after the 2016 election at Trump Tower, he presented the president-elect with a fancy golf driver. And they bonded on the links both here in Florida and in Japan.

But in a global economy, putting tariffs on imports can have unintended consequences. NPR's Jim Zarroli looks at how steel tariffs will affect the canned goods business. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Pacific Coast Producers is as a co-op representing 168 family farms in California. CEO Dan Vincent says each year, the company sells more than 700,000 tons of fruit. DAN VINCENT: Peaches, pears, apricots, grapes and tomatoes. ZARROLI: The company cans the fruit and sells it to supermarkets and hospitals. Pacific Coast Producers doesn't make the cans it uses. It buys them from manufacturers in the United States. Cans are made of steel coated in something called tinplate. There was a time when virtually all tinplate used in the United States was made here. In the 1950s, U. S. Steel put out this film about how it was made. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're always glad to talk about our tinplate. We take a sheet of steel and put a protective coat of tin over it. Then you have tinplate. ZARROLI: But today, most American steelmakers don't make a lot of tinplate. Dan Vincent says it's not profitable enough. VINCENT: The U. S. - they don't even have the ability to do it, nor do I think they want to do it. There are other higher margin businesses they've focused on. ZARROLI: So more than 60 percent of the tinplate used today is imported from places such as South Korea and Europe. The Trump administration is deciding whether to permanently exempt some countries from the tariffs. But if the tariffs do go through, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross insists the impact on prices should be negligible. Ross appeared on CNBC recently holding up a soup can. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILBUR ROSS: So if that goes up by 25 percent, that's about six-tenths of one cent on the price of a can of Campbell's soup. So who in the world is going to be too bothered by six-tenths of a cent? ZARROLI: And Ross isn't wrong, says Dan Vincent. The tariffs probably won't add much to his costs, but the canned goods business is really struggling right now. Customers more and more prefer fresh produce. Companies such as Vincent's face intense competition from imports, especially from China. Profit margins are very small, and Vincent says that extra costs from the tariffs could actually wipe out a good part of this year's profits. VINCENT: That one cost increase is more than half of what we'll make. ZARROLI: And that same dynamic is playing out across a lot of industries. Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations says tariffs are great if you're a steelmaker. EDWARD ALDEN: But if you're a steel user - and, you know, the number of steel users in the United States vastly outnumbers the number of steel producers - your costs have gone up. ZARROLI: And when costs go up, companies have to deal with it. The higher cost could force Pacific Coast Producers to raise its prices. And here's the ironic thing. Vincent says all of his foreign competitors who now import canned fruit into the United States - they're not affected by the tariffs. VINCENT: They won't hurt our Chinese competitors at all because they import a finished good. You know, that's classified as canned peaches. It's not classified as steel. So a steel tariff doesn't apply. ZARROLI: So the tariffs will actually place Pacific Coast Producers at a disadvantage against foreign imports. Can makers have asked to be exempted from the tariffs, arguing that they can't get all the tinplate they need domestically. But the government has gotten hundreds of similar requests, and it's likely to take many months to wade through them. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

NPR's John Ydstie reports the industry's favored treatment goes back centuries. DOUGLAS IRWIN: Well, if we're talking about tariff protection, it goes back right from the very beginning. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: That's Dartmouth professor Douglas Irwin. In his book \"Clashing Over Commerce: A History Of U. S. Trade Policy,\" Irwin writes that protection for metal producers began way back in the 1790s. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)YDSTIE: Iron forges, the forerunners of the modern steel industry, were sprouting in Pennsylvania. Tariffs, or taxes, on products like imported horseshoes and rifle barrels protected the fledgling industry from foreign competition. A century later, politicians were still making a name for themselves shielding the industry. IRWIN: There was a guy called William Pig Iron Kelley, a representative from Pennsylvania, who just championed the iron and steel interests and always was pushing for higher tariffs in the late 19th century after the Civil War. YDSTIE: Now fast-forward to World War II. Newsreels shown in movie theaters across the nation highlight the steel industry's contribution to the war effort. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Long lines of new heavy tanks bear witness to the need for steel and more steel. Here is one of the many tank depots which stretch across the American continent - tanks finished, armed and ready for shipment to the battlefronts of this global war. YDSTIE: The war decimated steel production in Europe and Japan. Meanwhile, U. S. steelmakers thrived. So after the war, there was no need for protection. But the industry faltered in the 1970s. As this California Newsreel documentary explains, U. S. steel companies failed to invest in modern equipment. Meanwhile, foreign competitors rebuilt with the latest technology. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE BUSINESS OF AMERICA\")UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: By the mid-70s, Japanese productivity had surpassed us. We had lost our technological lead. And lower-cost, imported steel captured up to 23 percent of the domestic market. YDSTIE: During the next decade, outdated U. S. plants were shuttered. More than 100,000 steelworkers lost their jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Freeze the rent. My money's spent. YDSTIE: Communities were devastated. As the industry struggled, says Irwin, the U. S. government stepped in again with special protections. IRWIN: Just about every president has renewed or extended those special import quotas or voluntary export restraints or various extra, above and beyond the tariff, way of protecting the domestic industry. YDSTIE: In the 1980s, the industry was disrupted by mini-mills, high-tech plants that melt down scrap metal to make steel - but with far fewer workers. Then, in the early 1990s, Irwin says, the first President Bush began to try to phase out protections. And the Clinton administration followed suit. IRWIN: After the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, there was a surge of steel imports. And they said no to the industry. They said, those times have passed. You've gotten many years of adjustment assistance, and so we're not going to help you. YDSTIE: But in the election of the year 2000, George W. Bush's campaign went to West Virginia promising to help steelworkers. And his administration eventually reinstituted special tariffs to help the industry. Irwin says politicians are motivated to protect steel because, historically, it's been concentrated in politically important states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. IRWIN: The reason why the steel industry gets protected is not because it's saving jobs because, ultimately, it's not. It's really saving a very politically powerful industry that history has shown has been very much able to get politicians to act on their behalf. YDSTIE: And then there's the aura of steel as the indispensable industry, a sentiment President Trump voiced as he authorized the new tariffs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely vital. Steel is steel. You don't have steel, you don't have a country. YDSTIE: A lot of countries think that way. That's why steel gets protected worldwide. And that's why the new U. S. tariffs are justified, says Roger Newport, the CEO of AK Steel. ROGER NEWPORT: This is not protection. This is ensuring there is a level playing field. We've been in a trade war with China and other countries for a long time, and we've been losing it. YDSTIE: Newport says his company will continue to invest in technology to compete better globally. But professor Irwin says that likely means more jobs will disappear. IRWIN: One thing about competition and technological change - it's always forcing firms to become more efficient. And the steel industry has responded. And as a result, the number of worker-hours it takes to produce a ton of steel has really plummeted in the United States. YDSTIE: In 1980, it took 10 worker-hours to produce a ton of steel. Today, Irwin says, it takes only two hours. And employment in the industry has declined by 80 percent from its peak six decades ago. Irwin says, the Trump tariffs won't reverse that trend.

The unemployment rate was 3. 9 percent last month. Yep, the lowest rate since the year 2000. What's more, April was the 91st straight month of job gains. But that hasn't brought along big pay raises. NPR's John Ydstie is here to tell us why. Welcome to the studio. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So employers say they can't find enough workers now, right? And then economists say that when that sort of thing happens, usually, wages are supposed to go up. So what is going on? What's the disconnect. YDSTIE: That's a good question. Many companies now are so desperate for workers that they're actually recruiting teenagers, or they're giving former inmates a chance and even overlooking marijuana use to find the people they need. But the April data showed that wages rose just 2. 6 percent in the past year. And that's about the same slow rate we've been seeing over the past several years. Now, 17 years ago, the last time unemployment was at this very low level, wages were rising between 3 and 4 percent a year. CORNISH: So what's different this time around? YDSTIE: Well, I talked to an economist named Andrew Chamberlain about this today. He works at the online job site Glassdoor. And this is the first thing he told me. ANDREW CHAMBERLAIN: Today, you have high-earning baby boomers leaving the labor force, and they are being replaced by young workers at the beginning of their career earning their lowest pay of their career. So that composition is pulling down wage gains. CORNISH: So he's saying, essentially, all of these older workers leaving their jobs - they're taking those, like, high salaries with them. And younger, cheaper workers are coming in. Is that the story? YDSTIE: Right. Right. And there are other factors. Lots of employers are offering bonuses now rather than increases in base pay. And those bonuses don't show up in the hourly wage data we get in this monthly employment report. And some other forms of compensation don't show up in the hourly wages, either, like health benefits or retirement contributions, maybe a life insurance that your company helps you pay for. Many employers are offering those things instead of wage increases. And, in fact, some of those broader measures of total compensation have been rising faster than hourly wages. CORNISH: Of course, it's worth noting here that we've been talking in averages. But when you look at individual sectors, John, what patterns do you see when it comes to pay? YDSTIE: Well, some high-tech jobs are seeing much greater wage gains than the average 2 1/2 percent a year - and many jobs in health care, too. But obviously, some job categories have to be doing worse than the average. And certain professional jobs are being affected by automation and the Web, including insurance agents. People are buying insurance on the Web now. CORNISH: It's interesting, John - you probably could've said the same thing about travel agents at one time, right? YDSTIE: Right. CORNISH: So should we expect this trend of slower wage growth to continue even if the unemployment rate somehow continues to fall? YDSTIE: You know, Audie, virtually all economists at the Fed and in the private sector say, eventually, we'll see wages rise faster as the unemployment rate drops. And it's difficult for them to imagine a world where that doesn't happen. I guess we'll just see. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

The suspense goes on. Amazon is soon going to announce a new shorter list of locations it is considering to host a second headquarters, and the bidding race is super competitive. At stake are some 50,000 jobs with an average salary of six figures. The bids from the Washington, D. C. , area really stand out for a particular lack of teamwork. NPR's Alina Selyukh met up with Martin Austermuhle from member station WAMU. He's been covering the politics of wooing Amazon. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Martin and I are on a bridge behind a landmark transit hub in Washington, D. C. It's called Union Station. This is a fast-growing neighborhood, one of several being pitched for Amazon's HQ2. MARTIN AUSTERMUHLE, BYLINE: Union Station is behind us. The train tracks kind of stretch in front of us heading north out of the city. SELYUKH: How far are we from Maryland and Virginia here? AUSTERMUHLE: I think five or six miles in any one direction. SELYUKH: In another universe, the District of Columbia and nearby parts of Maryland and Virginia could easily be one giant city. Everyone here rides the same Metro, comes out to the same baseball and football games, either works for the federal government or knows someone who does. But when it came to wooing Amazon, three parts of this one metro area - Washington, Northern Virginia and the Montgomery County in Maryland - decided to compete. AUSTERMUHLE: It would stand to reason that this is exactly the sort of place - these are elected officials that interact on a daily basis - they could've sat down and had a conversation and said, listen, we all want Amazon HQ2 to come to the region. Let's not make it more expensive for each of us individually by one-upping each other with incentives. SELYUKH: Did that happen? AUSTERMUHLE: No. SELYUKH: It did happen in other large metro areas. For example, places like Denver or Dallas drew the entire region into one pitch. In fact, Amazon encouraged local governments to join forces for a unified bid. But the nation's capital is special with so many suburbs belonging to two completely different states and so different taxpayers and different governors who all want to bring home their own bacon. VICTOR HOSKINS: You have to see that you can't do it alone. You know, you can't confront the challenge alone. You have to see you've got to confront it together. SELYUKH: Victor Hoskins is with Arlington County, Northern Va. He says it takes a major breakthrough, something like tackling the regional subway system to convince separate states to spend their taxpayer money on one joint mission. HOSKINS: That's the kind of conclusion that the jurisdictions have to come to, and it's not an easy one to come to. People sometimes can't agree on what movie to go to. SELYUKH: Hoskins has a word for the relationship in the region. HOSKINS: Co-opitition (ph). And I call us frenemies. SELYUKH: And not just any kind of frenemies but frenemies who generously borrow each other's backyards. All three finalist bids around here tout many of the same perks - airports in Virginia and Maryland, universities and museums in D. C. and some of the smartest workers in the country. And what I haven't mentioned yet is that there was a fourth bid from the D. C. metro region, one that didn't make the finalist list. It came from Maryland's Prince George's County. Economic Development chief David Iannucci says they crafted their own pitch because Maryland's governor basically told all counties to fend for themselves. DAVID IANNUCCI: So I think there's a very strong chance we didn't make the cut because of the way that happened. SELYUKH: When you met with Amazon, did they. . . IANNUCCI: They cited the No. 1 reason that we didn't make the cut was an absence of senior software development engineers. SELYUKH: This is a bit ironic because we're talking about a county that's home to the University of Maryland, College Park, which has a top-rated computer science program and definitely features in the bids that did make the cut. Iannucci says he tried to explain this to Amazon, but. . . IANNUCCI: It's like saying your teenage date, take me back. SELYUKH: Lately, the three D. C. -area finalists have been taking great pains to say that they aren't actually rivals. The governors of Maryland and Virginia, along with the mayor of Washington, wrote a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos reassuring him they are, quote, \"much more than just neighbors. \" They say they are partners with a shared vision for the future. Meanwhile, Martin has been digging into how the three are competing financially. AUSTERMUHLE: Maryland is offering one of the biggest buckets of money that anyone knows about - some $5 billion worth of tax breaks and other perks. We don't really know what Virginia is offering. And D. C. shared a document about its financial incentives but redacted some of the juiciest details. SELYUKH: The bottom line is this for local officials - even if Amazon's workers come from the whole region, and even if the whole region benefits from the prestige, it's the winning location that gets most of those sweet tax dollars. And that's why Amazon now has to choose not just among 20 metro areas but three neighbors in one metro area, though some folks around Washington would say that's three times the chances of getting picked.

Mr. Levy, thanks so much for being with us. PHILIP LEVY: It's a pleasure to be with you. SIMON: Is it too simple a question to ask what this administration wants from China? LEVY: No. That's the core question. But now, we didn't really get an answer to that question over the last couple days, but that's the question that needs asking. They presented a long list - there's a lot of candidates for the answer, but we don't know which one they really prioritize. SIMON: What about - the point that, I guess, seemed to particularly unnerve and aggravate some of the Chinese participants in the talks, according to reports, is that the United States wants China to change its core economy. LEVY: Yeah. I think a number of these requests really did get down to the fundamentals of China's economic approach. China is facing a transition that they no longer can count on being the low cost, low wage leader. And so they're looking to sort of advance on several technological fronts. They have long-run plans to do this, and they're trying to promote domestic industries. The U. S. has taken exception to some of the measures they're using. SIMON: Like what? LEVY: Like subsidies for key industries and, like, blocking out foreign investments or foreign exports in those sectors to give their domestic industries a leg up. SIMON: Is this just President Trump's negotiating style? A lot of people have quoted \"The Art Of The Deal\" in recent months, where he says, my style of deal making is simple. I aim high, then I just keep pushing, pushing and pushing. LEVY: The other possibility, of course, is it was a large group of advisers, each of whom comes from a somewhat different ideological position. The list of demands they put forward sounded like it had something for everybody. SIMON: And so is it a case of everybody has to kind of make a show of those ideas that are important to them or those ideas that got them placed at the table before real negotiation can begin? LEVY: Or it could be that nobody really feels empowered to prioritize and to say, this is the one key issue that we care about the most. I think that kind of prioritization would be much more likely to lead to a successful outcome with the Chinese. SIMON: I think we need to ask you about NAFTA, too - the free trade pact with Canada and Mexico. Hours before some steel tariffs are going to begin against Canada and Mexico, the president offered those countries an exemption. But is it possible that they will not have any kind of deal negotiated by the deadline that had been set? LEVY: It is absolutely possible, and it's worth remembering that the initial notional deadlines had these NAFTA renegotiation talks initially concluding at the end of 2017. Then, it was at the end of the first quarter. And so we've seen them steadily get pushed back. We have very few results where the distinctive Trump approach to trade has led to a full conclusion. SIMON: Mr. Levy, what do you think was accomplished at the China trade talks? Or - was it what you can expect from a first round?

C. It is a revival of a movement that began 50 years ago. It was started by Martin Luther King. It was called the Poor People's Campaign. In 1968, the movement brought thousands of America's poor to Washington to put a face on those living in poverty. Today's movement tries to finish what King started. NPR's Brakkton Booker reports. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Terrence Wise (ph) lives in Kansas City and has three teenage daughters. He works full time for $10. 25 an hour. TERRENCE WISE: Yeah, I've been a fast food worker for the past 20 years. I truly enjoy my job and the work that I do, you know, customer service. BOOKER: I reached him at home before he heads to his job as a shift manager at McDonald's. He admits life is a struggle at times. WISE: And it's really dangerous when we're skipping meals or having to buy less food. Now you're not only struggling financially. You're possibly affecting the health of your family and your children. And this is just constant. BOOKER: Wise will be one of the thousands of low-wage workers taking part in the nationwide protest. It was inspired by a movement 50 years ago. Just like the 1968 movement, today's campaign will last about 40 days. Pastor William Barber is a national co-chair. WILLIAM BARBER: We will have what is called a nonviolent moral fusion direct action where people will come together and put their mouths and their bodies on the line to force the nation, the media to have to see and hear the people that are impacted. BOOKER: The list of demands is long, calling for a higher minimum wage and a repeal of the 2017 federal tax law, ending gerrymandering. It also calls for an expansion of Medicaid in every state and an end to systemic racism, ecological devastation and military aggression, among other things. BARBER: This is what Dr. King understood when he said you have to deal with militarism, poverty and racism together. They are interlocking injustices. BOOKER: Barber insists this is only the beginning. Michael Jeffries is an associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College. He says the movement is coming at the right time, but the focus may be too expansive. MICHAEL JEFFRIES: It is a lengthy list. And I think that's the piece of this that remains to be seen - is can you sustain a social movement with as many issues as Barber is targeting? BOOKER: Barber, though, says the mission is worth it. BARBER: We've never lost a fight for justice that we chose to fight. BOOKER: The fights that have been lost, he says, are the ones no one chose to stand up for. Brakkton Booker, NPR News, Washington. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Later today, thousands of low-wage workers, faith leaders and civil rights activists will protest in more than 30 state capitals and here in Washington, D. C. It is a revival of a movement that began 50 years ago. It was started by Martin Luther King. It was called the Poor People's Campaign. In 1968, the movement brought thousands of America's poor to Washington to put a face on those living in poverty. Today's movement tries to finish what King started. NPR's Brakkton Booker reports. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Terrence Wise (ph) lives in Kansas City and has three teenage daughters. He works full time for $10. 25 an hour. TERRENCE WISE: Yeah, I've been a fast food worker for the past 20 years. I truly enjoy my job and the work that I do, you know, customer service. BOOKER: I reached him at home before he heads to his job as a shift manager at McDonald's. He admits life is a struggle at times. WISE: And it's really dangerous when we're skipping meals or having to buy less food. Now you're not only struggling financially. You're possibly affecting the health of your family and your children. And this is just constant. BOOKER: Wise will be one of the thousands of low-wage workers taking part in the nationwide protest. It was inspired by a movement 50 years ago. Just like the 1968 movement, today's campaign will last about 40 days. Pastor William Barber is a national co-chair. WILLIAM BARBER: We will have what is called a nonviolent moral fusion direct action where people will come together and put their mouths and their bodies on the line to force the nation, the media to have to see and hear the people that are impacted. BOOKER: The list of demands is long, calling for a higher minimum wage and a repeal of the 2017 federal tax law, ending gerrymandering. It also calls for an expansion of Medicaid in every state and an end to systemic racism, ecological devastation and military aggression, among other things. BARBER: This is what Dr. King understood when he said you have to deal with militarism, poverty and racism together. They are interlocking injustices. BOOKER: Barber insists this is only the beginning. Michael Jeffries is an associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College. He says the movement is coming at the right time, but the focus may be too expansive. MICHAEL JEFFRIES: It is a lengthy list.

When Americans import Chinese goods, what's really happening is this - an American business is using Chinese goods and making a profit. So as President Trump imposes tariffs on China, NPR's John Ydstie met an American business owner who thinks they could destroy her American company. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Mary Buchzeiger came to Washington on a mission. It's not a place she visits often. MARY BUCHZEIGER: I'm not a political person. I'm not in politics. I don't - you know, this is my first go-round in Washington. The last time I was here, I was 13 years old for my eighth-grade trip. (Laughter). YDSTIE: Now she's here again, sitting in a cafe a couple of blocks from the Capitol building, preparing to plead her case before Trump administration trade officials. Buchzeiger owns and runs a business founded by her father, Lucerne International, in Auburn Hills, Mich. It's a small parts supplier, but it's a big supplier for Chrysler's Jeep brand. BUCHZEIGER: We make all of the hinges that go in the Jeep Wrangler. They're all Class A forgings. Our company is actually one of the only ones in the world that can produce Class A forgings. YDSTIE: Class A forgings are parts visible on a vehicle's exterior. BUCHZEIGER: It's polished jewelry on the outside of a vehicle. It can't have defects in it - nicks, scratches, dents, dings, anything like that. It's got to look pretty. YDSTIE: Check out the door hinges on the next Jeep Wrangler you see. They came from Lucerne International. Those hinges, and about 90 percent of the parts Buchzeiger's company supplies to U. S. automakers would be hit by a 25 percent tax under President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs are supposed to protect U. S. businesses, but Buchzeiger doesn't see it that way. BUCHZEIGER: They're attacks on U. S. companies that are using Chinese goods. YDSTIE: And that's the rub. Buchzeiger's company produces most of its parts in China. BUCHZEIGER: I would love to be able to manufacture these parts in the U. S. We've tried. But here in the United States, there is not one company that can handle even half the volume of one part-number that I produce because there's no capacity left for manufacturing here. YDSTIE: Buchzeiger has searched for factories in the U. S. several times. Currently she's investigating the possibility of a plant in Flint, Mich. , where she was born. But if the tariffs hit now, she fears she'll be out of business before that could even happen. A couple of hours after our conversation, Mary Buchzeiger sat down in a government hearing room to tell her story. She had five minutes to make her case for an exemption before a panel of trade officials. Audio recording wasn't allowed, but we talked to her as she left the hearing room. So how'd it go? BUCHZEIGER: I think it went well. And I got the message across, and it was exactly what I expected. I'm hopeful that they heard our message. YDSTIE: And here are a few lines of her plea to trade officials. BUCHZEIGER: The tariffs proposed by President Trump would cripple my business and many like it in the Midwest. I'm fighting for the life of my company and for the livelihood of my employees, and I'm fighting to protect an intricate auto-supply chain that creates hundreds of thousands of U. S. jobs. YDSTIE: Buchzeiger is a Republican, and she says she hopes President Trump will get the message that his tariffs could harm businesses and workers in Trump Country. If or when those tariffs will take effect remains unclear. So for now, Buchzeiger can only wait and hope. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

(SOUNDBITE OF AD)MORGAN FREEMAN: New Mountain Dew Ice - a clear, refreshing lemon-lime Dew. RAZ: . . . Because some estimates show that most Americans are exposed to between 4,000 and 10,000 ads every day. And all those ads are after one thing - your attention. ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Attention is an absolutely significant resource, right? RAZ: This is sociologist Zeynep Tufekci. TUFEKCI: Everybody has 24 hours in the day. You sleep some, you work some, and what time you have free is one of the most important things you have. Getting your attention and putting in front of you can change your opinions. It changes what you prioritize. It affects politics. It affects your social interactions. I think that in an age where you have too much information, the crucial resource is that which information consumes, which is attention. Your attention is being battled over and being packaged and sold. RAZ: Attention is a commodity. TUFEKCI: Absolutely. And we have a digital economy that is essentially based on making sure that we are not in control of our attention. RAZ: On the show today - competing for your attention, ideas on the value of our awareness and why in an age of infinite distractions whoever can capture our attention holds a lot of power. Zeynep Tufekci explains from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TUFEKCI: Do you ever go on YouTube meaning to watch one video and an hour later you've watched 27? You know how YouTube has this column on the right that says up next, and it autoplays something? It's an algorithm picking what it thinks that you might be interested in and maybe not find on your own. It's not a human editor. It's what algorithms do. It picks up on what you have watched and what people like you have watched and infers that that must be what you're interested in, what you want more of and just shows you more. It sounds like a benign and useful feature, except when it isn't. So in 2016, I attended rallies of then-candidate Donald Trump to study as a scholar the movement supporting him. I studied social movements, so I was studying it, too. And then I wanted to write something about one of his rallies so I watched it a few times on YouTube. YouTube started recommending to me and autoplaying to me white supremacist videos in increasing order of extremism. If I watched one, it served up one even more extreme and autoplayed that one too. If you watch Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders content, YouTube recommends and autoplays conspiracy left, and it goes downhill from there. Well, you might be thinking, this is politics, but it's not. This isn't about politics. It's just the algorithm figuring out human behavior. I once watched a video about vegetarianism on YouTube, and YouTube recommended and autoplayed a video about being vegan. It's like you're never hardcore enough for YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)TUFEKCI: So what's going on here isn't YouTube engineers are out to wreck the world, right? But they have set loose an algorithm that's optimized to grab your attention for as long as possible to keep you on the site under, their word for it, engagement while YouTube serves the ads. And the algorithm has sussed out that humans are particularly susceptible, especially young people are particularly susceptible, to the idea that they're discovering a secret, that they're being told something edgier - right? - something more extreme because it's kind of like, ooh, this is novel. I'm interested in this, right? It's sort of seducing you. It's sort of trying to play to your appetites. So the algorithm automatically plays more and more. So if you just watch some political stuff, you end up with Alex Jones, who has all these horrible conspiracy theories. You watch some, you know, science stuff and three recommended autoplays later you're in the moon landing never happened. You watch something about Trump, and a little bit later, the algorithm is playing the Holocaust never happened stuff. So by optimizing for grabbing your attention, we have in effect through YouTube's recommender algorithm created this engine of extremism that is deployed globally. RAZ: Zeynep, this is really bad. TUFEKCI: I agree. RAZ: Like, this is - this should never have been allowed to happen. TUFEKCI: Well, I absolutely agree it is a big problem, but I'm an optimist, right? Just like we can deal with the other things that come with the 21st century and just like, you know, industrial revolution has brought us a lot of good things, this is something we can deal with. We just have to say, look, let's make explicit what the problem is. Let's realize that our attention is a crucial resource. And it's an equal resource, right? Every human being on the planet only has so many hours. It doesn't matter if you're rich or not. Right? You still have so many hours. It's one of the most human of things. And we have to treat our attention and our time as the crucial resource it is and change. And we're being told a story by Silicon Valley that this is inevitable, this is good or that this stuff has to come in combination. You know, if you're going to use digital stuff, you're going to have your attention manipulated and sold. It's just not true. They package it this way, and we don't have to. We finally are paying attention to the question of attention. The next step is, we need tools and regulations and industry self-regulation and individual awareness and all those things together to say, how do we grab back control of this most precious resource?

More than 80 buildings have been destroyed by the gushing and flowing lava. Smaller eruptions continue to punch plumes of ash into the sky. But for most people on the Big Island, the lava and ash are actually far away. Closer is the impact the eruption is having on the island's tourist-dependent economy. NPR's Nathan Rott has this report. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: On a normal weekend, the parking lot outside of the Lava Rock Cafe would be abuzz. Tour buses would be dropping off visitors fresh off their visit to neighboring Volcanoes National Park for a lava tube plate lunch or a cinder cone side. The adjacent stores would be ringing up lava puddle postcards and Kilauea keychains. This weekend, though. . . ADELE TRIPP: Oh, yeah, dead - nothing. Like a graveyard. It's very sad. ROTT: Adele Tripp is the manager here, and she says business has come to a near halt ever since the recent eruption and the partial closure of the national park, the biggest tourist destination in the state. The volcano is a huge draw. TRIPP: We need it to be just enough crazy but not too crazy. ROTT: And right now is too much crazy. Tripp says they're cutting hours at these shops. A couple of restaurants just down the road. . . TRIPP: They're going to close for three weeks or until further notice. ROTT: They're just going to full-on shut down. TRIPP: Just going to shut down because they can't afford to keep their people working when you only have a few customers coming in. ROTT: The physical effects of the volcano and lava flows are only being felt on a small corner of this roughly 4,000-square-mile Big Island. Even here in the town called Volcano - only about a 10-minute drive from the actual crater - it really seems like just another day. But the economic impacts of the eruption are being felt island-wide. SARAH STEINBRECHER: I can see just around town that it's a lot quieter, too. And a lot of the businesses are laying off people, but we're hanging in there right now. ROTT: Natalie Sampaio is the owner of Hilo Ocean Adventures, a snorkel and scuba outfitter about 30 miles from the volcano. Sampaio's store, like many here in Hilo, rely on cruise ships for a lot of their income. Since the eruption, those cruise ships have stopped coming to port, costing the economy an estimated $3 million through July. Sarah Steinbrecher is one of the employees here. STEINBRECHER: People are under the impression that the whole island is erupting and sinking into the sea and, you know, really this is just how this - how all of the Hawaiian island were made. ROTT: You hear this frustration all over the Big Island. Many people here blame the over-excited news coverage. Tourism officials say the booking pace for the summer has slowed by almost 50 percent. People are canceling hotel stays and conferences, fishing trips and bike tours. But locals argue there's still plenty to do. (SOUNDBITE OF AIRPLANE)ROTT: And you hear that at the Kona International Airport on the other side of the island more than a hundred miles away from the volcano. Cathy Fischer is getting ready to fly back to Madison, Wis. , after a week-long trip. CATHY FISCHER: The main way it affected us is probably the vog. ROTT: That's the volcanic fog, which happens all the time here - just more so now. FISCHER: And we were planning on, you know, like, Hawaiian sunsets and all of the nice stuff, and it was pretty much just, like, a fade to grey at night. Other than that, pretty much no effect at all. ROTT: The north side of the island was fine, she says. The water was nice. And hey, she says, it's a little less crowded than it would be otherwise. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Volcano, Hawaii. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now to Hawaii, where the images coming from the volcanic eruption on Hawaii's Big Island are spectacular and heartbreaking. More than 80 buildings have been destroyed by the gushing and flowing lava. Smaller eruptions continue to punch plumes of ash into the sky. But for most people on the Big Island, the lava and ash are actually far away. Closer is the impact the eruption is having on the island's tourist-dependent economy. NPR's Nathan Rott has this report. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: On a normal weekend, the parking lot outside of the Lava Rock Cafe would be abuzz. Tour buses would be dropping off visitors fresh off their visit to neighboring Volcanoes National Park for a lava tube plate lunch or a cinder cone side. The adjacent stores would be ringing up lava puddle postcards and Kilauea keychains. This weekend, though. . . ADELE TRIPP: Oh, yeah, dead - nothing. Like a graveyard. It's very sad. ROTT: Adele Tripp is the manager here, and she says business has come to a near halt ever since the recent eruption and the partial closure of the national park, the biggest tourist destination in the state. The volcano is a huge draw. TRIPP: We need it to be just enough crazy but not too crazy. ROTT: And right now is too much crazy. Tripp says they're cutting hours at these shops. A couple of restaurants just down the road. . . TRIPP: They're going to close for three weeks or until further notice. ROTT: They're just going to full-on shut down. TRIPP: Just going to shut down because they can't afford to keep their people working when you only have a few customers coming in. ROTT: The physical effects of the volcano and lava flows are only being felt on a small corner of this roughly 4,000-square-mile Big Island. Even here in the town called Volcano - only about a 10-minute drive from the actual crater - it really seems like just another day. But the economic impacts of the eruption are being felt island-wide. SARAH STEINBRECHER: I can see just around town that it's a lot quieter, too. And a lot of the businesses are laying off people, but we're hanging in there right now. ROTT: Natalie Sampaio is the owner of Hilo Ocean Adventures, a snorkel and scuba outfitter about 30 miles from the volcano. Sampaio's store, like many here in Hilo, rely on cruise ships for a lot of their income. Since the eruption, those cruise ships have stopped coming to port, costing the economy an estimated $3 million through July. Sarah Steinbrecher is one of the employees here. STEINBRECHER: People are under the impression that the whole island is erupting and sinking into the sea and, you know, really this is just how this - how all of the Hawaiian island were made. ROTT: You hear this frustration all over the Big Island. Many people here blame the over-excited news coverage. Tourism officials say the booking pace for the summer has slowed by almost 50 percent. People are canceling hotel stays and conferences, fishing trips and bike tours. But locals argue there's still plenty to do. (SOUNDBITE OF AIRPLANE) ROTT: And you hear that at the Kona International Airport on the other side of the island more than a hundred miles away from the volcano. Cathy Fischer is getting ready to fly back to Madison, Wis. , after a week-long trip. CATHY FISCHER: The main way it affected us is probably the vog.

But this week, turmoil there rattled financial markets around the world. Stock prices took a nosedive Tuesday before regaining ground yesterday. But could there be more volatility ahead? Let's ask Philip Suttle. He was head of global currency research for JPMorgan, and he joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for coming in this morning. PHILIP SUTTLE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So granted, Italy is the third-biggest country in the eurozone, third biggest economy in the EU. But still, how were its political problems able to spook markets so much? SUTTLE: Well, what we're really looking at here is another one of these problems related to the issue of the euro. Italy is now the poster child for the country that doesn't work within the eurozone. For a number of years, the focus was on Greece. Greece had many more difficult problems. It was a really big challenge. But now attention has shifted to Italy. And the economic difficulties there translated into a big political problem. So we now have a populist government looming in Italy. MARTIN: A populist government that has suggested - at least by extension of one person who has been floated to be part of the government - that Italy should pull out of the eurozone. SUTTLE: Well, to be fair, none of the people who are likely to take over are explicitly saying we should pull out. It's just not clear what they're saying. What they're really saying is we want to do things to gin up growth. We need to do things to gin up growth. And it's hard to see how they do that while keeping within the eurozone rules. So we seem to be heading for some kind of collision here through the summer months. MARTIN: Walk us through why this matters if you're a consumer in the U. S. , an investor in the U. S. SUTTLE: Well, I think the biggest issue is it affects financial markets and financial volatility. So most of us, in some way or another, have some exposure to the stock market. As you mentioned earlier, as we saw earlier in this week, it had a lot of volatility - first down, then back up - from turmoil in Italian and broader European markets. So this - there's, I think, a real sense here in which we could see the financial markets globally being affected by such a big country as Italy having problems. Of course, the other channel is through the exchange rate. The dollar's gone up by about 6 percent against the euro since these difficulties have begun to unfold. So that not only makes imports from Europe cheaper and holidays in Europe cheaper but it also affects companies in the U. S. doing business with European competition. MARTIN: The Federal Reserve here in the U. S. has been raising interest rates rather steadily. If there is more political turmoil in Italy and in Europe more broadly, how could it affect how the Fed decides to move forward? SUTTLE: Well, it's clearly going to - it's caught the Fed's attention, I think it's fair to say. The Fed will tighten in June. I think everyone accepts that. But the next move, which everyone thought would come in September, I think, now looks a little more in question given the potential for market volatility through the summer months as this turmoil plays out.

This was a landmark regulation put in place after the financial crisis to protect banks from themselves. The Federal Reserve has unveiled proposed changes to the rule, which blocks banks from trying to make money with speculative investments. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The Volcker Rule basically says that banks can't gamble with risky Wall Street bets because they might make bad bets and collapse. That might sound like a pretty reasonable idea. Some huge financial firms, of course, did that just 10 years ago. They needed bailouts with taxpayer money, and they gave the entire financial system a heart attack. WAYNE ABERNATHY: Well, that was the way it was sold publicly, that this is a tool to deal with systemic risk. ARNOLD: Wayne Abernathy is with the American Bankers Association. ABERNATHY: But when the rules were written, it applied to every single bank. We're talking about small community banks that didn't get involved in any trading.

He says the proposed changes relax some of the requirements for the big banks, too. ABERNATHY: That means you don't have to show paperwork with every single trade that you're doing. ARNOLD: Instead, he says, banks would come up with their own systems to make sure that they're square with the Volcker Rule with regulators signing off on their plans. But that sounds too much like banks policing themselves to Marcus Stanley. He's with the watchdog group Americans for Financial Reform. He worries that the changes let banks off the hook too much. MARCUS STANLEY: This is moving the Volcker Rule much more toward a we'll-take-your-word-for-it kind of rule. ARNOLD: Stanley says that nobody's had time to fully evaluate all the proposed revisions.

European, Canadian and Mexican officials are promising to retaliate in response to steel and aluminum tariffs that the Trump administration imposed today. These tariffs were first announced by the president in early March. He then suggested that some countries could be exempted. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, the administration has a pattern of mixed signals on trade. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: For weeks, the Trump administration has threatened to impose major tariffs on imports from China. Recently, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox News that talks with China had made progress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVEN MNUCHIN: We're putting the trade war on hold. So right now we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold. ZARROLI: But Mnuchin was contradicted by Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, who said in an interview with NPR this week that the remarks were an unfortunate soundbite. The Trump administration has sometimes displayed a split personality on trade. Someone will make a tough-sounding pronouncement only to change course later. The president pulled the U. S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership then said he might consider rejoining it. He announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports then spent three months deciding whether to exempt certain countries. Dan Ikenson of the pro-trade Cato Institute says trying to find a coherent strategy in all this can be mentally debilitating. DAN IKENSON: My view is we need to distill the signal from the noise. The problem is, if there's a signal there, it's pretty weak. ZARROLI: The divergent policies reflect the sharply differing views of Trump's economic team. It includes trade hawks such as Navarro and U. S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and orthodox free-traders such as Mnuchin and National Economic Council head Larry Kudlow. But the president also appears to see sowing confusion as a bargaining tactic at a time when the U. S. is in negotiations with some of its major trading partners. Eswar Prasad is a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. ESWAR PRASAD: The strategy, if one can call it such, seems to be that threats, bullying and some degree of unpredictability can gain the U. S. an upper hand in trade negotiations. ZARROLI: Prasad says this may produce some short-term victories, but it could also erode trust in Washington among U. S. trading partners. Adding to the confusion has been Trump's unconventional willingness to mix trade and foreign policy goals. For example, Chinese telecom company ZTE was barred by the government from buying parts in the U. S. because it violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. But Trump has said the punishments could be reduced as part of a trade agreement with China. Celeste Drake is a trade policy specialist at the AFL-CIO. CELESTE DRAKE: It doesn't seem that saying we're going to go easy on ZTE because we've had some good discussions with China about some other things is really the best way to defend national security. ZARROLI: Likewise, Trump argued that tariffs on steel and aluminum were needed to protect industries vital to national defense. The global trading rules are changing, leaving U. S. trading partners confused about where Washington is going, and that may be what the administration is banking on. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   All right.

The six finance ministers of the G7 organization - among them Canada, France, and the U. K. - are calling out its seventh member, the United States. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow this morning downplayed the friction, calling it a family quarrel. There is one organization, though, tasked with dealing with international trade disputes, the World Trade Organization. And Canada and the EU have already filed challenges to the tariffs with the WTO. Jennifer Hillman is a former member of the World Trade Organization's appellate body, and she joins me now. Welcome to the program. JENNIFER HILLMAN: Thank you very much. GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. So just briefly, why are these countries coming to the WTO? HILLMAN: Because they believe what the United States has done violates its WTO obligations. The United States promised, as part of a series of tariff negotiations, to limit its tariffs on steel to 0 percent duties and to limit its tariffs on aluminum to somewhere between 0 and 6 percent on average. And secondly, they're complaining because one of the other rules of the WTO is that you cannot discriminate as among WTO members. And, here, the United States is applying the steel and aluminum tariffs to some countries but not to Korea, not to Brazil, not to Australia, not to Argentina. So the other complaint is, at its core, that there's been discrimination against the EU, Canada Mexico and the other countries that are subjected to the tariffs. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Could this dispute turn into something more serious, depending on what the WTO rules? HILLMAN: Well, if it ruled, it would hear this complaint and figure out whether they agree or don't agree with the European Union or Canada or any of the challenges. And I think the chances that the WTO will decide against the United States are very, very strong. I mean, it's a very clear case of a violation. What will get tricky for the WTO is, what are they going to do about the defense that the United States intends to raise? GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that defense is national security, apparently? HILLMAN: It's national security. Exactly. And so what the United States is going to say is that there is a provision in the WTO that says, yes, you can break your tariff commitments. You can discriminate if you fall under the terms of this security exception. And that's really the problem for the United States - is that it's not clear that these steel or aluminum tariffs fit within any of those boxes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So the WTO is going to have to arbitrate this. But whatever they rule, will it have teeth? I mean, what will the WTO do? HILLMAN: So, again, what happens at the end of a WTO case is that countries are asked to come into compliance. If you do not, then there are sort of two other options. One is that the countries - the European Union, Canada, et cetera - could ask the United States to compensate them for the amount of trade that's been lost or disrupted as a result of the tariffs. The last option is that the EU, Canada and others can add on retaliation duties against the United States. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you think the likelihood of a trade war breaking out is? HILLMAN: I fear that it's higher than I would ever have imagined and would like to see. I think the Trump administration has miscalculated the willingness of Europe, Canada, Mexico and many other countries to react to these steel and aluminum tariffs. I fear that what they thought is that everybody would agree. And obviously, what's happened is most of the countries have said no. No, you don't have a right to put on these tariffs in the first place, so I'm not going to agree to limit my trade just to get out from underneath your illegal tariffs. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The WTO is really an institution that was built around trying to prevent trade wars happening. And just remind us why that is. Why are trade wars damaging? HILLMAN: That's exactly right. Its whole purpose is to set up a set of binding rules that everybody will agree to because what happens is when one country says, I'm going to raise my tariffs on you, other countries then get into the act and say, well, I now need to raise tariffs to protect my market because all of the steel or the aluminum that didn't end up in the United States is now ending up in my market and hurting my suppliers. So everyone starts raising tariffs on each other. And at that point, you end up where we were in the late '20s and early 1930s, which is the entire trading system crashing and the economies of the world crashing. And you get into a long and deep recession. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jennifer Hillman is a professor at Georgetown University Law School and a former member of the WTO's appellate body. Thank you very much.

And, here, the United States is applying the steel and aluminum tariffs to some countries but not to Korea, not to Brazil, not to Australia, not to Argentina. So the other complaint is, at its core, that there's been discrimination against the EU, Canada Mexico and the other countries that are subjected to the tariffs. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Could this dispute turn into something more serious, depending on what the WTO rules? HILLMAN: Well, if it ruled, it would hear this complaint and figure out whether they agree or don't agree with the European Union or Canada or any of the challenges. And I think the chances that the WTO will decide against the United States are very, very strong. I mean, it's a very clear case of a violation. What will get tricky for the WTO is, what are they going to do about the defense that the United States intends to raise? GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that defense is national security, apparently? HILLMAN: It's national security. Exactly. And so what the United States is going to say is that there is a provision in the WTO that says, yes, you can break your tariff commitments. You can discriminate if you fall under the terms of this security exception. And that's really the problem for the United States - is that it's not clear that these steel or aluminum tariffs fit within any of those boxes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So the WTO is going to have to arbitrate this. But whatever they rule, will it have teeth? I mean, what will the WTO do? HILLMAN: So, again, what happens at the end of a WTO case is that countries are asked to come into compliance. If you do not, then there are sort of two other options. One is that the countries - the European Union, Canada, et cetera - could ask the United States to compensate them for the amount of trade that's been lost or disrupted as a result of the tariffs. The last option is that the EU, Canada and others can add on retaliation duties against the United States. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What do you think the likelihood of a trade war breaking out is? HILLMAN: I fear that it's higher than I would ever have imagined and would like to see. I think the Trump administration has miscalculated the willingness of Europe, Canada, Mexico and many other countries to react to these steel and aluminum tariffs. I fear that what they thought is that everybody would agree. And obviously, what's happened is most of the countries have said no. No, you don't have a right to put on these tariffs in the first place, so I'm not going to agree to limit my trade just to get out from underneath your illegal tariffs. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The WTO is really an institution that was built around trying to prevent trade wars happening. And just remind us why that is. Why are trade wars damaging? HILLMAN: That's exactly right. Its whole purpose is to set up a set of binding rules that everybody will agree to because what happens is when one country says, I'm going to raise my tariffs on you, other countries then get into the act and say, well, I now need to raise tariffs to protect my market because all of the steel or the aluminum that didn't end up in the United States is now ending up in my market and hurting my suppliers. So everyone starts raising tariffs on each other. And at that point, you end up where we were in the late '20s and early 1930s, which is the entire trading system crashing and the economies of the world crashing. And you get into a long and deep recession. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jennifer Hillman is a professor at Georgetown University Law School and a former member of the WTO's appellate body. Thank you very much.

Just south of here yesterday, the CEO of Apple took the stage. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPER CONFERENCE)TIM COOK: Good morning. (APPLAUSE)COOK: Good morning. INSKEEP: Tim Cook had reason to be cheerful. He runs the world's most valuable company worth close to a trillion dollars. He was addressing software developers, promoting new features to the operating systems of the iPhone and the iPad and the Apple Watch. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPER CONFERENCE)COOK: Changing the world and making it a better place is what it's all about for us. INSKEEP: That's the motto for much of the tech industry, though it faces unprecedented questions about whether the industry really is making the world better. Apple's shareholders recently warned of growing societal unease about the mental health effects of too much phone use. So now Apple says a new feature will make it easier to track what you or your children have been doing on a device. COOK: So you know how much time you're spending, where you're spending it, how many times per hour you're picking up a device, how many notifications you get, who's sending those to you. INSKEEP: That's how Tim Cook described it when he sat with us after his speech. What, if anything, bothers you about the amount of time people are spending on your phones? COOK: Well, if you back up and think about what we're about, we've never been about maximizing usage of our devices. It's never been a focus of ours. There's clearly users out there that are worried about the amount of time they're spending, or the amount of distraction or interruptions they get. INSKEEP: I want to ask about your thinking, though, because you could say, I'm responding to demand and there's some shareholders that wanted this, but are you actually bothered? Are you actually concerned by the possibility that what you argue is a social good could be a social detriment? COOK: I think there are cases in life where anything good used to the extreme becomes not good. And so I think you can depend on your device so much and spend so much time on certain apps or pick up your phone so many times during the day that this is no longer good. INSKEEP: But this was literally your ambition as a company, right, to make sure that people use everything? COOK: No. That's the interesting thing. We're in a very unique position because we had never been about maximizing the number of times you pick it up, the number of hours that you use it. . . INSKEEP: But you maximize the number of things you can do with it. That's for sure. COOK: We do that, yes, because we want it to be an incredible device for you. And so, you know, we've provided a way for you to have health information on it, financial information, you can pay with it. But if you're getting bombarded by notifications all day long, that's probably a use of the system that might not be so good anymore. INSKEEP: Is there a little bit of conflict that you have to think about because you are offering people ways to limit their screen time while speaking to this giant conference of thousands of people, developers, who are in business to go sell products through your app store that would encourage people to use the phone more? COOK: No. I don't see it as that because we always put the user at the center. And so our question is always, what is in their best interest? INSKEEP: Do you agree with people who use the word addiction, talk about addiction to smartphones? COOK: I'm not a clinician, and so I don't know. What I do know is that you can use something too much. And I'm concerned about it. But what we want to do is provide you great tools so you can make a judgment for yourself. INSKEEP: You also made some news by announcing some changes to your Web browser and elsewhere, which you say will make it more difficult for outside parties to track what you do online, to track your data. Are you deliberately making your platforms more hostile for companies that do business like Facebook, which was mentioned in your presentation? COOK: We're not targeting any single company. We're targeting a practice of people collecting information without the vast majority of users knowing that it's being collected. We think that when a person leaves one website and goes to another and another and another, they do not have a reasonable expectation that that original website is still following their every move. And so we want to do what we can do there to try to prevent that. But we're not taking the ability of if somebody, you know, is on the NPR app, we think it's fine that, in rational, that NPR knows that person is there and knows something about them, assuming the user has elected to share that. What we don't think is, when you leave there, we don't think that the surveillance engine should stay. INSKEEP: I want people to know that you have emphasized that your company does not intend to make money off of data mining, does not intend to make money off of advertising. You make money by selling hardware. But you're addressing a developers conference here, where theres a lot of app developers who may well rely on advertising, who may well rely on data. COOK: Well, let me let me correct something you said there. We don't believe there's anything wrong with digital advertising. It's a key part of people's business models, and we think it's perfectly fine. It's the crafting of a detailed profile, and tracking you in places where you don't reasonably expect to be tracked and companies gathering information well beyond what you would have voluntarily shared if you knew what they were doing. INSKEEP: Is there a better business model than the business model that lots of companies are using? COOK: Again, on the digital - we have no issue with digital advertising. INSKEEP: Excessive data tracking, you do have an issue. COOK: It's the collection of information beyond what the person is fully and completely aware is taking place and the building of this detailed profile. I think that steps over a boundary. INSKEEP: That's some of our talk with Apple CEO Tim Cook here in California. We're hearing him throughout the morning. NPR digital culture correspondent Laura Sydell was with us for that talk and is with us now. Hey, Laura. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: So we heard Apple pushing back on Facebook there, but just a couple days ago there was this story suggesting that Apple in some cases has been in league with Facebook. SYDELL: That is right. As a matter of fact, what was reported was that Facebook made it possible for the hardware manufacturers like Apple or Samsung to essentially get all kinds of personal information off their app, including your friends and your friends' personal information. INSKEEP: OK. That's what the story said. What did Tim Cook say? SYDELL: Tim Cook says we could have done it, but we didn't do it. All we did was try to make things more convenient so that maybe you could post something to - you could post a photo on Facebook, and that's about it. They are not in the business, as he said, of getting users' data. INSKEEP: Although they are working pretty closely with Facebook, as you see from examples. . . SYDELL: Yes. And, in fact, a lot of these apps do it. So even though they are not doing it, the apps in their app store may very well be involved in it.

S. Today the Labor Department poured a bucket of cold water on that notion. It released a report showing contract workers make up a slightly smaller share of the workforce than the last time the survey was done more than a decade ago. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has this report. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The last time the U. S. government surveyed the size of the independent contractor workforce, it was 2005, before the Great Recession and before it was possible to hail a ride with your phone. Other surveys have found growth in freelance or contract work rapidly outstripping conventional full-time employment. A recent NPR Marist Poll, for example, found 20 percent of workers relied on contract work as their primary source of income. The Labor Department's latest data contradict these studies. It found a slight increase in the number of contract workers to 15 1/2 million. But it also found their share of the overall workforce actually declined slightly to 10. 1 percent. Sam Katzen is a spokesperson for Fiverr, a marketplace for freelancers to find work. SAM KATZEN: The numbers are misleading because it doesn't really represent how work has changed since this report last came out. NOGUCHI: A big problem, Katzen says, is the Labor Department's methodology. Even though more people work multiple jobs, the government counted only those who rely on contract work as their main income. Also, defining contract work is tricky. Some surveys use a broad definition that includes very short-term gigs. Louis Hyman is director of the Institute for Workplace Studies at Cornell University. LOUIS HYMAN: It speaks to the fact that the language that we have around work hasn't really caught up with the ways in which people are working these days. NOGUCHI: The economy might be yet another factor in the government's very different figures. The job market now is stronger than it was in 2005, which might mean employers are more likely to offer full-time positions to attract and retain talent. There is a lot of interest in the size of the contract workforce because it forms the basis for public policy. Jennifer Curry is a senior director at Samaschool, a San Francisco training program for low-income contract workers. She estimates the government left out 25 to 30 million freelance or contract workers who do some part-time work. JENNIFER CURRY: Without capturing those other millions of people who are doing this work on the side, it doesn't really give us the full picture. So it doesn't tell us enough about, you know, their training needs, the supports they need, the benefits that they're lacking. We definitely need to know more. NOGUCHI: Not everyone agrees the government's latest report is misleading. Lawrence Mishel is a fellow at the Economic Policy Institute. LAWRENCE MISHEL: So the whole idea that we're all becoming freelancers is just that much - hype. NOGUCHI: But Mishel does agree many more workers are using contract work to supplement their income. And that, he says, speaks to other problems in the job market. MISHEL: The fact that alternative work has not grown does not diminish one iota the fact that we really need to pay attention to wage stagnation and deteriorating job quality. NOGUCHI: There is one thing everyone does agree on - this report underscores the need for still more and better data. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

You buy something online, and then you change your mind. So what to do - keep it, regift, send it back? Well, Americans had interesting things to say about their return habits in a new NPR/Marist Poll, so interesting that some of the responses surprised our retail reporter Alina Selyukh. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: When you follow retail, you hear a lot about returns - that online shopping produces a ton of them. LARISA SUMMERS: It was $385 billion worth in one year last year. SELYUKH: That's 385. . . SUMMERS: Billion dollars, with a B, returned inventory. SELYUKH: Larisa Summers works for a company called up Optoro which is built around returns, helping retailers repurpose or resell the stuff people send back. SUMMERS: In some categories, 20 to 30 percent of goods get returned. SELYUKH: I went to Summers for a professional reality check because I'm trying to make sense of some fascinating results from the new NPR/Marist poll. Ninety-one percent of American online shoppers told us they rarely or never return things they buy online. And my immediate thought was, where are these people who never return things? PAT NOVAK: My name is Pat Novak, and I live north of Grand Rapids, Mich. SELYUKH: Novak rarely returns things for this straightforward reason. NOVAK: I don't enjoy shopping. It's not my favorite thing to do. SELYUKH: Not her favorite thing to do. Novak likes finding exactly the right thing before buying it so she doesn't have to shop again. Katie Burns from San Francisco has another reason why people don't return things. KATIE BURNS: I do have a basket in my apartment of things that I fully intend to return that have been there for more than a year, probably, that I have not gotten around to. SELYUKH: And now she's missed the return window for most of them. In our survey, a majority of online shoppers say they have indeed kept purchases they'd meant to return mainly to avoid the hassle. Now, another number in the polls surprised me the most. It has to do with how I personally shop, which is buy bunch of sweaters in different sizes, return what doesn't fit. Almost everyone - 94 percent of online shoppers - told us they rarely or never make a purchase expecting to return part of it. Am I really in such a tiny minority? STACEY STEINER: That surprises me. SELYUKH: Hey, there are two of us, me and Stacey Steiner from Jacksonville, Fla. STEINER: I'll go every once in a while, save up money, and then I'll just do a huge batch order. SELYUKH: Recently she wanted new dresses for her birthday. STEINER: So I think I bought, like, 13 dresses or something. SELYUKH: Oh, wow. STEINER: And I was able to try them on. And I picked three that I kept. SELYUKH: And guess who else shops like Steiner and I - director of the Marist Poll, Barbara Carvalho. BARBARA CARVALHO: I agree. The expectation was that we were going to see a very large proportion of people that return things. SELYUKH: But remember; we had 91 percent say they hardly ever returned things. My theory - asking about the frequency of returns was like calling people and saying, do you floss every day? But Carvalho says the poll accounts for this by suggesting a range of answers instead of a yes or no. And more importantly, I lost sight of the other side, the 9 percent of online shoppers who admit to making returns often or very often. CARVALHO: It actually translates into almost 16 million adults in the U. S. SELYUKH: A small percentage of shoppers giving retailers big headaches with costly returns. But sometimes the retailers have themselves to blame. Remember Novak from Michigan who doesn't like shopping? Last year, her husband ordered a small fuel tank for a camp stove but instead received a 5-foot-tall cooler. NOVAK: If I could return it, I would return the stupid cooler. They won't take it back. SELYUKH: She says the company only allows returns for warranty or defects, not wrong shipments. So now that's another reason why Novak does not return things. Alina Selyukh, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Now for a story most of us can probably relate to. You buy something online, and then you change your mind. So what to do - keep it, regift, send it back? Well, Americans had interesting things to say about their return habits in a new NPR/Marist Poll, so interesting that some of the responses surprised our retail reporter Alina Selyukh. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: When you follow retail, you hear a lot about returns - that online shopping produces a ton of them. LARISA SUMMERS: It was $385 billion worth in one year last year. SELYUKH: That's 385. . . SUMMERS: Billion dollars, with a B, returned inventory. SELYUKH: Larisa Summers works for a company called up Optoro which is built around returns, helping retailers repurpose or resell the stuff people send back. SUMMERS: In some categories, 20 to 30 percent of goods get returned. SELYUKH: I went to Summers for a professional reality check because I'm trying to make sense of some fascinating results from the new NPR/Marist poll. Ninety-one percent of American online shoppers told us they rarely or never return things they buy online. And my immediate thought was, where are these people who never return things? PAT NOVAK: My name is Pat Novak, and I live north of Grand Rapids, Mich. SELYUKH: Novak rarely returns things for this straightforward reason. NOVAK: I don't enjoy shopping. It's not my favorite thing to do. SELYUKH: Not her favorite thing to do. Novak likes finding exactly the right thing before buying it so she doesn't have to shop again. Katie Burns from San Francisco has another reason why people don't return things. KATIE BURNS: I do have a basket in my apartment of things that I fully intend to return that have been there for more than a year, probably, that I have not gotten around to. SELYUKH: And now she's missed the return window for most of them. In our survey, a majority of online shoppers say they have indeed kept purchases they'd meant to return mainly to avoid the hassle. Now, another number in the polls surprised me the most. It has to do with how I personally shop, which is buy bunch of sweaters in different sizes, return what doesn't fit. Almost everyone - 94 percent of online shoppers - told us they rarely or never make a purchase expecting to return part of it. Am I really in such a tiny minority? STACEY STEINER: That surprises me. SELYUKH: Hey, there are two of us, me and Stacey Steiner from Jacksonville, Fla. STEINER: I'll go every once in a while, save up money, and then I'll just do a huge batch order. SELYUKH: Recently she wanted new dresses for her birthday. STEINER: So I think I bought, like, 13 dresses or something. SELYUKH: Oh, wow. STEINER: And I was able to try them on. And I picked three that I kept. SELYUKH: And guess who else shops like Steiner and I - director of the Marist Poll, Barbara Carvalho. BARBARA CARVALHO: I agree. The expectation was that we were going to see a very large proportion of people that return things. SELYUKH: But remember; we had 91 percent say they hardly ever returned things. My theory - asking about the frequency of returns was like calling people and saying, do you floss every day? But Carvalho says the poll accounts for this by suggesting a range of answers instead of a yes or no. And more importantly, I lost sight of the other side, the 9 percent of online shoppers who admit to making returns often or very often. CARVALHO: It actually translates into almost 16 million adults in the U. S. SELYUKH: A small percentage of shoppers giving retailers big headaches with costly returns. But sometimes the retailers have themselves to blame. Remember Novak from Michigan who doesn't like shopping? Last year, her husband ordered a small fuel tank for a camp stove but instead received a 5-foot-tall cooler. NOVAK: If I could return it, I would return the stupid cooler. They won't take it back. SELYUKH: She says the company only allows returns for warranty or defects, not wrong shipments. So now that's another reason why Novak does not return things.

As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, the resistance he's encountering underscores how isolated the U. S. has become on trade. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau doesn't vent publicly much. But after Trump's recent tariffs on steel and aluminum, he reacted angrily. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: We have to believe that at some point, common sense will prevail. But we see no sign of that in this action today by the U. S. administration. ZARROLI: And Canada isn't the only country that's unhappy. Trump's trade policies have been condemned throughout Asia, Europe and Latin America. Doug Irwin is a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. DOUG IRWIN: Well, he's getting a lot of pushback from just about every country that he's taken a tough stance against. There's a lot of global resistance I think to the way the Trump administration's trying to push U. S. trade policy. ZARROLI: In recent months, Trump has flexed his muscles on trade. He's insisted on renegotiating trade agreements and threatened tariffs against uncooperative countries. The tough stance represents a calculation that U. S. trading partners will cave in to Washington's demands because they need access to the vast American market. That kind of pressure has worked before. The U. S. once exerted a lot of pressure on Japan to open its markets. In 1987, President Reagan even spoke to the country's parliament. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: Americans believe your markets are less open than ours. We need your support to lower further the barriers that still make it difficult for some American products to enter your markets easily. ZARROLI: But Doug Irwin says times were different then. Japan was a key U. S. ally in the Cold War. The two countries needed each other. What's more, Irwin says the U. S. dominated the global economy more than it does today. IRWIN: The weight of the world economy has really shifted towards Asia. That's where some really big, rapidly growing markets are. And the U. S. is just not quite as important as it was before. ZARROLI: Irwin says today the United States' biggest trading partner is China, and it simply isn't as vulnerable to U. S. pressure as Japan was. Economist Simon Johnson of MIT says many countries are also confused by Trump's harsh rhetoric on trade which they see as a big departure from longstanding U. S. policy of promoting open markets. SIMON JOHNSON: I think a lot of countries are taking the position that they have cooperated for a long time in what has always been an American-initiated and an American-overseen system. So now Mr. Trump wants to change the rules. You know, to what end? (Laughter) What exactly is he going to get from that? ZARROLI: In the past, the U. S. has argued that fair and open trade benefits all countries. But in his speeches and tweets, Trump sometimes seems to view trade like a war game aimed at winning more favorable terms from your trading partners. And Doug Irwin says a lot of countries are worried that if they give in, Washington will keep demanding ever-bigger concessions. IRWIN: And I think what they're doing is drawing a line in the sand early on, saying, look; this is an inappropriate way of approaching things; you can't treat us this way, and we're going to resist 'cause if they just cave in, then the Trump administration might double the ask. ZARROLI: And U. S. trading partners are already making clear they're willing to go their own way. As the G-7 summit was approaching, French President Emmanuel Macron said maybe the American president doesn't mind being isolated, but we don't mind being 6 if necessary. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

Several hundred people work for NLMK in Farrell, Penn. This is a Russian-owned steel mill that uses Russian steel, and so it's being hit by a 25 percent tariff. This mill is in an area that backed President Trump. And so its fate really speaks to the complicated politics around the president's trade policies. Here's NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Dan Moore is one of those guys who voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. But he became enamored with Donald Trump's promise to bring back jobs and renegotiate trade deals. DAN MOORE: Right now there's a pretty fair amount of uncertainty with the steel tariffs. KHALID: I meet Moore near the entrance to the NLMK steel mill about an hour before he's got to get to work inside. He's wearing a Donald Trump hat, a souvenir he picked up at the inauguration. He gives the president an A-plus on a lot of things, but he's not so sure about tariffs. MOORE: Tariffs are - they may help some people, but they're going to hurt a lot of people, too. I don't know exactly how you balance that. KHALID: NLMK, where he works, depends on steel from Russia. And it wants to import 3 million tons a year. MOORE: It's kind of like - OK, well, we need tariffs. But when it starts to impact the company where you work for, now you're like, whoa. Wait a minute. Time out. (Laughter) Let's take a closer look at this. KHALID: Do you at all regret your vote? MOORE: No, I don't regret my vote 'cause I certainly think President Trump was the better candidate. KHALID: Plus, he thinks the president is receptive to feedback. MOORE: I have plans to write a letter to President Trump or maybe a personal phone call. KHALID: Moore says, if he can get the president's ear, maybe he could convince him to give NLMK an exemption. The company officially applied for an exemption with the Commerce Department in March, but that application is still pending. Moore says he thought tariffs would help the country. But now he's just nervous about his own future. MOORE: You know, every day, I have to try to stay focused on my job. But you have that question in your mind - how much longer do I have before I get my pink slip? KHALID: As we walk, we pass boarded-up storefronts and dilapidated houses. Up the road from NLMK, I meet Farrell's city manager, Michael Ceci. He sounds glum. He says he doesn't know if the company can stay in business with a 25 percent steel tariff. And if it doesn't, that would crush the city financially. MICHAEL CECI: I would - not figuratively but literally. . . (SOUNDBITE OF KEYS CLINKING)CECI: . . . Leave the keys on the desk. The lights will get turned off, and the power doesn't get paid. And that's it. KHALID: Ceci says a quarter of the city's revenue comes directly from an NLMK through property taxes and income taxes. And he is frustrated because Farrell has had a hard time, and now life in this city finally seemed to be getting a tad better with NLMK. CECI: We've gotten 700 great jobs, high-paying jobs at this mill. It's really helping. It's a spark of life. And now you're going to change the rules again and make us start over again. KHALID: NLMK's argument is that it can't find enough steel to work with in the U. S. So it imports it from Russia to produce coils in Pennsylvania. But it's an argument that's up for debate. Tariff supporters say it's true. Maybe right now there is not enough domestic steel, but that's changing precisely because of the tariffs. And critics are skeptical NLMK would really shut down. They say the company is exaggerating the supply problems because it wants to continue buying cheaper steel from Russia. In a statement to NPR, the company strongly denied it's doing this. The Commerce Department will ultimately decide who's right. Bill Almashy, though, who also works at the mill, just hopes he doesn't lose his job. BILL ALMASHY: If it would go down because they don't get the exemption, this will be the third steel mill I've closed. KHALID: I meet Almashy in a park with his daughter. He tells me he's worked at two other mills. One went bankrupt. The other moved most of its jobs to Mexico. Along the way, he lost his home, his pension and his 401(k). ALMASHY: A lot of steel in America is gone. Basically, our politicians failed us. KHALID: Almashy says Americans need to get back to buying American products. And so when he first heard about President Trump's tariffs, he liked the idea. He told me he still does. But he doesn't understand why his company should get punished for importing steel. ALMASHY: Even if they're foreign-owned but they have a factory in this country and they're employing American workers, to me, that's an American company. KHALID: To Almashy, exempting this Russian-owned steel mill from the tariffs would be putting America first. Asma Khalid, NPR News, Farrell, Penn.

U. S. Steel made that announcement this past week. That's on top of the 500 new jobs U. S. Steel announced in March. The company pointed to the Trump administration's controversial tariffs on imported steel as one of the reasons. Dan Simmons is the president of the steelworkers union in Granite City, and he joins us now. Welcome to the program. DAN SIMMONS: Well, thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to take you back a little bit to understand the context of what happened in your town. I understand the last few years have been really tough for your members. U. S. Steel laid off hundreds of workers in 2015. What did that mean for the people there? SIMMONS: It was devastating. When you take their livelihood away, there's nothing out there. And what jobs are there that these guys were able to, you know, pick up, they weren't making nothing what they were making with us. And you watch the - not only these members and their families erode, you see this town erode, the community. It's like a big sucking sound, so to speak. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what has the community's reaction been to this most recent announcement? SIMMONS: Well, it's just the opposite (laughter) the total opposite. You see smiles on everybody's faces when I go into stores. Not only are we adding so many jobs at the mill, but it's all the mom-and-pop shops, all the suppliers, all the vendors, all the people that are connected to this. So it's - jubilant is probably the word. These people are ecstatic. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So one of the big criticisms of these tariffs that Trump has imposed that have benefited the steel industry is that other parts of the U. S. economy may suffer and that steel costs will go up and ripple through the economy. What is your response to that? SIMMONS: Well, as far as the downstream industries that was squealing that it's going to negatively impact now their business, what I say to them - they've been profiting for too long off of illegal imports at our cost. They were getting cheap, dump steel. So, you know, I don't have much sympathy for those downstreams that were leeching off these illegal imports at the cost of our jobs in the steel industry. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs targeting U. S. pork producers, apple growers. What do you say to people in those industries who are now affected because other countries are basically saying, you know, we're not going to take this lying down? SIMMONS: Clearly, we don't want to see anybody negatively impacted or harmed by what we were fighting and struggling for. I always tease that it's kind of like that cartoon character - on one side, we're pulling on a vegetable and on the other end of the world they're pulling the other way. That seems to be what the threat is, the counter threat. And it's a big poker game we're playing. And I hope it's just a poker game and we don't get caught up into a deep back-and-forth, tit for tat on trade. But I do feel like we are one of the biggest links in the chain of trade. So some of these threats I do feel are veiled threats, that they're just words that they won't be able to live without these products. I don't feel that it'll be a real threat. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Just more widely, I mean, I imagine that President Trump's pretty popular right now in your town. SIMMONS: Well, there's a lot of things we are at odds with him with because we've been a pretty strong Democrat supporter in this area and this plant. And him acting on this trade issue the way he did, there are a lot of people that are probably supporting of that. Now, I guess the proof's in the pudding. We'll see how this all lines up. We'll see where this ends up between now and the next election cycle for him. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dan Simmons, president of the United Steelworkers Local 1899 in Granite City, Ill. , thank you so much.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Just more widely, I mean, I imagine that President Trump's pretty popular right now in your town. SIMMONS: Well, there's a lot of things we are at odds with him with because we've been a pretty strong Democrat supporter in this area and this plant. And him acting on this trade issue the way he did, there are a lot of people that are probably supporting of that. Now, I guess the proof's in the pudding. We'll see how this all lines up. We'll see where this ends up between now and the next election cycle for him. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dan Simmons, president of the United Steelworkers Local 1899 in Granite City, Ill. , thank you so much.

They are buying pricey items on the Web. Nearly 3 out of 10 online shoppers in the United States have bought a product that costs a thousand dollars or more. That is according to an NPR/Marist poll. And as NPR's Uri Berliner reports, those big online spenders are much more likely to be men than women. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: The early days of the Web were pretty cumbersome. (SOUNDBITE OF AOL AD)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) How long have you had this? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) About a week. And it's so easy. All you do is point and click. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) But how does it work? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) All you need is a computer and a regular phone line. BERLINER: That's an AOL ad from the 1990s. Back then online shopping wasn't just awkward. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DIAL-UP MODEM)BERLINER: It felt risky. People were afraid to give out their credit card numbers. They worried, if products would arrive, would they be able to return them? Sucharita Kodali is an analyst with Forrester Research. She says gradually online shoppers dipped their toes in the water. SUCHARITA KODALI: And it would start with relatively low-ticket transactions, like a book, and that really was, I think, the beginning of it. BERLINER: The it she's talking about is the explosion in Internet shopping. Last year, U. S. shoppers spent $453 billion on retail purchases online. And many of them go big. Twenty-seven percent of online shoppers have bought an item that costs $1,000 or more. What do they buy? Just about anything. CARA VETOR: I purchased an infrared sauna online for about $1,100 in 2015. ANDY PENNELL: I bought a full-size movie prop of Han Solo in carbonite for $1,800. ALAN KWOK: I bought a lab-grown diamond engagement ring online for $11,000. KENNA MCKENZIE: Two harps. My latest harp cost $1,800. BERLINER: That's Cara Vetor of Indianapolis, Ind. , Andy Pennell of Kirkland, Wash. , Alan Kwok of Austin, Texas, and Kenna McKenzie of Tucumcari, N. M. If you dig a little deeper into the habits of online spenders, a striking fact emerges. Men are twice as likely as women to buy an item online that costs a thousand dollars or more. Guys have twitchier fingers. Kodali says she's not surprised. Men are usually the early adopters when it comes to technology. KODALI: If you were to consider, you know, high-end e-commerce purchases, and something that, you know, has historically had a lot of hold outs, the gender that I would expect to be the first to experiment with it would, of course, be men. And I think that's why you're seeing the breakout that you're seeing. BERLINER: Americus Reed, a professor of marketing at Wharton, believes there's another factor at work, too. AMERICUS REED: What the research has shown is that men tend to, if they are going to check something out, go to the store quickly, kind of gather as much information as they can quickly and just buy it online, particularly because it's just faster. BERLINER: Rick Hays of Tallahassee, Fla. , has no qualms about a big purchase he made last year at an online auction, even though it's just two sentences long. RICK HAYS: I purchased a note that Mark Twain had written regarding a missing package, and I paid about $1,500 for it. BERLINER: Hays says his wife has very different buying habits. HAYS: She struggled with buying a, you know, a hundred-dollar dress recently online. You know, she wants the experience of seeing it, the tactile experience, I think, of being around whatever item she wants to get. BERLINER: Hays says there may be another reason he's the more adventurous online shopper. His wife is still working. Hays is retired so he's got more time to browse. And just last week, Hays struck again, buying a signed picture of Muhammad Ali for $1,020. He says he was willing to go higher. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

No surprise, then, that its revenues make up more than 80 percent of the kingdom's budget. Now Saudi leaders want to use the company to overhaul their economy, even selling part of it off. NPR's Jackie Northam got a look inside the company's headquarters. MOHAMMED AL-ABDULLATIF: This is the heart of Saudi Aramco, where we manage the overall hydrocarbon network from the beginning. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Mohammed Al-Abdullatif stands on a platform and surveys a cavernous control room filled with massive screens and charts. The engineers here at Saudi Aramco chart the journey of every drop of crude. 4. 5 terabytes of data are received every second from wells all over Saudi Arabia. AL-ABDULLATIF: Since the center is operating 24/7, it ensures sustained and reliable supply of energy to our customer. NORTHAM: Aramco is often described as the crown jewel of Saudi Arabia. It was just up the road from Aramco where oil was first discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938. Over the years, that oil has provided the kingdom and its royal family with seemingly unlimited wealth. But that's not a given anymore. With concerns about fossil fuels and oil prices dropping, the government is having to change the way Aramco does business. SADAD AL-HUSSEINI: It's a sea change for Saudi Arabia - very much of a long-overdue change. And Aramco's a part of it. NORTHAM: Sadad al-Husseini is a former executive vice president of Aramco and now heads up his own firm, Husseini Energy. He says Aramco is at the center of a plan to diversify the economy from oil and create new industries, a plan being spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. AL-HUSSEINI: Aramco is a core element of both the Saudi economy and the long-term development of the kingdom's other sectors. So it was obvious he would look at it and see how he could leverage it more. NORTHAM: Leverage it by putting a slice of it up for sale, just a 5 percent stake. But it's being touted as the biggest initial public offering in history, possibly worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The money would be invested in big non-oil projects and to create much-needed jobs as part of what could be a turbulent economic reform in the kingdom, says Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, the minister of economy and planning. MOHAMMED AL-TUWAIJRI: It's going to be a very attractive proposition for local and global investors. We're very keen on opening our market. And it's a funding mechanism for doing other things to diversify the economy away from oil. So Aramco ticks all these boxes in a wonderful way. NORTHAM: But the sale could make some members of the royal family nervous. Aramco has never opened up its books to the public before, divulged the size of its oil reserves or its massive profits, says Jim Krane, Middle East energy specialist at Rice University's Baker Institute. JIM KRANE: Saudi Aramco answers to a royal family at the end of the day, and that royal family has thousands of members. And, you know, the amount of oil revenues that go to that family are a mystery. And I think the king would like to keep it that way. NORTHAM: Crane says the IPO comes at a time Aramco is branching out in other ways. It's buying up refineries around the world, including Port Arthur, Texas, guaranteeing customers for its oil. It's also developing a new use for its crude. There's a series of security measures you have to go through as you enter a restricted area of Sadara petrochemical plant. Beyond the gates, you can see camels wandering in the desert. Inside, the enormous $20 billion plant is a joint venture between Aramco and Dow Chemical. It opened last year. It converts Aramco's raw oil and gas into petrochemicals that are used to make everything from car seats to lipstick. FAISAL AL-FAQEER: Sadara is unique and young, but reliable. NORTHAM: Faisal al-Faqeer is the CEO of Sadara. He says the plant is being held up as a prime example of other valuable uses for Aramco's oil besides export. It's being embraced by Crown Prince Mohammed, often referred to as MbS. AL-FAQEER: Now there is a focus. There is big support from the government. MbS is - this is his baby. NORTHAM: Petrochemicals, selling some of its cherished private company, diversifying the economy - all sound necessary. But whether Saudi Arabia has the will to pull it off is another question. As a placard in an Aramco executive office says, keep calm. We still have oil. Jackie Northam, NPR News, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

And today, President Trump is preparing to do it, impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese-made products. The U. S. turned aside China's offer in last-minute talks to buy $70 billion worth of American farm and energy products. Now China is preparing to retaliate for the new tariffs, or taxes on imports, that tend to raise their price in the United States. Carlos Gutierrez was the commerce secretary under President George W. Bush. He's been following this. Welcome to the program. CARLOS GUTIERREZ: Good morning. INSKEEP: So when we think about what seems likely to be taxed here - televisions, medical devices, aircraft parts, batteries, a lot of other things - do you feel you understand what the strategy is? GUTIERREZ: Well, the idea is to tax as many either high-tech or high-tech-related materials that are coming out of China given that this stems from a 301 initiative, the 301 being targeted at intellectual property and technology transfer. INSKEEP: Well, with that - I guess that gets to what the administration is concerned about. China is trying to dominate certain high-tech industries and is accused of doing so in part by taking U. S. technology. Right? GUTIERREZ: That's just one piece of this. That's what is called Article 301. That is directly targeted at technology, technology transfer, intellectual property rights and very much focused on what China calls China 2025, when they plan to be almost self-sufficient in technology. There are other tariffs coming on. There's an investigation on autos. There are aluminum and steel tariffs. There are other things up in the air. And part of the problem is that there are too many things up in the air, too many threats, too many tariffs. And it's just hard to keep track of it all. And it is about tactics. Even though there is a trade strategy, these are circumstantial tactics. You never know what's going to happen next because a lot depends on the circumstances of what happens now. Everything seems to be in reaction to something else. INSKEEP: OK. So I think you're saying that some in the administration have a strategy. They have real concerns they want to raise with China. But the administration thrives on chaos. There's a president who likes to be unpredictable. And you're saying too many things are happening at once, and it's hard really to execute the strategy. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. I mean, I think there's a strategy in the sense that there is a concept that says that the U. S. has been taken advantage of, and we can see that through the trade deficit. I personally disagree with both. But after that, there really isn't a strategic plan. It's sort of being worked on as we go along. And that's part of the problem. So you don't know. Right now the president is being criticized by Congress for having backed off a little bit on ZTE - on the sanctions against ZTE for having broken. . . INSKEEP: Right. GUTIERREZ: . . . Iran's sanctions. That, in turn, may make the president feel like he has to be more forceful with these tariffs to show that he is strong. So again, that's what I mean about tactics. It's usually a response to something that just happened. And that's why it's so difficult to track. And anyone who wants to track it should do it every day. INSKEEP: So it's unpredictable what the administration is doing. Is it predictable, though, what happens now? The administration goes through with these tariffs, and then it's China's turn. GUTIERREZ: Yes, that's easier to predict. China will respond. And China will respond with products that will hurt the U. S. and will hurt U. S. lawmakers. So they've targeted Kentucky bourbon; they've targeted Harley-Davidson - Kentucky bourbon, of course, being from the state where Mitch McConnell's from. They've targeted products from Wisconsin, which is where Paul Ryan is from. So they know what they're doing. And they're also targeting red-state products. INSKEEP: Carlos Gutierrez is a former U. S. commerce secretary. Thanks very much. GUTIERREZ: Thank you very much. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   He's made this threat a number of times.

SIMON: The president said these tariffs are needed to prevent unfair transfers of U. S. technology and intellectual property to China. Will tariffs do that? IKENSON: I don't think so. I think the president has identified a legitimate problem. It's a problem that we've been hearing about for many years. But the president also conflates that intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer issue with just bilateral trade imbalances. And he sees our bilateral trade deficit with China as a sign that we are losing at trade as though trade were a zero sum game. And his intention of imposing tariffs is going to drive up the costs of production for U. S. manufacturers. It's going to drive up the cost of living for households. And there's going to be retaliation, which is also going to hurt U. S. manufacturers and agricultural interests. So it's not very well-thought through. SIMON: Well, U. S. officials, I believe, have indicated that tariffs might prompt some technology companies to move manufacturing out of China. If they did that, wouldn't that return more jobs to the United States? IKENSON: You know, I really don't think so. We have to recognize that in technology, as in just about every other industry, we have these global supply chains. There's tremendous interdependence, and throwing up tariffs is equivalent to, like, building a wall in the middle of a factory, the Ford Dearborn, Mich. , plant in 1950, right in the middle of the assembly line. SIMON: What would you suggest? IKENSON: I think the approach we should have been taking, and maybe it's not too late, is that we should have been standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies, with Japan, Korea, the European Union, to say to the Chinese, look; we have a problem with your technological mercantilism. You're not playing by the rules. We're going to bring cases to the World Trade Organization, which is, you know, enforces the rule of law in trade. There's a narrative that has emerged in Washington that suggests that the WTO can't rein in China, but that is a false narrative. I think China has complied with most of the judgments that have come down against it so far. There have been 40 cases brought against China since it joined the WTO in 2001. That, by the way, is just a fraction of the cases brought against the United States. But we should use the rule of law. We should stand with our allies. But instead, we've hit our allies with steel and aluminum tariffs. We withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which was another way to rein in some of these practices in China. And now, we stand alone as the international bad guy. SIMON: Mr. Ikenson, I don't think President Trump ever made it secret that he wanted to do this, did he? This is the trade expression of America First. IKENSON: You know, Trump is making good on his - some of his campaign promises. But to what effect? It seems to me that the biggest losers from a trade war are going to be the people who have supported Trump's presidency, people in the manufacturing sector and people in the agricultural sector. There's a better way to do this, and that's through cooperation. President Trump departs from about 80 years of U. S. trade policy history. Presidents going back to FDR supported the institutions of trade, saw trade as a way to foster good relations among nations and to grow economies. And President Trump doesn't seem to get that at the moment. And there is a certain grievance to this America First nationalism that Trump projects. It's this idea that the United States is this benevolent giant, that after the Second World War we were generous, we had a generosity of spirit, generosity of resources. We rebuilt Europe and Asia. We provided a security blanket for these people to reemerge. And what did they do? Did they thank us? No. They decided to rebuild their industries and challenge us, and sometimes they subsidized those industries. And we need tribute from these countries. And there's this sense that, you know, it's a version of American exceptionalism that I think jeopardizes the whole trading system. SIMON: Dan Ikenson, director of Cato's Herbert A.

Beijing has promised to match the U. S. response. And on China's list of tariffs - U. S. soybeans. This has American farmers worried because half of all soybeans grown in the U.

LIU: (Through interpreter) It's too risky to grow soybeans, and the income is less stable than growing corn. You don't lose money growing corn. Soybean yields are too low. SCHMITZ: And government subsidies, says Liu, aren't enough incentive to grow soybeans.

SI: (Through interpreter) Judging from the land and water resources we have, I don't think it's realistic to grow all the soybeans we need ourselves and completely replace U. S. imports. We use U.

In the years that followed the collapse, Congress and federal regulators drew up rules to rein in big banks and prevent another crisis. A report out today says banks have found a loophole around some of those rules, and it warns that taxpayers could be on the hook if the economy takes a bad turn. NPR's Jim Zarroli has been digging into this. He joins us now. And, Jim, the 2008 crisis was caused by a lot of complicated financial investments. So is this what the report is focused on? JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Yes. Yes. Let's say you own some kind of investment, and you're worried that it might lose value. One way that you can protect yourself is by buying something called a credit default swap. Now, this is one of those really complex Wall Street products that works like - it works like a kind of an insurance contract. You can even buy these contracts on someone else's investment. And that's exactly what a lot of investors did in the years leading up to the crash. They placed bets on assets owned by other people, especially on mortgages. The market for those products was huge. It was in the trillions of dollars. So when the mortgage market tanked, there were just enormous losses, and they dragged the global economy down. And after that, Congress came in and set up a lot of new rules to govern these swaps. Wall Street didn't like them because Wall Street makes a lot of money off of selling these products. CORNISH: Now a report says Wall Street has found a loophole in the rules. Can you give us a little bit more background in the study itself in terms of who did it? And what do they consider a loophole? ZARROLI: Well, this is based on research by Michael Greenberger of the University of Maryland. During the Clinton administration, he was with the agency that regulates these contracts called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Greenberger says all of this comes down to a single footnote in the regulations - you know, the kind of footnote that most people don't ever read. It essentially says the regulations don't apply if the products are traded overseas. And Greenberger says the banks interpreted this to mean that they could, you know, slough these trades off to their foreign subsidiaries. CORNISH: So wait a second. You're talking about swaps overseas. Why would that be a problem for U. S. taxpayers? ZARROLI: Well, it comes down to a question of who's on the hook. I mean, remember; after the financial crisis, U. S. taxpayers had to bail out the banks for losses. The banks are saying that won't happen again this time because these - you know, these - swaps are traded overseas, so U. S. rules don't apply. But Greenberger says that's a fig leaf because even though a foreign subsidiary will be doing the trades, these are still U. S. banks, so U. S. taxpayers will have to bail them out. CORNISH: The U. S. economy seems to be doing fairly well right now. How much should we really be concerned about this? ZARROLI: Well, we don't really know how big a problem this is. Greenberger says a lot of these trades - you know, we just don't know that much about how many there are. But the former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker appeared at a press conference today to talk about this report. And he says history really shows us that these problems have a way of festering, and then all of a sudden, you have, you know, a really big problem on your hands. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)PAUL VOLCKER: What strikes me is I've seen it all before. . . (LAUGHTER)VOLCKER: . . . Over and over again in different degrees of complication. ZARROLI: So federal regulators are aware of this loophole. They've been working on this before. Under the Obama administration, there was an effort that took some time to try to tighten it.

S. was preparing to levy tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese exports to the U. S. That is on top of the tariffs already announced. China has, again, threatened to retaliate. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The U. S. is already on course to begin collecting tariffs on July 6 on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. And the Chinese are set to respond in kind. In a statement from the White House late yesterday, President Trump said this new round of tariffs is necessary because of a lack of progress in talks with China. Former acting U. S. trade representative Wendy Cutler says that's unfortunate. WENDY CUTLER: He's clearly frustrated with China's failure to respond to the issues that we put on the table with respect to intellectual property and technology issues. And he's ready to escalate the dispute with China even if it means retaliating in the hundreds of billions of dollars. YDSTIE: In fact, Trump also said, if necessary, he's willing to punish up to $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. That would cover almost all the annual U. S. imports from China. The president defended his action today in a speech before the National Federation of Independent Business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have no choice. This should have been done many years ago. We have no choice. China has been taking out $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuilding China. YDSTIE: Because China does not import enough from the U. S. to match the tariffs the U. S. is imposing, China says it will also retaliate in qualitative measures. Cutler says that could mean harassing U. S. companies doing business in China. CUTLER: Everything from withholding parts for a company so they can make their final product; we're talking about holding off approvals for certain products and factories. So these type of measures can actually in many respects have a greater impact than simple tariff increases. YDSTIE: Cutler says she's also worried this latest tit for tat means the trade conflict is getting harder and harder to resolve. CUTLER: When two sides are being so public about what they're willing to do and how they're willing to hurt each other, it's hard then to move off the ledge and to get back to the negotiating table. YDSTIE: The Chinese are very concerned about backing down and losing face, says Cutler, and so is President Trump, she says. So far, the actual U. S. tariffs already imposed on washing machines and solar panels and those set to take effect on July 6 would not hurt the U. S. economy much. But that could change, says Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. MARK ZANDI: If, however, the tariff increases include all the things that the president has been talking about, that would do real damage, cost the economy about a half a point on growth, 500,000, 600,000 in jobs a year from now at the peak impact. YDSTIE: And Zandi says there is a chance it could tip the U. S. economy into recession. ZANDI: Seems like a outlier, a real low-probability event, but it does now have a probability. YDSTIE: Already, Zandi says, U. S. consumers are being hit with higher prices on products facing tariffs. For instance, if you need a new washing machine. . . ZANDI: And you go down to your local appliance store, you're going to pay almost 20 percent more for that washer today than you would have a couple months ago because of the tariffs on that equipment. YDSTIE: Zandi says he thinks President Trump's strategy is unlikely to improve U. S. trade with China or with U. S. allies like Canada, Mexico and Europe. And he thinks the president's threats are already doing long-term damage. ZANDI: Our allies are now thinking about how they can do more business with each other as opposed to doing business with us. The uncertainty this is creating is making it bad for their businesses. So I think they're going to - they're going to pull away from us. YDSTIE: And Zandi says less trade with Europe, Canada and Mexico will erode U. S. growth and leave the country poorer in the future. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

WENDY CUTLER: He's clearly frustrated with China's failure to respond to the issues that we put on the table with respect to intellectual property and technology issues. And he's ready to escalate the dispute with China even if it means retaliating in the hundreds of billions of dollars. YDSTIE: In fact, Trump also said, if necessary, he's willing to punish up to $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. That would cover almost all the annual U. S. imports from China. The president defended his action today in a speech before the National Federation of Independent Business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have no choice. This should have been done many years ago. We have no choice. China has been taking out $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuilding China. YDSTIE: Because China does not import enough from the U. S. to match the tariffs the U. S. is imposing, China says it will also retaliate in qualitative measures. Cutler says that could mean harassing U. S. companies doing business in China. CUTLER: Everything from withholding parts for a company so they can make their final product; we're talking about holding off approvals for certain products and factories. So these type of measures can actually in many respects have a greater impact than simple tariff increases. YDSTIE: Cutler says she's also worried this latest tit for tat means the trade conflict is getting harder and harder to resolve. CUTLER: When two sides are being so public about what they're willing to do and how they're willing to hurt each other, it's hard then to move off the ledge and to get back to the negotiating table. YDSTIE: The Chinese are very concerned about backing down and losing face, says Cutler, and so is President Trump, she says. So far, the actual U. S. tariffs already imposed on washing machines and solar panels and those set to take effect on July 6 would not hurt the U. S. economy much. But that could change, says Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. MARK ZANDI: If, however, the tariff increases include all the things that the president has been talking about, that would do real damage, cost the economy about a half a point on growth, 500,000, 600,000 in jobs a year from now at the peak impact. YDSTIE: And Zandi says there is a chance it could tip the U. S. economy into recession. ZANDI: Seems like a outlier, a real low-probability event, but it does now have a probability. YDSTIE: Already, Zandi says, U. S. consumers are being hit with higher prices on products facing tariffs. For instance, if you need a new washing machine. . . ZANDI: And you go down to your local appliance store, you're going to pay almost 20 percent more for that washer today than you would have a couple months ago because of the tariffs on that equipment. YDSTIE: Zandi says he thinks President Trump's strategy is unlikely to improve U. S. trade with China or with U. S. allies like Canada, Mexico and Europe. And he thinks the president's threats are already doing long-term damage. ZANDI: Our allies are now thinking about how they can do more business with each other as opposed to doing business with us. The uncertainty this is creating is making it bad for their businesses. So I think they're going to - they're going to pull away from us. YDSTIE: And Zandi says less trade with Europe, Canada and Mexico will erode U. S. growth and leave the country poorer in the future. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Many rural American towns face depopulation. They've been declining in population for decades. Some hope for big turnarounds that will draw people back, but the researchers in Iowa think there's a better way, a more practical way, borrowed from towns in Eastern Europe to improve even as they lose population. Here's Frank Morris of member station KCUR. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Back when big families worked small farms, Americans built tens of thousands of towns that those families relied on to sell their crops and to buy just about everything else. Those days are long gone, and now remote, rural towns with a strong economic anchor are the lucky ones. Business is booming here at Sukup manufacturing in Sheffield, Iowa. They make those big, round, steel bins you see dotting the grain belt. Charles Sukup says he's hiring about as fast as he can and already employs close to 700 people in this town of just over 1,100. CHARLES SUKUP: Well, I guess our philosophy is you bloom where you're planted. MORRIS: But Sukup's dedication to Sheffield hasn't been enough to shield it from the larger social and economic headwinds buffeting small towns. KIMBERLY ZARECOR: The big picture for all rural communities that don't have a connection to a growing metro area is that they are going to get smaller over time. MORRIS: Kimberly Zarecor teaches at Iowa State University and argues that little towns should stop beating themselves up for losing population and instead focus on making life better for the residents they still have. ZARECOR: We call this the Shrink Smart Project. MORRIS: It's an idea that dawned on Zarecor when she studied in a city in the Czech Republic, one that saw its local coal and steel industry collapse 30 years ago. ZARECOR: Ostrava is a place that's shrinking, losing people, but it's still a place that people love to live in, are very loyal to. And it's also a place that outsiders look at and think, I don't want to be there. MORRIS: Sounds like any number of small American towns, right? Zarecor says the difference is that Ostrava is embracing the idea that it can shrink and still improve. Zarecor and her colleague at Iowa State, Dave Peters, want to bring that paradigm shift to rural America. Peters says they're conducting surveys to figure out how it is that some remote, rural towns manage to make life better for their residents even as their populations drain away. DAVE PETERS: So Sac City is probably one of our best examples of shrink smart in that the quality of the services, the quality of the government, the quality the community, it's phenomenal. MORRIS: That's Sac City, Iowa - population 2,200 and falling. (LAUGHTER)MORRIS: It's 7 a. m. and members of the Sac City Community Foundation are discussing possible projects - $2,500 to build a bike path, maybe chipping in for a marketing campaign. Board member Steve Irwin says that while Sac City wants to grow, it's quality of life that comes first. STEVE IRWIN: It's more about how the people feel about their towns. Are they happy? Do they have a sense of community? Do they have the essentials of life? Do they have health care and recreation? MORRIS: Smaller than most cities' tiniest suburb, Sac City boasts a hospital, a nice rec center, two pools, schools, a library, robust day care, even a roadside attraction - the world's largest popcorn ball, a confection that weighs more than 4 1/2 tons - this in a town that's lost a big chunk of its economic base and a third of its population since the 1980s. Irwin says the secret sauce here is people, super-involved citizens, willing to work together for the good of the town. IRWIN: You know, we always seem to have a champion for a project, somebody or some group or something that kind of takes the lead. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We're gaining. MORRIS: A couple of men are building a new shelter in Sac City's leafy cemetery. It's a very small part of the work funded by one of the town's former champions, John Criss, a local businessman who died and left $5. 7 million to beautify Sac City. This came as a complete surprise, even to Renae Jacobsen, who Criss left in charge of the fund. RENAE JACOBSEN: I think it was just his way of giving back to the town - probably saw that it needed some beautification, some work, and he just didn't want to see it die out like so many small towns do. MORRIS: Global economic forces will likely keep grinding away at many remote, rural towns. But people in Sac City hope that by working collaboratively, they can little by little raise the quality of life even as population declines. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Sac City, Iowa.

The White House says he's going to hold a roundtable on protecting American workers. But some economists say Trump right now is actually putting American jobs at risk with the trade conflicts he has provoked. This week, the president threatened tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. He has already slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the EU and Mexico. And all of this is happening at a time when the U. S. economy has been booming. So could these tariffs hurt job growth? Well, even Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, says maybe. This is him with Chris Wallace on Fox News. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\")LARRY KUDLOW: Oh, it might. I don't deny that. You have to keep an eye on it. It's a very precious. . . CHRIS WALLACE: It could jeopardize that. KUDLOW: It's possible, absolutely. I don't think it has right now. GREENE: All right. Stephen Moore has also advised the Trump administration on economic matters. He has also expressed worry about tariffs hurting U. S. jobs, and he joins us this morning. Mr. Moore, welcome back. STEPHEN MOORE: Hi, David. GREENE: So explain to me the concern about jobs here. How - is this a matter of tariffs could hurt American consumers who would have to pay higher prices and that's how U. S. jobs could be harmed? MOORE: Well, David, let's just step back a minute. As you mentioned, I worked with Donald Trump during the campaign when he was running for president. And one of the things that he said over and over during that campaign was that he was going to get very tough with China in trade deals. GREENE: Right. MOORE: This day has come. And so I don't know if you're a poker player, but it's almost like Donald Trump said yesterday I'm all in. GREENE: I'm more blackjack and craps, but if I played poker, you're saying I could have - this is him basically making that move. MOORE: Well, there you go. And so now you're talking about tariffs that will affect - you know, if this takes place, by the way, and I do think - again, to use the poker metaphor, I think he's thrown a chip in. But I don't know if he's - you know, there's a good chance that they're going to negotiate a settlement before all of this goes into effect. But this is a big deal. GREENE: OK, so this could be just threats. MOORE: But this is a big deal. And you're talking about $200 billion of products that would face tariffs that would affect, you know, potentially, again, if this goes into effect, the price of everything from TVs to cellphones to toys and almost anything you buy in Walmart might rise in cost. Now, the question is, is this worth it? And, you know, my own opinion is, you know, there's a big risk here - no question about it. Obviously, the stock market doesn't like this at all. The market's fallen by about 600 points since he's announced these tariffs. On the other hand, there is something to what Trump is saying, that for a long, long time we've - as a nation and our leaders have turned a blind eye to bad behavior by China. It is true that they steal a lot of our technology, and they steal a lot of our intellectual property, everything from our computer software to our movies and music and. . . GREENE: So the question is, is it worth taking the risk if it means forcing China to change its behavior? Well, Stephen Moore, could we just go through a couple scenarios of how this could play out? I mean, if these tariffs are put on things like televisions, as you say, I as a consumer might not buy a television. Fewer televisions are selling, and that could mean that producers are shaving jobs, and that could be one scenario. MOORE: Well, look; Donald Trump believes, actually, that by putting this tariff on that people will buy more American-made products and that - if you were interviewing him right now, he would say this is going to create more American jobs. And look; the truth is there are some areas of the country where workers have been hurt by trade with China where factories have left. And I went to a lot of those areas in the country in the Midwest where voters rightly or wrongly believe that that is true, that they - that the factories have left because of China. I think there's some truth to that - not an entire truth to it. But, you know, so there's a plus and a minus here, I would say, that the outcome that we would all like to see from this is that China does make some capitulations. And I think everyone should understand that China does also impose a lot of extreme trade barriers for the United States producers to penetrate the China market whereas we've opened up our doors to them with very few tariffs. And I think Trump does have a case to be made that it's not a - he uses the term reciprocal - that it's not a reciprocal negotiation and arrangement we have with them because they impose a lot higher tariffs on us than we do with them. GREENE: Well, let me just keep you on the gambling metaphor. I know there's no way to know for sure, but do you think that American jobs would be hurt if these tariffs go forward and (unintelligible)? MOORE: I am an optimist here. I'm going to be an optimist and I'm going to say I think China is going to sit down at the negotiating table with Donald Trump sometime in the next few months. And this is going to get resolved in a way that will actually lead to less - ultimately, we want freer trade out of this, not more protectionism by China playing by the rules and stop stealing. And I think there's a high likelihood, actually, that that will happen, but it's going to take - it could take months. GREENE: All right, Stephen Moore of The Heritage Foundation, thanks as always.

The Supreme Court ruled today that states can force retailers to collect and remit sales taxes on out-of-state purchases. The 5-to-4 decision reverses decades-old decisions. Those rulings had protected out-of-state vendors from sales tax obligations unless the vendor had a physical presence in the state. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports the decision could add billions to state coffers. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The court's earlier decisions that were reversed today date back to a time when mail order sales were relatively small and online sales were all but non-existent. Writing for the five-justice majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that in the modern economy, the rule linking tax collection to a physical presence in the state unconstitutionally deprives states of the ability to collect taxes and perform critical public functions. The decision was a victory for South Dakota, which, like some other states, has no income tax and relies on sales taxes to fund most of the state's services. Because of dramatic fall-offs in state sales tax collection, the state in 2016 enacted a law to test the physical presence rule. Three large online vendors, Wayfair, Newegg and Overstock, challenged the law in court and lost today. MARTY JACKLEY: It's a great day for South Dakota and Main Street America. TOTENBERG: Marty Jackley is South Dakota's attorney general. JACKLEY: It's an additional, in the words of the Supreme Court, $48 to $58 million that South Dakota can use for education, health care and infrastructure. But it's much bigger than that. I think it's going to revive Main Street South Dakota and Main Street America. TOTENBERG: South Dakota Senator Deb Peters, president of the National Conference of State Legislatures, noted that small businesses have faced an uphill battle against out-of-state vendors who until now could charge lower prices because they didn't have to collect sales taxes. She points to a local shoe store for example. DEB PETERS: The storefront on Main Street is paying property taxes in their local community. They're paying the person that's helping you try on the shoes, and, you know, they've got to pay for the inventory. TOTENBERG: But she said they lose a lot of sales because people know they can buy the same shoes online without paying taxes. While some online sellers recently have started collecting sales taxes, others like L. L. Bean do not. Amazon does collect on direct sales but not indirect sales. That's likely to change now. Twenty-four states have already agreed to a streamlined proposal for vendors collecting sales taxes. But some of the most populous states - New York, Texas and California - have until now refused to sign on and have far more complicated tax collection systems. Congress, as the court acknowledged, could enact a broad-based law for state sales tax collection, but anti-tax groups and Republicans in Congress have bottled up such proposals. Today's victory for South Dakota would seem to flip the script with states less interested now in enacting some sort of national legislation and online vendors perhaps more interested. Stephanie Martz is general counsel for the National Retail Federation, which includes 18,000 businesses large and small. STEPHANIE MARTZ: I think the chessboard just looks a lot different now. TOTENBERG: But she added. MARTZ: Now our members are going to be able to figure out how to construct their businesses without worrying about whether putting a distribution center on this side of a state line or that side of a state line will result in a different tax implication. TOTENBERG: While the court made clear that the states do not have unlimited power to require a sales tax collection, as Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, put it. . . CARL DAVIS: The court blessed South Dakota's law. TOTENBERG: That law specifically protects small businesses from collecting sales taxes if they have less than $100,000 or fewer than 200 sales in the state. The state provides sales tax collection software for free for any business that wants it. And most importantly, the state law does not permit sales tax collection for past purchases.

The decision was a victory for South Dakota, which, like some other states, has no income tax and relies on sales taxes to fund most of the state's services. Because of dramatic fall-offs in state sales tax collection, the state in 2016 enacted a law to test the physical presence rule. Three large online vendors, Wayfair, Newegg and Overstock, challenged the law in court and lost today. MARTY JACKLEY: It's a great day for South Dakota and Main Street America. TOTENBERG: Marty Jackley is South Dakota's attorney general. JACKLEY: It's an additional, in the words of the Supreme Court, $48 to $58 million that South Dakota can use for education, health care and infrastructure. But it's much bigger than that. I think it's going to revive Main Street South Dakota and Main Street America. TOTENBERG: South Dakota Senator Deb Peters, president of the National Conference of State Legislatures, noted that small businesses have faced an uphill battle against out-of-state vendors who until now could charge lower prices because they didn't have to collect sales taxes. She points to a local shoe store for example. DEB PETERS: The storefront on Main Street is paying property taxes in their local community. They're paying the person that's helping you try on the shoes, and, you know, they've got to pay for the inventory. TOTENBERG: But she said they lose a lot of sales because people know they can buy the same shoes online without paying taxes. While some online sellers recently have started collecting sales taxes, others like L. L. Bean do not. Amazon does collect on direct sales but not indirect sales. That's likely to change now. Twenty-four states have already agreed to a streamlined proposal for vendors collecting sales taxes. But some of the most populous states - New York, Texas and California - have until now refused to sign on and have far more complicated tax collection systems. Congress, as the court acknowledged, could enact a broad-based law for state sales tax collection, but anti-tax groups and Republicans in Congress have bottled up such proposals. Today's victory for South Dakota would seem to flip the script with states less interested now in enacting some sort of national legislation and online vendors perhaps more interested. Stephanie Martz is general counsel for the National Retail Federation, which includes 18,000 businesses large and small. STEPHANIE MARTZ: I think the chessboard just looks a lot different now. TOTENBERG: But she added. MARTZ: Now our members are going to be able to figure out how to construct their businesses without worrying about whether putting a distribution center on this side of a state line or that side of a state line will result in a different tax implication. TOTENBERG: While the court made clear that the states do not have unlimited power to require a sales tax collection, as Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, put it. . . CARL DAVIS: The court blessed South Dakota's law. TOTENBERG: That law specifically protects small businesses from collecting sales taxes if they have less than $100,000 or fewer than 200 sales in the state. The state provides sales tax collection software for free for any business that wants it. And most importantly, the state law does not permit sales tax collection for past purchases.

And that has the Trump administration claiming its policies are working. Still, a growing number of analysts point to signs a recession could be looming. NPR's Chris Arnold tells us what's happening. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The president has predicted that his policies will spur growth so much that the U. S. economy will grow at a rate well above 3 percent, maybe even 5 percent. That would be super great economic growth - more jobs, probably better wages. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVEN MNUCHIN: A year ago, people were laughing when we talked about 3 percent GDP. ARNOLD: That's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaking on CNBC. He was happy to talk about how some analysts now think that the next reading of gross domestic product will show growth somewhere between 4 and 5 percent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MNUCHIN: We're expecting a big second-quarter GDP number. We have an economy that's here because of the president's tax plan and the president's regulatory relief. ARNOLD: At the same time, unemployment is at historic lows. But it may not be all sunshine and good times are here again. Those GDP numbers bounce around a lot quarter to quarter, and a growing number of analysts see warning signs of a recession. One of those signs is called. . . SCOTT SIMON: The yield curve. ARNOLD: . . . The yield curve. That's Scott Simon. He's a former portfolio manager at the bond trading firm PIMCO. So we asked him, why is this yield curve thing worrying people? SIMON: The yield curve may sound boring - and it does - but some believe that a flatter, inverted yield curve is a recessionary canary in a coal mine. ARNOLD: OK, a flat or inverted yield curve - here's what that actually means. Ten-year Treasury bonds, they usually pay out a higher interest rate than shorter-term bonds. That's because of expectations about economic growth and inflation. SIMON: If people think the economy is going to slow and inflation's going to go down, long-term interest rates tend to go down. ARNOLD: And when plotted on a graph, the difference between the long and the short bonds flattens out. It can even flip. That can be a sign that a lot of investors see trouble ahead, which is why it sets off a blinking red light on economists' dashboards. In fact, every recession of the past 60 years has happened after the yield curve's red light has started blinking. And it's getting pretty close to that level again now. So that sounds pretty ominous, but. . . SIMON: While that is true, it hasn't been a very good predictor because it keeps predicting recessions that haven't occurred. It was wrong in 1994. It was wrong in 1998. It was right in 2001. It was also right in 2006-7. ARNOLD: But Simon says he's not freaked out about it this time around. That's because ever since the Great Recession, the Fed and other central banks have been doing unusual things that distort the bond market. And so this recession meter, he says, has been thrown off. Just about all economists agree, though, there is one thing that could eventually drive the economy into recession, and that is a trade war. David Kotok is chief economist with Cumberland Advisors. He says the White House lacks a coherent approach to trade policy. DAVID KOTOK: What's the policy of the United States? Is it Navarro? Is it Mnuchin? Is it Wilbur Ross? Is it Larry Kudlow? Is it the president who changes his mind back and forth every day? How do you proceed? ARNOLD: Kotok says businesses are delaying investments already amidst that uncertainty. That slows growth. He's not predicting recession yet, but he says if the trade fight grows into a full-blown trade war, that could definitely drive the country into recession. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

Chamber of Commerce put out a statement today taking issue with the president's trade policies. Tell us about what the statement said. ZARROLI: Well, one of the things it said - it's - it really - it had a kind of an analysis in it of how much the tariffs will cost every state. So state economies in some states, like Washington and Ohio, will lose billions of dollars, as much as $6 billion. It also said, you know, the president has done a lot of things right in the economy, like the tax cuts. But a trade war could really undermine that. Then, Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity, which is a Koch brothers-funded group, said virtually the same thing on MSNBC today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM PHILLIPS: This administration deserves a lot of credit for this economy doing better, with their tax cuts, tax reforms, eliminating barriers on the regulatory front. But these tariffs risk undermining everything good that's been happening. ZARROLI: And the important thing here is not just that they don't like Trump's policies. It's that groups like the Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity, they have a lot of money to spend. And they're saying that they're willing to use it to fight the Trump administration's policies. SHAPIRO: And outside of the U. S. , the president is doing battle with some of America's major trading partners. Explain how this is playing out. ZARROLI: It - (laughter) well, it's not playing out well. Over the weekend, Canada imposed some tariffs on U. S. exports, things like whiskey, coffee products. The European Union came out with some comments the other day about Trump's proposed tariffs on autos. It said this will only backfire against the U. S. And this coming Friday, the Trump administration is supposed to slap some tariffs on Chinese imports, and China is going to retaliate. It's drawn up this long list of American products that is - that are going to be affected. So you know, Trump has said many times that the - you know, once the U. S. started getting on - tough on what he says are these abusive trading practices, that other countries would give in. And there's simply no sign of that happening at this point. SHAPIRO: And is there any sign that all this pushback is swaying the administration? ZARROLI: Not really. I mean, Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, he's been one of the big trade hawks in the administration. He was on CNBC today. He was asked about the fact that the stock market has been pretty lackluster this year. And a lot of people think that's because of the trade war. And so he - Ross was asked, how much of a drop in the markets are you willing to tolerate until you change course on trade? And this is what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILBUR ROSS: The president is trying to fix long-term problems that should have been dealt with long time ago - weren't. And there obviously is going to be some pulling and tugging as we try to deal with very serious problems. ZARROLI: And then Trump over the weekend have had some really strong words about trade, especially about the European Union. He said - he was on Fox, and he said in an interview, they treat us very unfairly. He actually said the European Union is possibly as bad as China, just smaller. And he said every country that has a trade deficit with the United States should be subject to tariffs. So he's not backing down. SHAPIRO: All right. NPR's Jim Zarroli. Thanks, Jim.

As a result, hundreds of products could become more expensive. The administration says it is targeting unfair trading practices by Chinese companies. But according to researchers, most of the companies affected by the U. S. tariffs aren't even Chinese. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Joe Cohen started designing power snow shovels in high school. He was soon selling them on the home shopping channel QVC, where his products became something of a fixture. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This has got to be the most easy, convenient - by the way, he'll show you how little it weighs in a second - snowblower to own and use. ZARROLI: Today the company Cohen started called Snow Joe sells 700 different home and garden products. They're designed in New Jersey but mostly made overseas. JOE COHEN: I mean, there's just no other alternative. If there was a source in - you know, somewhere here absolutely it makes sense to produce it. But there are none. ZARROLI: Some of the products Cohen sells are made in China. They include garden tillers and cultivators, which are included on the Trump administration's tariff list. COHEN: We're going to do everything in our power to maintain our cost to our retailers and ultimately the retail price, but 25 percent's a really big number. Sooner or later, unfortunately, the price will ultimately go up, and consumers will pay more for it. ZARROLI: The company's plight underscores the unintended consequences of the tariff war between the United States and its trading partners. Mary Lovely, professor of economics at Syracuse University, says U. S. tariffs may be aimed at China, but in a recent report, she said, most of the companies that will be hurt are not Chinese. That's partly because of how intertwined global supply chains have become. For example, Lovely says, other countries still buy elevators made in America. MARY LOVELY: The U. S. is able to make elevators successfully partly by importing some of the less skill-intensive parts and then assembling those elevators here in the United States and then exporting those elevators to the rest of the world. ZARROLI: Lovely says a lot of the items targeted for tariffs are parts and pieces of products that are imported from China and assembled into finished goods in other countries. LOVELY: Sixty percent of all the trade between U. S. and China actually takes place through these multinational supply chains. ZARROLI: Because the tariffs are hidden inside these complex supply chains, consumers won't see price increases right away, but they will eventually. Mabuchi Motor is a Japanese company that makes small motors used in autos and medical devices. The motors Mabuchi makes in China are on the U. S. tariff list. Anne Hoef is treasurer of the company's U. S. distribution arm. She says Mabuchi will have to pass on the cost of the tariffs to its customers, the auto and medical companies that it sells to. ANNE HOEF: They're going to simply pass that cost on to their customers, which in many cases is the U. S. consumer. This isn't going to hurt China. This is going to hurt us. ZARROLI: Hoef says the company could leave China and find another country to make motors in, but that would take a while. HOEF: I mean, this could take two to three years before we are up and running with a new line. That's just not practical right now. ZARROLI: And even if it wanted to relocate, it's not clear where Mabuchi could go. The company also uses a factory in Mexico for some of its manufacturing. It can bring the products it makes there into the United States because of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But with President Trump renegotiating NAFTA, it's not clear how long it will be able to use that plant either. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

The Chinese government said this as the world's two largest economies impose tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of each other's imports. Both sides have said they're prepared to raise the stakes, hiking tariffs even more if the other country does not back down. To give us some idea of how this is all going to play out, we're joined now by NPR's Jim Zarroli. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So how soon do you think it'll be before consumers start feeling the impact of all these tariffs? ZARROLI: Well, I guess it kind of depends on which consumers we're talking about. The United States has imposed tariffs on up to 25 percent on a lot of different products. A lot of them are on machinery; also the parts that manufacturers use in the assembly process. These should eventually cause the price of a lot of consumer goods to go up, but it will take a while. China, on the other hand, has targeted things like electric vehicles but also a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, which is going to hurt a lot of farmers who, of course, tend to like President Trump. And that's not accidental because China is targeting its tariffs for maximum political effect. CHANG: I can imagine. Now, President Trump says he will respond to China's response by imposing even more tariffs on China. So how is China likely going to deal with that? ZARROLI: Well, China says the Trump administration's moves violate the rules of the World Trade Organization, which is the group that deals with global trade disputes. It says it won't be pressured. It says it's going to give as good as it gets. And it said it won't stop at tariffs necessarily. It's talked about what it describes as qualitative measures. CHANG: What does that mean? ZARROLI: I spoke with Monica de Bolle, who's an economist at the Peterson Institute on International Economics. I asked her what that meant. De Bolle says China can make it really difficult for American companies that want to do business there. MONICA DE BOLLE: And they can do that by just making the bureaucracy very difficult, making customs procedures very difficult for U. S. goods. So there are a number of other things that they can do on top of tariffs. CHANG: This could turn into a major fight between these two economic superpowers. What kind of risk is there for real economic harm? ZARROLI: Well, the tariffs by themselves are not really a big problem right now. The United States economy is doing well. We had another really good unemployment report today. So tariffs on $34 billion worth of imports - that's not really going to push the United States into a recession. The problem, of course, is that we don't know how big this gets. These are big economies. If they want to start inflicting real damage on each other, they can do it. Monica de Bolle says we're really in uncharted territory, and it's not just because China is so big. De Bolle says China is different in another really important way. DE BOLLE: It's not completely a market-driven economy, so the government exerts a lot of control. ZARROLI: So China has a lot of leverage that the United States doesn't really have in that sense. One of the things it has done before is discouraged Chinese consumers from buying products from countries that the government is unhappy with for whatever reason. It's done that with South Korea and Japan. There are a lot of American companies that do sell products in China, and they would be hurt. General Motors, for instance, sells more cars in China than it does in the United States. CHANG: Well, what kind of leverage does the U. S. have then? ZARROLI: China needs the U. S. market. The United States buys a lot of products from Chinese companies, and China is heavily dependent on exports to the United States. CHANG: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli. Thank you, Jim.

The U. S. economy is adding jobs. The unemployment rate has hit record lows. The numbers show the economy is growing. President Donald Trump is taking that news to the campaign trail. Here he is at a rally in Montana on Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've created 3. 4 million jobs since Election Day, which nobody can even believe. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But do these numbers give the whole picture? We wanted to know how the economy is playing out in communities across the United States. So we asked you to tell us about your financial situation. Nine years after the recession, are things easier or harder to afford? We received a huge response over this topic. And many of you said you're still struggling to make ends meet. DAVID KASTNER: We are able to find jobs, I guess, but they are not, like, high-paying jobs. MARGARITA RODRIGUEZ: We have three children, and what we pay for their child care is actually more than what we pay for our mortgage. LISA ROW: I'm actually making less now than I did 10 years ago. CARRIE ROSE: I feel like I'm a hamster in a wheel, going paycheck to paycheck. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was David Kastner (ph) of Pierce, S. D. , Margarita Rodriguez (ph) of Washington, D. C. , Lisa Row (ph) of New Jersey and Carrie Rose (ph) from Seaside, Calif. . Jamie Hamann is one of our listeners who called in. He's a histotechnologist, the guy in the lab who looks at samples to help determine if they're cancerous or not. He averages about $56,000 a year. Since the recession, he hasn't had more than a 1. 2 percent pay raise in his income. He lives in Reno, Nev. . JAMIE HAMANN: I'm a single dad. I have three kids that I'm trying to raise, and - on the wages that I'm making now, which I feel are respectful wages, but it's just very difficult. The cost of living in Reno, Nev. , is skyrocketing. The rent for a place where I can raise my children is getting up to like 2,000 a month. I'm able to get groceries. But, you know, I can't afford to really buy all the good healthy foods. I kind of have to buy the cheaper stuff, which is fine. I don't mind the frugal living. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But what does bother him is how unprepared he feels financially. HAMANN: If the housing situation changes, I don't know what I would do. And I'm currently not able to save. It's not building up fast enough. And if there was an emergency, I feel that me and my children would really have nowhere to go or not have the support structures. I don't know. I know it's just so much. It's so much costs, so much to live nowadays. And I don't see that cost of living decreasing at all. As a matter of fact, I feel that it's increasing very quickly. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hamann feels he should be more comfortable. He has a professional job that he likes, but he feels like he's getting squeezed out. HAMANN: I don't know. Maybe this new economy caters to the people who make $100,000 or more a year, and maybe people like me who are in this middle class are just part of a dying race in America. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We wanted to learn why so many Americans are experiencing this economic anxiety, so we reached out to Bill Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University. He also served as chief economist at the U. S. Department of Labor from 2000 to 2001. Bill, thank you so much for joining us. BILL RODGERS: Thanks for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, let's break it down then. What kind of workers are doing well right now? RODGERS: So if you are a physician, if you are a, you know, doctor or dentist, if you look at people who are pilots, judges, engineers, these make up the top, sort of, 20 highest-paying jobs or occupations in our economy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So those are people that are in demand. So who are the people that aren't doing so well? RODGERS: You know, many young millennials are challenged, you know, coming out of college who have the college debt is hanging over them. You also have people who are working in retail, hospitality. You know, these are individuals whose wages are either at the minimum wage or either they're tied to the minimum wage. And we haven't had a minimum wage increase since the, I guess, late-1990s now. More states and municipalities have been undertaking increases. But still, even evidenced by Friday's jobs report for June, you know, we're over 90 months into this recovery or expansion, and we're still not seeing wage gains for the typical American that are staying ahead of inflation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what are some of the foundational challenges you see in the economy? RODGERS: One, during this Great Recession and the weak recovery and now this longer expansion, about 4. 7 million Americans are working part-time, but they want to work full-time. We also have another 1. 4 million Americans who are - we call them want-a-jobs. They've stopped searching because they're discouraged about the job prospects. But if offered a job, they would take it. And what would happen is, if you include them into your unemployment calculation that the Department of Labor puts together, instead of a 3 point or 4 percent unemployment rate, we have a 7. 8 percent unemployment rate. So that is that this recovery - you know, yes, we are - we've created 3. 4 million jobs since Trump was elected, two million jobs have been created, I believe, over the last 12 months, but it hasn't been large enough to get employers or induce employers to shift people from part-time to full-time. It hasn't been enough to put pressure on wages. It hasn't been large enough to provide families with the ability to pay for their housing, to pay for their food, to pay for their health care, you know, and other expenditures that they have. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we also see that companies are less willing to give actual salaried employees benefits. Even people with full-time work don't seem to get the benefits that they used to. RODGERS: That's correct. And it also - and that really bleeds into the growth of contingent work. These could be people who are freelancers. These could be your Uber or Lyft driver. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The gig economy. RODGERS: The gig economy or the independent contractors. Now, some people respond and say, well, you know that I like the flexibility of those hours. For many of them, that's not their primary source of income, you know, because of they can't get full-time work in their chosen job or their wages are stagnating - that they're doing the hustle. They're doing the double-hustle, the triple-hustle to be able to try to make ends meet. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Where does income inequality fit into this picture? Because as you touched on there, there are the haves and the have-nots. There are people that are doing well in this economy, and there are people that are doing less well. RODGERS: Well, that's the whole underlying story, that, you know, we have divulged into what I call the a-la-carte society. And what I mean by a la carte is that if you're a CEO or if you're a physician, you have the income to be able to withstand that natural disaster because you'll have savings. You have the ability to send your kids to the best private school or the best public school. And you have the ability to also make sure that, you know, you're - you have health insurance for your family while this other reality for many Americans is, because they're not getting full-time work, their wages are stagnating, right? They're building up debt. GARCIA-NAVARRO: They can't live in the right neighborhoods to send their kids to good schools. RODGERS: Exactly. And that's the a-la-carte piece. Instead of once upon a time the contract in America was a much fuller contract that people could get the menu, and we have just shifted and put much more risk on families, and it's created this bipolar type of economy or these two-realities economy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Bill Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University, thank you so much for coming on the program. RODGERS: Sure. Lulu, thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As we heard there, there are people who may have jobs, but they're struggling to find enough work. On the other hand, employers say they can't find enough workers to fill jobs. So what's going on? Next week on The Call-In, we want to hear from employers looking to hire and job seekers looking for work. Call us and let us know your experience at 202-216-9217. Be sure to include your full name, where you're from and your phone number, and we may use it on the air. That's 202-216-9217. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:  Time now, though, for The Call-In. The U.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: We wanted to learn why so many Americans are experiencing this economic anxiety, so we reached out to Bill Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University. He also served as chief economist at the U. S. Department of Labor from 2000 to 2001. Bill, thank you so much for joining us. BILL RODGERS: Thanks for having me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, let's break it down then. What kind of workers are doing well right now? RODGERS: So if you are a physician, if you are a, you know, doctor or dentist, if you look at people who are pilots, judges, engineers, these make up the top, sort of, 20 highest-paying jobs or occupations in our economy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So those are people that are in demand. So who are the people that aren't doing so well? RODGERS: You know, many young millennials are challenged, you know, coming out of college who have the college debt is hanging over them. You also have people who are working in retail, hospitality. You know, these are individuals whose wages are either at the minimum wage or either they're tied to the minimum wage. And we haven't had a minimum wage increase since the, I guess, late-1990s now. More states and municipalities have been undertaking increases. But still, even evidenced by Friday's jobs report for June, you know, we're over 90 months into this recovery or expansion, and we're still not seeing wage gains for the typical American that are staying ahead of inflation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what are some of the foundational challenges you see in the economy? RODGERS: One, during this Great Recession and the weak recovery and now this longer expansion, about 4. 7 million Americans are working part-time, but they want to work full-time. We also have another 1. 4 million Americans who are - we call them want-a-jobs. They've stopped searching because they're discouraged about the job prospects. But if offered a job, they would take it. And what would happen is, if you include them into your unemployment calculation that the Department of Labor puts together, instead of a 3 point or 4 percent unemployment rate, we have a 7. 8 percent unemployment rate. So that is that this recovery - you know, yes, we are - we've created 3. 4 million jobs since Trump was elected, two million jobs have been created, I believe, over the last 12 months, but it hasn't been large enough to get employers or induce employers to shift people from part-time to full-time. It hasn't been enough to put pressure on wages. It hasn't been large enough to provide families with the ability to pay for their housing, to pay for their food, to pay for their health care, you know, and other expenditures that they have. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we also see that companies are less willing to give actual salaried employees benefits. Even people with full-time work don't seem to get the benefits that they used to. RODGERS: That's correct. And it also - and that really bleeds into the growth of contingent work. These could be people who are freelancers. These could be your Uber or Lyft driver. GARCIA-NAVARRO: The gig economy. RODGERS: The gig economy or the independent contractors. Now, some people respond and say, well, you know that I like the flexibility of those hours. For many of them, that's not their primary source of income, you know, because of they can't get full-time work in their chosen job or their wages are stagnating - that they're doing the hustle. They're doing the double-hustle, the triple-hustle to be able to try to make ends meet. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Where does income inequality fit into this picture? Because as you touched on there, there are the haves and the have-nots. There are people that are doing well in this economy, and there are people that are doing less well. RODGERS: Well, that's the whole underlying story, that, you know, we have divulged into what I call the a-la-carte society. And what I mean by a la carte is that if you're a CEO or if you're a physician, you have the income to be able to withstand that natural disaster because you'll have savings. You have the ability to send your kids to the best private school or the best public school. And you have the ability to also make sure that, you know, you're - you have health insurance for your family while this other reality for many Americans is, because they're not getting full-time work, their wages are stagnating, right? They're building up debt. GARCIA-NAVARRO: They can't live in the right neighborhoods to send their kids to good schools. RODGERS: Exactly. And that's the a-la-carte piece. Instead of once upon a time the contract in America was a much fuller contract that people could get the menu, and we have just shifted and put much more risk on families, and it's created this bipolar type of economy or these two-realities economy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Bill Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University, thank you so much for coming on the program. RODGERS: Sure. Lulu, thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: As we heard there, there are people who may have jobs, but they're struggling to find enough work. On the other hand, employers say they can't find enough workers to fill jobs. So what's going on? Next week on The Call-In, we want to hear from employers looking to hire and job seekers looking for work. Call us and let us know your experience at 202-216-9217. Be sure to include your full name, where you're from and your phone number, and we may use it on the air. That's 202-216-9217.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

It escalated last week when the two economic superpowers imposed tariffs on each other's imports.

DUSTIN DWYER, BYLINE: The Trump administration says the tariffs are about protecting American jobs, and some American jobs have been saved. In Hillsboro, Ore. , a solar plant got a second chance at life earlier this year after tariffs on imported solar panels went into effect. In Clyde, Ohio, the Whirlpool Corporation says it's adding 200 jobs because of tariffs on imported washing machines that started in January. And then there's Clarksville, Tenn. KIM MCMILLAN: If you have ever heard of the Monkees song, that's us - \"Last Train To Clarksville. \"DWYER: That's Clarksville Mayor Kim McMillan. Clarksville was in line to get a washing machine factory from LG, a Korean company. McMillan says she worried the tariffs on washing machines would pummel LG and ruin plans for the factory. But instead, LG is speeding up construction. MCMILLAN: They have been working as hard and fast as they can to get this plant online. DWYER: McMillan says LG may be able to open the factory a year ahead of schedule and bring 600 jobs with it, but the tariffs haven't been good for all U. S. communities. In Owosso, Mich. - population 15,000 - Tom Campbell expects to take a $30,000 hit on his family-owned business because of tariffs. His business - the local, daily newspaper. The price of paper has skyrocketed since the Trump administration launched a 22 percent tariff on imported newsprint from Canada. TOM CAMPBELL: Around about October, November, December, things started going crazy (laughter). And they still are. DWYER: And in Florida, the much larger Tampa Bay Times announced its costs are up about $3 million because of tariffs. And layoffs have already started. But the biggest impacts from tariffs so far this year come from the back-and-forth over aluminum and steel. The Trump administration imposed its tariffs in June. Canada, Mexico and the EU have all responded. Some American companies are getting hit twice, companies like Correct Craft - a Florida-based boat-maker. CEO Bill Yeargin says, one, he's facing higher aluminum prices. Even though Correct Craft buys American-made aluminum, prices are up across the board because of tariffs. And, two, the retaliatory tariffs from Mexico, Canada and the EU target boats. Yeargin says he's already lost orders from dealers in those countries. Before the tariffs, Correct Craft was planning to hire 50 new workers to build more boats. Now that may never happen. BILL YEARGIN: There's a good chance that we won't. And so right off the bat, you know, that's starting to impact our business from the growth potential and opportunities that we have. DWYER: Yeargin says he hopes the Trump administration can settle the trade disputes quickly, but past examples show that won't be easy. Remember Clarksville, destination of the famous Monkees song? Washing machines weren't Mayor Kim McMillan's first go-around on tariffs. Back in 2013, Clarksville was the site of a new $1. 2 billion factory that promised a thousand jobs making polysilicon, a component in solar panels. The factory was fully built, and then. . . MCMILLAN: They were unable to start production because of the global trade issues that we had with China. DWYER: China hit the U. S. that year with a tariff on polysilicon.

In a moment, we'll hear the view from China. But now let's look at opposition coming from the U. S. Senate. It voted overwhelmingly today to challenge President Trump's power to impose tariffs singlehandedly. But the president shows no sign of changing course. On the contrary, he's threatening to escalate the trade battle. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Today's vote in the Senate was nonbinding, but the message was unmistakable. Senators voted 88 to 11 in favor of a measure saying lawmakers should play a bigger role in trade policy and not just leave it up to the president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF FLAKE: Let's be clear. This is a rebuke of the president's abuse of trade authority. HORSLEY: Arizona Republican Jeff Flake is one of the co-sponsors of the measure. It was prompted in particular by the administration's use of an obscure national security statute to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. GOP Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has been warning since the tariffs were first floated back in March that they would drive up costs and prompt retaliation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAT TOOMEY: The harmful effects that we feared have already begun. We've got increased prices on U. S. consumers and a real threat to workers and businesses. I've heard from many Pennsylvania manufacturers that happen to rely for some portion of their products on imported steel, and now their products are no longer competitive. HORSLEY: Senator Lamar Alexander pointed to an Electrolux plant in Tennessee that canceled a planned $250 million expansion because of the tariffs. Even though Electrolux makes appliances using domestic steel, its costs have gone up. Other manufacturers, like BMW and Harley-Davidson, have announced plans to shift production overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs. Manufacturing has been enjoying a renaissance in the U. S. , adding 285,000 jobs over the last year. But Linda Dempsey of the National Association of Manufacturers says Trump's tariffs could jeopardize that. LINDA DEMPSEY: If you start seeing some of those shifts of parts of manufacturing supply chains outside of the United States, we're not going to bring that back. HORSLEY: Despite such criticism, Trump is poised to double, triple or quadruple down on his tariff strategy. He's threatened to use the same national security statute to impose a levy on imported cars. And he's also ordered tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports to punish that country for its handling of U. S. technology secrets. Dean Garfield heads the technology trade group ITI, which has responded to the White House tariffs by saying thanks but no thanks. DEAN GARFIELD: The administration has said that their effort is aimed at helping the tech sector. We appreciate the help, but we hope they stop. HORSLEY: The administration isn't stopping though. Yesterday, officials released a list of another $200 billion in Chinese imports that could be targeted with tariffs in a couple of months - a list that Garfield says includes popular consumer categories such as textiles and electronics. GARFIELD: So the administration has said they intend to take a targeted approach. Once you get to a number that size, it's hard to be surgical. HORSLEY: Garfield, like many of Trump's critics in the business and political worlds, agrees with the administration that China has engaged in unfair trade practices and should be confronted. But they argue tariffs are blunt instruments just as likely to backfire and hurt the country wielding them. Better, they say, to go after China with an international coalition. But with his wide-reaching tariffs on steel, aluminum and now possibly automobiles, Trump has already alienated other countries in Europe, Asia and North America that might otherwise be allies in the trade war.

NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports this is part of a bigger concern among regulators that such practices limit workers' ability to improve their wages. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Franchise restaurants are plentiful - more than a quarter of a million in the U. S. by one estimate. Anyone operating one must first sign an agreement with a big brand like Arby's or Wendy's. That agreement includes lots of terms about how to run the restaurant, including usually a provision to not recruit or hire employees from another franchise.

The U. S. and China are locked in what could become a full-on trade war. And China's economy is better positioned than it once was to survive. NPR's Jim Zarroli has the story. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: President Trump holds a view of China that a lot of Americans have. He says, for too long, it's been able to flood U. S. markets with cheap imports. And as a result, it's amassed lots of money, which has helped turn it into an economic superpower. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China made - anywhere, depending on the way you count - from $375 billion, we built China. ZARROLI: It's true that China has sold a lot of products to the U. S. over the years, and it still does. The U. S. remains China's most important single market, buying $500 billion in goods last year. David Dollar, who worked on trade negotiations with China in the Obama Treasury Department, says losing access to that market would take a bite out of China's economy. DAVID DOLLAR: For any economy to go down by 2 or 3 percentage points, that's a serious issue. ZARROLI: And the impact would be especially serious right now because China's economy is already slowing. At the same time, Dollar says, the pain wouldn't be as bad as it once might have been. DOLLAR: The U. S. market is very important to China, but it's less important than it was 10 years ago. ZARROLI: For one thing, the Chinese economy has become a lot bigger and more diversified than it once was and less dependent on trade. And China now has leverage of its own against the U. S. Companies such as Apple and Boeing make big money in China. And Boston College political science professor Robert Ross says the Chinese bureaucracy can make life difficult for them if it wants. ROBERT ROSS: All these various industries can develop problems in China. There can be health hazards at a McDonald's. Starbucks could all of a sudden come under investigation for profit issues and tax issues. ZARROLI: China can even discourage its consumers from buying American products. Whether it would go that far is still an open question. But Ross says, if worse comes to worst, China may be better able to survive a trade war than the U. S. ROSS: The question less is whether we can do harm to them than which one can endure the pain the better? And there are some reasons to believe that, over the short term, the Chinese are better positioned to manage this. ZARROLI: It can do that partly because of its top-down economy. If its growth suffers, Beijing can take steps like cutting taxes or stimulating spending without having to run it by Congress. No one has to worry about midterms. Economist Linda Lim at the University of Michigan says many of China's most important companies are government subsidized, and they don't have shareholders breathing down their necks. LINDA LIM: If you don't have to make money, that's a huge competitive advantage. So they can absorb the costs. ZARROLI: Lim points out that China has been gradually trying to become a more independent economy, to strengthen its tech and defense industries. Ironically, she says, a trade war would accelerate the process, even if China has to suffer through some pain to get there. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. NOEL KING, HOST:   Beijing says it will retaliate if President Trump goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on more Chinese products. The U. S. and China are locked in what could become a full-on trade war. And China's economy is better positioned than it once was to survive. NPR's Jim Zarroli has the story. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: President Trump holds a view of China that a lot of Americans have. He says, for too long, it's been able to flood U. S. markets with cheap imports. And as a result, it's amassed lots of money, which has helped turn it into an economic superpower. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China made - anywhere, depending on the way you count - from $375 billion, we built China. ZARROLI: It's true that China has sold a lot of products to the U. S. over the years, and it still does. The U. S. remains China's most important single market, buying $500 billion in goods last year. David Dollar, who worked on trade negotiations with China in the Obama Treasury Department, says losing access to that market would take a bite out of China's economy. DAVID DOLLAR: For any economy to go down by 2 or 3 percentage points, that's a serious issue. ZARROLI: And the impact would be especially serious right now because China's economy is already slowing. At the same time, Dollar says, the pain wouldn't be as bad as it once might have been. DOLLAR: The U. S. market is very important to China, but it's less important than it was 10 years ago. ZARROLI: For one thing, the Chinese economy has become a lot bigger and more diversified than it once was and less dependent on trade. And China now has leverage of its own against the U. S. Companies such as Apple and Boeing make big money in China. And Boston College political science professor Robert Ross says the Chinese bureaucracy can make life difficult for them if it wants. ROBERT ROSS: All these various industries can develop problems in China. There can be health hazards at a McDonald's. Starbucks could all of a sudden come under investigation for profit issues and tax issues. ZARROLI: China can even discourage its consumers from buying American products.

Last week we heard from you about how the economy is faring in your community. While unemployment has hit record lows, there's another number that also gets a lot of attention - underemployment. Around 33 percent of college graduates are underemployed. That measures the number of workers placed in jobs that are below their qualifications from a bachelor's and beyond. But as we heard from you, it has a different effect depending on your field of work. Julia Fallon of Jacksonville, Fla. , is about to graduate from her paralegal certification program in a few weeks. She received her bachelor's in American Sign Language interpretation, but she couldn't find stable work. She says her biggest frustration now is not the lack of jobs for paralegals, but the pay. JULIA FALLON: I've been astonished at the low-balling that is going on even for attorneys, let alone paralegals, which at the beginning of the program I was told would be much better paying than what I'm actually looking at. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Josh Borchard of Minneapolis, Minn. , graduated with his master's in space studies and planetary sciences. After years of working odd jobs and barely making ends meet, he decided to go back to get his teaching license. JOSH BORCHARD: I worked three years off and on doing odd jobs - research jobs all the way to working retail. And I'm almost 30 years old now, and I have never made more than about $25,000 a year. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Josh's investment in getting retrained paid off though. He recently got a job offer at a high school teaching science. People are having trouble finding jobs in their chosen field. But some employers complain that they're having trouble filling jobs. To help us understand that disconnect, we're joined now by Dawn Fay. She used to be a recruiter. She's now a hiring manager and district president of a recruiting agency, Robert Half. And Scott Dobroski is an employer trends analyst at Glassdoor. Welcome to the program both of you. DAWN FAY: Thank you for having us. SCOTT DOBROSKI: Thank you for having us. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Scott, I want to start with you. What are employers saying about the labor market right now? Is this a good time to be applying for jobs? DOBROSKI: The overall message is, it's very much a job-seeker's market. But what we are seeing in data trends as well is hearing anecdotally from employers - they are still having a tough time finding quality candidates who can tackle tomorrow's business challenges in their respective kind of pool or lane - what they do best. So they're looking for some skills - such as data analytical skills, critical thinking skills - that some candidates may or may not have. And so that's the difference between a good candidate and really a quality candidate. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dawn, what are you hearing from hiring managers? FAY: Well, as Scott had mentioned, there are certainly a lot of jobs open in the market. And whenever there is an increased demand due to growth, sometimes companies - they know they need the extra help but they're not sure exactly what they need. And at those times it seems that they're finding a harder time matching the candidate with the job. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why that disconnect? FAY: You know, sometimes people are looking for skill sets that are really so vast that they sometimes cover more than one area. And what companies need to do is get a little bit more focus, a little bit more granular on the skills they need - not absolutely everything A through Z because a lot of times people do not have that, but they've got enough of those skills where they can come in, add value to an organization and really help them grow, and then get more skills within the company as they go and be a really valued candidate for that company. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So Scott and Dawn, what I'm hearing from both of you is that it's the companies that are asking maybe too much of the people that they're looking for rather than there not being qualified people. And that's because we're in this age of disruption - right? - where people really don't know what the next phase of their business may be. DOBROSKI: I think that's definitely part of it. I think what's going on also with a lot of jobs - especially since the Great Recession - many employers are still building back out. And what they're doing is being - trying to be, actually - much smarter about the jobs that they offer and the people they find. And so pinpointing that right person is tougher, but at the same time they could be asking for too much. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Scott, what role does education have? Are universities and colleges doing enough to help job seekers prepare for this economy in your opinion? DOBROSKI: We definitely think there is still a large disconnect between what academic universities have to offer to prepare students for the real world. So, for instance, data science is one of the best examples to look at. The data science world is an industry, a world, that almost every single employer needs and wants now. Everyone has an online presence. Everyone is trying to get to more users or customers. And so the data scientist is someone who studies all of this and using data makes really smart business recommendations. However, it's really interesting that, up until a few years ago, data science wasn't even a major or something that people could learn about, study about and learn that code in college. So over the past few years we've seen a small handful of universities starting to introduce an actual data science program, but it's actually somewhat baffling that this is such a fast-growing skillset yet it didn't exist up until recently. GARCIA-NAVARRO: People who might be looking for jobs now or in the future, people just leaving college would love to hear what's your best advice to someone entering the job market - either people that are new to job searching or people who are trying to transition to something else? FAY: Well, I think the most important thing people can do whenever they're looking for a role is to really use their network. It's so important to talk to people within the industry that you have interest in, within those jobs and skill sets that you have interest in, get their advice. Find out how they got there. Find out what types of things that you can be doing as an individual to get some more skills and to get better educated in that area, and let people know you're eager to get in to that space because they can help you - potentially be a referral and refer you into an organization and help you get that first step in. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So it sounds like there are plenty of opportunities in this labor market, but there is also an affordability crisis. Many of the people who called in talked about the fact that they couldn't afford to take entry-level jobs even though they're qualified. DOBROSKI: I completely agree. It's also knowing about - before you say yes to a job or an employer, make sure to ask about career opportunities and upward mobility. Are there advancement opportunities at that organization? And it's also about having a career progression plan. You may have to take a parallel step. Sometimes you may have to do a job - it's not exactly what you want to do, but you do that, gain some added experience, and then you know in one to two years, it could hopefully catapult you to something else. So, again, research, research, research the job opportunity or the employer. It's too easy to know this day and age, and then, you know, take the right job for you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Scott Dobroski is an employer trends analyst at Glassdoor. Dawn Fay is district president of the recruiting agency Robert Half. Thank you both so very much. FAY: Thank you.

It's called the yield curve. But some experts now think it may not be the predictor it once was. Cardiff Garcia is the co-host of NPR's daily economics podcast The Indicator, and he's here to explain. Hey, Cardiff. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hey, Noel. KING: All right. So first off, right off the bat, what is the yield curve? GARCIA: Starting with the basics, the yield curve shows the different interest rates paid by each of the different kinds of U. S. government debt or just treasuries, as they're normally called. So there is a three-month treasury, a two-year treasury, a 10-year treasury and so on. And they each pay a different interest rate. And when the economy is expected to do well, when times are good, the interest rates on those longer-term treasuries, like the 10-year, are higher than the interest rates on the shorter-term treasuries, like the two-year. And so we say that, typically, the yield curve is sloping up. KING: OK. So sloping up is a good thing. What does the yield curve look like right now today? GARCIA: Well, it is flattening. And that's what happens when people start to worry a little bit about what the economy's going to do. And flattening yield curve - what that means is that the difference between those short-term interest rates and those higher longer-term interest rates has started to shrink. And, sometimes, the yield curve even inverts and starts to slope down. And every single time the yield curve has inverted since 1970, the U. S. economy has fallen into a recession within about a year. KING: Wow. GARCIA: That's why right now, so many people are paying attention to the yield curve because it is flattening, and it looks like it might invert. And this extends even to policymakers on the Federal Reserve, who are right now actively discussing amongst themselves whether they should pay attention to the yield curve and whether they might even consider altering the trajectory of their policies based on what it looks like right now. KING: OK. So there's a lot of dense information there. But I've been reading that not all economists think that the yield curve is as good a predictor of coming troubles as it once was. Why is that? GARCIA: Yeah. So the thinking is that it's possible that because the Federal Reserve itself is now such a huge buyer of treasuries as part of its attempts to stimulate the economy in the time since the recession of 2008 and 2009 that the yield curve itself is now distorted. And so the signals that it sends are no longer as useful as it used to be. That, again, is the thinking. There's no clear answer on it. KING: So it may not be the best predictor. Let me ask you. Is there a good predictor of whether or not we're headed into a recession? Is there a better predictor of whether or not we're headed into a recession? GARCIA: Nothing with nearly as good a track record as the yield curve, at least not that economists have, like, widely identified. And that, I think, is one reason to continue paying attention, even if it does prove to be the case that the yield curve is different this time. Nothing else has been as reliable. And, Noel, the other thing to keep in mind is that we've had these conversations about the yield curve before. . . KING: Yeah. GARCIA: . . . In the past. When it has inverted, economists and the Fed have debated whether or not it was still as good a predictor. And it ended up proving to still be every bit the predictor that it had been in prior decades. And so I think it would be a bit of a mistake to suddenly turn away from it now. KING: All right. So everyone keep your eyes on the yield curve. GARCIA: You bet. KING: Cardiff Garcia is co-host of NPR's daily economics podcast The Indicator. Cardiff, thank you so much. KING: Thanks, Noel.

The announcement came from Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. NPR's Brian Naylor joins us in the studio now. Hey there, Brian. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: What reason did the administration give for doing this? NAYLOR: Well, farmers, especially hog farmers and soybean growers in red states, have felt the brunt of the retaliatory tariffs placed on agriculture by China and other nations which the Trump administration has penalized with tariffs on their exports. China, the EU, Canada, Mexico - they've all been hit by U. S. levies on some of the products they send to the U. S. , including steel and aluminum. And so they've retaliated, placing their own tariffs on U. S. agricultural exports and targeting farm states that have supported the president and Republican lawmakers in general. So Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said today that the aid would show that the president has the farmers' backs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SONNY PERDUE: The programs we're announcing today are a firm statement that other nations cannot bully our agricultural producers to force the United States to cave in. CORNISH: At the same time, the president was tweeting just this morning that tariffs are great, right? We heard. . . NAYLOR: Yeah. CORNISH: . . . Him in a speech talking about how this is going to really make a difference and open up markets. So what is the message being sent now by the action of providing emergency aid? NAYLOR: Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, he seems to be saying, yeah, they're great, but they're going to cause some parts of the American economy to suffer at least for now. Here's how he put it today in Kansas City, where he was addressing the VFW Convention. He said the tariffs are bringing countries to the table. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Making tremendous progress - they're all coming. They don't want to have those tariffs put on them. They're all coming to see us. And the farmers will be the biggest beneficiary. (CHEERING)TRUMP: Watch. We're opening up markets. You watch what's going to happen. Just be a little patient. NAYLOR: So just be a little patient seems to be the message. There will be some short-term pain but long-term gain. CORNISH: Questions about the money - how will it be spent? We're talking 12 billion. Where did it come from (laughter)? NAYLOR: Yeah. CORNISH: And is Congress involved? NAYLOR: Well, so the administration says, no, we don't need congressional approval because they're going to use a Depression-era program called the Commodity Credit Corporation to draw the funds from the Treasury. And as USDA officials explain, there will be three forms of aid - direct payments to some farmers, including soybean and dairy and hog producers. Some of it will be used to buy surplus crops from other farmers - fruits and nuts and some meats. And that will be given to food banks. Some of our listeners might remember the government cheese program back in the '70s. Audie, I know you don't. CORNISH: Right (laughter). NAYLOR: But it's that same program. And some of the money will also be used to develop new markets for export. CORNISH: I can't imagine lawmakers don't have something to say about it, though. NAYLOR: Yeah, so Congress doesn't have to approve it, which is probably a good thing because the response so far hasn't been very positive. The farmers are hurting because of the Trump trade policies on one hand. And on the other hand, they don't want the government bailing them out. Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who's often been a critic of the president, said the administration's trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers, and the White House's plan is to spend $12 billion on gold crutches. Others are saying, hey, what about my state? You know, why are you singling out farmers? Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski says the tariffs are hurting her state's seafood industry and wonders where you draw the line. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters it's becoming more and more like a Soviet type of economy here. So whether the grumbling goes any further remains to be seen. CORNISH: That's NPR's Brian Naylor. Brian, thank you. NAYLOR: Thanks Audie. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The White House is coming to the aid of farmers hurt by its own hard-line trade policies.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all American and European citizens. This is why we agreed today, first of all, to work toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. Thank you. CHANG: Yes, you heard that right - zero tariffs. This is not the first time the U. S. has pursued removing tariffs between the two economies. And joining us now to talk about the goal and the challenges of getting to zero tariffs is Simon Johnson. He's a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and he is now at MIT. Welcome. SIMON JOHNSON: Nice to be here. CHANG: So Republicans and Democrats have long been in favor of reducing tariffs between the U. S. and European Union. Can you just first explain; why are there still tariffs between them? JOHNSON: Well, you have to remember we're living in a trading system that was created a long time ago. There were tariffs a hundred years ago. They were brought down after World War II. It's been a long, difficult process. Republicans and Democrats don't agree on very much, and not all of them are on board with lowering tariffs. But over a 50-year period, administrations from both parties have pushed for lower tariffs and lower tariff barriers with many countries, including with Europe. CHANG: And just to make it clear, the tariffs right now between the U. S. and the EU are quite low. JOHNSON: That's right. That's right. It's been one of the great success stories of the postwar trading era, although obviously there are still some barriers, including these non-tariff barriers like rules and regulations about what kind of food you can sell in different markets. CHANG: OK. Is getting to an absolutely zero-tariff reality or a nearly zero-tariff reality between the U. S. and the EU actually possible? JOHNSON: Yes, you could do that. The EU itself is a trading arrangement. Obviously it's a political union of sorts now. But the basis of it was a customs union lowering tariff - tariffs, lowering our barriers. There are zero tariffs, zero restrictions on trade within the European Union. So could we be become more integrated with Europe - yes. Those - they're rich countries. They're highly productive. They produce similar things to what we produce. We sell them cars. They buy our cars. We buy their cars. It could be - work just fine with zero tariffs. CHANG: But what about the political realities? I mean, what about the U. S. steel industry, farmworkers, all these constituencies that President Trump says he wants to protect? He has to signal that he's trying to protect them. How do you negotiate around those political realities even though economically it could work in theory? JOHNSON: Oh, that's why it's taken 60 years to get to this point. Look; agriculture's a different matter. And Mr. Trump definitely didn't say yesterday he was lowering tariffs and restrictions on agricultural trade to zero. So be very clear about that. And the Europeans don't want that either. So agriculture is in a different. . . CHANG: OK. JOHNSON: . . . Is in a different category. The, you know, various unions and various other people are concerned about imports, but they're mostly concerned about imports from low-wage countries such as China. So that's a whole different. . . CHANG: Right. JOHNSON: . . . Conversation. Europe is high wage, high productivity. They sell us similar goods to what we sell to them. And that's a very different basis for trade. A lot of companies are highly integrated across the U. S. and the European Union, including the U. K. at the moment. So that is a very different kind of a category for trade. CHANG: As we've said, this is not the first time an administration has talked about zero tariffs between the U. S. and the EU. The Obama administration tried to work out a partnership with the EU to remove almost all tariffs as well. Is what President Trump suggesting now all that different from what the Obama administration was trying to do with the EU? JOHNSON: No. It's actually exactly the same I think. And it was a curious omission, perhaps, but not - fairly obvious why they would omit the fact that what - the announcement yesterday was very much building on and will build on what the Trump - what the Obama administration started in 2013. It became known as the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership or T-TIP. CHANG: T-TIP. JOHNSON: Right. And the goals of T-TIP were exactly the goals stated yesterday by Mr. Trump and by Mr. Juncker, the president of the European Commission. CHANG: All right, that's Simon Johnson of MIT's Sloan School of Management. Thank you very much. JOHNSON: Thank you.

It's going to give us an early read on how big of an impact the president's tax cuts are having, for example. This year, though, forecasts for the number are all over the board. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In the summer of 2008, economists at the New York Federal Reserve Bank saw something disturbing. The statistical model they used to predict where the economy was headed, called the Nowcast, was giving off warning signs. Fed economist Andrea Tambalotti. ANDREA TAMBALOTTI: All the data turned negative quite quickly and quite abruptly and the Nowcast picked that up. And when you see the Nowcast sort of plunging, then you know that something is wrong. ZARROLI: What was happening, of course, was the Great Recession, and the Nowcast gave Fed officials a little extra time to prepare for it. The Nowcast was once only released internally, but a couple of years ago, Fed officials began publishing it online. TAMBALOTTI: We think that it's helpful for the public at large to see these numbers and understand what we do. ZARROLI: As of this week, the Nowcast is predicting that the U. S. economy grew by a middling 2. 7 percent during the second quarter. And then there's the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow. Like the others, it's compiled by crunching a lot of economic data, says Fed economist Pat Higgins. PAT HIGGINS: So it'll be things like retail sales, international trade, manufacturing shipments. ZARROLI: And right now, the Atlanta Fed's number is strikingly different than the New York Fed's. It's forecasting a blockbuster GDP of 4 1/2 percent. If you like President Trump's policies, that's the estimate you quote right now. Donald Trump Jr. bragged about the Atlanta Fed numbers on social media, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently trumpeted the Atlanta number on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF CNBC BROADCAST)STEVEN MNUCHIN: We're expecting a big second quarter GDP number. ZARROLI: These aren't the only growth estimates being published. Major banks and private firms put out their own numbers. Obviously, all of these numbers can't be accurate, but Andrea Tambalotti says these estimates shouldn't be looked at as competing. Instead, he says, they complement each other. TAMBALOTTI: We together can have a better sense of, you know, again, is the economy doing well or is the economy not doing so well? Which is what everybody in the end is really interested in. ZARROLI: Tambalotti says the economy is enormous and ultimately unmeasurable. He says all of these forecasts should be seen as an imperfect baseline. Even the official GDP number released by the Commerce Department is intelligent speculation, and it will be updated as new data comes in, says Pat Higgins. HIGGINS: The initial numbers are based kind of on incomplete data, so, you know, a year or two from now, you know, the actual estimate could change a lot. ZARROLI: In fact, the government can come back after a few years and revise the numbers. There have been times when the U. S. economy was actually in recession and no one knew for sure until much later. Still, the GDP report that comes out this Friday is the number that generates headlines and moves markets. Tambalotti calls it the custodian of the true number. And in a sense, that's the only number that matters. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

His goal has been to double the growth rate of recent years to about 4 percent sustained annual growth. Now, it happened, and it was announced today, and he's taking credit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am thrilled to announce that in the second quarter of this year, the United States economy grew at the amazing rate of 4. 1 percent. CORNISH: We're joined now by NPR's Chris Arnold. He's been following all of this. Hey there, Chris. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: The president was happy. How big a deal is this for everyone else, for the economy? ARNOLD: Well, 4 percent growth is a potentially very big deal. And we should start by saying, look; the economy is growing at a very healthy pace. It's growing faster than it has in the past few years. Part of this has to do with the tax cut, that people have a little more money in their wallets. They're spending that. Business investments played a role, too. And, you know, if that 4 percent rate could be sustained - and this 2-something percent growth rate up to 4 percent doesn't sound like much, but, I mean, that would just be huge for the standard of living for most Americans - higher wages - very big deal. But we should also note that even the president himself who is congratulating himself on all of - on this one good quarterly number seemed to back away a bit from his earlier claims of long periods of 4 percent growth. And most economists still think that that's highly unlikely. We talked to Ian Shepherdson. He's chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. IAN SHEPHERDSON: Well, 4. 1 percent is not sustainable. It's as simple as that - no chance. The idea that we could run at 4 having been trending more like 2 1/4, 2 1/2 is just nonsensical. CORNISH: Now, Chris, if that's so, what's driving this big 4 percent number, and why does Shepherdson think that it won't continue? ARNOLD: Well, the reason it won't continue has also to do with what's driving it now. And so, OK, the tax cut - that's giving a boost now. But, you know, the tax cut gives a boost early. People got a big boost, a pay raise, if you will. But that's not - they're not going to get another big tax cut next year and the year after that and the year after that. So the impact of that will fade. And another reason has a lot to do with something else that the president brought up today, the trade deficits and exports. Let's hear what he had to say about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Perhaps one of the biggest wins in the report - and it is indeed a big one - is that the trade deficit, very dear to my heart because we've been ripped off by the world, has dropped by more than $50 billion. ARNOLD: Now, it's true. That's an increase in exports. That sounds good. It boosted the economy. But the president left a lot unsaid there. CORNISH: So explain what's happening with that. ARNOLD: OK, so obviously we're in a trade war. And that in this perverse way boosted growth in just this one quarter because China was getting ready for these soybean tariffs that were coming into play. And so ahead of those tariffs, China bought massive amounts of soybeans from the U. S. , I mean, so many that it actually changed our overall economic output numbers. But now that the tariffs are in place, that's going to reverse. There won't be all these soybean purchases. Ian Shepherdson who we just heard from says half of that change in the trade deficit was due to this sort of quirk of soybean buying. And now that the tariffs have kicked in, all this is going to be a drag on growth going forward. CORNISH: Given all that, what are you hearing from economists about growth going forward? ARNOLD: One we talked to is John Silvia. He's the chief economist of Wells Fargo. Here's what he had to say. JOHN SILVIA: Well, I think if we can get the trade issues resolved without a lot of hoopla and problems - but, you know, again, that's a big assumption. But if we can get the trade assumptions straightened out, oh, you get - 2 1/2 to 3 percent growth is probably a pretty good number. ARNOLD: Pretty good number, not what the president had been promising to deliver. It's worth noting, too, the third quarter GDP, the next round of numbers, comes out just about a week before the midterm elections. So expect some very big news and attention around all of this plus whatever's happening with the trade fight. And that's, again, about three months down the road. There'll be a lot of news about this. CORNISH: That's NPR's Chris Arnold. Chris, thanks so much for explaining it. SILVIA: You're welcome. Thanks, Audie. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  President Trump has been pledging that his policies will ramp up economic growth. His goal has been to double the growth rate of recent years to about 4 percent sustained annual growth. Now, it happened, and it was announced today, and he's taking credit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I am thrilled to announce that in the second quarter of this year, the United States economy grew at the amazing rate of 4. 1 percent. CORNISH: We're joined now by NPR's Chris Arnold. He's been following all of this. Hey there, Chris. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: The president was happy. How big a deal is this for everyone else, for the economy? ARNOLD: Well, 4 percent growth is a potentially very big deal. And we should start by saying, look; the economy is growing at a very healthy pace. It's growing faster than it has in the past few years. Part of this has to do with the tax cut, that people have a little more money in their wallets. They're spending that. Business investments played a role, too. And, you know, if that 4 percent rate could be sustained - and this 2-something percent growth rate up to 4 percent doesn't sound like much, but, I mean, that would just be huge for the standard of living for most Americans - higher wages - very big deal. But we should also note that even the president himself who is congratulating himself on all of - on this one good quarterly number seemed to back away a bit from his earlier claims of long periods of 4 percent growth.

But before the hike could take effect, the state legislature passed its own law barring municipalities from setting their own minimum wage. This week, a federal appeals court handed Birmingham's workers a big win. They're the first to score a victory over a state in the fight over minimum wage laws. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: A kind of cat-and-mouse game has been raging between cities and states for the last few years. It goes something like this. Cities or counties with higher costs of living vote to raise their minimum wage above the federal minimum of $7. 25 an hour. Then state legislatures fight back by setting statewide caps. This is known as state pre-emption. So far, 25 states bar local governments from setting a separate minimum wage. When this happened to Birmingham, worker advocates in the city became the first in the country to sue the state. They argued that Alabama's majority white legislature discriminated against the majority black city. This week, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, reversing a judge's earlier decision to dismiss the workers' suit. SCOTT DOUGLAS: The voices of low-wage workers in Birmingham were heard. NOGUCHI: Scott Douglas is executive director of Greater Birmingham Ministries, which sued the state along with the NAACP and a group of fast-food workers. In its decision, a three-judge panel ruled the state's pre-emption law violated equal protection rights. It called the state's actions, quote, \"rushed, reactionary and racially polarized. \"DOUGLAS: Where that comes from is Alabama's history of denying black-controlled counties and cities the right to home rule. NOGUCHI: Home rule meaning local self-governance. This doesn't mean the city's wage hike now takes effect. It just means the Birmingham workers can argue their case in court. But how the courts ultimately rule will have major implications for workers in other cities locked in similar battles with their home states. Laura Huizar is a staff attorney for the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. LAURA HUIZAR: Well, I think the decision opened the courthouse doors in a new way for Birmingham and potentially other cities that are considering this type of action. NOGUCHI: Huizar says state pre-emption is very controversial, and not just because of how it could affect minimum wage. States are also using similar laws to bar cities from other kinds of legislation from gun regulations to antidiscrimination laws to bans on plastic bags. HUIZAR: More and more, local leaders and local communities are realizing that they have to stand up and defend their local rights or all of these state pre-emption bills are going to erode their ability to practice and exercise local democracy. NOGUCHI: The crux of this court battle is political. It's a fight over whose law should prevail. Separately, there is also a debate about the economic impact of raising the minimum wage and who benefits. Those in favor say it puts more money in people's pockets, which benefits both families and businesses. But Michael Strain says it's not that simple. Strain is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He argues a city risks driving employers out into surrounding suburbs by making it more expensive to run their businesses. MICHAEL STRAIN: So you have the kind of classic tradeoff where there are reductions in employment among minimum-wage workers, but minimum-wage workers who get jobs and keep jobs end up bringing in more money. NOGUCHI: Meanwhile, the group of Birmingham fast-food workers who brought the case must wait for the next stage of the legal fight. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

In the second quarter of the year, the U. S. economy grew by 4. 1 percent. Here's what President Trump said in front of the White House this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions. When I came into office, 1. 5 million fewer prime-age Americans were working than eight years before. MARTIN: We are joined now by David Wessel, longtime economic policy reporter. He's also the director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution - frequent guest on our show. Hey, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. MARTIN: How big a deal is this - 4. 1 percent growth? WESSEL: Well, it is definitely good news, and the presidents always get credit, whether they deserve it or not, when the economy does well. And I think the Trump administration does deserve some credit for this in two respects. One is tax cuts do give the economy a boost, so that's a plus. And the other is, in a strange way, all this trade war stuff led the Chinese and others to buy a lot of stuff from the U. S. in the second quarter to avoid tariffs. And so that gave us a little artificial boost. MARTIN: So that's the key, though, right? If people were trying to pre-empt inevitable price hikes that were going to come with these tariffs, so they stocked up on, say, soybeans, that means that these numbers are going to be tough to sustain over time. WESSEL: Correct. That's absolutely right. So there are two things that I think we need to remind the president of. One is this historic turnaround stuff is a bit hard to take. There were four quarters in the Obama presidency where GDP was at 4 percent - 4 1/2 percent or better. So we do have strong quarters from time to time. This was a strong quarter. But the second thing - and you put your finger on it - is, is this sustainable? Most economists say it isn't. They don't expect us to keep up this pace over the next several quarters. We'll see. The president and his administration, of course, are very optimistic, but I think it's hard to do. MARTIN: The president also used his remarks to talk about the trade deficit, and he said it's down by more than $50 billion. Is that true? If so, what are the implications? WESSEL: Well, I haven't actually looked at the hard numbers, but the trade deficit was down in the second quarter, and that's part because we exported a lot of stuff, partly the soybeans and some oil that people were buying to avoid tariffs that Chinese opposing on our goods. I think, like most economists, that the president is way too focused on the trade deficit as sort of the nation's bottom line. It isn't. But I think it's important to not take away from the fact that the economy is doing pretty well. It has - there are lots of causes for that. They're not all the president's doing. But we don't want to pretend that he's not correct to say, hey, this is a good number. MARTIN: So the question really is, can it be repeated? Larry Kudlow - it's worth pointing out - the president's economic adviser, this morning in his remarks saying this number will be repeated till the day is done. I am paraphrasing there. But we will see. WESSEL: We will see. I guess - I'm guessing he's wrong, but we'll see.

MARTIN: NPR business reporter Chris Arnold is also with us right now. Chris, what's to account for the growth? I mean, it is extraordinary. We have to give the president credit here. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Well, therein lies sort of the answer to the question about whether this will be sustained. I mean, certainly, part of this was the tax cut - a lot of people going out there, spending on vacations and cars and all kinds of stuff. The problem with that is that you get a big bump from that when people first get this big bump in their paycheck from the tax cut. And then, that kind of, you know, fades in the future. And there were other stuff - there was other stuff like that, too. We were just talking about, you know, soybean sales. It was a sort of freakish thing that happened with the tariffs where China bought, like, massive amounts of soybeans, and that skewed the numbers. So there was just a lot going on in this report that led to these big numbers, but that all economists that I talked to say, look; no, this is not going to continue at 4 percent, maybe 2 1/2 next quarter.

And I think these numbers came at a good time for him because he's been kind of feeling some of the effects of him instituting these tariffs and that the farmers and other people have kind of been feeling that pain. So to get these numbers, what he's trying to argue is that, look; even though things may have looked a little shaky with the farmers, the GDP is actually growing. And once I get these deals together, oh, we're going to be off to the races. It's going to go much faster. And so he's making the argument that what he's doing right now is working.

And I am joined now by NPR's Chris Arnold, who has been following this this morning. Chris, this is, by all accounts, good news for the Trump administration. This is something that they had been hoping for. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel, yes, it is. And, you know, we can back up a bit and say that President Trump's been promising to launch the economy into this higher gear. He's even predicted twice the growth rate of recent years, up from around 2 percent annual growth to 4 percent. That may not sound like a lot but it would be a very, very, very big deal. And economists have scoffed at this saying, no, no, no, you know, that's impossible. And in a much-anticipated reading just out this morning, the president got the number he was talking about. At least for the second quarter - and we can emphasize that - gross domestic product grew at a strong 4. 1 percent. So that certainly does sound very good. MARTIN: The question is whether or not this is sustainable - right? - because as I have heard others analyze and try to unpack these numbers, some of this is an inflated growth because people were trying to pre-empt the effect that tariffs on certain products, including soybeans, were going to have. So they were essentially stocking up, which then is kind of padding these numbers. ARNOLD: Right. And so, I mean, first, let's say that right now, in this particular snapshot of several months, the economy looks really strong, right? We're - it's growing faster than we've seen in several years. And part of that is what you're talking about. The stars have aligned here in sort of reasonable and some perverse ways. Ian Shepherdson, he's a chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, he was anticipating a big number like this above 4 percent. Here's what he said this morning when I asked him about this. IAN SHEPHERDSON: The main story really is that consumers were really on a tear. We saw 4 percent growth in consumer spending. That's the biggest part of the economy by far. Almost $7 in every $10 spent in the U. S. is by consumers. And the trend there is about 2 1/2 percent. So to grow at 4 probably tells you people were spending the tax cuts that they enjoyed back in January. But that's extremely unlikely to happen again. MARTIN: Interesting. ARNOLD: Yeah. So I think the question you were asking is, how long can this last? And, you know, the president's already out there tweeting this morning, you know, great GDP numbers. And, look; if the president could take economic growth and really bring it up from 2 percent to 4 percent, not just for one quarter but, as he's talked about, for a decade, that would be, you know, huge as he likes to say, you know. So, I mean, this would be a big boost in the standard of living, higher wages, better public services. The government would bring in more taxes. It would just be like a bold, new, golden age. But, I mean, nobody - almost no serious economists think we're actually there yet. This is one set of numbers. And you were talking about - you brought up this thing about tariffs sort of having this provision. So, all right, what's going on there is that - OK, so we're - obviously we have this big trade fight going on. And one sort of weird outcome of that is that soybeans were about to get these huge tariffs slapped on them by China for retaliation. . . MARTIN: Yeah. ARNOLD: . . . Purposes. And so what happened was China went on this huge buying spree and bought, like, massive amounts of soybeans. In fact, so many soybeans were bought by China it moved, like, the entire economic output numbers for the United States. It was huge. So that - now the tariffs are in place. MARTIN: Yeah. ARNOLD: That's obviously not going to happen again. MARTIN: All right. We are going to keep following this throughout the morning. NPR's Chris Arnold, thanks so much. ARNOLD: Absolutely.

It gets even tougher when applicants flunk drug tests. One factory in Indiana is taking a novel approach to deal with both problems. It now offers drug treatment paid for by the company to any applicant who fails drug screening. Those who complete drug treatment are promised a job. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Belden has made electrical cables at its factory in Richmond, Ind. , near the Ohio border for nearly a century. It's the second-largest employer in Wayne County, and its fate closely tracks that of the local community. Many area families' histories intertwine with that of Belden, which is why it's willing to invest so much in drug treatment. Louis Hubble has worked at the company for 35 years. LOUIS HUBBLE: Between all of my family that have worked here - aunts, uncles and things - we've got over 300 years of service here at Belden. NOGUCHI: Are you kidding me? HUBBLE: When I first hired in, you had to be careful if you said anything about someone 'cause you'd be talking about their brother, their sister, their cousin, their aunt or uncle. NOGUCHI: Hubble's sister also once worked at Belden. She died of an opioid addiction at age 44, six years ago, leaving three children behind. HUBBLE: I'm not going to lie. I miss my sister to this day. And I wished - I always look back and say, what more could we have done? NOGUCHI: As families grapple with the growing drug epidemic, so too does Belden. That problem exacerbated an already severe shortage of workers. Last year, the crisis caught the attention of Belden's corporate headquarters. Doug Brenneke is Belden's vice president of research and development. He says the company recently needed to fill 75 positions, a very tall order in this rural area. At the same time, the percentage of applicants failing drug tests skyrocketed. DOUG BRENNEKE: It basically doubled or tripled. NOGUCHI: The factory spans nearly 14 acres. Here, machines extrude and weave wires used to hook up the world's TVs and Internet routers. BRENNEKE: So this is a wire braider. So it's actually weaving copper strands around. NOGUCHI: It takes 450 people to run this operation around the clock. Brenneke says a lack of workers means paying more in overtime pay, and a growing backlog means missed sales targets. This is a common refrain among employers in Indiana and just about everywhere else. Last summer, when I was in Muncie, about an hour's drive northwest of here, every business was recruiting. But employers told me a third of prospective hires failed drug tests, mostly for opioids. So some turn to machines to do the work. Others were giving addicted employees second chances. Every employer spoke of needing to address the problem affecting them all. So it has been for Belden. BRENNEKE: We think part of the solution is offering basically a path out. NOGUCHI: In February, Belden launched a pilot program believed to be the first of its kind. It is promising both paid drug treatment and a job to applicants failing drug tests. The key distinction is this. Belden isn't just paying for its own employees' drug treatment. It's doing so for those who aren't even part of their workforce yet. It's a recognition that Belden needs to invest its support in the broader community's struggles. BRENNEKE: It's not a silver bullet, but it is part of an overall solution, we believe, to the epidemic. NOGUCHI: So far, 17 people have signed on. Therapy lasts between one and four months, depending how severe their problem is. Three already work on the shop floor, and Brenneke he says he hopes that roster will grow. Do you have jobs for all of them? BRENNEKE: Right now we do, yes. NOGUCHI: And at some point if you don't need those people, does the treatment program go away? BRENNEKE: We don't ever see it going away. NOGUCHI: It will remain necessary, he says, because a third of the workforce is close to retirement age. Having this program also enables Belden to keep existing workers, like Shawn Adelsperger (ph). Adelsperger is 48 and grew up in Richmond. In June, he got into a minor forklift accident which prompted a mandatory drug test. He failed. Thin, shy and soft-spoken, Adelsperger says his divorce and his daughter's heroin addiction fed his own growing dependence on alcohol and marijuana. SEAN ADELSPERGER: One of the biggest things in the program so far is just being able to put everything out on the table and talk about it. NOGUCHI: According to addiction experts, patients referred to treatment through work often respond better. Mitch Rosenthal is a New York addiction specialist who helped design Belden's program. He says employers can often catch an addiction at an earlier stage, making it easier to treat. MITCH ROSENTHAL: The fact that people can see themselves succeeding in work as they also succeed in therapy and in self-understanding is powerful. NOGUCHI: One nice aspect of Belden's program, he says, is that workers going through recovery can support one another on the job. ROSENTHAL: And their sobriety and the fact that they have changed and are changing their lives is an encouragement to the people who will come in after them. NOGUCHI: Rosenthal says he hopes other employers will eventually replicate Belden's program. But there are challenges. One of them, says Leah Tate, is gauging cost. Tate is Belden's vice president of human resources. Initially, the company estimated medical treatment would average $5,000 per participant. But then it found some patients needed transportation to treatment because their driver's licenses were suspended. And, Tate says, participants aren't as productive at first because they cannot operate the machines until they've been drug-free for a couple of months. LEAH TATE: There's a lot more costs, a lot more handholding. NOGUCHI: Nevertheless, Tate says Belden remains committed, even to paying for more expensive residential treatment when necessary. In many ways, she says, the company has no choice. TATE: We've been in this community since 1928. We have families of families that have worked in this plant and for this company. So the Richmond community's extremely important to Belden. NOGUCHI: This is exactly what matters to employees like Belden old-timer Louis Hubble. He believes a program like this might have helped his sister. HUBBLE: When she lost her job and then she ended up being on the street, she had no hope. NOGUCHI: If the program helps one or two families avoid the same outcome, he says, it will be worth it. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Richmond, Ind.

But the administration could still slap Asia-based carmakers with tariffs on imported auto parts and vehicles. Companies like Kia, which is based South Korea, could be especially vulnerable. It has factories in the U. S. Johnny Kauffman of member station WABE visited a Kia plant on the Georgia-Alabama border, where people are worried. JOHNNY KAUFFMAN, BYLINE: Steve Tramell stands in the grass along Kia Boulevard, a four-lane highway in West Point, Ga. Tramell is mayor of the town, population 3,700. And these days, he's worried. The largest employer in his town is under pressure thanks to President Trump's threat of tariffs on imported auto parts and vehicles. Tramell looks across the road at a massive gray factory. Kia is written on the side in bold, red letters. STEVE TRAMELL: As far as automobile manufacturing, we think it's a beautiful plant. It's got, you know, the Kia plants here and then Hyundai Mobis and then Hyundai Dymos, which are two of the suppliers, are directly to the left of it. It's a big, big facility. KAUFFMAN: Kia says it's invested $1. 6 billion into the 2,200-acre plant and the surrounding area. Tramell says in 2006, when Kia announced plans to open the plant, it was a big deal. TRAMELL: The excitement in downtown was wild. The signs that were popping up in people's yards - thank Jesus for Kia (laughter) - you know, things like that. It was really neat. KAUFFMAN: Today Kia says its plant in West Point and the nearby suppliers employ 14,000 full-time workers. Those jobs could be at risk from Trump's proposed tariffs. Kia would be hit in at least two ways. First, importing already made vehicles into the U. S. would be more expensive. Two-thirds of the vehicles Kia sells here come from other countries like South Korea and Mexico. And second, the company would pay more to import parts for the vehicles it makes in the U. S. , like at this factory. Kia warns the tariffs would lead to job cuts right here in West Point. Just down the road from the Kia plant, Des Carlisle is headed into a gas station. The 26-year-old is on a break from job hunting. DES CARLISLE: Like, I just recently lost my job working out there - like, recently. KAUFFMAN: Carlisle worked as a temp at the Kia plant. His job was to make sure people who painted the cars had the necessary supplies. Three months ago, Carlisle's contract ended. He worries any slowdown at Kia would hurt his friends and family. CARLISLE: I got a lot of homeboys that work at plenty of these plants. Like, the whole Kia Boulevard, I've got homeboys out there. KAUFFMAN: Carlisle says President Trump doesn't understand how auto tariffs could hurt the community here. Also at the gas station, Carl Michalski is on his way to work at Yanfang Interiors, where he's a production supervisor. The company makes door panels for the Sorento, Kia's midsize SUV. Michalski isn't worried about auto tariffs. CARL MICHALSKI: It might get rough for a minute, but I think it's going to all work itself out in the best. China is going to come to the table and do what they're supposed to do. KAUFFMAN: Michalski says he trusts Trump to handle the international trade dispute. Auto tariffs wouldn't just affect workers but potential car buyers, too, especially for Kia. Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs says Kia depends on sales of less expensive, compact cars. And its customers tend to be younger with less money to spare. MICHELLE KREBS: So if you add on the cost of a tariff, they would lose sales because it would be very difficult for consumers to afford even more. KAUFFMAN: Krebs says car companies like Nissan and Hyundai face a similar scenario. And she says if prices go up and production slows, it could mean job cuts. That's why Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democratic Senator Doug Jones of Alabama filed a bill this week to delay the tariffs. They're among a growing number of politicians worried about an escalating trade war, and that may help explain why the EU managed to negotiate a truce on the tariffs aimed at Europe.

He's even predicted the country will achieve about twice the growth rate of recent years, up around 4 percent sustained annual growth. Now, many economists think we may actually see a blockbuster growth rate like this when we get the latest reading on the gross domestic product, or GDP, later this morning. NPR's Chris Arnold has been following all of this. He joins us now. Hi, Chris. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: All right. So why is this number so important? ARNOLD: Well, a strong number coming right now - if it's up well above 3 percent annual growth, that would show that the economy is stronger than it's been in at least a few years. And there's also been some fanfare around this. The president was out yesterday saying, I'm expecting a big number. His treasury secretary was out a few weeks ago saying this is going to be a big number. So you know, there is some anticipation. And like you said, a lot of economists think that the stars have kind of aligned here over the past few months, and we very well may see a very impressive number. Ian Shepherdson is the chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics. He's anticipating a number up above 4. 5 percent. That would be very big. Here's how he explains it. IAN SHEPHERDSON: What's really happened here is a convergence of favorable factors, which, you know, sometimes happens - in any given quarter, anything can happen. And it just means that all the major components of GDP - so that's consumption, business spending, government spending, foreign trades - all those things together have gone in the right direction. ARNOLD: Of course, the bigger question is, how long can things keep moving in the right direction that quickly? KING: Right. OK. So when you talk to economists, what do they say about that? ARNOLD: That's the big question. Of course, you know, if the U. S. economy really did sort of double in growth from 2 percent to 4 percent, that might sound like a small change. But it's really - it would be huge, as they say. I mean, it would mean living standards for many Americans, higher wages, better public services as the government raked in more taxes. But don't get too excited about this because most economists do not expect that to happen past this quarter, certainly growth not at 4 percent or anything like that. KING: Which is deeply disappointing - why don't they expect more good news? ARNOLD: You know, a bunch of factors are involved in this report that are sort of one-offs. Just one example of this is there's this kind of perverse situation where we're in this trade fight with China. So ahead of tariffs going into effect on soybeans, China bought tons and tons of soybeans, I mean, so many soybeans that it actually moved the scale on our overall economic growth. KING: Wow. ARNOLD: But now that the tariffs are in effect, that's going to reverse, right? And we're going to have a lot fewer, if any, soybeans going to China. So you know, that's going to be a drag instead of a boost - and several other factors like that that just mean that this is probably not going to be repeated. KING: And what about the tax cut that was passed by Republicans? Is that contributing here? ARNOLD: It does look like it's giving a boost to consumer spending. But the biggest impact from that happens, you know, right - or happened right when people started seeing these boosts to their paychecks. So that's already happened. We're not going to be getting a big raise in our pay month after month after month. So you know, we've probably seen the big hit from - the big boost from that in growth. So tax cuts, one-time distortions like the soybeans - one of the economists I talked to said this past quarter was like, quote, \"a sugar high that probably won't last too long. \"KING: (Laughter) NPR's Chris Arnold.

Yesterday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew 4. 1 percent in the second quarter of the year. President Trump called the news amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As the trade deals come in one by one, we're going to go a lot higher than these numbers. MARTIN: We wanted to talk more about those trade deals. This week, President Trump agreed in principle to lower tariffs on the European Union. In exchange, the president of the European Commission promised to buy billions of dollars of soybeans and natural gas from the U. S. And this raises several questions we wanted to try to answer. How does this fit in with how American presidents have conducted economic policy in the past? And we also want to know whether this will actually help or hurt the economy in the long run. To talk about this, we've called Greg Ip. He's chief economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal. He's here in our Washington, D. C. , studios, and he wrote about this this past week. Greg, thanks so much for joining us. GREG IP: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So, first of all, let's just start with the premise of how this president conducts economic policy. The shorthand that a lot of people are using is that he's picking winners and losers. Do you think that's the right terminology, and is this something that American presidents have done in recent history? IP: It's certainly terminology that he wouldn't agree with, but I think it probably does fairly reflect reality. Historically, presidents in the United States were very uncomfortable with the idea that we were going to favor this industry at the expense of that other industry. Now, it's true that if you go back to the 1700s and 1800s, we did used to have a policy of high tariffs, but we really haven't followed that policy since the 1950s. Trump is really taking us in a very different direction here. It's not just that he believes other countries have unfair policies. He believes things like a country like the United States needs a big, strong, robust, steel and aluminum manufacturing industry. It needs to manufacture more cars here even if that means Americans have to pay more for steel and more for cars. That is what's different. And he's using quite a few different levers of the federal government to try and push the economy in that direction. MARTIN: And on top of that, I mean, one of the levers that he's using - he announced a plan to provide $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers who may be hurt by the tariffs that he's imposed because other countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on American products, particularly food. And lawmakers from both parties have criticized this. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said, we're becoming more and more like a Soviet type of economy here. Commissars deciding who's going to be granted waivers. Commissars in the administration figuring out how they're going to sprinkle around benefits. Now those are pretty strong words, but is that accurate? IP: Well. . . MARTIN: Or fair, let me put it that way. IP: We're definitely not back in the old 1980s Soviet-style central planning days. But there's no question that the more the federal government intervenes in the economy whether it's to apply tariffs to these but not to these, bail out these farmers but not these industries, that somebody has got to make the decisions about who gets what. Other countries have been happy to do this. If you look at China, that's more or less how they've been managing their economy for the last 20 or 30 years. But in the United States, we've often prospered by allowing our sort of competitive advantages, which are basically risk taking, and entrepreneurialism, and our really good higher education system to determine what businesses are going to win. MARTIN: What motivates the president's focus on these specific industries? Is there an underlying principle of Trump's economic policy? If so, how would you describe it? IP: There's a mixture of policies here, and that's one reason why I think it's difficult to step back and say there is a single overarching industrial policy here. Part of it, frankly, is nostalgia. He has a vision of the United States when the U. S. steel makers and auto companies stood astride the world and all our cars were made here. That is a world of many years ago. The United States has moved on. We have other industries that we're good at, and some of the less-skilled jobs have moved abroad. He has a view that national security is endangered by not being able to make certain things at home. To a certain extent, he's right. But it's perhaps a little bit more doubtful that, say, treating Canada or Japan and Korea as national security threats is a credible approach to those things. And finally, and here's what's very important, is that there really is a case to be made that China specifically has been pursuing trade practices that are harmful to the United States economy and its national security. They basically don't allow American companies to sell or export to the Chinese market with the same freedom that they export to ours. They force American companies to hand over their best technology. Sometimes they steal that technology, and that takes away the very competitive advantages that make Americans richer over time. And to his credit, Trump has been much more forceful in confronting China about those problems. MARTIN: And as we mentioned, we also learned yesterday that the economy reached a 4. 1 percent growth rate in the second quarter. It's a cliche that presidents take credit for strong economic growth and they don't want to take blame for poor economic growth or the lack thereof. But what about that number? IP: That's a great question, and you're absolutely right. A president who did not take credit for great economic numbers would be guilty of malpractice. That's basically what you in politics. Now, we know that that 4 percent number was partly inflated by the fact that a lot of farmers were shipping out soybeans and other products to try and beat the imposition of tariffs from China - some of that will be unwound. But if you look beneath the surface, the economy is doing really well. It's growing at about a 3 percent annual rate. Trump should be very pleased with that. Now, we were also growing at a 3 percent rate back in 2014 or 2015, and it didn't last. So I think the real question is, when you look below the surface, do you see signs that we are getting out of this low-growth funk? And I would say there's some modestly small positive signs. But once again, it's just too soon to know whether that will last. And I think the more specific issue of whether Trump's trade policies are really behind this - no, not really. The tariffs are relatively new. He's certainly working hard to get a lot of new trade deals. But other than a very modest change to our trade deal with South Korea, there really hasn't been anything there. MARTIN: That's Greg Ip. He is chief economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal. Greg, thank you so much for joining us. IP: Great to be here. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We want to turn now to the economy, which was the focus of a lot of attention this past week.

S. economy is doing well. The Commerce Department reported yesterday gross domestic product grew at a rate of 4. 1 percent in the last quarter. That's faster than expected. And unemployment is low.

SIMON: We're going to talk about this with Kenneth Rogoff. He's an economist who teaches at Harvard. Professor Rogoff, thanks so much for being with us. KENNETH ROGOFF: My pleasure. SIMON: What does that 4. 1 percent growth tell us about the U. S. economy now? ROGOFF: Well, it's doing very well. I mean, I think it's probably not doing that well. It's been goosed up by a number of factors that are probably temporary - for example, people rushing to buy U. S. stuff before the tariff war sets in. But the economy's been doing well for a long time, and it continues to do very well. And the best guess is it will keep going. SIMON: President Trump's tough trade policy is leading to growth? ROGOFF: Absolutely not. I mean, I think President Trump's tough trade policies are the biggest cloud on the horizon at the moment. But they haven't really taken root yet. There's a lot of talk and back and forth. And he has slapped on some tariffs. It is hitting soybean farmers. It is hitting some manufacturers. But the trade war is not good for growth. It's bad. He touts it as a negotiating tactic. He says, well, you know, they'll start buying more of our stuff eventually. But I think right now it's something that everyone's worried about. And if growth slows down in the next few quarters, the trade war will likely be a central part of that. SIMON: Now, let's note. Presidents take credit when economic numbers are good, and they point out that we all blame them when the numbers are bad. Mr. Trump's been in office for a year and a half. Over that time, how has the economy done compared to, let's say, the last year and a half, two years of the Obama term? ROGOFF: Well, pretty similarly. I think it has done well. The numbers have continued to be good. But, let's face it, there was a very good and long recovery from the financial crisis under President Obama. And I think a lot of what we're experiencing today really is still the long, slow recovery from the deep financial crisis we had starting in 2009. And I think it will probably continue for a while. The truth of the matter is presidents don't have much to do with the economy. There are things presidents can do. So we had the tax cuts. We had the reform to the corporate tax law. And that's unquestionably goosing up the economy, now, maybe, adding half a percent to this 4. 1 percent number. But that's temporary. That's not going to last. SIMON: What about the president's recent criticism of the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates? ROGOFF: Well, presidents never like it when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. They like things - interest rates to stay low on the idea that people will borrow more, people will consume more, buy more houses. And it also drives up stock prices, which might lead people to spend more. There's been a recent tradition. It's recent - starting maybe with President Clinton in the 1990s, to sort of stay mum about the Federal Reserve. Bite your lip. Because the trouble is the Federal Reserve is pretty independent. And if you start criticizing them for raising interest rates, maybe they'll raise them more and things will be worse. I do worry about President Trump criticizing the Federal Reserve in that he might do something to undermine it. SIMON: Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard, thanks so much for being with us.

That would turn the ongoing tensions between Washington and Beijing into a full-fledged trade war. To help us explain what is unfolding, we're joined now by NPR's Jim Zarroli. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. CHANG: So how did the White House explain why it's doing this? ZARROLI: Well, the United States has already threatened to impose tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion-worth of Chinese imports. And senior administration officials said today that President Trump has told U. S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer to consider raising the tariffs to 25 percent. This isn't a done deal. There's going to be a comment period, for instance, before this would go through. But clearly there's this effort now to show that the administration isn't going to back down. It's going to step up the pressure and sort of take this as far as they need. . . CHANG: Right. ZARROLI: . . . It needs to. CHANG: So how is China responding so far? ZARROLI: Well, when news of this threat of a tariff increase came out today, Beijing issued a statement - a strong statement saying it wouldn't give in to blackmail and threats. And U. S. officials say this has been China's response all along. They - the administration says it's been in talks with China. Over and over again, it's asked it to address concerns about its unfair trade practices. The U. S. wants China to act more on a free-market basis, stop preventing U. S. companies that want to do business there from entering the market. China hasn't addressed these concerns, the administration says. And, in fact, it's retaliated with tariffs of its own. The administration says they've essentially doubled down on their unfair practices, and there's no sign now that they're going to reverse course. CHANG: So this constant one-upping, I mean, what does this say about the current state of the talks between U. S. - the U. S. and China? ZARROLI: Well, I - it says the countries are - they're playing sort of a big game of chicken. I spoke today to Michael Camunez, who was in the Commerce Department in the Obama administration working on trade issues. And he says he thinks this has the potential to really escalate now. MICHAEL CAMUNEZ: I think it is a very serious situation. I think it would be a very complicated thing to get out of because I don't see an easy remedy once we go down this path. ZARROLI: And Camunez says one of the problems is that the Trump administration still seems to be talking out of both sides of its mouth. You have Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who has been trying to come to some kind of deal with China to resolve these issues. But there are others in the administration, people like Robert Lighthizer, the U. S. trade representative, who - who's often seemed to be on a different page. CAMUNEZ: There are folks in the White House that really think that the best approach to China is a very aggressive one. And that position clearly seems to be prevailing. CHANG: So what does this all ultimately mean for American consumers? How are they going to feel all this? ZARROLI: Well, it's not clear. I mean, one of the interesting things that's happened here is that as these trade tensions have played out really all over the world, we've seen what often happens, which is that people - investors turn to safe havens like U. S. Treasury debt, like the dollar. And the Chinese currency has actually weakened. So on the one hand, you have - and that tends to make the cost of Chinese imports to the United States lower. So on the one hand, you have these tariffs that are supposed to increase the cost of imports. But the Chinese currency is weakening, so the costs are going down. So in general, we can't really tell what the impact is yet. But I think it's safe to say a lot of businesses and a lot - especially a lot of farmers are very nervous about where this is going. CHANG: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli. Thank you, Jim. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

So economists wonder why today's high demand for workers isn't translating into bigger increases in pay. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has called it a puzzle. As NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, there are a couple of factors that could help explain it. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Economist Dean Baker is among those who worry that, despite the strong economy, American workers aren't seeing big enough increases in pay. DEAN BAKER: If wages are stagnating, that means that we're doing all these great technological innovations, but most people really don't see the benefit of that. NOGUCHI: Baker, who is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says worker pay decreased during and after the Great Recession and has yet to make up that lost ground. At a time when employers are struggling to find available workers, wages are increasing at a relatively modest rate of 2. 7 percent a year - not much more than inflation. Many economists say that's lower than it should be. Some point to slow productivity growth, which makes it harder for employers to raise pay. And some argue recent wage growth may not be as bad as it appears. Russ Roberts is a researcher at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He says just looking at wage growth doesn't give you the whole picture. He says a strong job market is creating a lot of new opportunities. Retiring baby boomers, for example, are leaving their positions, creating openings for others. RUSS ROBERTS: So their wages are quite high. They're being replaced by lower-wage workers who are younger and just more likely to be just starting out. NOGUCHI: Which is why, Robert says, he's not alarmed by low wage growth. ROBERTS: I think we should be careful in assuming that something's broken because a tight labor market isn't leading to great wage increases. I would just simply say that the wage increases we observe are probably understating the actual gains to workers in terms of their standard of living. NOGUCHI: Another factor could help explain the wage puzzle. Employers say they're spending more on benefits and rewards outside of pay and that overall compensation is growing faster than wages. Alison Avalos is director of research at WorldatWork, an association that studies compensation. She says companies are offering better health insurance coverage, flexible work arrangements and wellness programs. ALISON AVALOS: What we're seeing is that employees say, you know, what I get out of working is not just a paycheck anymore. NOGUCHI: Avalos could not quantify how much more employers are paying for such benefits but says their budgets reflect these shifting priorities. Bob Wesselkamper agrees. He heads rewards and benefits consulting at Korn Ferry, a recruiting firm. BOB WESSELKAMPER: There's a changing balance of what drives an employee to move to a new organization. And sometimes it's not always pay. NOGUCHI: Wesselkamper says six years ago, his company's survey ranked pay the No. 1 reason workers switched jobs. This year, culture and purpose ranked highest. All of these dynamics have played out at Four Seasons Plumbing in Asheville, N. C. Owner Max Rose says last year, two of his staff of 20 left, worsening his worker shortage. MAX ROSE: It really hurt us. We were desperate. NOGUCHI: Like others in the industry, Rose has had to hike his salaries. But on top of that, his company started offering a 3 percent match on retirement plans and covering all health care costs. It also increased vacation time and eliminated overnight shifts. That's a sea change from a dozen years ago, when Rose started the company. ROSE: Yeah. When we first started, we didn't - (laughter) we didn't do any of this stuff (laughter), especially with retirement and health care. NOGUCHI: Even so, Rose says he still spends a lot of time trying to fill open positions and recruiting apprentices to train. ROSE: The biggest thing we've tried to do is culture-building and trying to portray this idea that there is room for advancement and that we're a growing company. NOGUCHI: He says that's shifted more of his attention from customers to employees. ROSE: Now we have to make sure the employees are happy, and then the customers are happy. And really, I feel that if we focus on keeping our employees happy, then we don't have to worry about our customers. NOGUCHI: Tomorrow, the Labor Department's July employment reports will offer a fresh look at wage increases. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

A new Republican president with a background in the entertainment business was trying to jumpstart the U. S. economy out of a brutal recession. The president pushed tax cuts. Then his administration had to come up with a plan to deal with trade. America's auto industry was suffering as new competition came in from Japan. What the Reagan administration did about it has shaped the auto industry we see today in America. And NPR's Dustin Dwyer reports it could serve as an example for the Trump administration in its ongoing rancorous trade battles. DUSTIN DWYER, BYLINE: The man Reagan put in charge of his trade policy in 1981 was William Brock. Brock says at that time, Congress was looking to take tough action to stop Japanese car imports. Brock went to the Japanese and proposed a different solution. WILLIAM BROCK: The thought was that if Japan would put some quiet, voluntary limits on their shipments, it would help ease the problem till we could walk through a transition period. DWYER: This idea is what's known as a voluntary export restraint. Instead of a tariff, which acts as a tax on imports, the restraint is more like a voluntary quota. The Japanese carmakers agreed they wouldn't send more than a certain amount of cars to the U. S. each year. And the original deal was supposed to last three years. It ended up lasting more than a decade. But the point was it was a negotiated, long-term deal. Companies and customers could expect it wouldn't go away in a flash like a tariff can. With the Japanese restraints in place, the Detroit Three rebounded. In 1984, President Reagan made a trip to a Ford plant in Missouri. And he told workers there some had urged him to take a harsher approach to Japanese imports, to push tariffs instead of voluntary agreements. Reagan wasn't having it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGRONALD REAGAN: I believe if Americans work together to improve quality, become more productive, hold down costs and invest in tomorrow's technology, then we can outcompete, outperform and outsell the pants off anybody. (APPLAUSE)DWYER: A study published in 1999 found that the voluntary restraints boosted profits for the Detroit Three by about $1. 6 billion. And that's mostly because it made Japanese imports more expensive, so there's also a case that it hurt consumers. But the biggest and longest-lasting impact of the policy can still be seen today in places like Georgetown, Ky. , Smyrna, Tenn. , and Marysville, Ohio, places where Toyota, Nissan and Honda all built plants in the 1980s. Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University who has studied the auto industry, says the carmakers might have moved production to the U. S. at some point anyway, but the trade policy made it more urgent. SUSAN HELPER: So I think it jump-started that sooner and maybe made it easier for automakers from other nations to come in as well. DWYER: But Helper says the voluntary restraints weren't perfect because, she says, when the new plants came in, they didn't come with the same protections for workers that had been established at the Big Three. They were and are non-union shops. HELPER: Some of the only non-union automotive plants in the world are in the United States as a result of this policy. DWYER: So one lesson for today's ongoing trade disputes, at least according to Helper, is to make worker protections part of the policy. William Brock disagrees with this take. He says the new automotive jobs in the U. S. were a good thing, and getting involved in wages and benefits isn't what the government should be doing. But another big lesson from the Reagan policy in the 1980s is just how long the impacts can last. The restraints Brock negotiated in 1981 led to investments in the U. S. that are still here and still affecting the economy 37 years later. Dustin Dwyer, NPR News, Grand Rapids, Mich. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AILSA CHANG, HOST:  It was 1981.

The new jobs report is out, and it shows that the U. S. economy added 157,000 jobs in the month of July. That has pushed down the unemployment rate to 3. 9 percent. Joining us to talk more, NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner. Hey, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: Three-point-nine percent. I mean, that's real low. What does it tell us about the overall health of the economy right now? BERLINER: Absolutely. Really low. This is basically what's considered full employment, which means that if you want a job, there's one out there for you. Three-point-nine percent is really a pretty historically low number. It reflects a job market that has continued to be strong, a job market where employers are really eager to hire workers. MARTIN: That's all good news. And, also, wages ticked up a bit, which is significant because we've been talking for a long time about how wages were just stuck. They were just plateauing and not moving upwards. That's changing? BERLINER: Right. The key word there is a bit. They're growing at an annual rate now of 2. 7 percent, which is OK. It's not great. And this has been one of the great puzzles of this recovery. So much hiring. Employers so in need of workers. Why aren't they paying more? MARTIN: Right. BERLINER: Which is really an interesting part of this recovery. Maybe that's starting to change somewhat, but not really at full force. MARTIN: All right. I'm going to switch gears because there is more tariff news this morning. China has announced that it plans to impose more tariffs, retaliatory trade tariffs, if the Trump administration moves ahead with its latest threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. This is an announcement that the administration just made some days ago. President Trump insists that trade wars are easy to win. Is this what winning looks like? BERLINER: I don't know if it's what winning looks like. This is definitely an escalation of tit for tat. China now says it is prepared to impose tariffs on $60 billion of U. S. , of American goods. This only would follow if the Trump administration goes ahead with its threat to impose tariffs of, perhaps, as high as 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. MARTIN: So far, when we think about this trade war - which it is at this point. We can call it that - have we seen an effect on the economy of the tariffs that actually have been implemented? BERLINER: Well, not if you look at this jobs report. I mean, one key sector to look at when tariffs are imposed is manufacturing. But manufacturing hiring was very strong in the last jobs report, 37,000 jobs. That's the highest in some time. So if you were going to see an immediate impact, negative impact from the tariffs, it would be in manufacturing, where higher steel and aluminum costs would start to affect the ability of companies to produce. And those - we haven't seen that yet. MARTIN: Do we know, Uri, if talks are happening right now? I mean, is there anyone from - we think about Robert Lighthizer, U. S. trade rep. Is Lighthizer or any of his representatives, are they in direct communication with someone on the Chinese side on a regular basis about how to put an end to this? BERLINER: We know that there's been a stalemate in talks, that there have been talks previously and they've broken off. Don't really know the status of them now, but we have to assume there's some backchannel communications to see that this doesn't get completely out of hand. MARTIN: NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner. Thanks Uri. BERLINER: You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Got economic news to share this morning. The new jobs report is out, and it shows that the U. S. economy added 157,000 jobs in the month of July. That has pushed down the unemployment rate to 3. 9 percent. Joining us to talk more, NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner. Hey, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: Three-point-nine percent. I mean, that's real low. What does it tell us about the overall health of the economy right now? BERLINER: Absolutely. Really low. This is basically what's considered full employment, which means that if you want a job, there's one out there for you. Three-point-nine percent is really a pretty historically low number. It reflects a job market that has continued to be strong, a job market where employers are really eager to hire workers. MARTIN: That's all good news. And, also, wages ticked up a bit, which is significant because we've been talking for a long time about how wages were just stuck. They were just plateauing and not moving upwards. That's changing? BERLINER: Right. The key word there is a bit. They're growing at an annual rate now of 2. 7 percent, which is OK. It's not great. And this has been one of the great puzzles of this recovery. So much hiring. Employers so in need of workers. Why aren't they paying more? MARTIN: Right. BERLINER: Which is really an interesting part of this recovery. Maybe that's starting to change somewhat, but not really at full force. MARTIN: All right. I'm going to switch gears because there is more tariff news this morning. China has announced that it plans to impose more tariffs, retaliatory trade tariffs, if the Trump administration moves ahead with its latest threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. This is an announcement that the administration just made some days ago. President Trump insists that trade wars are easy to win. Is this what winning looks like? BERLINER: I don't know if it's what winning looks like. This is definitely an escalation of tit for tat. China now says it is prepared to impose tariffs on $60 billion of U. S. , of American goods. This only would follow if the Trump administration goes ahead with its threat to impose tariffs of, perhaps, as high as 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

This morning, the Labor Department reported another month of strong job growth. Employers added 157,000 jobs in July, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 3. 9 percent. And of course, we had news last week that the U. S. economy grew in the second quarter at the fastest pace in nearly four years. But all this positive economic news is not helping the government's finances. The deficit is expected to top a trillion dollars next year. NPR's Scott Horsley has the story. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: On a muggy morning earlier this week, a group of bankers and investment managers met at the Hay-Adams Hotel here in Washington. They got an update from the Treasury Department about government cash flows. And according to minutes of the meeting, the picture was not pretty. Corporate tax receipts are down for the year while government spending is up. The Treasury expects to borrow more than $750 billion to pay its bills in the last six months of the year. STAN COLLENDER: The federal budget deficit is ballooning, skyrocketing, soaring - whichever way you want to describe it. HORSLEY: Stan Collender writes \"The Budget Guy\" blog about federal finances. COLLENDER: You've got a kind of perfect storm here. You've got more spending. You've got less revenue. And the deficit is just getting bigger and bigger, to the point where it will be at least a trillion dollars every year during the Trump administration and beyond. HORSLEY: Even the White House's own rosy forecast acknowledges the deficit will exceed 5 percent of the overall economy next year, a level it's previously reached only after deep recessions, when unemployment topped 10 percent. Today, the economy is near full employment. But Collender says the government is still acting like a spendthrift family, piling up credit card bills even though times are good. COLLENDER: It's close to unprecedented. When the economy's doing well, which it's obviously doing and has done for a decade, you would want a fiscal policy that would get the deficit to go down, not up. HORSLEY: But policymakers in Washington have gone in precisely the opposite direction. Earlier this year, Congress boosted spending on both the military and domestic programs. And then there are the tax cuts, which the president bragged about at a campaign rally this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history - biggest cuts in history. HORSLEY: In fact, these were not the biggest tax cuts ever. But they are cutting into government revenues despite repeated promises that the cuts would pay for themselves. MAYA MACGUINEAS: Let me be a hundred percent clear about one thing. The tax cuts are never going to pay for themselves. HORSLEY: Maya MacGuineas heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. She blames an outbreak of fiscal free-lunchism for the growing mountain of government debt. MACGUINEAS: If you want to spend more, you have to pay more in taxes. And if you want to cut taxes, you have to be willing to cut spending, also. And right now, it seems to be this period where no politician is willing to do any of those. HORSLEY: And like a family that's maxed out its credit cards, MacGuineas warns the government may have less room to maneuver the next time it's confronted with an actual crisis. MACGUINEAS: Last time we had a recession, our debt was half the level it is today relative to the economy. And that meant we had a lot of fiscal tools to help respond. But as the debt gets higher, our ability to respond to a recession or another kind of crisis is definitely much more difficult. HORSLEY: The growing deficit also means higher borrowing costs. So far this fiscal year, growth in Social Security, Medicare and defense spending have all been eclipsed by rising interest on the debt. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

Back then, a decade ago, lots of people were losing their homes. Today people who want to buy or in a lot of cases even just rent are being priced out of the market because there just aren't enough places for sale or for rent. So all this week on NPR's news shows we're taking a look at the new housing crisis in the U. S. from coastal cities to the rural heartland. And we're looking at what's being done to solve it. NPR's Kirk Siegler starts the series in one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country - Boise, Idaho. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Jennifer St. John has lived in Idaho's Treasure Valley all her life. The Boise she was born in was a sleepy, tree-lined river town surrounded by farms and mountains. It's hard to recognize today. JENNIFER ST JOHN: A lot of the areas that were fields and farms are now full-on neighborhoods. And corners that were out in the boondocks and why would you ever go there are now a booming part of town. SIEGLER: The boom didn't really get personal, though, until last year when St. John decided she was ready to buy her first house. She's 37. She manages a learning center for autistic kids. She's solidly middle class. ST JOHN: It's been hard for me. SIEGLER: Two hundred thousand dollars is as high as she can go. She's in good company. That's the limit for the average buyer here. The problem is the median home price is a hundred grand higher than that. ST JOHN: I'm single. There's only one income in my home (laughter). And I don't want to share my house with roommates. SIEGLER: So how did we get here, especially in a city like Boise that's long marketed its livability and affordability? Well, one answer lies in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, when homebuilding ground to a virtual halt. And the rebound has been slow. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCK REVERSING)SIEGLER: Nationwide, new home construction is lower than it's been in four decades. Housing experts tick through a list of specific reasons - there's tougher zoning; there's not enough undeveloped land; lumber is expensive. And one of the biggest problems - labor. ROBERT DEMARAY: Yeah, there is a shortage. It's been real tough to find help. Thank goodness my two sons work with me. SIEGLER: On a job site in the Boise suburb of Meridian I met Robert Demaray. DEMARAY: Yeah, we're just getting ready to use a crane to set our trusses here, and. . . SIEGLER: He's a contractor. DEMARAY: OK, down. SIEGLER: A huge crane is swinging each truss over to the skeleton roof where a few men are laying them in place. But because of that labor shortage, it's taking about two to three months longer to build homes than it would have back in 2006 before the recession. Demaray says after the housing crash, a lot of people in the trades left for the oil fields in North Dakota, and many didn't come back. Also, younger people aren't going into the trades like they used to, and those workers who are here and available are hard to keep. DEMARAY: The guys chase dollars. You know, they - this guy over here, he'll give me a dollar more an hour, so I'm going to go. SIEGLER: So they can't build homes fast enough to keep up with the demand. When you drive around the Boise area, it seems like every road is lined with for-sale or ready-to-build signs. You see a lot of bright flags and banners advertising brand-new spec homes, too. But a federal study showed that in Boise there is still a demand for more than 10 times the amount of homes being built right now. This is a nationwide problem, but it's especially acute in cities like Boise that are a draw for people moving from the more expensive and crowded West Coast. JOE ATALLA: This is just such a great place to live. And people do move here with a certain lifestyle in mind. SIEGLER: Joe Atalla moved with his wife 13 years ago from the Bay Area to start a family. An architect by trade, Atalla now owns his own building firm. Now, since the recession, he says developers across the country are building more high-end. If land and everything else is so expensive, you've got to make sure you're not going to go underwater. ATALLA: As a builder, if I'm buying a more expensive lot, I have to build a home that justifies the cost of that lot. SIEGLER: In Boise, two-thirds of all the new homes and rentals being built right now are on the upper end of the market. Now, Atalla took me to see his new Settlers' Village development, which he sees as one possible solution. ATALLA: Yeah, we're looking to pave our roads here in the next week or so. SIEGLER: It's an infill project, smaller homes on denser lots. Now, they'll still sell for probably $275,000 or more, which won't help a lot of people here. But Atalla says it's a start. ATALLA: I really like these smaller projects. It plays well into some of what we're trying to do where we can bring homes at a lower price point into the marketplace. SIEGLER: In some ways, Boise is a victim of its own success. Its easy access to hiking trails and trout streams and skiing always puts it high on top 10 lists by outdoor lifestyle magazines. DAVE BIETER: You know, we'll take these kinds of problems, you know? SIEGLER: Boise's popular longtime mayor Dave Bieter says a lot of cities and towns would envy being in this position. BIETER: You know, with 2. 6 unemployment - you know, our unemployment's so low here it looks like a typo. SIEGLER: The only problem is, where is everybody going to live - the teachers, the firefighters, the service workers that make a city tick? BIETER: Our figures show we need to build about a thousand units a year in the city of Boise to keep, you know, the kind of demand we're seeing. SIEGLER: And they're way behind in that goal. The city may look to voter-approved bonds to build more affordable housing like one large project that's underway on city-owned land not far from Bieter's office. Now, that could help ease the market, but it's not going to do too much right now. Brock Bridges is 28. He's a bartender at a local brewery. His wife is a sheriff's deputy. They've spent the past year looking for a starter home. BROCK BRIDGES: When a house that's decent pops up, it gets so many offers it's almost impossible. SIEGLER: Bridges says it's nice to have new people coming in. He's just tired of losing out on all the bidding wars for houses. One they recently bid on got 16 other offers, some all cash. BRIDGES: We feel priced out. You know, I don't think prices are going to go down anytime soon. So it's the kind of situation where you've got to make more money or live somewhere else. SIEGLER: So he and his wife are going to keep renting, which isn't exactly cheap anymore in Boise or a whole lot of other places either. That's what we'll dive into in the next story in this series later today on All Things Considered. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise.

NPR's Brakkton Booker reports from Baltimore as part of our series on the nations new housing crisis. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Devan Southerland was born and raised in Baltimore. I meet her in one of the city's most desirable neighborhoods. It's known for historic, tucked away parks and 19th century architecture. DEVAN SOUTHERLAND: Bolton Hill is an awesome mixed community. It's just a great, quiet, kept-away spot. It's one that I appreciate and I enjoy. BOOKER: This is one of her dream areas. Average home prices go for about $380,000. Southerland is a longtime renter and lives a few neighborhoods over. At times, the 39-year-old gets frustrated that she still does not own a home. SOUTHERLAND: Oh, I feel like I should have more by now. Like, I got to step it up. This is crazy. Why am I not further? BOOKER: Southerland is juggling a lot. As a legal assistant, she makes around $25,000 a year. She's raising a 10-year-old son, working on her master's degree in human services and has student loans. She's saving what she can and hopes to one day purchase here because she says Baltimore needs more black homeowners. SOUTHERLAND: For me, I just want to be smart about it because I know that a lot of black people suffered during the whole housing crisis and the whole subprime lending issue that happened a few years ago. BOOKER: In the run-up to the housing bubble a decade ago, black Americans were making strides getting into the ranks of homeownership - no longer, says Alanna McCargo, who studies housing trends. ALANNA MCCARGO: There was a slight uptick in black homeownership going into those years. And since, all sort of gains that have been made we've seen have all been lost at a national level. BOOKER: McCargo is the vice president of housing policy at the Urban Institute. Earlier this year, her organization mapped the disparities between the rates of white and black homeownership. So just how bad is it in the U. S. ? MCCARGO: Just to put it into context. If you think about the last 50 years when the Fair Housing Act was passed, the black homeownership rate today is just the same as it was in 1968. BOOKER: When broken down by city, McCargo says some places do worse than others. Cities like Minneapolis or Albany, N. Y. , have nearly 50 percentage points between white and black home ownership. Charleston, S. C. , and Austin, Texas, are around 20 percentage points. But Baltimore, a city where two-thirds of the population is African-American, is right smack in the middle. The city's 31 percentage point gap mirrors the national average. LAWRENCE BROWN: No, it's definitely not a surprise. BOOKER: Lawrence Brown is a professor in the School of Community Health and Policy at Morgan State University in Baltimore. Brown points to a study from 2017 that found, among other things, a large wealth gap persists in Baltimore City. BROWN: There's really almost a twofold gap between black Baltimoreans and white Baltimoreans. That definitely contributes to a disparity in homeownership. BOOKER: Despite having a majority black city council and five out of the last six mayors being African-American, Brown says the city in many ways remains segregated. He adds, present-day underinvestment in black neighborhoods echoes what happened in the city decades ago, the practice of redlining where neighborhoods are systematically devalued and denied financial services because of race. BROWN: People in black communities in these redlined areas have not been able to accumulate the wealth and resources oftentimes to be able to purchase those homes. And then oftentimes when they do, they get hit with a predatory loan. So they're redlined on the front end, subprimed on the back end. BOOKER: Experts say Baltimore's housing inventory is at its lowest point in more than a decade. That's just like the rest of the country. It may be why home prices are on the rise. Alanna McCargo, the housing expert from the Urban Institute, says closing the gap of home ownership has to be addressed on two fronts. MCCARGO: The black homeownership problem is not just about blacks being able to purchase homes going forward. BOOKER: She says it's equally important for blacks who own homes to stay in those homes. Rising tax rates and foreclosures are still a threat, but home ownership is the best way to transfer wealth to future generations. Brakkton Booker, NPR News, Baltimore. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   For many African-Americans, the dream of home ownership is still elusive. A recent report by Harvard University found that 43 percent of blacks in the U. S. own homes while more than 70 percent of whites do. That gap has widened over the past 30 years. NPR's Brakkton Booker reports from Baltimore as part of our series on the nations new housing crisis. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE: Devan Southerland was born and raised in Baltimore. I meet her in one of the city's most desirable neighborhoods. It's known for historic, tucked away parks and 19th century architecture. DEVAN SOUTHERLAND: Bolton Hill is an awesome mixed community. It's just a great, quiet, kept-away spot. It's one that I appreciate and I enjoy. BOOKER: This is one of her dream areas. Average home prices go for about $380,000. Southerland is a longtime renter and lives a few neighborhoods over. At times, the 39-year-old gets frustrated that she still does not own a home.

And that gives us a chance to compare President Trump's rhetoric on trade with the reality that American manufacturers are facing. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: At a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month, President Trump boasted about the comeback of one American industry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're putting our steel workers back to work at clips that nobody would believe. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: U. S. Steel is opening up seven plants. ZARROLI: In fact, U. S. Steel isn't opening up seven plants. But it has restarted a couple of blast furnaces in Illinois, and it has announced some other capital projects. CEO David Burritt appeared on Fox Business Network recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID BURRITT: So we're absolutely excited for our team and for our customers so that we can provide mined, melted and made-in-the-USA steel. ZARROLI: Steel companies are among the biggest beneficiaries of President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on imported metals. The tariffs make imports more expensive, and that's helped drive up steel prices. Mary Lovely is a professor of economics at Syracuse University. MARY LOVELY: The tariffs are working exactly the way they should. They produce winners and losers. ZARROLI: Among the losers, she says, are companies that have to buy a lot of metals to be used in manufacturing. Suddenly they have to pay more. LOVELY: The companies that use steel like aluminum can manufacturers, they're going to be hurt by this. ZARROLI: Over the past few weeks, companies such as Caterpillar, Whirlpool and General Motors have said they're having to contend with rising metal prices. The higher costs come at a time when manufacturers are otherwise faring well. William Staber is president of Staber Industries, a small Ohio company that makes washing machines and other products. WILLIAM STABER: We are so busy that it's out-of-control busy. The orders just keep coming in here, and it's never-ending. ZARROLI: Still, Staber says the rising price of aluminum and steel is causing him headaches. STABER: You go get a quote today, it's good through the end of business today period. ZARROLI: Staber says much of what his company needs to buy are specialty metals that aren't even made in the United States. He has no choice but to import them, so tariffs make no sense. STABER: It's all about protecting jobs and saving jobs. OK, I get that. But we're not even making it here. So whose job are you saving when you - we're not doing it here? ZARROLI: That's a view that Scott Paul is familiar with. The trade group that Paul heads, the Alliance for American Manufacturing, supports the steel and aluminum tariffs. But Paul concedes that many of the manufacturers he represents don't. He tells them the prices should eventually come back down. Paul says the cost of the tariffs is a small part of the $19 trillion U. S. economy. SCOTT PAUL: Obviously some steel consumers will face some price adjustments. But overall, a lot of the signs point to a healthy economy. ZARROLI: Paul says the U. S. has longstanding problems with China and other trading partners, and the tariffs are part of a strategy to address them.

Buying a home is increasingly out of reach for a majority of Americans. All this week, NPR has been exploring the new homeownership crisis in this country - not enough homes being built and sky-rocketing costs. Economists and experts blame a number of factors for this. We have a labor shortage, rising costs of building materials, not enough land - just to name a few. A good deal of our reporting on this series was informed by you on social media. Here to share some of what we heard is NPR's Kirk Siegler. He's been the lead reporter on the housing series this week. Hello, Kirk. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Hello, Lakshmi. SINGH: So I gather you have been inundated with responses from listeners. Tell me what question were you hoping to answer out of all this. SIEGLER: Well, we actually wanted to get a sense for how bad and widespread the problem really is. I mean, I spend a lot of time traveling out in the country, reporting on communities. And, you know, this is anecdotally one of the number one things I hear about - that people can't afford housing. And we were inundated by responses from people writing in from almost every state in the country, people writing in from small towns, big cities. And not just the expensive cities that you might think of when you think of a housing crisis here in California or New York or Washington, D. C. , where you are. And a story from a gentleman named Matthew Medvecki is one we heard a lot. He and his wife live in Sarasota, Fla. They've just recently started a family. They've got another child on the way, and they're about to outgrow their current house that they own. And they're thinking if they sell their house, they'd have a decent amount of money from it and they could find a new place. Well, not so fast, so let's hear from Matthew. MATTHEW MEDVECKI: Housing prices have nearly doubled. And while that means that we have a lot of equity in this house, to just be able to increase like from a two-bedroom to a three-bedroom house is a huge leap for us. SINGH: So they can sell their house, but they're unable to find anything else? SIEGLER: Right. And $300,000, he said, is basically his cap. And his story is not unique. Interestingly, he used the first-time homebuyer tax credit that you may remember came from President Obama in 2009 after the crash. And he's achieved the homeownership dream, right? But in order to find something new that suitable, a place they want to move into for 10, 15 years and grow their family, is maybe 350 to 400,000 in their Florida community, and they just can't afford that much. Lakshmi, we also heard just how crazy it is out there when you think you do have something that you want, and you're in the works, and you put the bid in, and you're outbid. Here's William O'Berry. He got in touch with us from Atlanta, and he had to go farther and farther out from the city, where he preferred to live in, to find something for $200,000 that he could afford. WILLIAM O'BERRY: Just the process of like we went to go see this house, and it's either someone bought it out right from under us while we were visiting it, or we didn't have enough money to do the renovations and pay for the mortgage at the same time. SINGH: That's one of the frustrating factors for anybody who's been through the home buying process. SIEGLER: Exactly. SINGH: I mean, we've talked about some of the economic reasons, the economic factors, for the housing shortage. What about the people who are relocating from one area to another? Maybe a big city and they're trying to get to a smaller city or town. I'm wondering, how much of a factor has that been in all of this? SIEGLER: Right. So that was actually one of the reasons we started to look to do this series. Living here in California, you hear about people moving to Denver, Salt Lake City, moving east, where homes are cheaper. You sell your condo, say, in San Francisco for 3 million. Well, that goes a lot farther in a place like Boise. So let me introduce you to Emily Burkhardt. She lives in Bozeman, Mont. , an increasingly unaffordable place to live in a state that has some of the lowest per-capita income in the country. And she told us that in large part, tech workers were moving in. They're able to work remotely, or they're coming into a town like Bozeman with all of its amenities, and that's driving up prices. EMILY BURKHARDT: And those are people that can sell their house in California, Seattle and Oregon for - their tiny house - for a lot of money and then come in here and buy a much bigger place. SIEGLER: And so, Lakshmi, we're using these western cities as an example. But I don't have to tell you this is a crisis clearly affecting everyone everywhere. SINGH: I mean, 10 years removed now from the last housing crisis. Now to face this new kind of a challenge of escalating housing affordability problems. I mean, this begs the question of what will become of homeownership in the United States. I mean, it has been such a big part of the American identity. It's part of the American dream to own your own home, finally. What do you think is being done to preserve that American dream? SIEGLER: I don't want to say that it's all just crisis, crisis, crisis. There are communities and cities and states that are doing things to tackle this. A lot of people we talked to in this series - economists, and experts, and builders, and developers, and city leaders - especially in Boise, as an example - that told us that the private market is not going to do this on its own. There's going to have to be some sort of public intervention into the market to give incentives to developers to build affordable housing. You know, there's just no clear sign that this market is going to get corrected anytime soon at least on the private market. In June, new housing starts - something the economists watch very closely. New housing starts - were actually down by an astounding 12 percent. And, you know, I think this latest housing crisis or affordability crisis we're looking at is causing - you know, you mentioned the American dream. It's causing a lot of people to question whether that's still attainable. You know, we hear all about how the economy is booming right now. But, you know, in reporting this series, it's clear that that is only the case for a certain number of people. SINGH: That's NPR's Kirk Siegler talking about the homeownership crisis in America, 10 years after the collapse and the Great Recession. Thank you very much, Kirk. SIEGLER: Glad to be here. SINGH: And you can find links to all of our reporting from NPR and member stations KQED and Colorado Public Radio - including photos and charts, et cetera at our website, npr. org.

And the problems facing those places may be especially hard to solve. As part of our series on the new housing crisis, NPR's Kirk Siegler sent this report from rural Nebraska. (SOUNDBITE OF CARS PASSING)SIMON: Along the country roads that fan out from the Ogallala, Neb. , there are abandoned, old farmhouses and weathered, caved-in barns - a remnant of the hardscrabble settlers who first tapped the Ogallala Aquifer, turning these dry, high plains into lush wheat and corn fields. Like a lot of the rural heartland, Western Nebraska slowly emptied out over the years. (SOUNDBITE OF CHURCH BELLS)KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: So why then is there a housing shortage today in Ogallala, population 4,500? The answers are complicated. But if you ask Mary Wilson, she'll tell you it's more like a shortage of adequate housing. MARY WILSON: People aren't updating their homes before they throw them on the market. People are living in their homes, I think, longer here. SIEGLER: On average, people are living in their homes twice as long as they did before the Great Recession. So the market is tight. When Wilson moved to Ogallala from Colorado, drawn back to the small-town Nebraska she grew up in, she and her husband had a hard time finding something suitable. WILSON: You know, we had to settle for what was available. SIEGLER: Wilson is in charge of economic development here. She's driving down a quiet, leafy street of larger old homes in the center of town. They were built for a far different time when you needed big families to work the farms. A lot of them now are outdated. The few that are for sale need 40 grand worth of rehab at a minimum. And most people either can't or aren't willing to pay that. WILSON: My role as the economic development director is bringing business and industry to town - retaining the business and industries that we have, you know, doing what I can to expand that tax base. Well, it's difficult to do that when we don't have adequate housing. SIEGLER: This is the classic chicken and egg that's long plagued rural America but is being magnified now by the national crisis in the housing industry - a crisis blamed on lots of factors. Lumber is hugely expensive due to tariffs on Canadian wood. And there's a labor shortage, made even worse in an isolated small town like Ogallala. Doug Davis is a longtime local real estate man and developer. DOUG DAVIS: In the bigger cities, you have a selection. I mean, I couldn't go out and get like 5 bids on a plumber to do this house because they're all busy. SIEGLER: And a lot of the contractors who are here are getting older and looking to retire. DAVIS: I think the need is there. If we could build 40 houses in the next two to three years, we'd sell more. SIEGLER: For now, Davis is just proud to have gotten three homes built - no small feat in a town that hadn't had a new private home put up since the 1990s. And they sold in less than three weeks, one even before it was finished. DAVIS: I tried to make it, so it all flows. You know, like I said, it's 1,300 square foot. SIEGLER: Now this place closed at just under 200,000. That's a lot in Ogallala where wages are depressed from the boom and bust of farm commodity prices. The few other homes on the market right now are mostly selling north of 300,000 too. As in a lot of smaller markets, newcomers are driving up prices. DAVIS: Yep, the folks I sold the house to next door are from Denver. And they just got tired of the Denver hassle. The houses I'd built up on 10th Street, I think that was a win-win situation because those were all three people that came from outside the community. SIEGLER: Now, the easiest answer is just to build more homes. But small towns like this are still considered risky by most outside developers. They can make a lot more money in cities where land and home values are even higher. Ogallala is learning this the hard way as it struggled to find capital to redevelop a shuttered school into condos to help ease the shortage. JACOB HOVENDICK: In rural Nebraska, you don't typically have tons of seed money just laying around waiting for a project to come across it's door. SIEGLER: At Adams Bank and Trust downtown, I met Jacob Hovendick. He's a financial adviser and accountant. His extended family is from here. And he jumped at the chance five years ago to move over from Lincoln and raise his young family. Now, the shortage of adequate or even available homes has clearly led to some soul-searching. HOVENDICK: I feel like we're at a very pivotal point in rural America's development because you now are finding opportunities through technological advancements to be mobile as a workforce - to maybe work from home but work for a company three states away. SIEGLER: Hovendick says rural America is so close to rebounding, but now there's no place to live. So he and other business leaders are behind a plan to ask voters here this fall to approve a small sales-tax hike. The money would be used to build more workforce housing and offer incentives for developers to come here. HOVENDICK: The federal government's not coming to help us. The state government, to a certain extent, can't come help us. No one's coming to our rescue. We kind of have to start helping ourselves. SIEGLER: Nationally, rural housing experts say the same thing. You've got to have a well-organized local group of leaders committed to raising money and getting things done, in this era where federal funding for rural development is trending down. WILSON: Just watch for rattlesnakes. SIEGLER: That's only a half joke for Mary Wilson, who just hopped out of her SUV on a dirt road north of Ogallala. Campers and boaters are whizzing by, headed to nearby Lake McCaughnay, lately a big economic driver. WILSON: So they started moving dirt last week to prep this site for this new development. SIEGLER: Wilson wanted to show me this site because a Nebraska developer, on his own, saw the need and decided to come in and build four new duplexes. WILSON: The cul-de-sac here, this is an entire subdivision. The developer bought this entire subdivision. SIEGLER: She hopes these starter homes will help the local hospital in particular attract new doctors and nurses. Wilson, who grew up in an even smaller town near here, says for too long rural America has suffered from a confidence problem. If you hear over and over that you're withering away, well, you start to believe it. WILSON: Some people out there have the perception of Ogallala drying up and dying. And we're not that at all. SIEGLER: To hear people in Ogallala tell it, the housing shortage is more a wake-up call than crisis for rural America. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Ogallala, Neb. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we state that voters would consider a small sales tax hike. In fact, the proposal is to reallocate existing sales tax funds. ] SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Home prices are skyrocketing in some places that might surprise you, including remote towns in rural America. And the problems facing those places may be especially hard to solve. As part of our series on the new housing crisis, NPR's Kirk Siegler sent this report from rural Nebraska. (SOUNDBITE OF CARS PASSING) SIMON: Along the country roads that fan out from the Ogallala, Neb. , there are abandoned, old farmhouses and weathered, caved-in barns - a remnant of the hardscrabble settlers who first tapped the Ogallala Aquifer, turning these dry, high plains into lush wheat and corn fields. Like a lot of the rural heartland, Western Nebraska slowly emptied out over the years.

They're bringing together the state's cheesemakers with prospective international buyers for a unique speed-dating event. One hope is that it could ease the tariff pain affecting Wisconsin cheese producers. Maayan Silver of member station WUWM in Milwaukee reports. MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: As morning sunlight peaks in, Gene Graf is among cheesemakers setting up shop around tables in this beer hall of a Milwaukee microbrewery. He's laid out three plates of cheese samples on a white tablecloth. GENE GRAF: We have our newest trending profiles - our coffee Gouda, our Gouda-mango-habanero and our Gouda-honey-Sriracha along with our apple-infused, smoked natural cheeses. SILVER: Graf is waiting for buyers to arrive. They've come here from countries he doesn't usually sell to like Guatemala, Colombia and the United Arab Emirates. The sellers and potential buyers will be scoping each other out and rotating table to table to see whether they'll be good partners for exporting cheese. This was a collaboration between the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture and the state's dairy groups. [EDITOR'S NOTE: The full name of the agency is Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. ]JEN WALSH: We make the best cheese in the world, and a lot of people don't know about it, so that's why we've brought them here so we can really showcase it. SILVER: That's Jen Walsh of Dairy Farmers of Wisconsin who's working with the Agriculture Department on the event. Wisconsin cheesemakers account for more than a quarter of the country's cheese production, more than 3 billion pounds per year. More than one-third of Wisconsin's income from cheese exports last year came from Mexico. And while only a small percentage of Wisconsin cheese is exported to China, China is a growing market. But both countries have recently added big tariffs on U. S. dairy products, up to 25 percent. Gene Graf expects that to put a dent in sales. GRAF: And then it just depends on how bad they want that product there. If the product sells good, well, tariffs will affect the consumer. The end user's going to end up paying more. SILVER: Claude Mauro is a distributor from Chile, and he's looking for cheeses with unique flavors that Chileans will turn to for an aperitif. He knows what he doesn't want - copycats of European styles like pecorino or brie. CLAUDE MAURO: But, really, a cheese from America, a gringo cheese, will say the people of South America. Something really they say, OK, I'm in American style, and this is an American-style cheese. SILVER: He chats freely with the cheesemakers about their processes and what it takes to get licensed to export to his country. When the speed dating ends, Mauro says it worked. MAURO: I tested five of them and one, two are very exceptional. SILVER: So they might get on your shelves. MAURO: Yup. SILVER: In addition to the speed dating, the prospective buyers from five countries toured six cheese plants around the state and visited the iconic Wisconsin State Fair. Jack Heinemann of the Agriculture Department says that this event was just the beginning. JACK HEINEMANN: I like the cheese. I have a good comfort with the supplier, and then they will follow up, make the deal and ship products. SILVER: With tariffs from Mexico and China taking a bite out of profits, Wisconsin cheesemakers are eager for a love connection between their product and consumers in countries not involved in a trade war.

I mean, are you looking at the labels to see where those goods are made? I, for one, don't. Maybe I should. As President Trump has been shaking up America's international trade relationships, NPR's Alina Selyukh did want to see just how much of the world is represented in our shopping baskets, and she sent this report from Hinesville in southeastern Georgia. ANDREA CONYERS: Sweetheart, why don't you look at some backpacks? ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Andrea Conyers is steering her cart and her daughter through the back-to-school area of WalmartCONYERS: Sharp turn, sharp turn, sharp turn. SELYUKH: Her daughter, Aviana, is very organized. She's 7 years old. She's got her second-grade supply list in hand, asks her mom for a pencil to cross things off. AVIANA CONYERS: OK, what's next? So two pink erasers. So let's go for the dry-erase markers. CONYERS: All right. You need a fine tip. AVIANA: Now, let's go find hand sanitizer. SELYUKH: Of course, the most exciting purchase is a new backpack. What kind of backpack do you want? AVIANA: Well, whatever my mom chooses. SELYUKH: Sure, we believe you, Aviana. She ends up choosing a colorful pack with a strand of doll hair. I'm following the Conyers' shopping trip today for a bit of a thought experiment. President Trump has put the U. S. on a path to a trade war with much of the world, especially with America's biggest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China. So far, the new tariffs on imports and exports have mostly been felt by U. S. manufacturers and farmers. But it all can feel distant when you're just a consumer shopping. I wanted to see how global trade might actually show up in the baskets of regular American shoppers. Many of them are now stocking up on back-to-school supplies. Conyers and I sort through her basket, searching the labels of pencils made in the Philippines, ear buds made in China, a few notebooks. CONYERS: Made in India. SELYUKH: Traveling around the world here. CONYERS: Yes - Brazil, India, China. SELYUKH: The Philippines. CONYERS: Made in the U. S. SELYUKH: Her basket ends up being split about half and half between foreign-made products and things made or at least assembled in America. CONYERS: Actually, I'm very pleasantly surprised. SELYUKH: She says she usually pays attention to where her purchases come from when the quality really matters for her, like food or clothes. CONYERS: Whatever you buy local, it goes back into your local economy. SELYUKH: On a larger scale, that's exactly the hope behind the Trump administration's new trade policies. President Trump argues instead of buying things from other countries, make them here, buy them here, create jobs in America. The thing is that's not how products have been made for years. You may have heard the term supply chain. Think of this. . . AVIANA: A pack of pencils. SELYUKH: A pencil might get wood from one place, graphite from another, the rubber eraser comes from a third place, and it might all get assembled in yet another country and then shipped to be sold all over the world. The vast majority of global trade works this way. Trump's trade policies stand to shake that up. Economists say eventually restricting America's role in this global web could lead to higher prices at the store. NATALIE MONDESIR: I am preparing myself financially. SELYUKH: Natalie Mondesir is a fourth-grade teacher here in Liberty County. MONDESIR: I am starting to save a little bit and buy stuff as much as possible while I can. SELYUKH: Mondesir also has two teenage children. MONDESIR: I'm usually looking for the best deals because not only am I buying stuff for my own personal children, I usually buy stuff for my class also. SELYUKH: Today, her shopping list is for her son's eighth-grade science class. And as we set off to see where her purchases come from, things get a bit emotional when Mondesir picks up a box of Crayola colored pencils. MONDESIR: I always go Crayola only because this has been childhood. I've been to the Crayola factory. SELYUKH: We look for the label. MONDESIR: As distributed - what does it mean by distributed? Made in Brazil. SELYUKH: Made in Brazil. MONDESIR: Dang, you just broke my heart. SELYUKH: I'm sorry. MONDESIR: I went to the Crayola factory when I was little. SELYUKH: Turns out, Crayola crayons are made in the U. S. but Crayola colored pencils are Brazilian. As I follow Mondesir, we make a couple other observations. Foreign-made pencils are slightly cheaper than made in the USA and sometimes American made isn't even an option. MONDESIR: OK, now I got to figure out where the locks are. SELYUKH: Mondesir is looking for a padlock, the kind you put on a school locker. MONDESIR: Of course, it's made in China. OK. SELYUKH: I'm guessing that one's also made in China. MONDESIR: Oh, no, no, Taiwan. SELYUKH: Packaged in the USA, though. MONDESIR: Plot twist. SELYUKH: Very few of the supermarket items have so far been directly affected by the escalating trade dispute. But the next wave of tariffs is expected to hit more consumer-oriented products. It's unclear how much the companies will be able to eat the costs instead of hiking up the prices for shoppers. And Mondesir is particularly worried about one big-ticket item she wants to buy this year - a new car. The auto industry is bracing to be swept up in a costly tariff war. So Mondesir says she is preparing to pay more than she had expected. Alina Selyukh, NPR News, Liberty County, Ga.

And as we set off to see where her purchases come from, things get a bit emotional when Mondesir picks up a box of Crayola colored pencils. MONDESIR: I always go Crayola only because this has been childhood. I've been to the Crayola factory. SELYUKH: We look for the label. MONDESIR: As distributed - what does it mean by distributed? Made in Brazil. SELYUKH: Made in Brazil. MONDESIR: Dang, you just broke my heart. SELYUKH: I'm sorry. MONDESIR: I went to the Crayola factory when I was little. SELYUKH: Turns out, Crayola crayons are made in the U. S. but Crayola colored pencils are Brazilian. As I follow Mondesir, we make a couple other observations. Foreign-made pencils are slightly cheaper than made in the USA and sometimes American made isn't even an option. MONDESIR: OK, now I got to figure out where the locks are. SELYUKH: Mondesir is looking for a padlock, the kind you put on a school locker. MONDESIR: Of course, it's made in China. OK. SELYUKH: I'm guessing that one's also made in China. MONDESIR: Oh, no, no, Taiwan. SELYUKH: Packaged in the USA, though. MONDESIR: Plot twist. SELYUKH: Very few of the supermarket items have so far been directly affected by the escalating trade dispute. But the next wave of tariffs is expected to hit more consumer-oriented products. It's unclear how much the companies will be able to eat the costs instead of hiking up the prices for shoppers. And Mondesir is particularly worried about one big-ticket item she wants to buy this year - a new car. The auto industry is bracing to be swept up in a costly tariff war. So Mondesir says she is preparing to pay more than she had expected. Alina Selyukh, NPR News, Liberty County, Ga.", "section": "Business", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

The job market is hot right now, and businesses are scrambling to find available workers. But worker advocates say age discrimination persists when it comes to recruitment and hiring. Several pending legal cases are putting the spotlight on this issue, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Linda Bradley's two decades at a call center came to an end when she was laid off about a year and a half ago. Since then, she's combed the Internet every day looking for jobs without much luck. Bradley is 45 and lives near Columbus, Ohio. Last year, someone at her union mentioned how recruiters often target online ads at younger candidates. LINDA BRADLEY: I thought to myself, oh, that's why I wasn't seeing some of the ads that my daughter had seen on her Facebook. NOGUCHI: Her daughter, who is 26, got hired right away. Bradley eventually took the only job she could land, making far less than before. She continues searching but feels disadvantaged. BRADLEY: To have someone withhold something that you qualify for - and I'm sorry. I get emotional talking about it. And it's a struggle taking care of four children, not being able to have the same opportunities as everybody else. NOGUCHI: Bradley is now a plaintiff in a suit filed by the Communications Workers of America against T-Mobile, Facebook and a host of other businesses. The suit alleges the companies discriminate by excluding older workers from seeing their ads. T-Mobile didn't respond to requests seeking comment on the case; Facebook also declined. But in a December blog post, Facebook's vice president of ads, Rob Goldman, defended the practice. He argued that tailoring ads is not illegal so long as the recruitment campaign overall is designed to reach all demographic groups. But Bradley says that's not what she observes. BRADLEY: If I would've saw ads for employment, I would have definitely noticed them because I'm looking for employment. NOGUCHI: Workplace civil rights law prohibits discrimination against workers 40 and older, yet worker advocates say recruiters sometimes exclude older workers by narrowing how and where they look for candidates. In addition to Bradley's suit, another recent case has challenged whether an employer can recruit exclusively on college campuses. Jody Calemine is chief of staff with the Communications Workers. JODY CALEMINE: We see that this is one of the factors that keeps older workers out of the job market after a job loss. NOGUCHI: Last month, Facebook signed a legally binding agreement pledging to stop allowing advertisers to exclude people based on race, nationality or sexual orientation. But Calemine notes that did not include prohibitions on exclusions based on age. CALEMINE: The agreement shows that they can fix the age discrimination issue very quickly, but they are resisting. And that is very perplexing. NOGUCHI: Facebook allows users to click on a feature to see why they're seeing certain ads. Calemine says those disclosures are explicit about their target audience. One T-Mobile job he cites seeks 18 to 38-year-olds. CALEMINE: My jaw dropped as I saw some of the ads we were able to uncover. NOGUCHI: Calemine says targeted advertising - the profit engine for most sites - is a new frontier for discrimination. CALEMINE: Their business relies on this microtargeting. The problem is microtargeting can be discrimination. Civil rights don't stop when you turn on your computer. NOGUCHI: But making the case in court won't be easy. Laurie McCann is a lawyer for the AARP Foundation, a nonprofit fighting poverty among seniors. LAURIE MCCANN: Hiring discrimination is very difficult to prove because the applicant is on the outside looking in. NOGUCHI: She says, in these types of cases, the applicants aren't claiming the employer discriminated against them personally. Rather, McCann says, they're arguing the recruitment process itself has a discriminatory effect. That is, by targeting recruitment to younger people, employers end up excluding older job seekers. Whether that's a violation of law, McCann says, is the question. MCCANN: The issue is whether or not workers can even get into the courthouse door to challenge that practice that clearly screens out older workers. NOGUCHI: That's the legal hurdle Dale Kleber must clear. Kleber is 62, a lawyer and former executive at a Fortune 500 company living just outside Chicago. Three years ago, he applied for a legal job with medical technology firm CareFusion. The posting specified it was looking for candidates with three to seven years of experience but no more than seven. Kleber applied anyway, was rejected, then sued. DALE KLEBER: I thought that was blatantly discriminatory. Most people who are 40 years or older had been a lawyer for more than seven years. NOGUCHI: In April, a three-judge panel on a federal appeals court ruled in Kleber's favor. They said the law protects applicants like Kleber. But the case remains in limbo. CareFusion, which is now owned by another company, is appealing the decision. In a statement, the company denies its policies discriminate. But Kleber takes issue with the company's defense. KLEBER: The response that the company gave was, well, Mr. Kleber was overqualified. And, frankly, I think that's a code word really for age discrimination. NOGUCHI: The case will be reheard by the full 7th Circuit Appeals Court in November. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVID GREENE, HOST:  All right.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, how the numbers don't always tell a single story, especially when it comes to measuring progress - even numbers the whole world seems to agree on, like gross domestic product. MICHAEL GREEN: So gross domestic product is a statistical tool created in the 1930s. RAZ: This is economist Michael Green. GREEN: It was not something handed down by God on tablets of stone, as we sometimes talk about it. This is a single tool that tries to measure how much is the economy producing each year, adding up all the different things to produce and saying what's the total value of production of the economy. RAZ: And Michael says that while GDP alone was helpful back then in managing the economy, it has since become the only defining measure of economic progress. GREEN: We divide our world into rich countries and poor countries based on these economic numbers, these GDP numbers. And then we count our success. And we tell the countries that have got less GDP that the thing they've got to do is just get more GDP. And then there'll be a better country. We've ignored the fact that, you know, GDP says nothing about the environment. GDP says nothing about fairness. It's just telling us what's the value of what's being produced in the country every year. So one thing you can find is that it can jump about quite a lot, especially if you get an earthquake or a natural disaster. This happened in Japan a few years ago. Bigger earthquake. So there was a lot of money spent on reconstruction. GDP jumped. So if you're thinking that GDP is progress, you'd have said the earthquakes are good for Japan's progress. Actually, that's a bit weird. Then second - similarly, GDP counts any activity. It makes no judgment about whether the economic activity is productive or not. So if you're spending money on prisons and bombs and tear gas or whatever, all these things may be bad things. As long as they've got a market price and they're part of the production of the economy, GDP's counted them as being a positive step forward. RAZ: So what are we not measuring? GREEN: So things that are essentially exchanged between us, which can be things like community and friendship, the fact that I can rely on a friend or neighbor, the fact that I have a place of belonging. None of these things are being counted. RAZ: Michael Green picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GREEN: There have, of course, been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP. But I believe that we're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution. Today, I'd like to introduce you to the Social Progress Index. It's a measure of the well-being of society completely separate from GDP. It's a whole new way of looking at the world. The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions. The first is, does everyone have the basic needs for survival - food, water, shelter, safety? Secondly, does everyone have access to the building blocks to improve their lives - education, information, health and sustainable environment? And then third, does every individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles? Do they have rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination and access to the world's most advanced knowledge? Together, these 12 components form the Social Progress framework. RAZ: So - I mean, can everything you measure be measured? Can you quantify it and create data and statistics out of them? GREEN: Well, I think we can do it well enough. So we're very much focusing on the outcomes. So it could be anything like, what's the life expectancy? That's a hard number. What's the high school dropout rate? That's a hard number. You know, what are we - what pollution are we putting into the environment? What's - how many people are dying in road traffic accidents? And then we could also measure things which are more about how people feel. But those things matter. Things like, do people experience discrimination? Do people feel part of a community? And those are survey questions. But they're measuring a critical part of people's real-lived experience. RAZ: So if GDP basically tells us which economies are the largest in the world, it doesn't tell us which countries are the best places to live for just sustainability for our own well-being. It tells us nothing, almost nothing about that. GREEN: Well, it - what we found is that GDP tells us something, but it's not the whole story. So the Social Progress Index shows us that - broadly - countries that are richer tend to have higher social progress. But it's definitely not destiny. So some of the richest countries in the world, like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, in per capita terms actually have pretty middling levels of social progress. The United States, which has a very high level of GDP per capita, actually is not doing very well compared to other rich countries. On the other hand, we find there are countries that have got a very modest income, like Costa Rica that's got a level of social progress the same as - almost the same as some of the G-7 countries. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, it is amazing that a country like the U. S. , which is one of the richest countries in the world, does so badly when it comes to social progress. GREEN: Yeah. I mean, the United States' results in Social Progress Index are actually quite shocking. So the U. S. is the only real major industrial society that we've seen that consistently is underperforming on its social progress relative to its GDP per capita. So the U. S. is basically failing in using its wealth to deliver real quality of life for citizens. So in our rankings, the U. S. is fifth in terms of GDP per capita and 19th in terms of social progress. So it's a really, really strikingly poor performance from the U. S. that I think paints a pretty stark picture. RAZ: Now, somebody might look at the Social Progress Index and say, well, Michael, I mean, you know, the U. S. is a massive country with 300-plus million people, and the countries that seem to be doing well are much smaller, smaller populations, and so, you know, you're comparing apples to oranges. GREEN: Yeah, I mean, big countries do seem to have a harder job. That certainly is the case. But we can say even compared to countries of, you know, that are also of a good size, like the other G-7 countries, even then the U. S. is not doing well. I think the issue we find with the U. S. , there's too many people falling off the bottom, achieving very, very low levels of social progress who are being left behind. And that's what's pulling the average numbers down for the U. S. RAZ: Do you see the Social Progress Index as something that could or should replace GDP or something that can work in parallel alongside GDP? GREEN: Well, we really say mostly that it's there to work in parallel alongside. We've got a system of economic measurement. It's got so many flaws, and we've talked a lot about the flaws. But it's telling us something. What we have to recognize is that it's not telling us the whole story. And so by counting those intangible things into tangible numbers through the Social Progress Index, we can actually help communities make choices about where they want to go and what kind of societies they want to build. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GREEN: Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits, charities, volunteers, civil society organizations really contribute to our society. Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution, but on their contribution to social progress. Imagine if we could hold politicians to account for really improving people's lives. Imagine if we could work together - government, business, civil society, me, you - and make it this century the century of social progress. Thank you.

HANNA ROSIN, BYLINE: I will warn you guys, I'm always off my mic. And everyone complains that I breathe too much. RAZ: This is journalist and writer Hanna Rosin. And you might recognize her voice from the NPR podcast Invisibilia. ROSIN: That's the - 100 percent things I get from Invisibilia. Alix is like, stop breathing, I can't even think. RAZ: That's why your show sounds better. Now, before becoming a podcast host, Hanna was a writer for The Atlantic. And she also ran Slate's women site DoubleX, which is why we wanted to ask her about measuring progress when it comes to women. So when I say the word progress, what does that mean to you? ROSIN: The most clean definition of progress for me is more opportunities and less restrictions for the greatest number of people. You know, if you think about it in terms of men and women there are various points in history where the possible roles for women were much too restrictive. But if you look at 100 years of history, decade after decade there's a lot of movement for women and very little movement for men. RAZ: About a decade ago, right after the recession, Hanna was going through some job numbers, and she noticed something pretty remarkable, something that signaled a huge economic shift for women. ROSIN: Lots of jobs that were associated with men were dropping off the map one after another. There are just lists of professions. They go from nurse to ship worker, to technological assistant, to journalists, it's every profession in a list. And then, you have projections of the professions most likely to grow and the professions that are absolutely disappearing. Most of the professions that were absolutely disappearing were professions that were traditionally associated with men. Most of the professions that were growing were professions that were traditionally associated with women. RAZ: So today, a decade on, we know some of the basics of this story, a decline in manufacturing jobs and a rise in service-sector jobs. But Hanna noticed this back in 2009. And when she put all the numbers together a much bigger picture emerged. So she gave a talk about what she found at the very first TED women's conference. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ROSIN: If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots you can see the evidence everywhere. For every two men who get a college degree, three women will do the same. Women, for the first time this year, became the majority of the American workforce. Over 50 percent of managers are women these days. And in the 15 professions projected to grow the most in the next decade, all but two of them are dominated by women. So here you have a generation of young women who grow up thinking of themselves as being more powerful earners than the young men around them. Certainly, this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women. The '20s and the '60s also come to mind. But the difference is that back then, it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement that was trying to project its own desires, whereas this time it's not about passion and it's not about any kind of movement. This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in. The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not. And that's why I talk about \"The End Of Men. \"RAZ: So you wrote a book about this, and it's actually called \"The End Of Men. \"ROSIN: Yeah. RAZ: And what does that mean? Like, what do you what do you mean by that? ROSIN: I mean - OK - so what does, \"The End Of Men\" mean? It's the end of the assumption of male dominance, that's no longer what we assume to be the order of our current universe. You know, the end of an assumption of male order in the family and the male breadwinner. And all of these roles that we slot men into and have assumed that they occupy. All of those things are being questioned now. What the economy requires now is a whole different set of skills. You, basically, need intelligence. You need an ability to sit still and focus, to communicate openly, to be able to listen to people and operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be. And those are things that women do extremely well, as we're seeing. If you look at management theory these days, a leader is somebody who can foster creativity, who can basically build teams and get them to be creative. And those are all things that women do very well. And then on top of that, that's created kind of a cascading effect. Women enter the workplace at the top, and then at the working class, all the new jobs that are created are the jobs that wives used to do for free at home - child care, elder care and food preparation. So those are all the jobs that are growing, and those are jobs that women tend to do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I think it's fair to say that it's certainly a better time to be a professional woman than, you know, 1990, 1980, 1960. ROSIN: Yes. Why did I pause before saying yes? Well, let me just say cleanly, yes. Absolutely. There's a lot more opportunities. There's a lot more job growth. Do you want to know about my hesitation? RAZ: Sure. ROSIN: So there's two hesitations. One is that the jobs at the very, very top, which is really important because those are the sources of true power, has not shifted that much. So middle management has shifted a huge amount, kind of working class jobs shifted a huge amount. But the very top has not shifted that much. And the second hesitation comes from the fact that these are low-paying jobs. RAZ: So seeing these numbers as pure progress is a little tricky here, right? I mean, it sounds like it makes you uncomfortable interpreting it that way. ROSIN: It doesn't actually make me uncomfortable because I'd like to zoom outwards. I will say it made many readers of my book uncomfortable. I got tremendous resistance from feminists to the idea of calling this progress. And that's because - I mean, that's for several reasons. One is the cultural backlash that we are seeing hugely now. I mean, you can see the election of Trump that way, you can see social dynamics such as marriage. There's been a profound change in American marriage patterns. RAZ: Well, explain that for - what you mean by that. ROSIN: OK. So we haven't talked about this yet, but there's college-educated marriage patterns, which are the happiest, most settled, most wonderful marriages that people have measured in a really long time. But most of Americans are not college-educated. That's only 30 percent of Americans. For most of Americans, divorce rates and kind of rates of broken families are exactly where they were in the '70s - lots of divorce, huge rise in single motherhood. This has been going on in black families since the '70s when factories sort of moved out of the city, has migrated to white families as factories sort of moved out of smaller towns. And so you have to reckon with the fact that there are a lot of angry, displaced men who resent the rise of women and blame the rise of women for a lot of their problems. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ROSIN: This whole thesis really came home to me when I went to a men's group in Kansas. And these were men who had been contractors or they had been building houses and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom. And they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support. And the instructor was telling them they no longer had any moral authority, that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore and they were not really the providers, so who were they? And what he did was he wrote down on the board $85,000. And he said, that's her salary. And then he wrote down $12,000. That's your salary, so who's the man now? He asked them. She's the man now. And that really sent a shudder through the room. And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful. But if we do take account of it, then I think it will go much more smoothly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So, you know, this book comes out, I think, 2012. ROSIN: Yeah. RAZ: We're, you know, six, seven years on since the book came out. I mean, you almost seemed to predict the consequences of not dealing with this disruption, which happened - is happening. ROSIN: Oh, wow, is it happening. I mean, I spend a lot of time on the manosphere, you know, which is the man part of the web. It is utterly dominated by biological determinism, that women have a certain role and men have a certain role and that the fact that women have subverted that role is destroying society. RAZ: Do you think that that perspective is just kind of fleeting, or do you think that that has a potential to actually take root? ROSIN: Oh, it is taking root. And, you know, this is a thing Susan Faludi predicted in her book \"Backlash,\" which is about this very idea. Every time you have forward motion economically, any kind of progress for women, it's accompanied by a giant tidal wave of cultural backlash. And that's exactly the moment we're in right now. RAZ: But it seems like that tidal wave of backlash doesn't have quite the impact of the ultimate progress. In other words, two steps forward, one step back. ROSIN: I think that's right. I think it's two steps, forward one step back. I mean, the way I think of these numbers is progress, like all of history is jagged, like there isn't usually a straight line you can draw upwards or downwards. You know what is my hesitation here? RAZ: What? ROSIN: Lots of power hierarchies have worked in lots of different ways across the span of history, but not the male/female hierarchy. It is consistent over every society over the millennia forever. And so why is that? You know, why is that the one that's so hard to break? Is that a cultural story that we tell ourselves? It is remarkably consistent over history. RAZ: Except it's breaking now. We're watching that happen, right? ROSIN: Yeah, we're watching it happen. RAZ: So, I mean, in a hundred years from now, can we say - can we assume that things will be even better? ROSIN: Well, it's true in all futuristic societies that project forward, the woman is commanding the fleet, so maybe. Maybe we can. Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Hanna Rosin. Her book is called \"The End Of Men. \" You can watch her entire talk at ted. com, and you can check out more stories from Hanna on the NPR podcast Invisibilia. On the show today, The Story Behind The Numbers. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  On the show today, The Story Behind The Numbers. HANNA ROSIN, BYLINE: I will warn you guys, I'm always off my mic. And everyone complains that I breathe too much. RAZ: This is journalist and writer Hanna Rosin. And you might recognize her voice from the NPR podcast Invisibilia. ROSIN: That's the - 100 percent things I get from Invisibilia. Alix is like, stop breathing, I can't even think. RAZ: That's why your show sounds better. Now, before becoming a podcast host, Hanna was a writer for The Atlantic. And she also ran Slate's women site DoubleX, which is why we wanted to ask her about measuring progress when it comes to women. So when I say the word progress, what does that mean to you? ROSIN: The most clean definition of progress for me is more opportunities and less restrictions for the greatest number of people. You know, if you think about it in terms of men and women there are various points in history where the possible roles for women were much too restrictive. But if you look at 100 years of history, decade after decade there's a lot of movement for women and very little movement for men. RAZ: About a decade ago, right after the recession, Hanna was going through some job numbers, and she noticed something pretty remarkable, something that signaled a huge economic shift for women. ROSIN: Lots of jobs that were associated with men were dropping off the map one after another. There are just lists of professions. They go from nurse to ship worker, to technological assistant, to journalists, it's every profession in a list. And then, you have projections of the professions most likely to grow and the professions that are absolutely disappearing. Most of the professions that were absolutely disappearing were professions that were traditionally associated with men. Most of the professions that were growing were professions that were traditionally associated with women. RAZ: So today, a decade on, we know some of the basics of this story, a decline in manufacturing jobs and a rise in service-sector jobs. But Hanna noticed this back in 2009. And when she put all the numbers together a much bigger picture emerged. So she gave a talk about what she found at the very first TED women's conference.

And we can't really talk about progress without talking about the one thing that might unravel all of it. And that thing is climate change. So, Paul, in 2012, you gave this very dark TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PAUL GILDING: Let me begin with four words that will come to define this century. RAZ: And your opening line was, like, the earth is full. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILDING: The earth is full. It's full of us and full of stuff, full of our waste, full of our demands. RAZ: Like, you were saying we're kind of in trouble. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILDING: In other words, to keep operating at our current level, we'll need 50 percent more Earth than we've got. RAZ: But now, you know, six years on, things are much better, right? We're doing great, right? GILDING: Not quite. RAZ: OK. (LAUGHTER)GILDING: Look. It's like living on your credit card. When you're living on a credit card, life is good. You know, you can buy the stuff you need. Life is ticking along. And then one day, the bank goes and says, I am sorry, got to pay it back now. And Mother Nature is basically saying now, like, hey, the card is full, time to start paying it back. And we don't want to. RAZ: This is Paul Gilding. He's a writer and an environmental activist. GILDING: And have been trying to convince the world to act on sustainability for 45 years or so, not very successfully. RAZ: So while some of the numbers do tell a story of progress - poverty is down, we're living longer and healthier - Paul says they also tell another story that we've been ignoring, a story about a world that's been growing too fast for too long. And now, he argues, we've reached the limit. GILDING: So the resources that keep us alive, that give us the water we need, the food we need, that make the oxygen that we breathe by processing the pollution, et cetera, et cetera, the capacity of the Earth to support us is past its capacity. RAZ: You know, we've heard from Steven Pinker about all of these amazing developments - global developments - that are irrefutable. I mean, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out from poverty. It seems like a pretty great story. GILDING: It's a great story. The problem is that we've got another three or four billion people who'd like to follow them. And they have every right to do so. The question is physically, can we sustain that world? So what, in a practical sense, that means is that the food supply becomes unstable. We can't produce enough food cheaply enough and go to the right places to feed enough people. And political instability accelerates, and conflict between nations accelerate, trade slows down, and all those things lead to an economic downturn. And then we crash. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILDING: Many of you will be thinking - but surely we can still stop this. If it's that bad, we'll react. RAZ: Here's more from Paul Gilding on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILDING: Let's just think through that idea. Now, we've had 50 years of warnings. We've had science proving the urgency of change. We've had economic analysis pointing out that, not only can we afford it, it's cheaper to act early. And yet the reality is we've done pretty much nothing to change course. We're not even slowing down. Last year on climate, for example, we had the highest global emissions ever. The story on food, on water, on soil, on climate is all much the same. So when does this transition begin? When does this breakdown begin? In my view, it is well underway. We see spiraling debt crises. We see growing inequality. We see money's influence on politics. We see resource-constrained food and oil prices. But we see, mistakenly, each of these issues as individual problems to be solved. In fact, it's the system in the painful process of breaking down - our system of debt-fueled economic growth, of ineffective democracy, of overloading planet Earth - is eating itself alive. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK. So let's say the numbers are going to lead us in one of two directions. Direction A, we say, all right. We need to freeze growth. We need to start doing that now. What do we do? How can we do that? GILDING: Yeah, so for a start, we are not going to be able to convince a population who's been brought up on growth as the pre-existing requirement for quality of life to suddenly stop growing. So what we need to do is to divert growth dramatically and urgently to accelerate the economy rapidly to stop climate change and other issues getting out of control. RAZ: Wait. Sorry, I didn't get that. We need to accelerate the economy to stop climate change? Isn't that - doesn't that make things worse? GILDING: No because to accelerate the economy in the direction of solving climate change, we decelerate it dramatically in terms of the spending and consumption on fossil fuels, for example. So we know we need to wipe out whole industries. Companies in the fossil fuel sector, in oil and coal and gas need to cease to exist. They need to be replaced by other companies that, by the way, create more jobs. We could eliminate fossil fuels from the economy, right, inside 10 years, and it would be a positive economic impact. We're also, by the way, inventing new technology all the time to make it better, right? We've got extraordinary opportunities in artificial intelligence, in solar power, in autonomous vehicle and transport as a service, so we have to think differently about how we consume - doesn't mean we don't consume, doesn't mean we go out and live in caves, doesn't mean we have a horrible quality of life. But it does mean we don't live a life that results in most of our stuff ending up in the oceans and landfill and incineration because that's not a sustainable economy. Then we're going to have to face up to, is that enough? But in the meantime, it will be enough. RAZ: Are you optimistic? GILDING: It's a funny question, which I get asked a lot. And yes, fundamentally, I am. I'm optimistic because I think it's a better strategy for driving change. I'm also optimistic because if I look at history, we tend to do crisis response really well. In my book \"The Great Disruption,\" I talked about imagining being a couple of guys in Amsterdam having coffee on the canal and talking about World War II in 1938, right? So it hasn't started. And. . . RAZ: And you're like, this thing's never going to get off the ground. GILDING: Come on, so you're telling. . . RAZ: Come on. GILDING: . . . Me we're going to kill 60 million people in the conflict? It's going to go on for, like, five years. It's going to cost us. . . RAZ: People would say, oh, Paul. You're just a. . . GILDING: Come on. RAZ: . . . Worrywart. Come on. GILDING: It'll be OK. It'll be OK. RAZ: Yeah. OK. GILDING: Exactly. RAZ: I got you. Right. Fine. But. . . GILDING: So if you'd painted that picture then of World War II, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, of the, you know, invasion of all these countries, of this catastrophe and the Holocaust, et cetera, et cetera, people would say, oh, my God, that's the end of the world. We'll never survive that. RAZ: Yeah. GILDING: And we'll never recover the emotional, political trauma of that process. And look what happened. It was horrible. It was tragic. It was, like, beyond our comprehension how bad it was, but then society moved on. And we went through that process. And we successfully moved into a different era. So the point is it's always hard to imagine these things before they come. RAZ: Yeah. GILDING: It's very hard to prevent them for that reason. And therefore, we wait until the crisis is completely out of control, and it's, like - it's well past the last minute in which you have to respond. And then we react and then we do extraordinary things. And that's the essence of my story that I'm telling. Now, that wouldn't help if this was really hard to fix. But the reality is there is just amazing amounts of possibility as to how we could fix this, so this is not like World War II. World War II was really hard to imagine how the Allies could win at the beginning. This is not hard to imagine how we could win. We just got to decide to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: Paul Gilding.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GILDING: Many of you will be thinking - but surely we can still stop this. If it's that bad, we'll react. RAZ: Here's more from Paul Gilding on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GILDING: Let's just think through that idea. Now, we've had 50 years of warnings. We've had science proving the urgency of change. We've had economic analysis pointing out that, not only can we afford it, it's cheaper to act early. And yet the reality is we've done pretty much nothing to change course. We're not even slowing down. Last year on climate, for example, we had the highest global emissions ever. The story on food, on water, on soil, on climate is all much the same. So when does this transition begin? When does this breakdown begin? In my view, it is well underway. We see spiraling debt crises. We see growing inequality. We see money's influence on politics. We see resource-constrained food and oil prices. But we see, mistakenly, each of these issues as individual problems to be solved. In fact, it's the system in the painful process of breaking down - our system of debt-fueled economic growth, of ineffective democracy, of overloading planet Earth - is eating itself alive. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: OK. So let's say the numbers are going to lead us in one of two directions. Direction A, we say, all right. We need to freeze growth. We need to start doing that now. What do we do? How can we do that? GILDING: Yeah, so for a start, we are not going to be able to convince a population who's been brought up on growth as the pre-existing requirement for quality of life to suddenly stop growing. So what we need to do is to divert growth dramatically and urgently to accelerate the economy rapidly to stop climate change and other issues getting out of control. RAZ: Wait. Sorry, I didn't get that. We need to accelerate the economy to stop climate change? Isn't that - doesn't that make things worse? GILDING: No because to accelerate the economy in the direction of solving climate change, we decelerate it dramatically in terms of the spending and consumption on fossil fuels, for example. So we know we need to wipe out whole industries. Companies in the fossil fuel sector, in oil and coal and gas need to cease to exist. They need to be replaced by other companies that, by the way, create more jobs. We could eliminate fossil fuels from the economy, right, inside 10 years, and it would be a positive economic impact. We're also, by the way, inventing new technology all the time to make it better, right? We've got extraordinary opportunities in artificial intelligence, in solar power, in autonomous vehicle and transport as a service, so we have to think differently about how we consume - doesn't mean we don't consume, doesn't mean we go out and live in caves, doesn't mean we have a horrible quality of life. But it does mean we don't live a life that results in most of our stuff ending up in the oceans and landfill and incineration because that's not a sustainable economy. Then we're going to have to face up to, is that enough? But in the meantime, it will be enough. RAZ: Are you optimistic? GILDING: It's a funny question, which I get asked a lot. And yes, fundamentally, I am. I'm optimistic because I think it's a better strategy for driving change. I'm also optimistic because if I look at history, we tend to do crisis response really well. In my book \"The Great Disruption,\" I talked about imagining being a couple of guys in Amsterdam having coffee on the canal and talking about World War II in 1938, right? So it hasn't started. And. . . RAZ: And you're like, this thing's never going to get off the ground. GILDING: Come on, so you're telling. . . RAZ: Come on. GILDING: . . . Me we're going to kill 60 million people in the conflict? It's going to go on for, like, five years. It's going to cost us. . . RAZ: People would say, oh, Paul. You're just a. . . GILDING: Come on. RAZ: . . . Worrywart. Come on. GILDING: It'll be OK. It'll be OK. RAZ: Yeah. OK. GILDING: Exactly. RAZ: I got you. Right. Fine. But. . . GILDING: So if you'd painted that picture then of World War II, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, of the, you know, invasion of all these countries, of this catastrophe and the Holocaust, et cetera, et cetera, people would say, oh, my God, that's the end of the world. We'll never survive that. RAZ: Yeah. GILDING: And we'll never recover the emotional, political trauma of that process. And look what happened. It was horrible. It was tragic. It was, like, beyond our comprehension how bad it was, but then society moved on. And we went through that process. And we successfully moved into a different era. So the point is it's always hard to imagine these things before they come. RAZ: Yeah. GILDING: It's very hard to prevent them for that reason. And therefore, we wait until the crisis is completely out of control, and it's, like - it's well past the last minute in which you have to respond. And then we react and then we do extraordinary things. And that's the essence of my story that I'm telling. Now, that wouldn't help if this was really hard to fix. But the reality is there is just amazing amounts of possibility as to how we could fix this, so this is not like World War II. World War II was really hard to imagine how the Allies could win at the beginning. This is not hard to imagine how we could win. We just got to decide to do it.

S. and Mexico have tentatively agreed to a trade deal. And in today's announcement, President Trump wanted to make one thing clear. This new deal will not be called NAFTA, the old North American Free Trade Agreement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This has to do - they used to call it NAFTA. We're going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. We'll get rid of the name NAFTA. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by NAFTA. CHANG: All right, NPR's John Ydstie joins us now to talk about this new deal. Hey, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So President Trump touted this deal, this morning when talking to the Mexican president on the phone, as a great accomplishment. Can you just put that into perspective for us? Is this a great accomplishment? YDSTIE: Well, it's a step toward the renegotiation that the president promised during the campaign. But there's still a long way to go. This is a tentative agreement only with Mexico. And there's another critical party in the NAFTA agreement - Canada. CHANG: Right. YDSTIE: Canadian officials today signaled they're ready to come back to the negotiating table. They've been sitting on the sidelines for some time. In fact, Canada's foreign minister cut short a trip to Europe and is flying to Washington today. But she said she'll only sign a deal that is good for Canada. CHANG: And the president said, in his appearance this morning, that negotiations with Canada will start shortly. But then in the very next breath, he threatened Canada. Let's take a listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I think with Canada, frankly, the easiest thing we can do is to tariff their cars coming in. It's a tremendous amount of money. And it's a very simple negotiation. It could end in one day, and we'd take in a lot of money the following day. But I think we'll give them a chance to probably have a separate deal. We could have a separate deal, or we could put it into this deal. CHANG: OK, so let me get this straight. We could end up with having two separate agreements - one with Mexico, one with Canada - instead of a North American Agreement. Is that how this is going to work? YDSTIE: Probably not. The president's strategy here appears to be flawed. The Congress gives a president the authority to negotiate trade deals. In the case of NAFTA, it's a three-country agreement. And all three parties need to be onboard to renew it. Taking this deal with Mexico to Congress separately would take a long, long time. Now, despite the president's bluster, the administration would actually like to get official notice to Congress of a deal that includes Canada by the end of this week. Under any fast-track deal, there needs to be a 90-day waiting period, so Congress has time to consider the trade deal before it's signed by the leaders of each government. Threatening Canada with car tariffs, the way the president did today, may or may not speed things up. CHANG: And the rush has to do with Mexico getting a new president on December 1, right? YDSTIE: Yeah, that's right. Mexico has elected a new president. And while his representatives have been involved to some extent on the Mexican side, it's possible he could ultimately object to some provision in the deal. And it could all unravel when he takes office. And that's a concern. CHANG: So give us a sense of what is in this agreement between the U. S. and Mexico. YDSTIE: Well, among the most important provisions are changes in rules governing automobile manufacturing. The amount of North American-made parts that cars have to have to cross borders duty-free would rise to 75 percent under this deal. That's up from 62. 5 percent now. Another change would require higher wages for autoworkers in Mexico, and a large number of cars made in Mexico would have to be built in factories where workers earn at least $16 an hour. But the deal also affects trade in other areas - from chemicals to textiles. It contains new rules for digital technology and intellectual property. The stock market rose on the news today. But, again, its progress towards a new trade regime in North America but still a long way to go. CHANG: NPR's John Ydstie, thank you very much. YDSTIE: You're welcome. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The U.

Here he is last year in Phoenix. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Personally I don't think we can make a deal because we have been so badly taken advantage of. They have made such great deals, both of the countries but in particular Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal. So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK? Probably. GREENE: Well, now it sounds like NAFTA may have a future. Today the White House announced that the United States has reached a tentative deal with Mexico on an updated version of NAFTA which the president is now calling the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. Negotiators from the two countries have been holed up for weeks trying to hammer out a deal with Canada sitting on the sidelines. The president is announcing this handshake agreement with Mexico in the Oval Office this morning. And NPR's Scott Horsley joins us from the White House. Hi there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, David. GREENE: Good to have you. So I thought this was the worst deal ever made, according to President Trump. What has changed this? HORSLEY: Well, we're still waiting to find out a lot of the details. But one big push from the Trump administration has to do with cars and trucks. Right now vehicles produced anywhere in North America can be sold in the U. S. duty-free if they have just two-thirds or a little less than two-thirds North American content. Trump wants to boost that to 75 percent. And he also wants to require that a big chunk of the vehicles be made in high-wage factories, so likely the U. S. and Canada. Mexico is apparently willing to go along with that. This could lead to more production in this country, but it's not clear. Right now, cars imported from outside North America face a relatively low tariff unlike trucks, which face a big, stiff tariff. So if this new agreement were to drive up the cost of North American production, it could put domestic manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. So we shall see. Of course Trump has threatened to impose a much stiffer tariff on imported cars, so it's kind of a moving target. GREENE: OK, so nothing certain yet, although one thing that seems certain is NAFTA has always been a three-way deal. Canada not at the table during this round of talks. They've even been cut out of the new name that Trump wants, the U. S. -Mexico trade deal. So what happens to our northern neighbor? HORSLEY: Well, Trump said he still wants to include Canada, but they've not been taking part. They have been monitoring these talks. The idea was if the U. S. and Mexico could get their deal worked out, then maybe Canada would rejoin the negotiations. Interestingly, though, Canada's foreign minister is off in Europe this week and doesn't seem to be any - be in any rush to come back to Washington. You know, Mexico has approached these talks in sort of a different way. They take seriously President Trump's threat to pull out of NAFTA, and they are worried about being left with no trade deal with the United States. So they're kind of willing to negotiate. Canada takes that threat less seriously. They would just as soon stick with the existing NAFTA. And they think that's a possibility. GREENE: So what are the remaining sticking points here? HORSLEY: One bone of contention has been the U. S. insistence on a sunset provision that would end the deal every five years unless it was explicitly renewed. Canada and Mexico don't like that. A lot of Trump's Republican allies don't like that. It's not clear whether the U. S. dropped that demand or Mexico conceded. Another of course sticking point has been carveouts in NAFTA for Canadian dairy, for example. So those could be bones of contention as well. GREENE: So if indeed this is an agreement that the president is announcing today that's going to go forward, I mean, is there a sense for the timing and when it could actually be a real thing? HORSLEY: He's calling this an understanding. So we'll see how long it takes to reduce it to writing. It - there has been a push to get a deal done before the new Mexican president is sworn in on December 1. It seems unlikely they can meet that target because any deal has to be vetted by the U. S. Congress, and that takes time. More likely the new agreement will be signed by a new Mexican president and also perhaps ratified by a new American Congress. And depending on what happens in November, that new Congress could look different than the House and Senate we have right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: I said from the very beginning - no NAFTA deal is better than a bad NAFTA deal. MARTIN: We've got Christophe Bondy on the line with us. He was senior counsel in Canada's negotiations with the EU over a trade deal. And he joins us from the BBC in London. Mr. Bondy, thanks for being here. CHRISTOPHE BONDY: Thanks very much. MARTIN: So those are bold words from the Canadian prime minister. The U. S. is Canada's largest trading partner. I mean, can Canada afford not to sign some kind of revised NAFTA agreement? BONDY: Well, I think Canada is going to continue its longstanding efforts to have a good update to the NAFTA. One knows that President Trump only has congressional authority to do a three-way deal. And the deadline of Friday really relates to his efforts to get this deal over the line in time to have congressional approval before the midterms so that he can declare a win. I think Canada's negotiators are very experienced. They're level-headed and will agree to the deal if it's in Canada's interests. If not, the discussions will continue, and the original NAFTA stays in place. Don't forget - this is just a preliminary agreement in principle on some of the sticking points. So I think the Canadian negotiators may see this as an opportunity to deal with some of the more difficult issues. MARTIN: And I want to talk about those, but you do point out something important here - that Canada does have some leverage even though President Trump has established this deadline of Friday so he can get this through before there's new leadership in Mexico. He actually doesn't have the authority to negotiate two bilateral deals. That would be different. Congress gave him the authority to negotiate a deal that would include Canada and Mexico. So you feel like Canada has some leverage in the moment? BONDY: Well, the other thing is that Canada is the U. S. 's single biggest foreign export partner. For 35 U. S. states, Canada is their single biggest foreign export market. Millions of U. S. jobs depend upon three-way trade between Canada, Mexico and the United States. The automotive industry, in particular, is deeply integrated. And so to, you know, try to sort of throw a spanner in that kind of works would be very economically damaging for the United States. But that's not what we're focusing on here. I'm sure that the negotiators are looking to work to mutual advantage. And they're thinking about some of the negative impacts that may flow from some of the more protectionist rules that have been proposed. So one of the interesting questions is, if you increase the amount of auto parts content - for example, the North American content rule - what impact will that have on the total sales of North American cars? MARTIN: We should just say that this is a tenant of the U. S. -Mexico proposal that President Trump has agreed to that would require that a certain percentage of the parts of any car be - come, originate from North America. BONDY: Yeah. So I think one has to just analyze that and see, does it come to the right outcome? I mean, Canada is a high-wage economy, so perhaps it's less relevant for us. It's like the steel and aluminum tariffs that have been imposed that end up acting as a tax to American producers, to American consumers, and end up leading to countervailing tariffs, which are damaging to both economies. So I think that we're trying to seek - the negotiators will be trying to seek a rules-based approach, an update that makes sense for everyone. MARTIN: What concession would Canada make? BONDY: I don't know. I'm not part of the negotiations right now. I think they're going to be looking at the deal that's on the table and considering whether they can agree to the elements - at least these issues in principle - that U. S. and Mexico have been discussing. Don't forget - it's not unusual in a multiparty negotiation to have sideline discussions. Canada has been following those closely and is coming to the table with an understanding of what's being discussed. But I'm sure that the outcome, if it's in everyone's interest, will be a positive one. MARTIN: Christophe Bondy was lead counsel to Canada in multiple NAFTA arbitrations. He now practices law with Cooley LLP. He joined us from the studios of the BBC in London. Thanks so much for your time this morning. We appreciate it. BONDY: Thank you.

Mexico is in. Today, we find out if Canada is in or out. The administration negotiated some updates to NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement from the '90s. So how much sense does the new deal make? Austan Goolsbee was chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and he's on the line. Welcome back to the program. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Hi, Steve. Thanks for having me. INSKEEP: Glad you're with us. And I want to play you some sound of Peter Navarro. He's a presidential economic adviser. He was on the program the other day. And he pointed out that this deal with Mexico - the part we know about, anyway - would assure more North American parts in cars that are assembled in multiple countries, digital trade provisions, a lot more. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)PETER NAVARRO: This is a 25-year-old agreement, so it needed things like protections for digital trade, e-commerce, things like that, so that's in there. For me, Steve, the guts of this really is the rules of origin requirements, which go up to 75 percent. INSKEEP: That's the percentage of a car that has to be made in North America to qualify for free trade across borders. What's wrong with that? GOOLSBEE: Oh, I don't think there's much wrong with the - updating the digital goods treatment. There's a couple of things on environmental that they agreed on, many of which it looked like they kind of just took from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the president pulled the U. S. out of, but was an agreement that both Canada and Mexico signed onto. So there was a natural kind of a portfolio of things that they could choose to update NAFTA with. I guess my overriding impression is relief. This is all they - this was the only reason we were about to declare a trade war with our two biggest export markets and allies? These are small - it's pretty insignificant things. And I don't know if it's like, you know, you're going to do as I say or I'm going to smash every window in this house and break down the door. Fine; we can get the 2 percent milk. You know. . . INSKEEP: (Laughter). GOOLSBEE: We don't have to get 1 percent. INSKEEP: OK, so wait a minute. There's a couple things to follow up on there. First, you're saying that these are provisions that were similar to what was in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included not only Canada and Mexico, but a bunch of other nations facing the Pacific. Is this deal actually a worse deal than the TPP, which the president dumped? GOOLSBEE: Oh, for sure, a hundred percent worse. The thing is that the TPP - there were provisions that people argued about, but nobody can argue with the fact that it cut tariffs on 18,000 different products, industries across the gamut of the U. S. And what we're talking about to modify NAFTA is really almost entirely about just one sector and just one minor adjustment. So I don't think there's anything especially wrong with this. It's just hard to understand what - if this were sufficient, how was the TPP not something - why did the president say that was the worst negotiated deal in history or whatever he said if you were willing to settle for what Mexico has said here? I think anything that prevents us from having a trade war is good. Every day without a trade war is a good day for America. INSKEEP: Is it possible the president wants to make a lot of noise about trade but doesn't actually want to change that much - which in some ways would be disturbing, but also might be reassuring? This is actually not that big a change. GOOLSBEE: Yeah, maybe. This certainly follows on the heels of - if you remember some months ago, the president announced that they were renegotiating the Korea Free Trade Agreement. And they announced a couple of minor tweaks, which people at the time said, well, that's - doesn't seem that big, and they said, and is Congress going to pass that? And we kind of never heard from it again. And it served mostly as a way to get us off of the impending trade war with our ally. If that's what's happening in North America, then it's fine. We should say, hey, good job, Mr. President. You got us an adjustment of a small part of one sector within NAFTA and updated a couple things, and it's great. If this is a sign, however, that the United States is going to kind of systematically threaten a massive escalation of trade war, it's taking a risk that I think maybe - it's taking a big risk and maybe not taking into account the damage that would occur if something went wrong. INSKEEP: In a sentence or so, if Canada - if you feel that this is a really rather minor adjustment to NAFTA, is - should Canada just go along with it, say, yeah, sure, fine? GOOLSBEE: I think Canada - if - look; I'm not - there are many people far more expert about what the Canadian perspective is, but I think they would look at what Mexico agreed to. I don't think it would be that hard for them to say, yeah, that seems fine. INSKEEP: I got to stop you there. We're out of time. GOOLSBEE: Yeah. INSKEEP: But I'll be happy to continue this discussion another time. I'm sure other people will as well. Austan Goolsbee chaired President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. He's now at the University of Chicago. Thanks. GOOLSBEE: Thanks, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Today is the deadline set by the Trump administration to send Congress a new North American trade deal.

It's told Congress the U. S. will sign a revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, if Canada is willing. The U. S. and Canada continue trade negotiations next week. We're joined now by Gordon Ritchie, former Canadian ambassador for trade negotiations. Mr. Ambassador, thanks so much for being with us. GORDON RITCHIE: My pleasure, and Gordon will be just fine. SIMON: All right. Well, thank you, Gordon, then. And what do you see as the major sticking points between the U. S. and Canada right now? RITCHIE: Well, the main sticking point right now is Mr. Trump's determination to be able to impose his will on Canada and brag about it to his electorate. I caught the other night - I guess it was last night - of a speech he gave. And frankly, like most Canadians, I was just shocked at the vitriol. He talked about how those mean Canadians have these enormous trade barriers against imports from the United States, which are depriving Americans of markets in this country. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. We're by far the biggest and best market for American goods and services. We do $2 billion worth of trade every single day. More than 99 percent of that trade comes in duty-free - 99 percent. And in the remainder, the amounts are small, and the balance - the trade balance is in favor of the United States. So frankly, when you have somebody charging at you, saying he wants you to stop beating your horse, and you say, well, I'm not beating my horse - I don't even have a horse - it's a little hard to negotiate. SIMON: But let me ask - I mean, both President Trump and, for that matter, Prime Minister Trudeau operate within democratic systems, and that means politics. And isn't it just a fact of life that politicians might say one thing, domestically, to fire up their supporters but reach the negotiating table and wind up being reasonable, from your point of view? RITCHIE: Well, of course. That's what negotiations are really all about. And I went through this back in the days of Ronald Reagan and Jim Baker. And Jim Baker was as tough a negotiator as they come. Yes, of course. But the difference is that we have here - I don't know quite how to put it - a president who, in his public utterances, is completely disconnected from the truth. And that makes it very hard for his negotiators to deal with because he's saying to them, I don't care how you do it. Bring back a head on a platter. And that's not going to happen. SIMON: Yeah. RITCHIE: (Laughter) It's just not going to happen. SIMON: Well - but in the end, isn't some kind of an agreement in the best interests of Canada, whether - whatever their opinion of President Trump and his leadership might be? RITCHIE: Oh, no, let's be absolutely clear. The obstacle to agreement is not on the Canadian side. The Canadians are perfectly interested in having an agreement to modernize the existing arrangements. And the Canadians are prepared to show flexibility on the crucial issues - quite a lot of flexibility. That's not the problem. The problem is that the American negotiators do not have authority to accept that agreement. SIMON: I guess what you're suggesting is that there's - whatever the American negotiators think they have negotiated, it could be undercut by President Trump at any moment. RITCHIE: Well, that's certainly the case. Yesterday, for example, everything was thrown into a bit of a scramble when President Trump's remarks became known in which he said that he was determined not to give an inch to Canada on anything and that if Canada didn't come around, he would slap more punitive tariffs on. The sad thing is it's as if he and his audience don't realize that putting on tariffs penalizes American consumers and producers. (Laughter) It's bizarre.

Our colleague Marilyn Geewax retired from her post as an NPR business editor, and then she attended her 45th high school reunion in the Youngstown, Ohio, area. It's a region where many old-style, middle-class jobs have disappeared, and that is now reflected in the lives of many retirees. Here's what Marilyn found at the reunion. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: The 1973 class of Memorial High School met at a nice restaurant in one of Youngstown's suburbs seven miles from the hard luck area where our high school stands. The classmates who showed up were, by and large, those who had gone to college and could afford the dinner - $45 a person, $90 a couple, plush your drinks. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Wait. There's Mary. Oh, my God. Good to see you. GEEWAX: I caught up with friends, especially the ones who, like me, had moved away for degrees and jobs. I've lived in Ohio, New York, Georgia, Massachusetts, Washington, D. C. , and now back to Georgia. My classmate, Pete Nicolaou, he was different. He stayed close to home, but he wasn't going to the class reunion, so I stopped by his house to see how he was adjusting to retirement. It's just a few miles from our high school in a rural area. He has woods in the backyard and a fish-stocked pond in the front. PETE NICOLAOU: We cleared all the land that you see cleared. (Laughter) To do it now - I wouldn't be able to do it. GEEWAX: He loves living in the country. NICOLAOU: We got coyotes. We got bears. GEEWAX: We went inside the house. The living room walls are decorated with mounted deer heads. We sat at the kitchen table and flipped through our old yearbook. In high school, I was a nerd focused on getting into Ohio State. Pete was a bit of a smart aleck but in a cool way. NICOLAOU: Everybody's worried about me cussing and everything else. I thought I. . . GEEWAX: You are, Pete. . . NICOLAOU: I could have a civil tongue - yeah, me. GEEWAX: . . . Quite capable (laughter) of a civilized conversation. Our high school sat on a hilltop. Behind it, the Earth sloped away down to the valley where the Youngstown Sheet and Tube mill stretched out for miles. Our school, our town, the air we breathe, they were inseparable from those blast furnaces. NICOLAOU: When there was smoke coming out of that valley, people were being fed, and kids were being sent to school. GEEWAX: At the time, I was the one moving in a riskier direction by trying to be a writer, a hit-or-miss job that may not provide a pension. Pete made what seemed like the more secure choice. NICOLAOU: Go to the steel mills. That's my - that was my vision, to go work and follow my father. (SOUNDBITE OF STEEL MILL MACHINERY)GEEWAX: That's the sound of the Sheet and Tube mill captured in an old government documentary film. It's exactly the kind of noise that greeted Pete when he started working there that summer of 1973. NICOLAOU: Didn't know what I was walking into - I've never been in the - where there was cranes going overhead and flames and heat. GEEWAX: The job was dangerous but weirdly satisfying. NICOLAOU: In the steel mill, I was ready to retire there. I was set. You felt good. You come out dirty (laughter) but, I mean, you did a good day's work, and you felt good about it. GEEWAX: Then came what everyone here calls Black Monday, September 19, 1977. That was the day the Youngstown Sheet and Tube announced it was shutting down. Five thousand people lost their job on that day, including Pete. NICOLAOU: They walked in and told us you're done. They didn't give us no two-week notice. No - you didn't see nothing about it. They just come and told us goodbye. GEEWAX: And here's where our life stories really start to diverge. I heard the news on the radio. I was in my black Plymouth Duster driving back to Ohio State after finishing up an internship at the Dayton newspaper. I called the Dayton editor and asked if I should go cover the steel mill shut down. He said, yes. I got a front-page story and a $50 check for it. I made money on my hometown's calamity. I'd go on to become a business news journalist. These days, I'm still editing and teaching part time. White-collar retirees can pad savings by doing sit-down jobs. As for Pete, after Black Monday, he worked in a van plant until that shut down, too, then an auto plant until he had to retire at 56 because of health problems. NICOLAOU: I got a staph infection after one of my surgeries, and that's what ended me, and it ate my heart - ate the valve off my heart. And they had to take my knee back out again. GEEWAX: Pete walks with a cane. He's also survived a cancer. He says his doctors tell him it's likely linked to asbestos in the mill. His wife works cleaning houses to help pay the bills. Still, Pete and his wife live a peaceful life. He's glad he stayed. NICOLAOU: And I hunted and fished all I wanted around here. I did what I wanted to do, and I had a wife that supported me, and she understood it. GEEWAX: So Pete is content, but here's what bothers me - seeing so many older Americans who worked hard like Pete facing mounting medical bills. Lawmakers are talking about raising the Social Security retirement age by two or three years. That could hit people like Pete, people who worked so hard their bodies won't let them continue earning into their late '50s. It's funny how many of us knew people, relatives, that had a missing finger or missing - I had a - my father's cousin was missing his leg. A couple of guys from our church died in the mill. I mean, it was a tough life. It was. . . NICOLAOU: But it was a good life that we'll never see again. GEEWAX: Pete doesn't want anyone feeling sorry for him, and I respect that. As for me, when the reunion ended, I flew away, like always. INSKEEP: Former NPR business editor Marilyn Geewax. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  There is a big divide between older Americans who are ready for retirement and those who don't quite have the money. Our colleague Marilyn Geewax retired from her post as an NPR business editor, and then she attended her 45th high school reunion in the Youngstown, Ohio, area. It's a region where many old-style, middle-class jobs have disappeared, and that is now reflected in the lives of many retirees. Here's what Marilyn found at the reunion. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: The 1973 class of Memorial High School met at a nice restaurant in one of Youngstown's suburbs seven miles from the hard luck area where our high school stands. The classmates who showed up were, by and large, those who had gone to college and could afford the dinner - $45 a person, $90 a couple, plush your drinks. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Wait. There's Mary. Oh, my God. Good to see you. GEEWAX: I caught up with friends, especially the ones who, like me, had moved away for degrees and jobs. I've lived in Ohio, New York, Georgia, Massachusetts, Washington, D. C. , and now back to Georgia. My classmate, Pete Nicolaou, he was different. He stayed close to home, but he wasn't going to the class reunion, so I stopped by his house to see how he was adjusting to retirement. It's just a few miles from our high school in a rural area.

Employment is also running high. They have been for years - the very conditions that tend to push up wages. So why isn't that happening? David Wessel is here to talk with us about that. He is at the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Welcome back, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good to talk to you, Steve. INSKEEP: A couple of years ago, it seemed that wages were finally climbing. What's happened since? WESSEL: Well, I think a good yardstick is to look at what happens to the wages of people who work full time year-round. And according to the Census Bureau, the typical man earns about $54,000 a year. The typical woman earns about $43,000 a year. Adjusted for inflation, the typical man who works full time is earning less today than his counterpart did in 1988. INSKEEP: Wow. WESSEL: I think that's extraordinary. Now, more recently, as you point out, wages have begun to go up, but they haven't gone up much more than inflation. It depends month to month what's happening. So adjusted for inflation, wages are basically flat, even though we have unemployment at an 18-year low. INSKEEP: Why would that be? WESSEL: Well, that's a good question. It's one that economists in academia all the way up to the chairman of the Federal Reserve have been asking recently, and I think there are a couple of possible explanations. One is that the unemployment rate is misleading. There are a lot of workers on the sidelines of the economy, and they are being pulled in by the recovery. Another is that productivity has been growing very slowly. Rising productivity growth is the way that employers can afford to raise wages and maintain profits, so you would expect wages to be growing sluggishly when productivity growth is low. But in many ways, I think what's going on is that workers simply have less bargaining power today than they once did. Unions are weaker. There's an explosion of temp agencies and outsourcing and the gig economy. And in lots of communities across the country, very few employers dominate the labor market, so that workers have no choice but to work for them. In some communities, for instance, it's the hospital. So that means employers aren't competing for workers by raising wages, and that depresses them. INSKEEP: Anand Giridharadas, a writer who was on the program the other day, put out a book about inequities in the economy and suggested that, essentially, productivity is going up but that the economy has changed in ways that people at the top are able to hold on to more and more and more of those gains and not share. WESSEL: I think that's true. Productivity is growing. It's just growing at a disappointingly slow pace. But it's true that the benefits of the growing economy are being increasingly claimed by people at the top. INSKEEP: So what does this mean if you're Jerome Powell running the Federal Reserve or any number of the other people who are in positions of power and are supposed to influence the economy? WESSEL: Well, what they refer to at the Fed as the wage puzzle is really central to their decision-making on interest rates today. Usually, history tells us that when an unemployment rate goes way, way down, wages start to go up, and then businesses start to raise prices and you have more inflation. But that relationship isn't holding now. So the Fed has to decide is something really different in the economy? Is this a permanent change? Or are wage increases just around the corner? In which case, they should be raising rates more rapidly than they are. INSKEEP: Is this wage stagnation the same for every kind of person? WESSEL: No, of course not. We're talking about averages. Wages actually are going up a little faster at the bottom than they are for people at the middle. Yes, the best-paid people - CEOs, lawyers at big law firms, the best ballplayers - they're doing very well. But when we look at the data, it turns out that things like raising the minimum wage, which has happened in 18 states this year, that's beginning to lift the wages of the least-paid people in the economy a little more than the typical worker at the middle.

They're talking about the economic health of emerging markets around the world. And the diagnosis does not look great.

He says there's a variety of issues confronting these countries. Turkey's president, for instance, has tied up politics with monetary policy. And what's worse, the U. S. has doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum. In Argentina, meanwhile, investors are spooked by skyrocketing inflation. But one major source of their currency troubles comes not from these countries at all. It rests in the U. S. PRASAD: The fact that interest rates have been rising in the U. S. causes investors around the world to rethink the proposition of taking risks by investing in emerging markets in order to get higher yield. DWYER: The U. S. central bank has raised interest rates twice already this year. Those higher interest rates help boost the value of the U. S. dollar and make it more pricey for countries to pay back their loans. That's really bad news for countries like Argentina and Turkey which have borrowed a whole lot of American dollars. JOSEPH GAGNON: So you get a double whammy, higher interest rates and a higher dollar, making it harder to pay back. And that's what scares investors. DWYER: That's Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He has worked in the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department. And he knows the value of a central bank getting to set its own monetary policies. GAGNON: But when Argentina borrows in dollars, they have no control over those interest rates. And they aren't set by the Argentine central bank for the Argentine economy. They're set by the U. S. central bank for the U. S. economy. So it may not be appropriate for Argentina. DWYER: But even if a country did not do much of its borrowing in dollars, it can still get stained with the same brush. Ask India or South Africa. They have stumbled into some of the same economic troubles as their emerging market peers despite avoiding many of the missteps in borrowing. Eswar Prasad again. PRASAD: The sense of concern about the rest of the world is beginning to spread. DWYER: Spread - in other words, like a contagion. But unlike some contagions, Gagnon does not expect this to spread too far to other countries. GAGNON: So many emerging markets are in better shape than they were 20 years ago.

And while the unemployment rate didn't change from the current 3. 9 percent, the number many people were really focused on is wage growth. Today's report shows that wages grew in August, increasing 2. 9 percent over August of last year. Many economists are concerned that wages are not growing as fast as they should be. And in response to that, the White House this week came out with a different calculation for wage growth, one that gives a rosier number than the Labor Department's official figure. To talk more about this, we're joined by Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who focuses on wages. Thanks for being here in the studio. ELISE GOULD: Thanks for inviting me. SHAPIRO: So without getting into too much jargon, explain the difference between the new way that the White House wants to calculate wages and the way that most economists, including the Labor Department, have been evaluating this. GOULD: Sure. And to start out, I'd say that there are many different ways that you might look at wages. There's many different surveys that look at wages. The 2. 9 percent, as you said, comes from the Labor Department report today. And that's looking at all private sector workers. Year over year, what has happened to wage growth? And that's nominal wage growth also, so not real. We think about real or inflation-adjusted wage growth, we're talking about how much more purchasing power people's wages have. SHAPIRO: But what's the White House doing that's different here? What change is the White House making to get a better number? GOULD: So they're trying to change the metric. And they're doing a few key things. One of the things is they're looking at compensation - so nonwage benefits, things like health insurance. They're looking at paid leave. They're trying to say, OK, wages are one thing, but there's other benefits that workers may be getting, and maybe we should take that into account. SHAPIRO: So if somebody's getting the same paycheck but they're getting an extra week's vacation each year, that would be a higher number in this White House calculation than the ordinary Bureau of Labor Statistics calculation. GOULD: Exactly, but to know it would also have been a higher number last year or the year before. So one of the things that the White House is doing is they're putting out a new number for this year without really putting that back in time to see, OK, now we need to sort of change the benchmark. SHAPIRO: So that's a real apples-to-oranges comparison then. GOULD: Right. It's sort of like moving the chains and the goalposts in the same direction at the same time. And it doesn't give you a better picture of how things are today. SHAPIRO: What is the appropriate level of wage growth if there is such a thing? GOULD: Well, when we think of in a growing economy, the Fed has a target inflation rate, and that's 2 percent. We also want to look at what's happening with workers becoming more productive over time - so how much more they're producing. And that has to do with technology and investments in education and lots of different things. And that is trending. The potential is around 1. 5. We put those two together, then we should be looking at something like 3. 5 percent or even higher. SHAPIRO: So that makes the 2. 9 percent number we saw today look a lot worse relatively speaking. GOULD: Yes, although 2. 9 percent honestly is better than we've been seeing. SHAPIRO: Sure. GOULD: So it is - there is some optimism with that number. Hopefully it moves up even faster. But the problem is that workers just don't have the kind of leverage that they've had in the past to be able to go to their employer and ask for wage increases. We've seen a decline, a long-term decline in collective bargaining, erosion of the minimum wage. We've also seen employers taking on practices that keep these workers from having better outside options - so things like having to sign noncompetes or nonpoaching clauses. And so workers can't more easily go out and try to get other outside options to bid up their wages. SHAPIRO: That one top-line number, 2. 9 percent wage growth compared to last year, lumps together a lot of different kinds of people and a lot of different kinds of workers. When you pick it apart, who are the winners and losers? Who's doing better? Who's doing worse? GOULD: In general, we're still seeing people at the top doing better than people at the middle. That's growing inequality. Those at the top are having the biggest gains. What you're also seeing over the last few years is some gains at the very bottom. So those workers, those low-wage workers at the 10th, 20th percentile - we're actually seeing some meaningful rises in their wages. And I think some of that is attributed to the growing economy, and some of it is attributed to the fact that we've seen a number of state-level minimum wage increases that have raised pay for those workers. The ones that are getting lost are those ones in the middle. We're talking about hourly wages around $20. Annual that's, you know, in the $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 range. You're talking about teachers, manufacturing workers. They're seeing very little wage growth. SHAPIRO: Elise Gould is with the Economic Policy Institute. Thanks for joining us. GOULD: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  The latest jobs report came out today. And while the unemployment rate didn't change from the current 3. 9 percent, the number many people were really focused on is wage growth. Today's report shows that wages grew in August, increasing 2. 9 percent over August of last year. Many economists are concerned that wages are not growing as fast as they should be. And in response to that, the White House this week came out with a different calculation for wage growth, one that gives a rosier number than the Labor Department's official figure. To talk more about this, we're joined by Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who focuses on wages. Thanks for being here in the studio. ELISE GOULD: Thanks for inviting me. SHAPIRO: So without getting into too much jargon, explain the difference between the new way that the White House wants to calculate wages and the way that most economists, including the Labor Department, have been evaluating this. GOULD: Sure. And to start out, I'd say that there are many different ways that you might look at wages. There's many different surveys that look at wages. The 2. 9 percent, as you said, comes from the Labor Department report today. And that's looking at all private sector workers. Year over year, what has happened to wage growth? And that's nominal wage growth also, so not real. We think about real or inflation-adjusted wage growth, we're talking about how much more purchasing power people's wages have. SHAPIRO: But what's the White House doing that's different here? What change is the White House making to get a better number? GOULD: So they're trying to change the metric. And they're doing a few key things. One of the things is they're looking at compensation - so nonwage benefits, things like health insurance. They're looking at paid leave. They're trying to say, OK, wages are one thing, but there's other benefits that workers may be getting, and maybe we should take that into account. SHAPIRO: So if somebody's getting the same paycheck but they're getting an extra week's vacation each year, that would be a higher number in this White House calculation than the ordinary Bureau of Labor Statistics calculation. GOULD: Exactly, but to know it would also have been a higher number last year or the year before. So one of the things that the White House is doing is they're putting out a new number for this year without really putting that back in time to see, OK, now we need to sort of change the benchmark.

President Obama addressed campaign rallies last weekend, reminding audiences of the economic growth that started early in his term and has continued ever since. Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, offered a different view yesterday at a White House briefing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN HASSETT: I can promise you that economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump and that a whole bunch of data items started heading north. INSKEEP: Our source for reliable data is NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Is there a case that something suddenly got a lot better in the economy around November 2016? HORSLEY: Well, that's certainly the case that White House economist Kevin Hassett was trying to make yesterday. If you sketch a graph of a lot of economic indicators, what you see is a pretty straight line stretching back into the Obama years. You've seen a steady march upward in the total number of jobs, a steady march downward in the unemployment rate, but Hassett was trying to show some different graphs where you show a turnaround beginning right around November 2016 when Donald Trump was elected. He looks at things like business investment, for example, trying to make the point that not only is the U. S. economy doing well but that President Trump deserves the credit for that. INSKEEP: OK. But when we hear you giving economic statistics since the start of the Trump administration, Scott, I consistently hear a pattern that the stats are pretty good but actually in many cases not quite as good as the last of Obama's years. HORSLEY: For example, if you look at overall job growth, 3. 6 million jobs have been added in the U. S. in the 19 months that Donald Trump's been in office. That's just shy of the 3. 9 million jobs that were added in the comparable period at the end of the Obama administration. But here's something interesting, Steve. The makeup of those jobs has shifted just a little bit. We are now seeing faster growth in industries such as manufacturing, construction, oil drilling, other resource extraction industries, and somewhat slower job growth in the service industries, which is everything else. And the political geography could be interesting here because those, what the Labor Department refers to as goods-producing jobs, tend to be concentrated in more rural and suburban and more Republican parts of the country, the kind of areas where Donald Trump did well in 2016. So that could be a lifeline for the GOP in the midterm elections in November. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about the politics here because 70 percent of people in a Quinnipiac poll rate the economy as good or excellent, and that is happening on President Trump's watch. The president tends to get blamed. The president tends to get credit. He's the president. He gets credit. Seventy percent say the economy is good or excellent, yet the president's approval rating, his job approval rating - below 40 percent in that and some other surveys. What's happening? HORSLEY: Well, it may be that people are not giving President Trump credit for that positive economy, or it may simply be that however they feel about the economy, it's trumped by other things they think about the president. If you look back to 2014, which was one of the strongest years for growth during the Obama administration, you still saw Democrats get a whuppin' (ph) in the midterm elections. So it's not - it's often the economy, stupid but not always just the economy. INSKEEP: A lot of people still struggling out there perhaps. Scott, thanks very much, appreciate it.

Apple has its biggest hardware event of the year later today. This is when they unveil all these new devices - always a whole lot of anticipation. Of course, before Apple was a trillion-dollar company, before its phones and laptops came to dominate the tech industry, it was just another California startup. And now one of the first products the company ever made is about to hit the auction block. New Hampshire Public Radio's Todd Bookman reports on a very valuable Apple-1 computer. TODD BOOKMAN, BYLINE: Looking at an Apple-1 is kind of like looking at the Rosetta Stone. You don't totally understand what you're seeing, but you sense its significance. COREY COHEN: The Apple-1 didn't come with a keyboard. It didn't come with a monitor or anything like that. BOOKMAN: This is Corey Cohen. He's known nationally as the guy when it comes to Apple-1 restorations. COHEN: It really was just the board, but the board itself was really the first you could only buy assembled computer. BOOKMAN: In front of him is one of the 200 original Apple-1 circuit boards. It was built in 1976 and retailed for $666. 66. Don't picture a normal computer. This is just the guts, the brain, a thin green rectangle with chips and capacitors and microprocessors soldered on in neat rows. With this powerful technology, you could, well. . . COHEN: Write small programs, play a couple of video games that were kind of text-based, you know, interactive fiction. And that's pretty much it. BOOKMAN: Home computers back then weren't for the masses. They were for hobbyists and folks who liked to tinker. This Apple-1 is unique because it hasn't been modified and the thing still actually works. Cohen Has it rigged up to a vintage keyboard and small black-and-white monitor. COHEN: So this is your boot-up screen. There's not much to it. It's just kind of flashing all the empty characters. So we will clear the screen. We'll reset. It's like watching grass grow. BOOKMAN: The auction on September 25 will likely be more exciting. Bobby Livingston, who helps run New Hampshire-based RR Auction, says they can trace this Apple-1's origins. BOBBY LIVINGSTON: This particular board was purchased from the original owner for $300 in 1976. I think the original guy only had it for about three months. He was a mainframe guy, he said. He didn't really want to mess with it, so he sold it to our client, who's had it since 1976. BOOKMAN: The seller is remaining anonymous. He or she stands to make a lot of money off that purchase from 40 years ago. The estimated auction price tag is $300,000. With that kind of cash, you are buying a piece of Apple history, a piece of the Steve Wozniak legend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE WOZNIAK: The summer that I built the Apple-1 computer, I was totally aware that a revolution was close to a starting. BOOKMAN: This is Wozniak, or Woz, who designed the Apple-1, speaking in an old Bloomberg News story. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WOZNIAK: Steve Jobs came into town. He'd pop into town, see what I was up to, the latest thing I designed for fun, and then he'd somehow turn them into some money for both of us. BOOKMAN: These guys would make a lot of money but not off the Apple-1. It was the Apple II released a year later in 1977 that would forever change home computing. Dag Spicer is with the Computer History Museum, which has an Apple-1 in its collection. He says it's one of their most popular pieces. DAG SPICER: The Apple-1 is so iconic of that era, of the garage era of Silicon Valley, that I think there's almost no other object that really encapsulates what it does culturally and technologically. BOOKMAN: Corey Cohen, the Apple-1 expert, says anyone willing to spend this kind of money is likely to keep the computer behind glass. COHEN: From a layout perspective, it's considered a piece of art. Many people hang these on the wall. BOOKMAN: Even if you don't understand how it works, it's a fascinating thing to look at.

Some failed, and markets worldwide plunged into chaos. (SOUNDBITE OF MEDIA MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Right now, breaking news here - stocks all around the world are tanking because of the crisis on Wall Street. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The Dow tumbled more than 500 points after two pillars of the Street tumbled over the weekend. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and word of trouble with the world's largest insurance company. CORNISH: The 2008 crisis left its mark on our financial system and our government. Behavioral economists believe it also left its mark on us. People who lived through the crisis and suffered from it changed their behavior. That in turn changed our economy. Cardiff Garcia from our Planet Money team has been looking into this. He's co-host of the daily economic podcast The Indicator. Welcome back. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So what can we say about the ways in which living through an experience like the financial crisis changes actually how people think and act when it comes to their finances? GARCIA: Yeah, very broadly, we know that living through, like, a big, consequential economic event like this tends to influence how willing we are to take risks. And when the event is of a harmful, for many people devastating kind of event like the financial crisis, it makes them more cautious and less likely to participate in the stock market, less likely to borrow money to buy things. And it also makes the people who run companies and even banks more cautious as well - so just more caution for everyone. CORNISH: Can you give us some examples? GARCIA: Yeah. I mean, there's a few examples. This is based on the work of an economist named Ulrike Malmendier. And she's found that, for example, CEOs who grew up during the Great Depression ended up running their companies with less debt throughout their lives, taking less risk. And she's also found that after declines in housing prices like what happened in the financial crisis, people are less willing to take out mortgages to buy homes. And what's really interesting about this work is that this effect of making people more cautious can last a very long time, even after the economy has started recovering and you would think that it's safer to start taking risks again. And the effect is sometimes also stronger in young people, probably because the traumatic event in question accounts for just a bigger share of their lives. CORNISH: Have we actually seen evidence of these effects in the economy, though? GARCIA: I think we have. So for instance, stock market participation for the middle class has not yet gone back to where it was before the crisis. And that's despite quite a healthy recovery in the stock market. And until just the last couple of years, when the economy got a lot healthier, businesses had been really slow to increase how much money they're paying people and how much money they spend on things like equipment and research and new factories. And banks themselves have also been very kind of tightfisted in lending, especially mortgage lending. So these effects can also partly be driven by other variables like the overall pace of economic growth. But I think it's also reasonable to assume that a lot of this behavior has also just been a lingering effect of the crisis itself. CORNISH: So is that really a good or a bad thing? I mean, the economy seems to be doing really well, and the problem with the crisis was that people took on too much risk. GARCIA: Yeah, that's absolutely the case. And it's true that the economy now is doing well, but especially in the first few years after the crisis ended, the economy was actually growing very, very slowly. So it's taken a while. And this actually is related to the fact that perhaps people are more cautious after the crisis because remember; you need people to take risks in order for the economy to grow. On the other hand, if people are very careful about the kind of risks that they're taking, then the economy, yes, might grow a little bit more slowly, especially right after the crisis. But it also means that the economy is less vulnerable to the next downturn and that maybe the economy can keep growing for a little while longer before we dip back into a recession. CORNISH: Cardiff, thanks so much for your reporting. GARCIA: You got it. CORNISH: Cardiff Garcia co-hosts NPR's daily economics podcast The Indicator, where you can hear more about the psychological impact of the financial crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ANI DIFRANCO AND UTAH PHILLIPS SONG, \"JOE HILL\") AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Ten years ago this month, huge banks teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Some failed, and markets worldwide plunged into chaos. (SOUNDBITE OF MEDIA MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Right now, breaking news here - stocks all around the world are tanking because of the crisis on Wall Street. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The Dow tumbled more than 500 points after two pillars of the Street tumbled over the weekend. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America and word of trouble with the world's largest insurance company. CORNISH: The 2008 crisis left its mark on our financial system and our government. Behavioral economists believe it also left its mark on us. People who lived through the crisis and suffered from it changed their behavior. That in turn changed our economy. Cardiff Garcia from our Planet Money team has been looking into this. He's co-host of the daily economic podcast The Indicator. Welcome back. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hey, Audie. CORNISH: So what can we say about the ways in which living through an experience like the financial crisis changes actually how people think and act when it comes to their finances? GARCIA: Yeah, very broadly, we know that living through, like, a big, consequential economic event like this tends to influence how willing we are to take risks. And when the event is of a harmful, for many people devastating kind of event like the financial crisis, it makes them more cautious and less likely to participate in the stock market, less likely to borrow money to buy things. And it also makes the people who run companies and even banks more cautious as well - so just more caution for everyone. CORNISH: Can you give us some examples? GARCIA: Yeah. I mean, there's a few examples. This is based on the work of an economist named Ulrike Malmendier. And she's found that, for example, CEOs who grew up during the Great Depression ended up running their companies with less debt throughout their lives, taking less risk. And she's also found that after declines in housing prices like what happened in the financial crisis, people are less willing to take out mortgages to buy homes. And what's really interesting about this work is that this effect of making people more cautious can last a very long time, even after the economy has started recovering and you would think that it's safer to start taking risks again. And the effect is sometimes also stronger in young people, probably because the traumatic event in question accounts for just a bigger share of their lives. CORNISH: Have we actually seen evidence of these effects in the economy, though? GARCIA: I think we have. So for instance, stock market participation for the middle class has not yet gone back to where it was before the crisis. And that's despite quite a healthy recovery in the stock market. And until just the last couple of years, when the economy got a lot healthier, businesses had been really slow to increase how much money they're paying people and how much money they spend on things like equipment and research and new factories.

The start of the harvest season has brought a new concern this year for a lot of farmers in the Midwest. The Trump administration's trade policies have helped drive down the prices for all crops, as foreign markets such as China pull back on their purchases. NPR's Jim Zarroli is attending one of the biggest agricultural shows in the Midwest this week, and many farmers there are worried about whether these markets are going to come back. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Each year, the Big Iron Farm Show attracts thousands of visitors to a dusty fairground in West Fargo, N. D. Dozens of farm equipment makers come to show off their latest products. Acres of threshers, combines and tractors gleam in the hot September sun. Among the farmers who turned out this year, the No. 1 topic of conversation has been the big drop in farm prices, especially for corn, wheat and soybeans - America's largest crops. CHRIS JOHNSON: Oh, it's a devastating loss. Soybeans are my largest acreage crop. ZARROLI: Chris Johnson farms 3,300 acres in the southern part of the state. Much of what he grows gets exported to Asia. This spring, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese imports. China retaliated, and soybeans were among the first crops targeted. Almost right away, prices fell by a fifth. It's a huge loss for Johnson. JOHNSON: On my farm, that's close to $150,000 that, you know, we have to make up. ZARROLI: And farmers here can't easily find other markets to sell to. The rail lines that transport crops head to the Pacific Northwest to serve the vast Asian market. With prices falling, farmers face a dilemma - do they sell off their crops now and take a big loss, or do they try to store them and hope to sell them later at a higher price? Dan Younggren (ph) farms 6,500 acres in far northern Minnesota. DAN YOUNGGREN: I can't afford to sell my soybeans at what would be $6. 50. So I've got to put them in the bin. How long do I have to leave them in the bin? I don't know. ZARROLI: Like a lot of farmers here, Younggren is hoping that the current crisis is part of some negotiating strategy, and Trump is getting ready to announce some kind of new trade deal with China that will bring prices back up. But he worries that a trade relationship that was carefully cultivated over the years has already been damaged beyond repair. YOUNGGREN: It took decades to get these markets in place with these - with China and whatnot. And the marketplace is not going to come back overnight. It's just not. ZARROLI: John Snyder is with Hurricane Ditchers (ph), a small Indiana company that makes machines that smooth out drainage ditches on farms. The machines use a lot of steel, and the company already faces higher costs because of the steel tariffs. So far, it's managed to keep prices from rising. JOHN SNYDER: We're a luxury item. We're not a tractor or combine plant, or we're not a necessity. ZARROLI: But this is Trump country, and although people here are on the frontlines of the trade war, many people, like Snyder, believe the president is doing the right thing by taking on China. SNYDER: I believe in the administration and what they're trying to do. I just wish it would have started 40 years ago so we could have gradually gotten here. There's going to be a lot of suffering to get to where we need to be. ZARROLI: Ironically, this has been a pretty good year for farmers here. Crop yields have been better than average, but with their largest markets suddenly closed off, farmers are having trouble selling their bounty. And no one knows when that will change.

S. economy is growing. Unemployment is near record lows. The stock market is at all-time highs. And all that can make the financial panic that gripped the country 10 years ago this weekend feel distant. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Lehman Brothers, a 158-year-old firm, filed for bankruptcy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The stock market suffered one of its worst days in years Monday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch fearing it could be next. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: The U. S. government is extending an $85 billion lifeline to American International Group, or AIG. SHAPIRO: Pillars of the financial system were toppling. At the time, Neil Barofsky was a federal prosecutor in Manhattan. NEIL BAROFSKY: The image that just resounds for me is just the image of bankers in their suits and ties walking out of the building with their boxes of files and personal belongings and that sort of look of hopelessness and really that fear of what's next. If these institutions could fall, what does that mean for all of us? SHAPIRO: Congress soon approved a $700 billion fund to shore up the crumbling banking system. It was called TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. And Neil Barofsky was appointed inspector general. His job was to oversee how the government dispensed that money. Now 10 years after the crash, I asked Barofsky what he sees as the fund's legacy. BAROFSKY: You know, it was extraordinarily important in helping to stop the financial crisis, to sort of blunt its impact and keep the banks from failing. But of course the flip side of that legacy is all of things that this TARP fund was supposed to do but it never actually did 'cause it wasn't just about saving the banks. When Congress passed that bill, it was very important that it helped not just Wall Street but Main Street. So it was supposed to help restore lending to the middle class, to small businesses. It was supposed to be used to help the struggling homeowners who were being thrown out of their homes through this foreclosure crisis at a record pace. And I think that the fact that the policymakers in Washington didn't ensure and didn't pay the necessary attention to those goals - I think that's part of the real legacy of TARP. And even today, there's still so much anger surrounding these bailouts. SHAPIRO: How much do you think TARP contributed to the wealth divide and inequality that we see today - because, as you point out, banks got help, but millions of homeowners went into foreclosure, and a typical worker did not get a bailout like the big banks did. BAROFSKY: Yeah, it's more of the opportunity cost, right? It's the things that TARP could have done but didn't do. And it all went in to help the big banks. And of course as a result, you know, just months really after the bailouts, you saw these sort of almost record-setting bonuses returning to Wall Street. You saw huge amounts of government money, TARP money, that essentially went into the pockets of the very AIG executives who brought that institution to its knees and the global economy alongside of it. So you have that image on one side of literally government money going to these executives and, on the flip side, just standing by idly as people lost their homes, their livelihood. And the government just sort of blindly looked away and let it happen. SHAPIRO: I was going to ask, whose fault was it? Was it the Treasury Department and the White House? Was it the banks that were supposed to allocate the money differently? Like, who failed to send the money to a wider range of places? BAROFSKY: I think the responsibility really falls squarely within the Treasury Department. Banks are banks, right? I mean, banks are going to respond to whatever incentives and requirements that they have. They're going to try to make as much money as possible. They're not here to provide a social purpose. They're going to serve their shareholders. But the Treasury Department had an enormous amount of leverage when it started pumping all this money into the banks. And in return, they were required to - they were supposed to restore lending. That was sort of one of the big key phrases of the time - that TARP is going to restore lending. But Treasury never put that into the deal. They never said, OK, we're going to give you this $25 billion, but you know what? You need to use some of it to increase your lending. SHAPIRO: Before the crash ten years ago, people were making false assumptions about risk. Like, they assumed that home prices would never fall, that unqualified borrowers would never default on their loans in large numbers. Do you think that today there are false assumptions that people are making that are comparable? BAROFSKY: I think it's undoubtedly true that that is the case. I think that is the nature of capitalism. I think as long as there's been a financial system, there have been bubbles that have been based on false presumptions. And financial crises are in some ways totally inevitable. For me, the bigger question is, are we prepared for the next crisis knowing that one is going to happen? Are we in a materially safer place than we were in 2008, and are we in fact safe? SHAPIRO: And how do you answer that question? BAROFSKY: We're not safe, I think is the answer. I think we are safer. I think that you look at the post-crisis regulatory reforms that went into place. You addressed some of the issues that were at the heart of the crisis. Banks are required to have more capital on hand so that when losses inevitably come as part of the next crisis, they have a bigger buffer before they're threatened with bankruptcy. And that's a good thing. On the other side, one of the reasons why we had the bailouts is we had a handful of institutions that were so large and so interconnected that the failure of any one of which could bring down our financial system. Today those banks are bigger. They're more interconnected and in many ways just as if not more dangerous. It's good that they have more capital, more protection, but it doesn't seem necessarily that it's enough to withstand another crisis. Plus you have the probably even bigger concern - the political winds have changed a lot in the last few years. And you have this big de-regulatory push going on in Washington that is undoing each of those changes. And that really does threaten the resiliency of our system when the next crisis inevitably comes. SHAPIRO: Neil Barofsky, thanks for taking this trip back in time with us. BAROFSKY: Always happy to go down memory lane. Thank you. SHAPIRO: He's former inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

He's had 10 years to think over what went wrong. The closing of Lehman raised the possibility that the financial crisis could become economic collapse. Freidheim has mentally replayed the months beforehand, like the day that he and other executives asked Tim Geithner, then a top official at the Federal Reserve, to change the form of the bank in a way that would give it more federal protection. SCOTT FREIDHEIM: We believed that that was the right message for the marketplace. On that phone call, he said, no. It will send the wrong message. As we all know, what he denied us was precisely what he prescribed and executed for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs one week after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. And it was the right thing to do to save the financial services industry. INSKEEP: So why were you told before the collapse of Lehman that it was not possible for the federal government to do what you asked? FREIDHEIM: Never did the Fed or politicians say that they could not. And I think it's pretty clear. INSKEEP: Well, in terms of the law, in terms of technical considerations, they could have supported you. But was there a political consideration that made it impossible? FREIDHEIM: Well, on a couple of things - you said that legally they could have. Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner have stated several times that they were legally precluded. Now, I'm not particularly in that camp, but to the point that you just made about politics, I have enormous respect for their talent, the sense of urgency that they had and that they had no other choice, as Timothy Geithner said - before the weekend started and before the competitors started poring through Lehman's books he said, there is no political will in Washington for support. There will be no government money. INSKEEP: Do you think that bankers were so unpopular because, in a sense, you earned it? FREIDHEIM: I once said - they earned it meaning? INSKEEP: Well, here's what I mean. The average person - the average person may well feel like they're getting - even when there's not a financial crisis - feel like they're getting shafted by the bank. And there's some truth to it that, for decades now, people in the middle or on the lower part of the economic spectrum are not making any more money. And they see that people in financial services are making more and more. The people who make the rules of the game somehow seem to be getting a larger and larger share. FREIDHEIM: I think unquestionably there is a stratification of wealthy and not, and that contributes to the lack of popularity. So I think there are pros and cons of where we are today. And we've made a lot of progress. But yes, I understand that there is that dynamic, absolutely. INSKEEP: You've laid out why you think the Fed made a mistake with Lehman - why you think that a different course might have led to, let's say, a less-disastrous situation. What was Lehman's responsibility, by which I mean, how was it that your company specifically got into the mess it was in? FREIDHEIM: The industry was over-levered. And all of us had risk-management tools that simulated every crisis going back 50 years. But as an industry, we didn't take it far enough. And Lehman was one of those. And since we were the second-smallest, once Bear Stearns was gone, we were the focus of the world. And having been one of those participants, we bear the shadow of that cloud for the rest of our lives. INSKEEP: Scott Freidheim, thanks very much. FREIDHEIM: Thank you very much. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The day Lehman Brothers closed, Scott Freidheim was a top executive there. He's had 10 years to think over what went wrong. The closing of Lehman raised the possibility that the financial crisis could become economic collapse. Freidheim has mentally replayed the months beforehand, like the day that he and other executives asked Tim Geithner, then a top official at the Federal Reserve, to change the form of the bank in a way that would give it more federal protection. SCOTT FREIDHEIM: We believed that that was the right message for the marketplace. On that phone call, he said, no. It will send the wrong message. As we all know, what he denied us was precisely what he prescribed and executed for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs one week after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. And it was the right thing to do to save the financial services industry. INSKEEP: So why were you told before the collapse of Lehman that it was not possible for the federal government to do what you asked? FREIDHEIM: Never did the Fed or politicians say that they could not. And I think it's pretty clear. INSKEEP: Well, in terms of the law, in terms of technical considerations, they could have supported you. But was there a political consideration that made it impossible? FREIDHEIM: Well, on a couple of things - you said that legally they could have. Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner have stated several times that they were legally precluded. Now, I'm not particularly in that camp, but to the point that you just made about politics, I have enormous respect for their talent, the sense of urgency that they had and that they had no other choice, as Timothy Geithner said - before the weekend started and before the competitors started poring through Lehman's books he said, there is no political will in Washington for support. There will be no government money. INSKEEP: Do you think that bankers were so unpopular because, in a sense, you earned it? FREIDHEIM: I once said - they earned it meaning? INSKEEP: Well, here's what I mean. The average person - the average person may well feel like they're getting - even when there's not a financial crisis - feel like they're getting shafted by the bank. And there's some truth to it that, for decades now, people in the middle or on the lower part of the economic spectrum are not making any more money. And they see that people in financial services are making more and more. The people who make the rules of the game somehow seem to be getting a larger and larger share. FREIDHEIM: I think unquestionably there is a stratification of wealthy and not, and that contributes to the lack of popularity. So I think there are pros and cons of where we are today. And we've made a lot of progress. But yes, I understand that there is that dynamic, absolutely. INSKEEP: You've laid out why you think the Fed made a mistake with Lehman - why you think that a different course might have led to, let's say, a less-disastrous situation.

A company that survived world wars and the Great Depression closed its doors in a signal moment of the financial crisis. David Wessel covered that crisis for The Wall Street Journal and later wrote the book \"In Fed We Trust. \" He's with us once again. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What went wrong? WESSEL: Well, you know, that's a question that economic historians are going to be asking and answering for decades, but here's my quick take. Americans - ordinary Americans and big Wall Street banks bet that housing prices would never fall, and they did. They fell a lot. That was the trigger for a widespread financial panic. INSKEEP: I think people didn't even realize they were betting. They thought that was a basic reality, like the sun rising, that the housing prices over time would always rise. WESSEL: Absolutely. They've been told for years that housing prices may go down in one community but not another. But the housing crisis alone didn't do this. It triggered a financial panic, a run on the entire financial system - not this time on the banks with depositors lining up but on the short-term borrowing that all sorts of big financial institutions relied on. And, you know, when that happens, the financial system moves credit around the economy the way blood moves through the circulatory system. The financial system froze up. And with that, the economy collapsed. And with a lot of creativity, controversy and effort, the U. S. government got things going again. But it turns out that even though they avoided a repeat of the Great Depression, we had a terrible recession. And they got a lot of blame for not having avoided it in the first place. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk a little bit about the blame and also about what really happened here. If we look in a broader frame, was economic inequality part of the problem here? You had lots of people who'd been living on less and less over time, or feeling like they weren't getting ahead and ending up borrowing too much for a house, borrowing against the house to pay expenses. That was part of the crisis that built up over time, wasn't it? WESSEL: Absolutely. I mean, there's an economist at the University of Chicago, Raghuram Rajan, who has written a book that argues that one of the causes of the whole thing was that since incomes for ordinary Americans weren't going up but their eagerness to live well - perhaps as well as their neighbors or the people they saw on TV - continued to grow, the only way to do it was to borrow. And it turned out the financial system was more than happy to lend them money, including some people who couldn't afford to pay it back, as long as they could then get someone else to carry the loan by turning it into some fancy security that was sold to a bank in Germany. INSKEEP: And I think we're getting a sense here of why it was that people got so angry. They were already strained before the crisis. The crisis strikes. A lot of people are wiped out. Their home value is wiped out. And suddenly, it's decided that the way to fix this is to bail out giant banks after Lehman Brothers collapsed. WESSEL: That's right. So some of the roots of this populism and this anger predate the crisis, as you suggest. There was a lot of inequality, a lot of angst about trade and immigration. The crisis made it worse, but people fail to understand - and the leadership failed to explain well enough - why it was that you had to bail out the banks in order to save the economy and save Main Street. INSKEEP: Very briefly, is the economy any safer today than it was a decade ago? WESSEL: I think Christine Lagarde at the International Monetary Fund put it very well - safer but not safe enough. INSKEEP: What does that mean? WESSEL: It means that we did some things to restrain the banks from making the same mistakes again. They have much bigger capital cushions to absorb losses. But we've taken away some of the tools that the authorities used the last time so that if we have another crisis, they won't be able to do all the same things again. That may make people happy today. They may regret it in the future. INSKEEP: David, always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you very much. WESSEL: You're welcome.

Day to day, housing prices are still plummeting. A new survey shows. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: . . . Pulling out, hedge funds pulling out. Their fear is, we don't know how many more banks will fail. MARTIN: We're going to revisit that history and look ahead with one of the key players from the era, a woman who sounded the alarm about the impending crisis. She's Sheila Bair, former chair of the FDIC - the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. She's a Republican. She was appointed by George W. Bush in 2006, and, over her five-year term, she saw the depths of the crisis. Sheila Bair, welcome. Thank you so much for speaking with us. SHEILA BAIR: Pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Lehman Brothers collapsed under the weight of bad debt, mainly mortgage-backed securities. You foresaw in 2006 that that was going to be a problem. Could you just remind us what the problem was? BAIR: Well, the problem was unaffordable mortgages being commoditized and sold off to investors. We had something called securitization that basically severed the decision to make the mortgage from the risk of whether the mortgage would be repaid. We had a situation where the people originating the mortgages were just getting paid up front and then selling the mortgages off and these securitizations to investors who were not aware of the risk. And that's - that was the core of the problem - massive, unaffordable mortgages, much of it predatory, push-marketed on families, particularly in low-income and minority neighborhoods. MARTIN: Now, you were the chair of the FDIC, which guarantees deposits if a bank goes bust. What did you see. . . BAIR: Right. MARTIN: . . . That caused you to become alarmed about what was going on? BAIR: Well, my history with this actually goes back to 2001 and 2002 when I was the assistant secretary for financial institutions at Treasury. And we were seeing this predatory lending going on then. It was primarily targeted, again, in low-income neighborhoods. There was a big problem in Baltimore, Cleveland, Boston. There were pockets. So we tried to get industry together for some best practices, realizing that Congress was not going to impose mortgage lending standards. This was going on in the early 2000s. This idea that nobody saw it coming is just laughable. MARTIN: I want to hear more about why you think they didn't listen in a minute. But first, I just want to ask you to give us the short course and refresh our memories about how the collapse of Lehman spiraled into. . . BAIR: Right. MARTIN: . . . The recession. You know, why was there such an enormous knock-on effect? BAIR: Well, I think it's important to understand that Lehman not only had helped securitize and invest in these very toxic mortgage-backed securities. It also had exposure on derivatives that were tied to how these mortgages perform. Lehmann also was also a borrower - a heavy borrower. And so, as it started getting into trouble, and then when it finally went bankrupt, it defaulted on a lot of its own debt obligations. And when investors saw that Lehman was defaulting on its debt, they said, well, we don't want to lend to these other big financial institutions either that have a lot of exposure to subprime mortgages. And that's really what caused the system to freeze up. MARTIN: So now that we're in a different phase - let's say we've passed through that crisis - a lot of people are revisiting, and a lot of people have written books, you know, giving their perspective on what happened. BAIR: Right. MARTIN: You've been very critical of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Tell me what you think the dispute is about. BAIR: Yeah. Well, it's - I think it's a fundamental policy debate. And I want to emphasize, I have respect for Tim Geithner. My focus was on homeowners. It was on the mortgages. Banks getting into trouble and not being able to fund themselves, and then they themselves were not lending - that exacerbated the problem. But what really drove this severe recession was the steep drop in consumer spending because people who had previously relied on their homes to accumulate wealth and refinanced and pull out cash were relying too much on that. You know, people tried to fight us in our efforts to help homeowners by saying, well, these are all a bunch of speculators. And that's not true. Most of them were people just trying to hold onto their homes, and they were desperate to do so. And they retrenched on their consumer spending. They spent down their savings. They spent down their college - their kids' college accounts trying to hold onto that home, trying to make that mortgage payment. When they couldn't refinance anymore because home prices had dropped, their mortgages were underwater, meaning that they owed more on their mortgage than their home was worth. That's what caused the problem. Tim's view was that the problem was Wall Street. It was with the banks. MARTIN: My colleague Scott Simon talked to Barney Frank earlier. He asked him the same question. The criticism is that the banks were supported at the expense of homeowners and that this was a bank. . . BAIR: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Big bank-centric policy, and he disagreed strongly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)BARNEY FRANK: If the banks aren't working, you know, who is particularly hurt are people who live paycheck to paycheck. MARTIN: And what would you say to that? BAIR: Well, I think that that is the - that's the Wall Street view (laughter). And nobody's saying that we shouldn't have stabilized the banks. But the debate is why we did that but didn't do much to help homeowners and not nearly as much as we should have. And then also, once that system was stabilized, why then we didn't move to impose accountability. Not many people went to jail. A lot of people - a lot's been written about that. Not many people even lost their jobs, frankly. MARTIN: You've cited a number of warning signs that would suggest that there are - the seeds are there for another financial crisis. Do you see signs of another financial crisis ahead? BAIR: Well, I certainly see signs of a heavily - of a U. S. economy and a global economy that is overburdened by debt. This is symptomatic of low interest rates. So we shouldn't be surprised that we've got a lot of debt now - government debt as a percentage of GDP is at an all-time high. Student debt - you know, need I say more? We're approaching $1. 5 trillion. And that's heavily, again, skewed towards low-income families that are taking on that student debt burden. So I'm not optimistic. I'm not, given that the political sentiment that's going towards financial deregulation in Washington combined with the extreme amounts of debt, both U. S. and world economy. I think there are a lot of the areas to worry. And, again, I just hope that government leadership as well as corporate financial leadership are prudent and prepare as opposed to just borrowing more, lending more, listing credit standards - the same kind of behaviors we saw the lead-up to 2008 that brought us into such a terrible situation. MARTIN: That's Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. She wrote a book about the financial crisis called \"Bull By The Horns: Fighting To Save Main Street From Wall Street And Wall Street From Itself. \"Sheila Bair, thanks so much for talking with us.

It was a signal moment in the financial crisis that nearly spun out of control. One response was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which became law in 2010 - a huge law that called for breaking up banks if they were determined to be too big to fail so that an entire global economy would not be at risk. It also helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but the powers of that agency have recently been curtailed by the Trump administration. The Frank of that bill, of course, is Barney Frank, who joins us now. Mr. Frank, thanks so much for being with us. BARNEY FRANK: You're welcome. SIMON: Ten years later, with the advantage of historical hindsight, what do you think was at the root of the financial crisis? FRANK: Two major changes in the way in which financial activity was conducted. One was, frankly, made possible by information technology. In 1970, if you borrowed money, you borrowed it from a bank, which you would have to repay. That is, you got a mortgage, and every month, you sent them a check. And then banks began to develop something called securitization. Banks would make hundreds, thousands of loans but instead of waiting for each borrower to repay that loan, they would bundle them into securities, and then they would sell to investors a package of loans, and the mortgage repayments then went to the people who owned the securities. The problem is that if I'm lending you money and I'm depending on you to pay me back every month, I'm going to be careful about who I lend to. But if I am making thousands of loans, I no longer have an interest in whether or not they're repaid. Secondly, around the same time and related to this, large amounts of money started coming into the United States not from banks. You had the oil-producing countries. You had Asian countries with large balance and payments surpluses (ph). You had all kinds of money coming in that was available for loans outside the banking system. So the combination was that the discipline in the lending business of the borrower having to prove his or her credit worthiness disappeared. A whole lot of bad loans were made. SIMON: Mr. Frank, how do you - how do you react to the criticism that's been made over the years that when Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson and Tim Geithner and others got together and figured out what amounted to a rescue package for the U. S. economy, it rescued Wall Street but not regular citizens. FRANK: Well, that's wrong. What they rescued was the economy. Now, it is true that the direct beneficiaries in the first instance were the banks. Although if the banks aren't working, you know who is particularly hurt? The people who live paycheck to paycheck. Look; if the bank system failed, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase - a perfectly nice man, I don't mean to single him out - but he had enough money, he wouldn't have starved. He would have - he would have found a way to support himself. It's the people living paycheck to paycheck who suddenly weren't getting a paycheck or had no place to cash it or no ATM, they would have been hurt. My - the mistake - and it was one I was very angry about and fought against, but the Bush administration was in power and then frankly the Obama administration didn't pick up enough on it - we should have done more with that money to help people who were having foreclosures on their property. SIMON: Mr. Frank, I have to ask, in May, Congress passed bipartisan legislation that loosened some provisions of your own bill so community, regional banks, smaller banks could operate more freely. You endorsed that change. This is at the same time you're on the board of the Signature Bank, which stands to benefit from that change. FRANK: Well, you left out some - you left out some very salient facts. First of all, I did not endorse it. I consistently said I would've vote against it. I did disagree with those who thought it was a terrible mistake. I don't think it did serious damage. But the most important thing you left out is this - in 2013, long before I had ever heard of Signature Bank, the part of that law that benefited Signature Bank was something that I had announced my support for years, again, before I had even heard of the bank. And the fact is that passing the law as they did preserved most of the regulatory bill - over 90 percent. And by the way, with regard to the biggest banks, there was no loosening whatsoever. SIMON: Barney Frank, a member of Congress for 32 years, thanks so much for being with us. FRANK: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Today marks 10 years since Lehman Brothers collapsed. It was a signal moment in the financial crisis that nearly spun out of control. One response was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which became law in 2010 - a huge law that called for breaking up banks if they were determined to be too big to fail so that an entire global economy would not be at risk. It also helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but the powers of that agency have recently been curtailed by the Trump administration. The Frank of that bill, of course, is Barney Frank, who joins us now. Mr. Frank, thanks so much for being with us. BARNEY FRANK: You're welcome. SIMON: Ten years later, with the advantage of historical hindsight, what do you think was at the root of the financial crisis? FRANK: Two major changes in the way in which financial activity was conducted. One was, frankly, made possible by information technology. In 1970, if you borrowed money, you borrowed it from a bank, which you would have to repay. That is, you got a mortgage, and every month, you sent them a check. And then banks began to develop something called securitization. Banks would make hundreds, thousands of loans but instead of waiting for each borrower to repay that loan, they would bundle them into securities, and then they would sell to investors a package of loans, and the mortgage repayments then went to the people who owned the securities. The problem is that if I'm lending you money and I'm depending on you to pay me back every month, I'm going to be careful about who I lend to. But if I am making thousands of loans, I no longer have an interest in whether or not they're repaid. Secondly, around the same time and related to this, large amounts of money started coming into the United States not from banks. You had the oil-producing countries. You had Asian countries with large balance and payments surpluses (ph). You had all kinds of money coming in that was available for loans outside the banking system. So the combination was that the discipline in the lending business of the borrower having to prove his or her credit worthiness disappeared. A whole lot of bad loans were made. SIMON: Mr. Frank, how do you - how do you react to the criticism that's been made over the years that when Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson and Tim Geithner and others got together and figured out what amounted to a rescue package for the U. S. economy, it rescued Wall Street but not regular citizens. FRANK: Well, that's wrong. What they rescued was the economy.

That's the question before the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee as it meets next week. Right now interest rates are under 2 percent. What the Fed decides can have big effects on the economy. But lately, it's gotten harder for the Fed to know exactly what those effects will be. Keith Romer from our Planet Money podcast reports. KEITH ROMER, BYLINE: The big job of a central bank like the Federal Reserve is to keep the economy from growing too fast or too slow and keep inflation in check. Traditionally, the Fed would do this by changing interest rates. Set them high; inflation comes down. Set them low; inflation rises. Esther George is president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank (ph). ESTHER GEORGE: One of the common things that you look for as a central banker is price stability. So in other words, is inflation being affected by your monetary policy? ROMER: And that's where the problem is. Interest rates have been really low, but inflation hasn't responded - and not just in the United States. GEORGE: What we've noticed is, globally, the advanced central banks have been putting a lot of accommodation into their economy and yet not seen inflation rise. ROMER: When changes in the interest rate stop affecting inflation, economists start to worry and look for explanations. One answer they've come up with - more and more industries are controlled by just a few very successful companies, obviously in tech but also in industries like banking, health care and airlines. This consolidation, they say, has three main effects. First, a lot of these giant new companies have gotten so efficient that they have pushed prices down, which may be keeping inflation lower than anyone expected. A second way that big companies may be changing things is borrowing. It used to be that if a company wanted to expand, it needed to build new factories and buy new machinery, which would require a big loan. But modern companies depend less on physical capital and more on things like patents and software. John Van Reenen is an economist at MIT. He says that's true not just for tech companies like Google and Facebook. JOHN VAN REENEN: Think about Walmarts in retail, a much more low-tech type of sector. But what Walmart's done is that it's invested huge amounts of money in building up better software. ROMER: If companies don't need to rely so much on loans, changes in the interest rate will have a much smaller effect on whether or not they choose to expand. The final riddle these giant companies have created for central bankers involves the job market. Normally with unemployment as low as it's been, wages would rise. But they've barely budged. Some economists think this has to do with the decades-long decline in union membership. Others point out that when an industry contracts from 10 major companies to, say, three, workers will just lose some of their bargaining power. VAN REENEN: What larger firms, in particular, can do is they can actually drive down wages below what the competitive level is. ROMER: These giant companies are making it harder for central bankers to know how to think about interest rates. But Kansas City Fed President Esther George says not knowing for sure has always been part of the job. GEORGE: I think we will never defeat uncertainty. And the question is - as we think about policy, are we factoring that in? ROMER: Next week, when George votes on whether to move interest rates, she'll do so with a robust sense of what she does not know. For NPR News, I'm Keith Romer.

For those who are covered by insurance, the price is growing, as are the risks. Here's NPR's Colin Dwyer. COLIN DWYER, BYLINE: Florence was a massive, wet monster, and an expensive one, too. Early estimates put the storm's price tag as high as $22 billion. But Florence is just one on a growing list of natural disasters recorded by Munich Re. The German-based company offers insurance for other insurers in case of catastrophe, so they have good reason to keep track. Ernst Rauch leads research on this stuff for Munich Re, and he's been doing it for three decades. ERNST RAUCH: When I look back to the 1980s, we recorded 200 to 300 events - catastrophe events annually. And today, we are close to about a thousand events. DWYER: That means a lot of losses insurers have to be prepared to cover - more than $130 billion worth last year alone. But these losses go beyond the balance sheet. DAVE JONES: Loss of life, community devastation. DWYER: That's Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner. He's not too concerned about hurricanes. It's wildfires that keep him up at night. JONES: The climate scientists tell us that we're going to continue to see temperatures rise, and that will contribute to more catastrophic weather-related events. DWYER: You see, climate change is not just on the minds of insurers. It's also on the minds of the officials who regulate them, like Jones. JONES: In 2017, collectively, we had the highest insured losses on record associated with wildfires in the state's history. DWYER: It's his job to be sure that insurance companies can continue to cover these losses. But it's also his job to protect the folks who actually suffer those losses. And that's becoming even harder these days, especially in risky areas for wildfires, like Mendocino County, where California's biggest fire on record blazed earlier this year. He says complaints about price increases have shot up in these regions. And recently, he has seen a 15 percent increase in the number of homeowners who've found that their insurance company would not renew them at all. Now people are still finding insurance, but more residents are turning to a state-created program as a last resort, which can often be even pricier. JONES: And those areas that were traditionally thought to be of a lower risk are now being treated by the insurers as a higher risk. DWYER: And the state expects the situation to get worse. Officials predict the area burned by wildfires will increase dramatically in the coming decades. But it's not just California. Hurricanes, droughts, floods - with global temperatures expected to increase, consumer advocates expect these insurance pains to increase with them. And looking ahead, that pain may not be evenly distributed. BOB HUNTER: The insurance companies will take care of themselves. DWYER: Bob Hunter of the Consumer Federation of America. HUNTER: But poorer people who can't afford that are going to buy the slimmed-down policies. And then the very poor, of course, will be priced out. So those are the people who will probably - will, not probably - will get hurt the most. DWYER: That's a point voiced not just by advocates, but by regulators and researchers in the insurance industry. RAUCH: So it really becomes, sooner or later, a social issue. DWYER: That's Ernst Rauch of Munich Re again. RAUCH: By the end of the day, someone has to pay for the increasing risk caused by climate change. DWYER: And one thing is certain. Those bills will be expensive when they come due. Colin Dwyer, NPR News, New York.

They've gone up a couple of times already this year, several times in recent years as the Fed works to manage inflation. And yet interest rates are still, by historic levels, pretty low. So what's going on here? David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So what's driving the interest rate hike? WESSEL: Well, basically, the economy is doing very well. The Fed officials have kept interest rates extraordinarily low. They've put their foot on the gas pedal for a quite a while now. With inflation now creeping up to their 2 percent target, unemployment at an 18-year low of 3. 9 percent and headed down, they don't think the economy any longer needs this extraordinarily low interest rates. So they're pulling their foot off the gas pedal. They're not yet touching the brake, but some Fed officials are saying it's time to touch the brake. INSKEEP: Well, a couple of things here. One, we discussed how inflation has gotten to the point - still pretty low, but - gotten to the point where it's eating the average person's wages, right? Wage hikes. WESSEL: Right. So wages, on average, are only now slightly above inflation. A lot of workers seem to be getting bonuses rather than wages. But that's not beginning to compensate for all the years at which wages have risen much more slowly for the average person than inflation. In fact, the Census Bureau recently said that the typical man who worked full-time last year earned less adjusted for inflation than his counterpart did in 1999. . . INSKEEP: Wow. WESSEL: . . . Using the official inflation measure. INSKEEP: And yet we're at this point where they need to squeeze the economy a little bit. Do President Trump's tariffs, which are beginning to hit soon, factor into this? Because these are tariffs on just about everything, ultimately, that the United States buys from China. Does that raise prices enough that the Fed has to consider that part of inflation? WESSEL: Well, the Fed doesn't have to worry much about President Trump's tariffs in the short-run. After all, they haven't had that much effect on the overall economy, just on some pockets. The United States still produces most of what it consumes and consumes most of what it produces. But over time, the Fed does have to worry, will the tariffs slow the economy so they stop raising interest rates so much, or will they add to inflation, as you suggest, and force them to raise interest rates more rapidly than they've planned? INSKEEP: One other thing I'd like to ask about, David Wessel. Interest rates went down around the time of the financial crisis. They were down around zero, effectively, for a very long time. And by now, we have a whole generation of consumers that effectively has no experience with high-interest rates, no experience with high inflation. What's it mean now that we're heading into a new phase? WESSEL: Well, I don't think they have to worry about high inflation. We're nowhere near that. But you're absolutely right on the interest rates. This is a group of people, people in their 20s and 30s, who seem to have a lot of debt. And for a lot of them, whether it's a car loan or an adjustable rate mortgage or, in some cases, student loans, the interest rate on their loans has been relatively low. It's going to start going up. That's going to pinch. On the other hand, some people who have savings may enjoy the fact that the bank's finally going to start paying them more than nothing on their savings. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Which has been the experience for a lot of people. But you're saying that the really low car loan or the really low house loan, that's going to get a little harder? WESSEL: Absolutely. And as I said, these people have lots of debt and they don't have a lot of assets. They're much less likely to own a home than their counterparts were a generation ago. INSKEEP: David, thanks very much. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's David Wessel of the Brookings Institution.

Does that raise prices enough that the Fed has to consider that part of inflation? WESSEL: Well, the Fed doesn't have to worry much about President Trump's tariffs in the short-run. After all, they haven't had that much effect on the overall economy, just on some pockets. The United States still produces most of what it consumes and consumes most of what it produces. But over time, the Fed does have to worry, will the tariffs slow the economy so they stop raising interest rates so much, or will they add to inflation, as you suggest, and force them to raise interest rates more rapidly than they've planned? INSKEEP: One other thing I'd like to ask about, David Wessel. Interest rates went down around the time of the financial crisis. They were down around zero, effectively, for a very long time. And by now, we have a whole generation of consumers that effectively has no experience with high-interest rates, no experience with high inflation. What's it mean now that we're heading into a new phase? WESSEL: Well, I don't think they have to worry about high inflation. We're nowhere near that. But you're absolutely right on the interest rates. This is a group of people, people in their 20s and 30s, who seem to have a lot of debt. And for a lot of them, whether it's a car loan or an adjustable rate mortgage or, in some cases, student loans, the interest rate on their loans has been relatively low. It's going to start going up. That's going to pinch. On the other hand, some people who have savings may enjoy the fact that the bank's finally going to start paying them more than nothing on their savings. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Which has been the experience for a lot of people. But you're saying that the really low car loan or the really low house loan, that's going to get a little harder? WESSEL: Absolutely. And as I said, these people have lots of debt and they don't have a lot of assets. They're much less likely to own a home than their counterparts were a generation ago. INSKEEP: David, thanks very much. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's David Wessel of the Brookings Institution.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

The state has the highest poverty rate in the nation due to its affordable housing crisis. Many lower- and middle-income people are being priced out of their apartments. One proposed fix is on the ballot. It's a measure that would let cities enact stricter rent control. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports from Los Angeles. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: You can add Robert Rodriguez to a growing list of Angelenos living right on the brink of homelessness. Rodriguez used to be a truck driver. He's 82. And when I met him, he was leaning on his walker outside his old apartment. He had been evicted the day before. ROBERT RODRIGUEZ: Everything is gone, yes. It's all in storage. SIEGLER: Now, in February, his landlord told him rent was going up by 15 percent to be followed by possibly another 30 to 40 percent increase. He couldn't pay. They went to eviction court. RODRIGUEZ: And in court, we lost. So I had to leave. SIEGLER: But where to go? His neighborhood, densely populated MacArthur Park with its many worn mid-century apartment buildings, is gentrifying. Landlords are suddenly asking and getting 2,000 a month or higher for one-bedrooms. Rodriguez can't afford that, and he's worried he'll end up homeless. RODRIGUEZ: It's an embarrassment more than anything else I think. At this point in my life, I should be sitting in a rocking chair, waiting for the pearly gates to open up for me. SIEGLER: California is now home to almost a quarter of this country's entire homeless population. This is an often-cited statistic for those backing Prop 10, which would allow cities to pass or expand rent control. It would repeal a law that prohibits rent control on any unit built after 1995 and a little earlier in some cities. PETER DREIER: California has the worst housing crisis in the country for two major reasons. SIEGLER: Peter Dreier's a former deputy mayor of Boston who now teaches public policy at Occidental College in LA. DREIER: Wages are stagnating for the majority of working families, and rents and home prices are going up much faster than wages. SIEGLER: And Dreier says the system is stacked against renters in particular. A report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition figured that just to afford market rent in LA right now you have to make at least $32 an hour. DREIER: We have a shortage of housing that's affordable to schoolteachers, that's affordable to firefighters, that's affordable to janitors, that's affordable to garment workers. SIEGLER: The people who make a city tick or any community. DREIER: Right. SIEGLER: But Prop 10 has its detractors, including people who build low-income rental housing. Elizabeth Bluhm is a project manager at a San Diego-based nonprofit developer called Wakeland Housing. She's worried that if it passes, there could be a patchwork of cities with different rent control laws and limits. ELIZABETH BLUHM: Which makes it very hard for developers to get things done efficiently because there's different rules to figure out in every city. And it just adds to the cost of development, which is part of the problem. SIEGLER: Bluhm says even just a little uncertainty threatens funding for a project because developers need to know how much rent they're going to bring in to cover their costs. Private firms like hers see themselves on the front line of fixing the housing crisis because federal housing subsidies for the poor have steadily declined since the 1980s. Bluhm says rent control is just a Band-Aid, and at the root of the problem is the fact that there's just not enough housing. BLUHM: The real solution to our affordable housing crisis is more construction of housing across the whole spectrum. SIEGLER: The state estimates it needs to build well over a million new units right now. Land is in short supply, and a lot of what is being built is high-end. And that's fueling a lot of the anger and momentum behind the push for rent control. Like in a lot of booming American cities, LA residents are watching as whole blocks are demolished to make way for luxury homes and big, fancy apartment complexes with pools and gyms. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) The rent, the rent is too damn high. The rent, the rent is too damn high. SIEGLER: Prop 10 supporters and neighbors of 82-year-old Robert Rodriguez are protesting on the street in front of his old building. The building's owners say the rent increases were needed to cover maintenance costs and are still below market rates. But for now, Roberts says he and his wife will stay with his sister while they desperately look for a new place. RODRIGUEZ: If you don't have family, you've got a problem. You've got a problem.

Few schools across the country are required to teach about consent. That is starting to change, as NPR's Anya Kamenetz reports. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: When the \"Access Hollywood\" tape of Donald Trump hit the news in late 2016, a middle school student in Maryland named Maeve Sanford-Kelly was listening. MAEVE SANFORD-KELLY: My friends and myself - we were all talking about this a lot. And then I started talking to my mom about it, and I was really distraught about the general situation. KAMENETZ: Her mother, Ariana Kelly, had an idea that might help. Ariana Kelly is a delegate in the Maryland legislature, and she introduced a bill that required the state to include consent in sex ed classes. ARIANA KELLY: The law defines consent as the unambiguous and voluntary agreement between all participants in each physical act within the course of interpersonal relationships. KAMENETZ: Maeve campaigned and testified in favor of the bill. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAEVE: Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the delegation. My name is Maeve Sanford-Kelly, and I go to North Bethesda Middle School. I'm here to talk about including consent in the sex ed curriculum because it's extremely important. KAMENETZ: Currently under a dozen states mention the term sexual assault, consent or even healthy relationships in their sex education programs. But with the #MeToo movement, that may be changing. Since the beginning of 2018, six states including Maryland have introduced or passed bills to require the teaching of consent in sex ed. Some of those bills have been controversial with some arguing that talking about consent is tantamount to condoning sex. It doesn't have to be that way, says Amy Tiemann. She's a neuroscientist and educator who works with Kidpower, a child safety education group. She says the message of respect for others and your own body can be made simple and empowering even for young children. AMY TIEMANN: They can be 3 years old. They can be 15 years old. They can be in college. And we don't know who might be a potential perpetrator or who might be a potential victim someday. And people can be both. KAMENETZ: In Maryland, the law passed on a second try last year. Schools in Montgomery County, were Maeve is now a freshman in high school, are teaching about consent already. Maeve and her mother both see reasons to hope for change in this generation. Ariana Kelly says she's found it especially heartwarming to see teenage boys speak up about this issue. KELLY: When we had the first hearing on this bill, all these teenage boys showed up. And they were talking about this issue just as much and just as passionately. And that just warmed my heart. MATT POST: If anything is going to change, guys cannot relegate themselves to the sidelines on this issue. KAMENETZ: At age 16, Matt Post campaigned for Maryland's consent law.

That might be getting a bit easier. Here's Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from NPR's economics podcast The Indicator. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Rents in the U. S. have been on the rise for years until now. According to the real estate database Zillow, the median rent in the U. S. is $1,440. And that is unchanged from a year ago. SUSAN WACHTER: This is a big deal. VANEK SMITH: This is Susan Wachter. She's a professor of real estate and finance at Wharton. She says, yes, New York is extreme, but this story has been playing out all across the country. WACHTER: This is a big deal because it signals a turning point. The housing recovery has been a story of supply chasing demand. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: And supply was chasing demand in large part because of the housing crisis 10 years ago. For a long time after the crisis, construction was just dead. Other parts of the economy, though, started gradually recovering, you know, like the tech sector and retail industry. And people started wanting to move again and get nicer places, but building and construction just lagged behind. VANEK SMITH: As a result, there weren't enough apartments to meet demand. And the prices of the rentals that were available just kept going up. The construction industry did eventually kick into gear. And building has been happening like crazy in many parts of the country. Still, there was such a backlog of people wanting apartments - even though new places were being built, there still weren't enough places to meet all of the demand. So rents just kept climbing and climbing. GARCIA: Until now. The supply of housing seems to finally be catching up with demand. WACHTER: Or right now if you need to rent, you're going to be renting for less than last year. So that's a good thing. And if you wait a bit, rents are probably going to fall even farther. GARCIA: This seems to be a window for the little guy. What about everybody else? VANEK SMITH: For the economy as a whole, good or bad? WACHTER: Well, I think this is actually good for the economy because we've had a real hit on mobility. GARCIA: Susan says a lot of people were dealing with unaffordable rents in a few different ways, you know, like they'd split a place with a bunch of people. VANEK SMITH: Sardine life. GARCIA: (Laughter) Yeah, or they'd stay with family or with their parents longer or just not taking a job in the places where the jobs were because the apartment rents were so high. VANEK SMITH: Now that rental prices are flattening, says Susan, it means people will have more options. They can be more mobile. WACHTER: Mobility to where the new jobs are is what drives the economy. The job market is booming, but it's been difficult to find places in the hot markets particularly. VANEK SMITH: Susan says a lot of companies have been struggling to find workers to fill all their jobs, which meant that those companies could not grow as fast as they wanted to. Lower rent, she says, will help companies and cities and small businesses. GARCIA: Also if people are spending less on rent, it means they have more money to spend on other things, like eating out or going to the movies or buying clothes. And that's obviously good for those parts of the economy. VANEK SMITH: Unless you are a landlord. Then you are not so excited about this. Suddenly, it's taking longer to rent a place. People are pickier. You can't raise the rent every year. Maybe you even have to lower the rent. GARCIA: Susan says vacancy rates have been around 4 percent across the country, and that is really, really low. But now, they're starting to rise. That's still totally fine for landlords.

But that depends on exactly where in America you live. It's often said that you can predict the futures of many kids by finding out the zip code where they grew up. An online data tool being made public today lets you see for yourself the link between where you are and the American dream. Here's NPR's John Ydstie. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Economist Raj Chetty has been worried about the fading American dream for years. He's crunched the numbers. And they're troubling. If you were born in the 1940s or '50s, he says, you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did. But. . . RAJ CHETTY: You see that for kids turning 30 today who were born in the mid-1980s - only 50 percent of them go on to earn more than their parents did. That is, it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream. YDSTIE: Chetty and his colleagues at Opportunity Insights, a research and policy institute located at Harvard, want to improve those odds. So they've partnered with the U. S. Census Bureau to develop an online program. It works a lot like a Google map. You can see the whole country. Or you can zoom into local neighborhoods. And you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures. CHETTY: We are able to pinpoint, you know, what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder? What are the places where the outcomes don't look as good? And we've put this all out in the form of a publicly available, interactive tool called the Opportunity Atlas that we hope citizens, local policymakers, nonprofits, people working on these issues can use to make better decisions. YDSTIE: Chetty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low-income kids by an average of $200,000. Of course, moving a lot of people is impractical. So the focus is on helping low-performing areas improve. Charlotte, N. C. , has gotten a head start on this effort. Back in 2014, Chetty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead-last out of 50 cities at providing upward mobility for low-income kids. That shocked many residents. OPHELIA GARMON-BROWN: If you know anything about Charlotte, Charlotte wants to be No. 1. YDSTIE: Ophelia Garmon-Brown, a prominent Charlotte physician, says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high-tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades. GARMON-BROWN: I wasn't surprised that we had done poorly. I've been a physician for a lot of years, worked with people who live in poverty. So I saw it. YDSTIE: What she saw was a segregated city where low-income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder. Garmon-Brown joined an effort by the Foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem. The group identified early childhood development, college and career readiness, family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility. It singled out segregation as a key obstacle. And now Charlotte officials are learning to use the Opportunity Atlas to effectively target some remedies, things like pre-K programs and affordable housing. ALANNA WILLIAMS: So what I have up here right now is just kind of a pure map of median income in Charlotte. YDSTIE: Alanna Williams, from the Chetty team, is demonstrating the Opportunity Atlas for a group that includes local officials. She zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods. If the area is reddish-brown, it signals low levels of upward mobility. If it's green or blue, it has higher opportunities. WILLIAMS: So this is the outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte. YDSTIE: Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools. He says the tool has already exceeded his expectations. FRANK BARNES: I think the key thing that has happened is that the Foundation for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data. And I think that's the power. It's in the community collaboration and the community partnership. YDSTIE: Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at Sedgefield Middle School. It's located in a majority-white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte. But Assistant Principal Eric Tornfelt says the school's students are mostly black and Hispanic. ERIC TORNFELT: So we got 48. 9 percent are Hispanic - 44. 5 percent are African-American. Four percent are white. YDSTIE: It's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body that's largely minority. That's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods. That segregation hinders upward mobility. James E. Ford, a former North Carolina teacher of the year, is working with Sedgefield's administration to make the school more racially balanced. Ford, now an education consultant, says two local elementary schools have already merged for that reason. JAMES E FORD: Eventually, something similar is going to happen here. The demographics here are going to shift quite a bit. It's majority-black and -brown now. But in the coming years, it'll change. It'll start to look more like the neighborhood. YDSTIE: But there's another challenge here beyond segregation. It's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed. The Sedgefield neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority-black neighborhood called Southside Park. But the Opportunity Atlas shows African-American boys growing up in Sedgefield in the 1980s and '90s are now doing worse than their counterparts from Southside Park. Ford says that might surprise some people. FORD: We may assume because an area's affluent, like, that's a high-opportunity area. Well, the truth is that may not be a high-opportunity area, according to all the metrics that we're looking at. YDSTIE: In this case, it may be that the majority-black neighborhood of Southside Park offers young, black men the social networks, friends, extended family, churches that help them get ahead. Those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority-white neighborhood. Ford says the Opportunity Atlas should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility. FORD: So this permits us to start making really smart and really intentional decisions so that 20, 30 years down the line, we can look and say, yeah, that was the right call. YDSTIE: Charlotte is already taking significant steps in that direction. Mecklenburg County, which encompasses Charlotte, has committed to providing pre-K for all children. The city of Charlotte has a $50 million bond issue for affordable housing on the November ballot. Raj Chetty says he hopes the Opportunity Atlas will help communities across the country revive the American dream in their local neighborhoods. John Ydstie, NPR News, Charlotte, N. C. (SOUNDBITE OF EDO. G'S \"SITUATIONS (INSTRUMENTAL)\"MARTIN: You can find the Opportunity Atlas at oppurtunityatlas. org. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   We'd like to think America is the land of equal opportunity. But that depends on exactly where in America you live. It's often said that you can predict the futures of many kids by finding out the zip code where they grew up. An online data tool being made public today lets you see for yourself the link between where you are and the American dream. Here's NPR's John Ydstie. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Economist Raj Chetty has been worried about the fading American dream for years. He's crunched the numbers. And they're troubling. If you were born in the 1940s or '50s, he says, you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did. But. . . RAJ CHETTY: You see that for kids turning 30 today who were born in the mid-1980s - only 50 percent of them go on to earn more than their parents did. That is, it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream. YDSTIE: Chetty and his colleagues at Opportunity Insights, a research and policy institute located at Harvard, want to improve those odds. So they've partnered with the U. S. Census Bureau to develop an online program. It works a lot like a Google map. You can see the whole country. Or you can zoom into local neighborhoods. And you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures. CHETTY: We are able to pinpoint, you know, what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder? What are the places where the outcomes don't look as good? And we've put this all out in the form of a publicly available, interactive tool called the Opportunity Atlas that we hope citizens, local policymakers, nonprofits, people working on these issues can use to make better decisions.

Late last night, Canada agreed to join the U. S. and Mexico in an updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It will no longer be called NAFTA but rather the USMCA. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Trump has long railed against NAFTA, calling it one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated. But in the White House Rose Garden this morning, Trump celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal. Trump called it a positive step for both the country and the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Once approved by Congress, this new deal will be the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed. HORSLEY: In signing on to the deal, Canada agreed to open up its long-protected dairy market, at least a little bit. Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Including milk, butter, cheese, yogurt and ice cream, to name a few. I want to be very specific. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)HORSLEY: But Canada is still expected to buy more than 90 percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers. Former U. S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who now heads the Dairy Export Council, says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much. TOM VILSACK: We're looking at an incremental increase in access. We're not certainly looking at an opening-wide of the market, but we are seeing an increase. HORSLEY: More importantly perhaps, the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the U. S. views as artificially low prices. In exchange for these concessions, the U. S. agreed not to scrap a NAFTA-era process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to. Preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: When your trading partner is 10 times your size, you need rules. You need a level playing field. HORSLEY: The U. S. and Mexico had reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago, but Canada didn't agree to sign on until late last night, just hours before a White House deadline. While Trudeau cautions there are still hoops to jump through before the deal is finalized, the threat of a trade agreement that left Canada on the sidelines has been averted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUDEAU: What I can say is that free and fair trade in North America is in a much more stable place than it was yesterday. HORSLEY: Markets rallied on the news with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining nearly 200 points. Trump, Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto are expected to sign the deal within 60 days, just before Pena Nieto leaves office. It will then be up to the incoming U. S. Congress to decide whether to approve the agreement. The president's trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, says he expects the deal to win backing from a lot of Democrats as well as Republicans. Celeste Drake, who oversees trade policy for the AFL-CIO, says while she still has a lot of questions about the fine print, the administration has been attentive to the concerns of organized labor. CELESTE DRAKE: Whatever else is going on in other parts of the administration, Ambassador Lighthizer has been very serious about listening to our ideas and wanting the support of working families. HORSLEY: White House aides say the new deal is a vindication of the president's hard-nosed negotiating tactics which have included stiff tariffs on U. S. allies and the threat of even harsher protectionist measures. The deal leaves intact for now U. S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico as well as the retaliatory tariffs on U. S. exports the North American neighbors imposed in response.

Supporters say freelance workers have more control over when and where they put in their hours. Critics say companies are simply looking to avoid paying benefits and are creating a second-class workforce. However you look at it, being an independent worker does come with some unique challenges and headaches, as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Kim Bui has been a freelance consultant off and on for two years and has learned this from the experience. KIM BUI: It's just excruciatingly difficult to manage our finances. NOGUCHI: In addition to the web design and social media work she's hired to do, Bui must also manage all her own office functions. BUI: No one really explains to you taxes and contracts and how to chase a client for that bill that they owe you, like, the nitty-gritty. NOGUCHI: Bui lives in Los Angeles with her husband who also works freelance as a graphic designer. They are among the rapidly expanding population of contingent workers that make up, by some estimates, a third of the U. S. workforce. They, like others, enjoy the flexibility of that work arrangement. On the other hand, neither of them has an employer contributing towards Social Security, health insurance, retirement or paid vacations. BUI: There's no such thing as maternity leave for freelancers. So we've put off the kids conversation for a tiny bit. NOGUCHI: She is also her own sales department, trying to keep clients in the pipeline. She says figuring out what to charge for her time is a challenge in and of itself. BUI: I actually just found out the other day I'm still undercharging people. NOGUCHI: Alastair Fitzpayne is executive director of The Aspen Institute's Future of Work Initiative. He says simply charging more isn't an option for many freelancers, especially if they work in low wage or very competitive fields. ALASTAIR FITZPAYNE: Freelancers are, you know, competing not just within their town, not just within their state but competing globally, and there's just huge global pressures on the amount that they can earn.

We see that freelancers as a result are really lagging behind employees when it comes to saving for retirement. NOGUCHI: Traditional employers contribute toward their workers' payroll taxes. That's not the case for the self-employed, who must pay both sides. And because taxes aren't automatically deducted from their paychecks, many must figure out what they owe on their own. Duke Chang founded bSolo in part to ease that burden. bSolo's service automatically estimates and pays taxes. Without that, Chang says, it's hard for freelancers to know how much they can save. DUKE CHANG: They are hesitant to lock anything in because they need the free cash flow in order to deal with taxes. NOGUCHI: That's certainly true for Alex Patton. Last year, the 24-year-old contract chef and freelance writer discovered he was short on his tax bill by several hundred dollars.

Does the place where you were born and raised determine how far you will get in life? Harvard economist Raj Chetty and colleagues recently developed an online tool called The Opportunity Atlas. It is a map. It's a map that uses tax and U. S. census data to track people's income from one generation to the next. And it reveals some uncomfortable truths. It turns out even what block you were born on can make a big difference. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports that in one New York City neighborhood, the divide is especially stark. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: When people find out where Audra Palacio is from, they often react in disbelief. AUDRA PALACIO: Well, how could you come from there, and you lived there? And it's like - almost as if it's like, I can't believe you made it out. GARSD: Palacio was born in the Linden Houses, a brick complex, public housing to several thousand families right next to Brownsville in Brooklyn. Nearly 40 percent of Brownsville lives in poverty. And if you look at The Opportunity Atlas and zoom into Brownsville, a lot of it is exactly what you'd expect. Black kids raised in the area 30-some years ago now make about $17,000 a year, same as their parents. But once you head across Dumont Avenue, everything changes. Black kids from the same exact background are doing better than their parents, making around $26,000 a year. To find out what happened on the other side of Dumont Avenue, people told me to go to church. DAVID K BRAWLEY: If the Lord has been good to you, you ought to thank him for blessing you. GARSD: Reverend David K. Brawley is one of the leaders of East Brooklyn Congregations. In his office, he tells me that in the early 1980s, Brownsville, N. Y. , was often referred to as. . . BRAWLEY: The beginning of the end of civilization - burnt-out homes, empty lots. People were leaving the city in droves. GARSD: In the '80s, New York City had been hard-hit by a recession, then the crack and HIV epidemics. There was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned - the other side of Dumont. The New York City government sold over 16 square blocks of Brownsville to the East Brooklyn Congregations for $1. Those blocks were dilapidated, rundown. The city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes. They would start selling at $30,000 each. They were called Nehemiah houses after the man in the Bible who rebuilt parts of Jerusalem. RUTH PALACIO: The family was growing, and we needed something that was much better for the children. GARSD: Ruth Palacio is Audra's mom. She and her husband came to New York from Honduras and Belize fleeing poverty. They identify as both black and Hispanic. They say they're grateful that public housing was available when they needed it but jumped on the chance to move on when the children were born. R. PALACIO: I didn't like elevators - up and down the elevators for my children because there was a lot of people living in the housing projects. GARSD: For a lot of people in Brownsville and the surrounding areas, coming up with $30,000 for a house was impossible. For the Palacio family, it took generations' worth of savings. R. PALACIO: My mother built her first house out of bamboo. Then eventually - she was hardworking. She used to trade. She built a house out of timber. Eventually, she built a house of concrete cement blocks, just like the story of the three little pigs. GARSD: Audra Palacio was 6 when they bought the house. A. PALACIO: I remember when we moved into Nehemiah's. We were so excited. We had rooms. We had space. We had a backyard. GARSD: In their new online tool, economist Raj Chetty and his colleagues at Harvard found that the sooner kids move out of an area with such limited opportunity, the better they will fare. When the Palacio family moved, they didn't just get a backyard. They shifted their future like a ship changing course. Here's Reverend Brawley. BRAWLEY: I'm not surprised when I look at this map and see the seed that has planted, there has been a harvest. GARSD: There are a lot of factors that determine a child's success. Having a mom like Ruth Palacio, tough but loving, is definitely one of them. But it turns out geography also matters. A lot of kids who moved here from public housing did a lot better than those they left behind. Reverend Brawley beams when I tell him two of the Palacio children are working on their master's and Ph. D. He says the Nehemiah houses in Brooklyn gave children a space to do homework, a good night's sleep. BRAWLEY: When people have ownership of their properties, ownership of their community, you have a better chance of addressing all core issues such as education and quality of life. GARSD: A neighborhood that can focus on more than just surviving the day-to-day. Brawley points out that those quaint $30,000 Nehemiah houses built on land once sold for a buck are now valued at as much as half a million. BRAWLEY: What has happened is that families now have wealth that they can pass down generationally. GARSD: And that's just what the Palacios did. They passed their Nehemiah home on to one of their daughters. After I leave the family, I walk just a few blocks to Dumont Avenue. According to the Atlas, it's the dividing line. On the map it looks jarring, but in person it's completely unspectacular. People bustle on their way to work. Cars zoom by. Just another New York City street - it means nothing. But what side you're on means everything. Jasmine Garsd, NPR News, New York. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Now, is geography destiny? Does the place where you were born and raised determine how far you will get in life? Harvard economist Raj Chetty and colleagues recently developed an online tool called The Opportunity Atlas. It is a map. It's a map that uses tax and U. S. census data to track people's income from one generation to the next. And it reveals some uncomfortable truths. It turns out even what block you were born on can make a big difference. NPR's Jasmine Garsd reports that in one New York City neighborhood, the divide is especially stark. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: When people find out where Audra Palacio is from, they often react in disbelief. AUDRA PALACIO: Well, how could you come from there, and you lived there? And it's like - almost as if it's like, I can't believe you made it out. GARSD: Palacio was born in the Linden Houses, a brick complex, public housing to several thousand families right next to Brownsville in Brooklyn. Nearly 40 percent of Brownsville lives in poverty. And if you look at The Opportunity Atlas and zoom into Brownsville, a lot of it is exactly what you'd expect. Black kids raised in the area 30-some years ago now make about $17,000 a year, same as their parents. But once you head across Dumont Avenue, everything changes. Black kids from the same exact background are doing better than their parents, making around $26,000 a year. To find out what happened on the other side of Dumont Avenue, people told me to go to church. DAVID K BRAWLEY: If the Lord has been good to you, you ought to thank him for blessing you.

But there aren't just more jobs. Cardiff Garcia of our Planet Money team says people are also changing jobs more often, and he's here to tell us more about this. Hi, Cardiff. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: What shows you that people are changing jobs, moving around more? GARCIA: Well, my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quits rate. That's just the share of people who quit, who voluntarily leave their jobs each month. It's now at its highest point in 17 years. So it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work and looking for something else. SHAPIRO: So you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate, that's actually a good sign economically. GARCIA: (Laughter) Yeah. I mean, individually, usually we associate quitting your job with, like, being fed up. You know, you've had it. But actually, if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy, it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere. They're leaving for a better job, or they're confident that they'll be able to find a better job when they do quit. SHAPIRO: And when you look at the economy as a whole, how much more opportunity for work is there? GARCIA: Actually a lot more. In fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people. This is the first year that that's been the case since the government started tracking these records back in the year 2000. And that doesn't mean that everyone who wants work will just slide into those open jobs. The jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are. They might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have. But it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it. SHAPIRO: And is that across the board, or in certain sectors, are there more job openings than others? GARCIA: No, no, it's consistent geographically across the U. S. , and it's also consistent across the entire U. S. economy. But there are some sectors that are more impressive than others. And if you look at the health care sector, food and accommodations, restaurants, hotels - and then there's this category called professional and business services. Those are, like, high-end services, things like design, accounting, law, advertising. In all of those sectors, you really see a lot of job opportunities. SHAPIRO: If employers have to compete so much for talent, why aren't wages going up faster than they are? GARCIA: You know, this has been puzzling economists for quite some time. But what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now said that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them. And so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work. And so companies are having to look for workers, yeah. But there are also more workers available to be found. SHAPIRO: What does all of this mean for the economy as a whole? GARCIA: You know, when the economy is more dynamic, it tends to give people more bargaining power. So wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years, very disappointing. It could be about to get better. It also makes the economy a bit more efficient, more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set, it makes them better at their jobs. And it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient. So it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy. SHAPIRO: That's Cardiff Garcia, co-host of our economic podcast The Indicator for Planet Money. Thanks a lot.

Twenty-five years ago this week was the last time the federal gas tax went up. Today, that tax is still what it was in 1993 - 18. 4 cents per gallon. And yet the costs of building and maintaining roads and bridges are going up. Here's more from NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: The first week of October 1993, the top TV shows were \"Home Improvement,\" \"Seinfeld\" and the first \"Roseanne. \" The top song was Mariah Carey's \"Dreamlover. \" You could still buy a Sony Walkman for 29. 95. Gas was just $1. 11 a gallon. And one of the top movies that year starred Bill Murray. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GROUNDHOG DAY\")BILL MURRAY: (As Phil) Rita, I'm reliving the same day over and over. CARL DAVIS: \"Groundhog Day\" is about Bill Murray's character getting caught in a time loop, and he spends decades reliving the same Groundhog Day. Those of us that have followed this gas tax debate can't help but feel some of that same repetition. SCHAPER: Carl Davis is with the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. And he says that's because the federal gas tax is still the same 18. 4 cents a gallon that it was when \"Groundhog Day\" was playing in theaters 25 years ago. DAVIS: The whole reason this tax exists is to keep our roads paved and to keep our bridges from falling down, and to do that effectively, it needs to collect a sustainable amount of revenue over time. And it can't do that if it's just not updated for decades at a time. SCHAPER: With rising construction and labor costs and less gas being used in more fuel-efficient cars, the purchasing power of the gas tax is now 64 percent less than it was in 1993. Illinois Transportation Secretary Randy Blankenhorn says that stagnant federal gas tax means less money to fix and improve his state's highways, bridges and transit systems. RANDY BLANKENHORN: We're losing revenue every day just because of inflation. Without new federal money, the cap of what we can do is there. We are right now simply maintaining what we have. SCHAPER: So Kevin Pula of the National Conference of State Legislatures says, while Congress won't raise the federal gas tax, states are taking action themselves. KEVIN PULA: In the last five years, we've seen many states - more than half of them, actually - enact legislation to increase funding for transportation. SCHAPER: Since 2010, 33 states have raised their own motor fuel taxes. Missouri could join them next month if voters approve a 10-cents-a-gallon gas tax hike. And Colorado voters are being asked to raise the sales tax to boost transportation funding. And many states are also now indexing their gas tax to inflation so it'll go up as construction costs rise. Some states are also trying alternatives to the gas tax like mileage-based user fees that will tax electric cars that also wear down roads but don't use gas. Staying with that \"Groundhog Day\" theme, Congress does hold hearings from time to time on ways to hike federal funding for transportation, but there's almost never a vote. Here's Nevada Congresswoman Dina Titus at one such hearing almost two years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DINA TITUS: We're having this same conversation, same rhetoric - need to fix the infrastructure. We need to look at this. It's just a matter of paying for it. But there's no substantive plan. SCHAPER: So when it comes to congressional inaction on transportation funding, as the late baseball legend Yogi Berra might say, it's deja vu all over again.

S. -Mexico-Canada trade deal. And indeed, some analysts are cautiously optimistic about it. But for many Americans from farmers to factory workers, the biggest news is not what's in the deal. It's the fact that there is a deal at all. NPR's Camila Domonoske has the story. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Kevin Scott is a farmer in South Dakota. He's on the board of the American Soybean Association. And he's normally pretty busy this time of year. But last week, he was sitting in his office with a magazine. KEVIN SCOTT: I am reading Dakota Farmer. DOMONOSKE: The weather wasn't cooperating. SCOTT: We had 6 1/2 inches of rain about a week ago, and then our weather's been overcast ever since and cool. And it makes it hard to do any combining on soybeans. That's for sure. DOMONOSKE: So he had plenty of time to explain how he feels about NAFTA. SCOTT: There were some things that needed to be modernized. And we don't dispute that. We were pretty concerned, though, when it was pulled off the table. DOMONOSKE: Soybean farmers are already reeling from tariffs imposed by China which have slashed sales to the largest export market. Losing sales to Mexico would be another blow. SCOTT: The benefits sneak up on you. Trade develops slowly over time. These things get opened up. And then when they shut off, then you know what you've lost. DOMONOSKE: So he's glad that there's a deal to replace NAFTA even if it just preserves the status quo for soybeans. To put it another way, he's relieved that negotiations are over rather than rejoicing at the outcome. Doyle Lentz, who farms wheat and barley in North Dakota, feels the same way even though he does see a benefit for wheat farmers in this deal. They'll be able to sell more wheat to Canada at fairer prices. Lentz is happy about that, but. . . DOYLE LENTZ: I don't think there was any need to open NAFTA from an agriculture standpoint. Most of these things could have been remedied by just having, you know, an open communication and dialogue. I guess I'm more of the belief that's how you do negotiations and trade than, you know, hold a gun to somebody's head. DOMONOSKE: Threatening to shred a functioning trade deal? LENTZ: Not worth the risk. There just wasn't enough benefit-risk ratio for me to open that up. DOMONOSKE: It's not just farmers who are relieved that negotiations are over. Robert Gruschow is the president of Deshler Group, headquartered in Livonia, Mich. The company has more than 400 employees. ROBERT GRUSCHOW: We supply everything from IT and global freight to manufacturing and assembly and warehousing primarily for automotive. DOMONOSKE: He says that when the NAFTA renegotiations began, his business was in the middle of growing. GRUSCHOW: We're in the process of expanding a facility in Ohio, our main and largest facility for metal forming products. DOMONOSKE: Think metal rods and tubes that go into cars. But the uncertainty about NAFTA threw the fortunes of the auto industry into doubt. GRUSCHOW: Certainly that was a nervous time period for us as we're expanding, expecting future business and not really knowing what the future might hold. DOMONOSKE: Gruschow says some elements of the new deal might help his company, like requiring a higher percentage of car parts to be made in North America. But his main takeaway. . . GRUSCHOW: I think whatever the deal, whether it's net a beneficial or not to the auto industry, I think knowing and understanding what's coming is a relief. DOMONOSKE: Of course not all the uncertainty is gone. Steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place. There's the big trade war with China. And the new deal still needs to be approved by Congress.

KEVIN SCOTT: I am reading Dakota Farmer. DOMONOSKE: The weather wasn't cooperating. SCOTT: We had 6 1/2 inches of rain about a week ago, and then our weather's been overcast ever since and cool. And it makes it hard to do any combining on soybeans. That's for sure. DOMONOSKE: So he had plenty of time to explain how he feels about NAFTA. SCOTT: There were some things that needed to be modernized. And we don't dispute that. We were pretty concerned, though, when it was pulled off the table. DOMONOSKE: Soybean farmers are already reeling from tariffs imposed by China which have slashed sales to the largest export market. Losing sales to Mexico would be another blow. SCOTT: The benefits sneak up on you. Trade develops slowly over time. These things get opened up. And then when they shut off, then you know what you've lost. DOMONOSKE: So he's glad that there's a deal to replace NAFTA even if it just preserves the status quo for soybeans. To put it another way, he's relieved that negotiations are over rather than rejoicing at the outcome. Doyle Lentz, who farms wheat and barley in North Dakota, feels the same way even though he does see a benefit for wheat farmers in this deal. They'll be able to sell more wheat to Canada at fairer prices. Lentz is happy about that, but. . . DOYLE LENTZ: I don't think there was any need to open NAFTA from an agriculture standpoint. Most of these things could have been remedied by just having, you know, an open communication and dialogue. I guess I'm more of the belief that's how you do negotiations and trade than, you know, hold a gun to somebody's head. DOMONOSKE: Threatening to shred a functioning trade deal? LENTZ: Not worth the risk. There just wasn't enough benefit-risk ratio for me to open that up. DOMONOSKE: It's not just farmers who are relieved that negotiations are over. Robert Gruschow is the president of Deshler Group, headquartered in Livonia, Mich. The company has more than 400 employees. ROBERT GRUSCHOW: We supply everything from IT and global freight to manufacturing and assembly and warehousing primarily for automotive. DOMONOSKE: He says that when the NAFTA renegotiations began, his business was in the middle of growing. GRUSCHOW: We're in the process of expanding a facility in Ohio, our main and largest facility for metal forming products. DOMONOSKE: Think metal rods and tubes that go into cars. But the uncertainty about NAFTA threw the fortunes of the auto industry into doubt. GRUSCHOW: Certainly that was a nervous time period for us as we're expanding, expecting future business and not really knowing what the future might hold. DOMONOSKE: Gruschow says some elements of the new deal might help his company, like requiring a higher percentage of car parts to be made in North America. But his main takeaway. . . GRUSCHOW: I think whatever the deal, whether it's net a beneficial or not to the auto industry, I think knowing and understanding what's coming is a relief. DOMONOSKE: Of course not all the uncertainty is gone. Steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place. There's the big trade war with China. And the new deal still needs to be approved by Congress.

It's a way to move Chinese exports to important markets, including the European Union. And in Europe, it all began in the Greek port of Piraeus. The Chinese shipping giant COSCO has spent millions transforming it into the fastest growing port in the world. But as Joanna Kakissis reports from Piraeus, this has come at a price. (SOUNDBITE OF NEVER ON SUNDAY THEME, \"TA PEDIA TOU PIREA\")JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: The port of Piraeus is as iconic to Greeks as the Acropolis. It's where warriors set out for ancient sea battles and where Hollywood docked for the 1960 film \"Never On Sunday. \"(SOUNDBITE OF NEVER ON SUNDAY THEME, \"TA PEDIA TOU PIREA\")MELINA MERCOURI: (Singing in Greek). KAKISSIS: Actress Melina Mercouri, saying that there's no port she loved as much as Piraeus. GIORGOS AND MARIA NOUCHOUTIDIS: (Singing in Greek). KAKISSIS: Retired stevedore Giorgos Nouchoutidis and his wife Maria know the song by heart. He worked at the port of Piraeus for 35 years. GIORGOS NOUCHOUTIDIS: (Through interpreter) This is my city. This is my father's city. When I started at the port, we didn't have many machines to load cargo onto the ships. We just did it with our own hands. We loaded bags of clothes, leather goods, knitwear, all made in Greece, all bound for North America and Australia. KAKISSIS: He says Piraeus took care of its dock workers. He made good money and now has a good pension. He flips a string of worry beads as he reminisces in his living room under a watercolor painting of a ship. G. NOUCHOUTIDIS: (Through interpreter) Piraeus is in a blessed location. It's across from the Suez Canal. It's deep enough for big ships. It's got everything to be successful. KAKISSIS: But for years, when the Greek state owned the port, bureaucratic red tape made it hard to attract investment. Then came the debt crisis, which began in 2010 and ravaged the Greek economy. The EU pushed Greece to privatize the port of Piraeus. Only the Chinese showed serious interest. The Chinese shipping giant COSCO took over the port in 2016. It now owns a majority stake in the Port Authority. COSCO runs cargo terminals, cruise ship piers and the largest passenger ferry wharf in Europe. And the Chinese are not stopping there. KRITON VALLERAS: They want to expand the car terminal. They want to expand. They want to create a logistics center. They want to build a new cruise terminal. KAKISSIS: Kriton Valleras advises the Greek shipping ministry. He's aware the Chinese lease on the port will run out in about 35 years. VALLERAS: If at some point in the future they want to abandon Piraeus, we will have all these investments. They will not take them with with them, OK? They will leave them here. KAKISSIS: So you see it as entirely a win-win. VALLERAS: Yes. KAKISSIS: Win-win, those are the words of Captain Fu Cheng Qiu, COSCO's CEO in Piraeus, heard here in 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FU CHENG QIU: It's a win-win to Greece and to COSCO. KAKISSIS: One of the port union leaders, Anastasia Frantzeskaki, has another interpretation. ANASTASIA FRANTZESKAKI: When the Chinese say win-win, they mean they win twice. KAKISSIS: She says the benefits mainly go to China. FRANTZESKAKI: They expand their influence. They expand their technology. They expand their know-how, their way to organize and doing business. They expand all these things in Europe. KAKISSIS: You can actually hear the Chinese expansion at the cargo terminals, which are busy 24 hours a day. Straddle carriers lift giant metal containers of goods onto ships. Workers in bright yellow safety vests are everywhere. These are coveted jobs in a country where the unemployment rate is 20 percent. But most of the 1,700 workers at the port are temps without labor rights. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Yelling in Greek). KAKISSIS: Two years ago, hundreds protested and battled police over COSCO's takeover and their working conditions. Thirty-year-old stevedore Markos Bekris recalled how he and his colleagues worked long hours in unsafe conditions for less pay. MARKOS BEKRIS: (Through interpreter) Workers were too scared to speak up. They kept their heads down, working straight shifts without breaks, even to go to the bathroom. Some of my co-workers had to relieve themselves in plastic bottles. KAKISSIS: Now, he says, at least they can take 20-minute breaks during shifts. Only about 250 workers are in the Greek dockworkers union run by Giorgos Gogos. He cannot stomach the new reality for most workers at the port and blames COSCO. GIORGOS GOGOS: They want silent, obedient, cheap workers with no unions. And this means no rights. What's the future? We don't this future. We have taken from our fathers a past with certain rights, certain conditions, and want to pass it to our children, to our future dockworkers. KAKISSIS: COSCO's Piraeus CEO, Fu Cheng Qiu, and his deputy declined NPR's interview requests. A COSCO spokesman said in an email that after, quote, \"long and productive negotiations,\" a labor agreement was signed that benefits both sides. The European Union's been largely silent on the labor concerns. But Christos Lambridis, Greece's secretary of ports, says he has heard from EU officials who are suddenly worried that China's running a European port. CHRISTOS LAMBRIDIS: (Through interpreter) We're all aware that the Chinese state is behind a company like COSCO. But it was the EU that pushed us to sell our port to COSCO in the first place. We were in debt. We had little bargaining power. KAKISSIS: He says the EU underestimated China. (SOUNDBITE OF NEVER ON SUNDAY THEME, \"TA PEDIA TOU PIREA\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in Chinese).

The problem is really visible in big cities but also in some that you might not think of, like Boise, Idaho, which is the fastest growing city in the U. S. Amanda Peacher of Boise State Public Radio recently spent time with one eighth grader who is living this reality. AMANDA PEACHER, BYLINE: Caydden Zimmerman's school days start early and end late. He has an hour-and-a-half-long bus ride to get from the homeless shelter where he's staying to middle school. CAYDDEN ZIMMERMAN: Wake up 5:45, brush my teeth, do my hair and then I hurry and rush downstairs so I can get out and catch my bus on time. PEACHER: Caydden is staying at the shelter with his 11-year-old brother and his grandma, Pam Cantrell. She says they moved here after getting an eviction notice. PAM CANTRELL: The landlord decided to sell the property. And we just could not find a place that we could afford. The more I looked, the more depressed I got. I just - I didn't know what to do. PEACHER: Cantrell gets a small disability stipend from the government, but that's nowhere near enough to cover rent in Boise. Cantrell is grateful for the shelter but says it's hard on her grandsons. CANTRELL: My youngest one, he can be a little terror because he's upset by it, you know? He gets angry. And then he'll sit in the corner. And he'll just say, I hate this place. I hate this place. PEACHER: It's difficult for Caydden, too. But you wouldn't always know it. Caydden is a social 14-year-old with a big smile. One of his favorite things about school is seeing his friends. CAYDDEN: My friends know about it, me being homeless. And they don't tease me on it. I'm trying to work hard - and that it's just an effort to try not to break down. PEACHER: It's harder for students who are anxious and worried to concentrate. Homeless kids tend to score lower on standardized tests and have lower graduation rates. And sometimes, Caydden does break down with his friends. CAYDDEN: They always bring me up when I'm feeling down. They make me smile when I'm sad. PEACHER: In this moment, though, Caydden is doing OK. CAYDDEN: Hey, Ash. PEACHER: It's lunchtime at school. Caydden carries his tray of food to a table with his friends. CAYDDEN: Yeah, you can have some. You can have these since I have better ones. PEACHER: Caydden's dad is out of the picture, and his mom has a drug problem. Before his grandma stepped in, he had to help take care of his little brother. CAYDDEN: Help get him ready for school - I had to feed Keston when Mom was passed out for days. There was one time when we only had cereal for, like, two weeks. PEACHER: Caydden has been trying to convince his grandma that she should let him get a job so he can help with rent. CAYDDEN: It's, like, something I want to do. I just want to help out. PEACHER: But Cantrell won't have it. CANTRELL: You need to be a child as long as possible, Caydden. You don't want to be in a big hurry to grow up, honey. PEACHER: A few weeks later, there's good news in Caydden's world. They got a house. It's about 700 square feet that they share with a roommate. For Caydden, it's a huge improvement.

U. S. stocks saw their biggest sell-off in six months. The Dow fell 831 points, which is a 3 percent decline. Here to talk about exactly what happened is NPR's John Ydstie. Hey, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So what made the market plummet today? YDSTIE: Yeah. It was a tough day, and a number of things contributed. Let's start with interest rates. Rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks. That's made the market nervous. In fact, this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S&P 500. Rising interest rates make stocks less valuable, and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go. The Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually, and it has suggested it will stop raising benchmark rates between 3 and 3 1/2 percent. So it still has a way to go to get there. CHANG: So the way I understand it, the Fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation, right? YDSTIE: Right. CHANG: Are there fears of inflation right now? YDSTIE: Well, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating. However, the economy is clearly very strong, and the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, so there's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly, and that could create inflation pressures. CHANG: But you're saying the economy remains strong, so shouldn't that be good for the stock market? YDSTIE: The economy is strong in the U. S. and most commentators are saying today's sell-off is not the end of the bull market and stocks here. But while the U. S. economy remains strong, Europe has cooled a bit, as have emerging markets. And the IMF gave a less-than-glowing assessment of the global economy this week - less glowing than it did just a few months ago. And, of course, there are concerns about global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies, the U. S. and China, and that hurts stocks. CHANG: Are there any particular areas of the market that have been hurt by the sell-off? YDSTIE: Well, virtually, all sectors of the market sold off today, wiping out all the stock gains since midsummer. But the tech sector has been hit the hardest, and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market. In fact, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 4 percent of its value today, and the S&P 500, which also has a lot of tech, lost 3 1/3 percent. So it's been a very tough day for tech. CHANG: A very tough day, but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market? YDSTIE: Well, most analysts I heard from today don't think so. Some said the selling toward the end of the day, which took the Dow down from around 500 points to 830 points down, was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling. Given the strength of the U. S. economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses, it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down. But we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the Fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession. We're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks. We'll see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow. And then the U. S. market will have another crack at it, and we'll see what happens. CHANG: I guess we'll see. That's NPR's John Ydstie. Thanks, John. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

CHANG: But you're saying the economy remains strong, so shouldn't that be good for the stock market? YDSTIE: The economy is strong in the U. S. and most commentators are saying today's sell-off is not the end of the bull market and stocks here. But while the U. S. economy remains strong, Europe has cooled a bit, as have emerging markets. And the IMF gave a less-than-glowing assessment of the global economy this week - less glowing than it did just a few months ago. And, of course, there are concerns about global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the world's two biggest economies, the U. S. and China, and that hurts stocks. CHANG: Are there any particular areas of the market that have been hurt by the sell-off? YDSTIE: Well, virtually, all sectors of the market sold off today, wiping out all the stock gains since midsummer. But the tech sector has been hit the hardest, and it's been one of the foundations of this bull market. In fact, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 4 percent of its value today, and the S&P 500, which also has a lot of tech, lost 3 1/3 percent. So it's been a very tough day for tech. CHANG: A very tough day, but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market? YDSTIE: Well, most analysts I heard from today don't think so. Some said the selling toward the end of the day, which took the Dow down from around 500 points to 830 points down, was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling. Given the strength of the U. S. economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in American businesses, it's difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down. But we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the Fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession. We're also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates they're paying is starting to compete with stocks. We'll see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow. And then the U. S. market will have another crack at it, and we'll see what happens. CHANG: I guess we'll see. That's NPR's John Ydstie. Thanks, John.

The Dow is off more than 200 points. This is after a dramatic sell-off yesterday. Stock prices had their worst drop since February with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing more than 3 percent of its value. And that sell-off rippled through international markets today, with stocks falling across Asia, and also across Europe. Let's bring in NPR's Jim Zarroli, who's in New York. Hi there, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So how are the markets looking at this moment? ZARROLI: Yeah, looks like another volatile day. I mean, we had a brief period where stocks were positive right after they opened, but now they're dropping again. If it continues, this will be the sixth straight day the S&P 500 is down. You know, it seems like the mood in the market has really changed. Investors are trying to come to grips with some of the big issues on the table. GREENE: Yeah. What has changed? What are investors coming to grips with? ZARROLI: Well, one of the important things is interest rates. The Fed has been raising rates for a while now. You have the central banks in Europe and Japan doing it as well. When that happens, it makes borrowing more expensive. But it also - when rates go up, bonds become more attractive, so people take money out of stocks and put it in bonds. Also, this continuing trade tension with China - that's certainly a factor. You know, we have this new agreement with Canada and Mexico, but it doesn't even really look like - that, like, we're talking with China. So I think invest - a lot of American companies do business in China and will be affected by that. How badly we - they are affected, we should see in the next few weeks because this is the time of year when companies begin to say how they did in the third quarter. So we will learn more. But right now, I think a lot of investors are just nervous. They're seeing what's happening with our trade with China, and that's being reflected in the markets. GREENE: You know, when the stocks are doing well, President Trump likes to point to it as some sort of indication of the economy. What does this say, or not say, about the state of the economy? ZARROLI: Well, the stock market is not the economy, so you can have turbulence in the market even when the overall economy is doing well, which, certainly, is the message the president wants to send. He put out a statement yesterday after that big sell-off saying the fundamentals of the economy are, quote, \"incredibly strong. \"However, it's important to remember, you know, stock market investors are always looking ahead. So they can think that conditions are good right now but, you know, not be so sure about the future. And clearly, the markets are worried about interest rates and trade. And the president is worried, too, because he, again, yesterday, criticized the Fed for raising interest rates. He said, I think that the Fed has gone crazy. Larry Kudlow, who directs the National Economic Council, tried to walk back some of the criticism today on CNBC. But the president clearly doesn't like what the Fed is doing. GREENE: All right.

More than a dozen cities sold these permits to operate cabs. And medallion values rose to hundreds of thousands of dollars - even more than a million dollars in New York City. Then along came Lyft and Uber, and the market for medallions melted down. KQED's Sam Harnett reports on what that is doing to cab drivers in San Francisco. SAM HARNETT, BYLINE: Yana Kiziryan's son looks just like his grandfather Edward. YANA KIZIRYAN: Hey, Eddy. HARNETT: What's his name? KIZIRYAN: Eddy. HARNETT: Hey, Eddy. KIZIRYAN: Edward after my dad. HARNETT: Yana's family's Armenian. In 1991, they came to the U. S. as refugees from Azerbaijan. KIZIRYAN: We got really lucky that the U. S. took us in. HARNETT: Yana's Dad Edward drove taxi. He loved it and dreamed of owning a medallion. These little tin permits used to be awarded on seniority. But to try to balance the transportation budget after the 2008 financial crisis, San Francisco started selling them for $250,000. That was still a good deal with a medallion. Drivers could make between five and seven grand a month. Edward got a loan and bought one. KIZIRYAN: He thought if anything ever happens to me - if I were to die, the family would be set. It was like his retirement plan. HARNETT: But then Lyft and Uber flooded the streets with cars. They operated without medallions or a cap on how many vehicles could be on the road. That drove down prices for rides and earnings for all kinds of drivers. Edward's income plummeted. His blood pressure began to go up, and he started gaining weight. KIZIRYAN: He became increasingly just restless and nervous. And there were months where they didn't have quite enough to pay all of their bills, and, like, I would help them out sometimes. HARNETT: Two years ago, the family was out of town, and Edward stayed home to drive. He went to the airport, like he did every day. KIZIRYAN: You know, his friends at the airport right away noticed something was wrong because he said, oh, I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go home. And they looked at him. And I guess he was like green or something. And they were like, no, you're going to the hospital. HARNETT: Edward's aorta had torn, and he soon passed away. He was just 59 years old. The market for taxi medallions in San Francisco is frozen. Not one has been bought or sold for over two years. The city recently held a meeting with drivers. Almost all the drivers want the same thing - for the city to buy back the medallions - drivers like Inder Jitghotra and Magdi Yousef. INDER JITGHOTRA: Me, my brother, we bought six medallions in the beginning. We are under the water. Some family members want to file for bankruptcy. We have no other option. MAGDI YOUSEF: I already suffer two heart attacks. I feel like I'm dying slowly. This medallion is killing me slowly. HARNETT: Around 700 drivers bought medallions, making the city about $63 million. Over 150 of these drivers have now defaulted on these toxic assets. Kate Toran manages the taxi program for the city. KATE TORAN: If Kate Toran, director of taxis and accessible services, had a magic wand and could say this can all go away, of course - who wouldn't want to do that? HARNETT: The city is considering a few changes to thaw the medallion market. But unlike New York City, it hasn't put a cap on the number of Lyfts and Ubers on the road. The city is also not talking about buying back the medallions, which Toran estimates would cost $160 million. TORAN: That's not on the list of recommendations at this point. I think that's unlikely. HARNETT: After Edward's death, Yana Kiziryan's family was still plagued by the medallion. No one wanted to buy it from them. So they defaulted on their loan and took a massive hit on their credit. Yana wants the city to do something for the other drivers. Many are still out there on the road just trying to break even on the little pieces of tin they invested their lives in.

The biggest bust of all targeted a trailer manufacturer in northeast Texas. Immigration police hauled off more than 150 workers from the plant. As NPR's John Burnett reports, the raids have employers howling that the immigration crackdown is undermining another administration priority of boosting manufacturing in America. (SOUNDBITE OF WELDING METAL)JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: The sounds of raw steel being turned into trailers. It's brutish labor. Cut the metal, hammer it into place, arc weld it, repeat. Business was booming here at the Load Trail plant northeast of Dallas. Their heavy black trailers are popular for hauling hay bales, topsoil and oilfield equipment. Then came the raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in late August. Jake Thiessen, whose family founded this plant, takes me onto the production floor, and I ask him why it's half empty. JAKE THIESSEN: Well, there should be a lot more welding going on on this floor right now. It's very slow now. BURNETT: I hear your production is down, like, 40 percent. THIESSEN: Yeah. BURNETT: Over in company headquarters, Load Trail CEO Kevin Hiebert remembers the morning of August 28, when a helicopter thumped overhead and 300 ICE agents swarmed into his yard. KEVIN HIEBERT: It looked like something that you typically would see out of the movies, not something you ever plan on living out in (laughter) real life. BURNETT: ICE rounded up nearly a quarter of Hiebert's workforce, loaded them into buses and booked them for working in the country unlawfully. A criminal investigation of the company continues. So far this year, ICE agents have stormed 7-Elevens, a meatpacking plant, dairy and vegetable farms, and a feedlot. Katrina Berger, Chief Homeland Security Investigator in the Dallas office, read a statement to reporters after the Load Trail raid. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATRINA BERGER: Businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens create an unfair advantage over the competing businesses. In addition, they take jobs away from U. S. citizens and legal residents. BURNETT: But you won't hear that complaint in Tigertown. This flyspeck community amid cotton fields near the Oklahoma border is home to a half-dozen major trailer manufacturers, all competitors. Does the American trailer industry depend on undocumented labor? HIEBERT: I can make a broader statement. I think the manufacturing industry in Texas, any kind of steel fabrication, construction, depends on immigrant labor, illegal immigrant labor. BURNETT: That's what Hiebert thinks, and he's not alone. The vice president of a competing trailer maker down the road agrees. He says they all depend on illegal labor. He asked not to be named in hopes of staying off ICE's radar. But it's too late for that. ICE is currently auditing employee records of every trailer manufacturer out here to find out which workers have fake identity documents. Some unauthorized employees are so rattled, they're not showing up for work. Kevin Hiebert says what his industry needs are legal guest workers. HIEBERT: Especially now that they're cranking up on the enforcement, everybody hopes that there will be some kind of a real immigration reform before what happens at Load Trail happens to them. BURNETT: Load Trail has been in trouble before. In 2014, the company was fined $445,000 for employing more than 170 unauthorized immigrants at its plant. Hiebert says they hire who walks in the door, and they pay decent wages - $20 to $25 an hour. Still, they've always had a hard time finding welders. So the work is done by men like Ignacio Barrios. He's a sturdy, 36-year-old welder who came here illegally from Oaxaca, Mexico. He wears an American flag T-shirt and sits in the church that's helping to support his family of five now that he's out of work. Barrios paid a $5,000 bond to get out of detention. Now he's waiting for his day in immigration court. IGNACIO BARRIOS: (Through interpreter) You have to work hard. Lots of times, you get injured, burned. You break your fingers. It gets over a hundred degrees in there. I've seen that Americans don't want to do the kind of work that we do. BURNETT: Lamar County, where the ICE raid went down, is crimson Trump country. Yet, to hear the trailer bosses tell it, the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement now threatens one of the county's lifebloods. I took this conundrum to the old boys down at the Dairy Queen in the county seat of Paris. They meet every morning to solve the world's problems. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Just coffee this morning? BURNETT: Here's Alan Helberg, a former hospital administrator. ALAN HELBERG: This country will not survive if we don't straighten the way they can come over here and work - because I guarantee you the Americans are not going to do that. BURNETT: And his buddy, Jerry Akers, a retired dentist. JERRY AKERS: The Congress of the United States needs to get off their duff and pass some meaningful legislation where people come here and work legally and not have to be afraid of getting uprooted. BURNETT: Immigration reform is so far dead in the water in the gridlocked Congress, and back at Tigertown, the trailer makers say if they can't find enough welders, they would consider moving their whole operations to Mexico.

That's a question of fact behind the hyperbole of the fall election. President Trump has been framing immigration as a matter of identity politics and conspiracy theories. He talks of immigrants overwhelming this nation of immigrants and speaks of Middle Easterners among them, although he admits he has no evidence. But there is a question about the labor market here. Do you think immigrants are taking your job or doing jobs that Americans would not? Ethan Lewis is a labor economist at Dartmouth, and he's on the line. Good morning. ETHAN LEWIS: Good morning. INSKEEP: In the broadest sense, do immigrants, as they come to the United States at this time, boost the economy? LEWIS: Yes, they do. You wouldn't know it from the rhetoric, but that is the basic story that comes out of economic research, that Central American immigrants in particular are highly beneficial to the U. S. economy. INSKEEP: How could that be - because we hear about how they arrive with very few skills, in many cases, and may demand services and that sort of thing? LEWIS: Well, the reason is related to what you said. Because they have very little skills, there are very few Americans with which they compete. And instead, it's almost the opposite. They do jobs at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder. And that opens up opportunities for native-born Americans to move up the economic ladder. INSKEEP: To move up the economic ladder - they don't just drag down wages for those low-end jobs? LEWIS: No. And the reason is that Americans have a key advantage over Central American migrants, which is they speak English very well. So hiring immigrants allows natives to specialize in what they are particularly good at - things like supervisory work, sales. So there's actually more opportunities for low-skill workers as a result of bringing in workers who can do more manual jobs. INSKEEP: Is it also true that a larger population over time just generally means more economic growth, a bigger country can be more prosperous? LEWIS: Yes, indeed. So another thing that gets left out of the discussion is that they come in; they are also not just workers but consumers. So their demand for products and services is part of what fuels the greater amount of job opportunities that comes as a result of their being here. INSKEEP: Let me ask about one other aspect of this, though. We're talking about low-skilled migrants, people who come across the border from Mexico, the kind of people in this much-publicized caravan - typically, anyway. But immigrants are extraordinarily diverse. And some of them are exceptionally high-skilled. And are brought in under. . . LEWIS: Yes. INSKEEP: . . . Special visas by corporations. Are there high-skilled immigrants who are in some way damaging to the overall job prospects and possibilities of people already here? LEWIS: Well, I mean, the thing is they also tend to be specialized. I mean, the big gains from immigration come from skill diversity. And immigration brings in ideas and new opportunities from all over the world. And so even high-skill immigration - and by the way, that's one thing that's been lost. The vast majority of immigrants are very high-skill. Even they contribute a lot to the economy by starting businesses, creating new ideas, etc. INSKEEP: So when you hear the immigration debate in this fall election, do you say to yourself, wow, this is a really factual and informative debate? LEWIS: (Laughter) No. You know, it's hard to get these points across. They're fairly subtle. But there's a very big absence of just basic facts. And I hope - you know, your report will help with that, I think. INSKEEP: Ethan Lewis of Dartmouth College, thanks very much for joining us this morning. LEWIS: Thank you.

S. economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government. The Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was 3. 5 percent during the quarter. But NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble, including weak business spending. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: As he often does, President Trump painted today's numbers as historic and unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They just announced an estimate of 3. 5. And these are numbers that were not even thought about. ZARROLI: In fact, the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected, and it was a drop from the 4. 2 percent growth rate in the second quarter. Still, the numbers were impressive. Former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market. JARED BERNSTEIN: Lots of people are working and drawing paychecks. Even if those paychecks aren't growing as fast as we might like, that's going to fuel economic growth. And in this report, in fact, the strongest sector was consumer spending. ZARROLI: Americans spent at an especially fast rate during the quarter. They took more trips and ate out in restaurants more. Elie Maalouf is Americas CEO of IHG, the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and Kimpton, among other brands, which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace. ELIE MAALOUF: We set records around Labor Day and Memorial Day this year and the Fourth of July in terms of travel. And so they're spending more per trip, and they're spending more with us. ZARROLI: But it wasn't just people who were spending more. Government spending was also up. Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February, a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals. Defense spending in particular was high. Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy. BERNSTEIN: All that deficit spending shows up in GDP, and that's helping to juice the growth rate. ZARROLI: For all the good news in today's reports, there were some disquieting signs. Business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight-tenths of a percentage point, a meager number. Despite the big cut in business taxes, there was little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies. Gregory Daco is chief U. S. economist at Oxford Economics. GREGORY DACO: When you take a look outside of the consumer realm, you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U. S. economy, in particular when it comes to business activity. ZARROLI: Those headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates. Higher rates tend to dampen spending by people and businesses over time, and there are already signs of weakness in the housing and car markets. Daco also cites a gradual slowing in the global economy in Europe and Asia. Meanwhile, the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year. Daco says that should bring the growth rate under 3 percent next year. DACO: We should expect to see somewhat slower momentum, but overall, the economy is still doing quite well. ZARROLI: Another question mark hanging over the economy is trade. There is what Daco calls a growing spirit of protectionism right now. The US has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, and China has retaliated. There's no telling what impact that will have, but for now, Americans are working and spending, and that is keeping the growth rate strong. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

The evidence? Low inflation and extremely low unemployment. But the Fed's success has also undermined one of the basic theories it has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related. It's called the Phillips curve. NPR's John Ydstie explains. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: For many years, the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low, inflation heated up. But these days, jobs are very plentiful, yet inflation remains very low. That's got some people writing the obituary for the Phillips curve. JAMES BULLARD: If you put it in a murder mystery framework - \"Who Killed The Phillips Curve? \" - it was the Fed that killed the Phillips curve. YDSTIE: Some Federal Reserve humor from James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve bank, who we spoke to about a week ago. And what was the murder weapon? Well, Bullard says, it was the Fed's long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable. BULLARD: The Fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last 20 years. And because of that, we have lower inflation, more stable inflation. And so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation. YDSTIE: So, Bullard says, the Phillips curve isn't working. But rumors of its death may be exaggerated. It's certainly still invoked during the debates within the Fed about whether to raise interest rates. Some policymakers argue that, with unemployment so low right now, the Fed should be raising interest rates much more rapidly to head off inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach. Here he is earlier this month in an interview on the \"PBS NewsHour. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"PBS NEWSHOUR\")JUDY WOODRUFF: So you've repealed the Phillips curve? JEROME POWELL: I wouldn't say it's dead. It might be resting. YDSTIE: A little more central bank humor, this time an apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch. A man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS\")JOHN CLEESE: (As Mr. Praline) I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique. MICHAEL PALIN: (As Shop Owner) Oh, yes, the Norwegian blue - what's wrong with it? CLEESE: (As Mr. Praline) I'll tell you what's wrong with it. It's dead. That's what's wrong with it. (LAUGHTER)PALIN: (As Shop Owner) No, no. It's resting. Look. CLEESE: (As Mr. Praline) Look, matey. I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now. (LAUGHTER)PALIN: (As Shop Owner) No, no. It's not dead. It's resting. CLEESE: (As Mr. Praline) Resting? PALIN: (As Shop Owner) Yeah. YDSTIE: The Phillips curve could just be resting. But with the help of a sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth, says former Fed economist Ann Owen. ANN OWEN: The traditional way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages. YDSTIE: And wage growth in the U. S. has been sluggish, which is part of the reason inflation is staying low. Whether the Phillips curve is dead or just resting, its long slumber has been useful for the Fed, says Owen, who is now a professor at Hamilton College. The U. S. economy's extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the Fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy responds. Owen thinks Fed officials are fine with that situation. OWEN: If you ask the Fed - do you want low and stable inflation, or do you want really rapid inflation because that would confirm your belief about how the economy works? - I have to believe that most of the people at the Fed would say, give me low and stable inflation.

Its stated aim is to make it easier for citizens to do business and help them to trust each other more. It's similar to the American credit score, but much more sweeping. It tracks far more than financial transactions and is called the Social Credit score. Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from The Indicator podcast explain. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Many people in China don't have bank accounts, don't really have much of a credit history. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: So China has never created something quite like the American credit score. RACHEL BOTSMAN: And so there is, for lack of a better word, a trust deficit in China that is impacting economic activity. VANEK SMITH: Rachel Botsman teaches trust and technology and is the author of \"Who Can You Trust. \" She says a lack of trust in people and businesses has held China's economy back. GARCIA: So when China decided to make a centralized score, the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them. VANEK SMITH: And you know who has lots of data on how people behave? Companies, especially big companies like Alibaba. That is China's version of Amazon. Alibaba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called Sesame Credit. So the government has been working with Alibaba in the development of people's Social Credit score. GARCIA: The way people are scored, it's not simply whether they miss a bill. It could be what they buy online. I mean, I think the example that the head of Sesame Credit publicly gave the press was, you know, if you buy nappies, you're responsible. So your score will go up. But if you're buying video games, you're lazy, so your school will go down. VANEK SMITH: But the Social Credit score will not be all about what you buy. The government is also collecting data of its own, and that data will factor into people's Social Credit scores, too. GARCIA: The Social Credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until 2020, but we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilot cities across the country. We talked to a 32-year-old IT engineer named Xu Ranjan. He lives in Rongcheng, which is one of those pilot cities. VANEK SMITH: And Xu Ranjan explained that everyone in the city starts with a score of 1,000. XU RANJAN: (Through interpreter) My score is full score. So it's 1,000. GARCIA: And there's a whole letter grade system behind the points. So from 960 to 1,000-plus points is an A, 850 to 955 points is a B. VANEK SMITH: Eight-forty-nine to 600 is a C. And this is considered a warning level. Below that, you are a D. You're labeled an untrustworthy citizen. You can gain or lose points for all kinds of reasons. Get a DUI? That is an automatic downgrade to a B. GARCIA: And if you spread rumors online - minus 50 points. VANEK SMITH: If you have a really high score, you get discounts at a bunch of local businesses. Your heating bill can go down. You also get special invitations to community events. GARCIA: Xu Ranjan says it's made people behave better. Before the pilot program, being a pedestrian in Rongcheng was just terrifying. You basically had to hurl yourself across the street when you saw a break in traffic. XU: (Through interpreter) But now, after the changes have happened, the cars, they will wait for you. VANEK SMITH: Now, remember, Xu Ranjan is an example of somebody with a perfect score. If your Social Credit score is low, or if you end up on something called the list of untrustworthy people, you can be banned from certain kinds of travel or even subjected to public shaming.

The government is also collecting data of its own, and that data will factor into people's Social Credit scores, too. GARCIA: The Social Credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until 2020, but we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilot cities across the country. We talked to a 32-year-old IT engineer named Xu Ranjan. He lives in Rongcheng, which is one of those pilot cities. VANEK SMITH: And Xu Ranjan explained that everyone in the city starts with a score of 1,000. XU RANJAN: (Through interpreter) My score is full score. So it's 1,000. GARCIA: And there's a whole letter grade system behind the points. So from 960 to 1,000-plus points is an A, 850 to 955 points is a B. VANEK SMITH: Eight-forty-nine to 600 is a C. And this is considered a warning level. Below that, you are a D. You're labeled an untrustworthy citizen. You can gain or lose points for all kinds of reasons. Get a DUI? That is an automatic downgrade to a B. GARCIA: And if you spread rumors online - minus 50 points. VANEK SMITH: If you have a really high score, you get discounts at a bunch of local businesses. Your heating bill can go down. You also get special invitations to community events. GARCIA: Xu Ranjan says it's made people behave better. Before the pilot program, being a pedestrian in Rongcheng was just terrifying. You basically had to hurl yourself across the street when you saw a break in traffic. XU: (Through interpreter) But now, after the changes have happened, the cars, they will wait for you. VANEK SMITH: Now, remember, Xu Ranjan is an example of somebody with a perfect score. If your Social Credit score is low, or if you end up on something called the list of untrustworthy people, you can be banned from certain kinds of travel or even subjected to public shaming. Life gets hard. Stacey Vanek Smith. GARCIA: Cardiff Garcia, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF YOMOTI'S \"RESTLESS MINDS\")", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're the greatest economy in the world. It's said now that our economy is the strongest it's ever been. On track to hit the highest annual average growth rate in over 13 years. SIMON: With midterm elections just days away, in which the economy is always an issue, we're going to turn now to Steve Pearlstein, economics columnist for The Washington Post and author of the new book \"Can American Capitalism Survive? \" Steve, thanks so much for being with us. STEVEN PEARLSTEIN: Thanks for having me. SIMON: In October, the report that came out on Friday says U. S. employers added 250,000 jobs. The unemployment rate remains at a near 50-year low. Isn't the president entitled to boast that the economy is in great shape? PEARLSTEIN: Well, it's in great shape. Whether it's in great shape because of him is a dubitable proposition. He was in good shape when he became president even though he ran on a platform that it was a basket case. But there are two things that he has done that have affected the economy to a not insignificant degree at the moment. One of those things is a negative, which is his trade policy, which has hurt certain exports, even though it has also created a few jobs in industries like steel. But the bigger thing that he has done is, with the Republican Congress, he's passed a huge tax cut that was unpaid for. That is, we have to borrow the money that we're no longer collecting in taxes. And that has been - it's sort of like mainlining sugar into the bloodstream. It's a huge sugar high. It's not sustainable. SIMON: The stock market has been dipping, diving and rising. What does that tell you? PEARLSTEIN: That tells you that the stock market, which is forward-looking, knows that we're in a bit of a bubble. We're in a - we're certainly in an asset bubble - that is, stocks, bonds, real estate. And that that's going to burst because cheap money, which the central banks of the world, including our own, had flooded the economy with in the financial system, cheap money is going away. And so all those asset values will go down. The price of the things you buy with that borrowed money goes down. But it's also a signal that we know we're at the top of an economic peak. SIMON: More jobs have been created. Do more Americans need more than one job just to get by? PEARLSTEIN: Some do, but we're at full employment. And so when economists look at this and they say, well, we're creating 250,000 jobs, what that tells us is that the cost of employment is going to go up, and that is wages. And when wages go up, it's good for all of us who work. But employers will then say, well, if it's going to cost that much, maybe at the margin they're not going to do the hiring. Maybe they'll replace a worker with a machine, or maybe they just won't add a worker at all. SIMON: From a strictly political point of view, though, this is a good economy to take into a midterm election, isn't it? PEARLSTEIN: It is. But I would say to you that Hillary Clinton from the Democratic Party took a good economy into the presidential election and, well, it didn't do her as much good as she thought it was going to do. SIMON: As you look at the economic horizon, what gives you some pause? PEARLSTEIN: Well, what gives you pause is that the economy right now is overheated in part because of this tax cut sugar high. And it will come back down to reality. That sugar high only lasts so long. We also see a stock market that is overpriced and real estate that's overpriced and interest rates that are going to rise. And all of those put together suggest that the economy is going to slow. SIMON: Steven Pearlstein of The Washington Post - his upcoming book, \"Can American Capitalism Survive?

From member station KQED in San Francisco, Guy Marzorati has more. GUY MARZORATI, BYLINE: As it tried to climb out of the Great Recession, San Francisco changed its tax policies to help tech companies grow in the city. But like in LA and Seattle, the boom led to higher housing costs, which contributed to the worsening homeless crisis. So now San Francisco is deciding whether to change its tax policy again - this time, to raise taxes on certain corporations. MARC BENIOFF: This is an extraordinary moment where we're in a crisis. MARZORATI: That's Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. His cloud-computing company is the city's largest employer. And he is, surprisingly, the biggest advocate for the tax hike. Proposition C would use the new tax money to pay for things like rental assistance and shelters. And not only is Benioff donating millions to the Yes on Prop C campaign, he's calling out other local CEOs who have opposed Prop C. BENIOFF: What I've found is there's two kinds of people in San Francisco. There's people who are willing to give. And there's those who won't give at all, no matter what. MARZORATI: Benioff specifically called out Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who says the tax would unfairly punish some smaller tech companies. In years past, the city specifically focused on helping these smaller companies grow and eventually go public while staying in the city. (SOUNDBITE OF CABLE CAR WHIRRING)MARZORATI: One of San Francisco's biggest tax breaks got companies like Twitter and Uber to move here to the city's mid-market neighborhood. On a weekday morning, you can see workers head to the office to start the day and homeless residents sitting on the ground nearby. Jennifer Friedenbach, head of the Coalition On Homelessness in San Francisco, says the neighborhood hasn't changed for the better. JENNIFER FRIEDENBACH: I think the most dramatic change has been displacement of people who were living here. And so we've had mass evictions of folks in this area. We've had real increases in rent. MARZORATI: Friedenbach says the massive federal tax cut for corporations has made it easier to ask big companies to pay more to fix local problems. FRIEDENBACH: Now is the moment. And we can't predict that this same moment will happen in the future. MARZORATI: But not everyone sees the proposed tax hike, or even this neighborhood, the same. JIM LAZARUS: We're standing here with hundreds of people walking to and from places of work. The street looks good today. MARZORATI: Jim Lazarus is with San Francisco's Chamber of Commerce. He says businesses already pay an outsized amount of taxes and extra costs to stay in the region. LAZARUS: At some point, the straw breaks the camel's back, and some chief financial officer says, when the lease comes up, we're leaving town. MARZORATI: That kind of threat actually happened in Seattle earlier this year. The city approved a new business tax. Amazon threatened to mount a repeal campaign, and the city council backed down and undid the tax. Molly Turner, who teaches business at UC Berkeley, says the economic boom in the Bay Area has motivated advocates and local governments to push ahead with tax increases. MOLLY TURNER: I think there's certainly an inspiration to take advantage of the enormous prosperity we have in the region while we have it. MARZORATI: If there's any risk, Turner says, it's that a future economic bust could make the money raised by the tax evaporate. For NPR News, I'm Guy Marzorati in San Francisco.

Sales of both new and existing homes are dropping. What does that mean for homebuyers and the overall economy? NPR's Camila Domonoske explains. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: This summer, Sara Murawski's real estate agent asked her how long she'd been looking at houses. SARA MURAWSKI: I was like, you know, I've wanted a house since I was 12, but I actually started looking to buy around 21 (laughter). DOMONOSKE: Murawski's 34, and she's serious. She dreamed of home ownership since middle school. She finally bought a home in Portland, Ore. , this year. And in her long-delayed childhood dream, you can track the last decade of the housing market, not just in Portland but across the U. S. Murawski always knew exactly what kind of house she wanted, a Craftsman - that style with columns and exposed rafters on a big front porch. But right after she graduated from college, the Great Recession hit. MURAWSKI: I worked in construction, so my wages weren't that great. DOMONOSKE: She wanted to buy a house, but it wasn't happening. MURAWSKI: I just felt really lucky to have a job throughout that entire time. DOMONOSKE: There were a lot of people in her position. After the crash, they couldn't afford to take advantage of low home prices. Then as the economy improved, they all entered the market at once. There weren't enough houses to go around. The fierce competition kept Murawski from buying. MURAWSKI: The market has just been climbing the whole time. It was really hard to decide if it was a bubble and I should wait or what I should do. DOMONOSKE: The market was booming in cities across the country, but it was particularly intense in Portland. Rhonda Spencer is a real estate broker in Portland. RHONDA SPENCER: Buyers were having to bid over the price of the home many times. DOMONOSKE: But this summer, things shifted, she says. SPENCER: We're not seeing as many competitive bids. DOMONOSKE: The market was cooling in Portland and other pricey markets from LA to New York City. Prices are still steep, but the bidding wars are easing. And this summer was also when Murawski decided she was ready. She got a real estate agent, found a condo. It wasn't the Craftsman of her dreams, but she fell in love. After years and years of waiting, it all happened very fast. MURAWSKI: It was maybe two weeks. DOMONOSKE: From deciding to buy to having her offer accepted, there were no bidding wars to block her way. So why did the market change? Well, interest rates are the biggest driver. After a long, slow recovery, the Fed is raising rates, and mortgage rates are approaching 5 percent for the first time in years. That's a full percentage point higher than a year ago. Len Kiefer is a deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac. LEN KIEFER: At a typical sort of mortgage size, that means about $150 a month in higher payments. DOMONOSKE: But Kiefer wants to keep that in perspective. KIEFER: Mortgage rates above 5 percent may seem very high. You know, over the last seven years, they have rarely been that high, but, historically, that is some of the lowest rates ever seen. DOMONOSKE: There's another factor, he says. Prices were rising way faster than incomes, which isn't sustainable, he says. So you'd expect the market to adjust. Kiefer uses words like rebalancing, but not everyone is quite so sanguine. PATRICK NEWPORT: So the housing market's in a slump. It's deteriorating, going to a temporary period of weakness. DOMONOSKE: Patrick Newport is a U. S. economist at IHS Markit, a business information group. But Newport also emphasizes that the national housing market is not collapsing and the economy overall is very strong. NEWPORT: The economy's doing so well right now that the rest of the economy can disguise what's happening in the housing market. DOMONOSKE: And this isn't a crash. In fact, slowing sales might let prices stabilize and eventually draw people who have been sidelined into the market - people like Sarah Murawski, who's settling into her new reality. MURAWSKI: This last weekend, the washer was off-kilter (laughter). Yeah, I just threw my fist in the air. And I was like homeownership, yay. DOMONOSKE: Don't worry. She fixed the washer.

And it's really easy to write off short sellers as, like, vultures who swoop in to feed on the carcasses of dead or dying companies. But it's a little bit more complicated than that. Xiaoxia Lou is a professor of finance at the University of Delaware. And a few years ago, she was seeing a lot of stories in the news about short sellers. XIAOXIA LOU: You read about these high-profile battles between short sellers and the companies they target. DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: There was this hypothesis that they actually could be very good for markets because they uncover bad behavior. And she wanted to test that hypothesis in a systematic way. So she and her colleagues looked at all of the companies that had been disciplined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for cooking their books, for financial misrepresentation. GARCIA: What she found was that in the year and a half before the financial fraud was revealed, there would be a huge spike in short selling on that company. And not only that, but the worse the fraud, the more shorting there was. And the fraud tended to be exposed earlier when short sellers were involved. LOU: There's evidence showing that short sellers actually act like detectives, and they're making money, but in the meantime, they actually provide important benefits to the financial markets. RAFIEYAN: Short sellers actually end up being better at identifying fraudulent behavior than just about anyone else in the market. ANDREW LEFT: Well, you know, short sellers are financially motivated. So whenever people are financially motivated, they're going to do a better job. RAFIEYAN: Andrew Left is a professional short seller. And to hear him tell it, he's sort of a Wall Street vigilante. LEFT: I enjoy exposing bad guys when I see guys I think are doing, you know, bad things to the market or to investors. RAFIEYAN: Andrew first got the idea to short companies back in the 1990s. LEFT: Out of college, I worked for a boiler room. I answered an ad in the newspaper. GARCIA: What these boiler room firms would basically do is they would use lies and they would use fraud to pump up these crummy stocks. Andrew decided he just could not do it anymore, so he quit. LEFT: Someone just said to me, hey, why don't we just short those companies? RAFIEYAN: Andrew knew that the stocks being pushed by these boiler rooms were BS because he'd been on the inside. GARCIA: Exactly. If these boiler room firms were saying these stocks were great, he knew they were terrible. So he thought he'd make a profit off that. RAFIEYAN: So Andrew built a very lucrative business by revealing information about companies. And the thing about markets is they work better when there's more information available because that means that the price of a stock will more accurately reflect whether or not it's actually a good company. And Xiaoxia Lou from the University of Delaware says short sellers can be very helpful in that regard. LOU: For the market to be efficient, we need all sorts of players so that all this information could be incorporated into stock price. So short sellers play a very large important role, in my opinion, for market efficiency. RAFIEYAN: Someone like Andrew Left, he may seem really odious to us because he profits off of other people's failure, and that feels kind of icky. But the data suggests that these short sellers are helping to keep companies honest. Darius Rafieyan. GARCIA: Cardiff Garcia, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   In recent weeks, the S&P 500 lost most of its gains for the year. If you have retirement money in stocks, that's probably not good.

Now comes the hard part, though - preventing companies or countries from finding ways around those very sanctions. Here's NPR's Jackie Northam. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: The Trump administration hopes its sweeping sanctions will cripple Iran's economy and force it to negotiate a new nuclear deal. Daniel Wager, a financial crimes specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, says sanctions are an effective way to change behavior, but they're not foolproof. DAN WAGER: There will always be both overt and covert activities to work around sanctions, to dodge sanctions or evade them. That's something that's gone on for a very long time. NORTHAM: Wager says many of the techniques to skirt sanctions are also used for money laundering, such as setting up shell companies and intermediaries. As an example, he points to Iran's efforts to procure aircraft parts and components, something Iran critically needs to keep its aging airplanes working. WAGER: There's a vast network of individuals who are out there that will go to a company that provides aircraft components, engine parts, and they will procure them and represent that those goods are being shipped to and paid for by someone in a country where it is allowed. And once the goods are shipped to there, they're further transshipped onward to Iran. NORTHAM: It's trickier to work around oil sanctions because the crude has to be transported by large tankers on open waters. Still, Peter Harrell, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security, says, in the past, Iran found ways to get its most important export to customers. PETER HARRELL: You saw Iran have its oil tankers turn off their tracking information. You know, they'd kind of take these very convoluted shipping routes to try to disguise that they were Iranian tankers. They'd change their flag. They changed change their name. And, you know, all these kind of tactics a ship can use to disguise its origin. NORTHAM: Harrell, who worked on sanctions during the Obama administration, says Iranian tankers can be tracked nowadays with the help of satellites. And the administration can also look at financial transactions around the world to identify Iranian oil deals. Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former sanctions official at the Treasury Department, says that will help track down and punish anyone doing business with the Iranians and not just the buyers of crude oil. ELIZABETH ROSENBERG: They could also go after the refiners who. Are their partners and creditors? The shipping company is. The shipping lines, the brokers - who touches them? The web is very broad here. NORTHAM: The U. S. wants Iran's oil exports, which represent about 80 percent of the country's economy, down to zero. But other countries want to keep the nuclear deal and do business with Iran. Harrell says energy hungry nations are willing to risk sanctions that could reduce their access to U. S. markets. HARRELL: You could see a country such as China that's importing oil - instead of the oil being purchased by a great big Chinese company that has lots of business in the United States, it'll be purchased by some small company that doesn't really do any business in the U. S. And if it is sanctioned, so what? NORTHAM: Some methods of evading sanctions fall into a gray zone, such as holding payments in an escrow account, something India did the last time Iran was sanctioned. There's bartering, exchanging oil for, say, industrial machinery. And the European Union is looking at creating a system that doesn't have any connection to the U. S. banking system - all stopgap methods that can help a hobbled Iranian economy despite U. S. efforts to bring it to its knees. Jackie Northam, NPR News.

Some researchers discovered a kind of real-world experiment. It was a chance to find if borrowing leads to a better education for community college students. Elissa Nadworny explains. ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: One of the ways schools have tried to help students cut down on their debt is to not package federal loans in the financial aid award letters that they send to students. This happens regardless of whether a student is eligible for federal loans. And about half of community colleges do it. LESLEY TURNER: It's part of the narrative of the student debt crisis - you know, avoid borrowing unless it's absolutely necessary. NADWORNY: That's Lesley Turner, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Maryland, talking over Skype. She and her colleague Benjamin Marx at the University of Illinois are studying this. And when students were offered loans in their letters and they took them, they weren't a bad thing. Instead, the small loan really helped students. TURNER: They attempted more courses. They earned more credit. And they had higher grade point averages. NADWORNY: The other big outcome. . . TURNER: There were also sizable increases in the likelihood of transferring to a four-year public institution, to a bachelor's degree program. NADWORNY: So why is this all happening? TURNER: The most likely explanation, we think, is that this loan allowed students to work less, that they would have had to work to pay for their living expenses, to pay for their transportation. NADWORNY: The loan may have freed up time in their schedules to take more classes, to study, to finish their schoolwork. And remember, these are community college students. So even though tuition is low or even free, there are other expenses. ODED GURANTZ: The cost of college creates a stress.

She drew criticism when she told supporters not to be afraid to harass Trump administration officials if they see them in public. Waters' work on the Financial Services Committee has attracted less attention, but it has earned her admirers, such as Mike Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending.

Representative-elect Ocasio-Cortez said the fact that a billionaire's company will receive more billions, quote, \"when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here. \" Queens State senator Jessica Ramos told a rally, it is unconscionable that we - in the middle of the housing crisis, in the middle of the public transportation crisis - have to dole out so many handouts to the richest company in the world. On the other end of the spectrum, The Wall Street Journal, which customarily sees virtue in wealth, points out that New York citizens will pay $48,000 per worker for each of the 25,000 jobs, paying $150,000 a year, which Amazon says their company will bring to Queens. The Journal observed, apparently bodega owners in Brooklyn are supposed to be happy about subsidizing a third of the salaries of hipster techies. New York political leaders, including the governor and mayor, often say they have to offer subsidies and tax breaks to companies that would bring jobs because New York must compete against states like Florida or Texas that have no state income tax. But rather than cut taxes for all, they will reward tax breaks to a selective few. As assembly member Ron Kim of Queens asked, now, in the progressive state of New York, we have a governor who gave away 3 billion to the richest man on the planet? If only for a moment, Amazon seems to have brought different political voices together in outrage. (SOUNDBITE OF MARCUS D. (FEAT. SAIGON AND CHOKLATE)'S \"LIVE BETTER\") SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   In these days of polarized politics, there was a small sign of a coalition this week. Voices that range - and it's quite a range - on the left, from the newly elected Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a democratic socialist, to labor unions and local Democratic Queens leaders, to The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page, and Tucker Carlson of Fox News, denounced the deal New York City and State struck with Amazon to locate one of their headquarters in the borough of Queens. Amazon has a market capitalization of more than $800 billion. Its founder, Jeff Bezos, is the richest man in the world - worth more than $130 billion. Yet, Amazon will unblushingly accept more than almost $3 billion in tax breaks and subsidies from New York State and New York City to open in Queens.

But it's been a quiet victory and a mysterious one, as NPR's Camila Domonoske reports. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: British electricity use dropped so much over the last decade that it's as if the U. K. shut down its largest coal power plant twice. That's according to the climate policy think tank Sandbag. And it's not just electricity. The country's total energy consumption of all kinds has dropped 10 percent since 2002. GUY NEWEY: And that's kind of unusual, actually. DOMONOSKE: Guy Newey used to be a climate adviser in the British government. Now he works at Energy Systems Catapult, which promotes energy innovation. I asked him why this is happening. Are there just fewer people? NEWEY: Nope, it's the opposite. The U. K. has had an increasing population. DOMONOSKE: A slowing economy uses less power. Is the British economy struggling? NEWEY: Our overall GDP has increased. DOMONOSKE: It's not tied to skyrocketing costs, and it's not the weather. The decline remains if you factor in temperature. And the U. K. is seeing a drop, while Ireland, right next door, is not. In fact, last year, the U. K. was the only country in the EU to see a drop in electricity use. I asked Newey, is it something special about British people? - stoicism, self-restraint. NEWEY: I mean, you know, we're quite reserved. But that's always been the case. I don't think that's increased or decreased over the last 10 years (laughter). DOMONOSKE: So what is going on? NEWEY: The first thing I'd say is it's not perfectly understood exactly what is happening. DOMONOSKE: Analysts do know some of the factors, but even those can be a little confusing. Consider energy efficiency. JONATHAN MARSHALL: We're getting better insulated homes and better insulated office buildings, more efficient televisions, computers, fridges, freezers, that sort of thing. DOMONOSKE: Jonathan Marshall is the head of analysis at a think tank called Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. He says efficiency is definitely part of the drop in energy use. But energy standards for appliances are the same across Europe. MARSHALL: You have energy ratings for fridges that are the same in the U. K. , in Poland, in Italy. DOMONOSKE: And only the U. K. is seeing use drop like this. Then when it comes to homes, it's not like the British government is making a huge insulation push. MARSHALL: There isn't really a particularly strong energy efficiency policy in the U. K. at the moment. DOMONOSKE: It's not a total mystery. Other factors include a shift away from heavy industry, improvements in streetlamps, tightened standards for boilers and changing consumer patterns. But added together, they don't quite seem to explain the drop. These solutions are not thrilling. MARSHALL: It's a lot easier to get, you know, excited about electric vehicles and wind turbines than it is about insulation. DOMONOSKE: And, Guy Newey says, it doesn't help that there's no one reason for the drop. NEWEY: Yeah. It's much easier if you can just point to one thing and say, oh, brilliant. If we just did X, it delivers Y benefit, and that's fantastic. DOMONOSKE: Still, this little puzzle is good news for the policy fight against greenhouse gas emissions. Some people worry that restricting energy use could hurt a country's economy. NEWEY: What we've seen, I guess, through history, is as people become richer, they tend to buy more stuff, use more stuff and consume more energy. DOMONOSKE: But remember; the British GDP has been rising. That link between growth and energy use has been broken in the U. K. NEWEY: The interesting question for kind of wider global energy policy is, can that example be replicated?

The city known for old-line industries, Lake Erie, LeBron James and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame wants to make itself a center of blockchain technology, the software behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Here's Jeff St. Clair of member station WKSU. JEFF ST CLAIR, BYLINE: Believeland was Cleveland's catchphrase when, in 2016, LeBron James and the Cavaliers delivered the city's first sports championship in half a century. Now LeBron is gone, and Clevelanders may be looking for something new to believe in. Bernie Moreno thinks that should be embracing Cleveland as a tech town. Moreno is a blockchain evangelist and luxury car dealer who is quick to resist a sports comparison. BERNIE MORENO: I know LeBron James, and I'm no LeBron James (laughter), OK? So let's get that out of the way. ST CLAIR: Moreno is trying to marshal his salesmanship skills to promote Cleveland as a center for blockchain innovation. MORENO: If you're going to have a blockchain startup, this is the place you'd do it. If you're going to invest in blockchain startups, this is the place I would invest in. And if you're a developer, you're a student who wants to do blockchain development, Cleveland's the place where you would do it. ST CLAIR: Blockchain is basically a digital lockbox that stores any kind of transaction in a secure block that's shared across independent computers. It's the technology behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin but is quickly transitioning to other uses, like digital home deeds, municipal bonds. . . MORENO: Digital car titles. There's digital driver's licenses, birth certificates, college degrees, medical records. ST CLAIR: One Cleveland startup is even testing a blockchain-based voting app. Hilary Carter is managing director of the Blockchain Research Institute in Toronto, a think tank laying out road maps for business uses of the technology. HILARY CARTER: Cleveland stepped up to be the very first city outside of Canada to want access to the thought leadership that we're creating at the BRI. ST CLAIR: Here's what Moreno says it would take to build Blockland. The city would need to attract around 1,000 software developers to the region who will help launch a couple dozen blockchain-based startups. He's planning to open a 100,000-square-foot downtown campus to incubate those companies, complete with a K-12 school. MORENO: We call the school Genesis because in the blockchain world, genesis is the first block in the blockchain. ST CLAIR: Moreno has also put together a dream team of Cleveland's civic leaders to help organize the Blockland Cleveland conference in December. Suzanne Rivera is vice president of research at Case Western Reserve University and likes the ambitious idea. SUZANNE RIVERA: I really think of it as a movement. This is going to be the way of the future. We can either let it pass us by, or we can seize this opportunity.

Will they make progress in solving their trade disputes? Well, President Trump fielded a question along those lines earlier today from a reporter in Buenos Aires. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we're working very hard. If we could make a deal, that would be good. I think they want to, and I think we'd like to. And we'll see. KELLY: And we'll see. Well, NPR's John Ydstie joins us now to talk about just what we might see. Hey there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So we've watched this trade dispute between the U. S. and China go from nasty to nastier with both of them slapping tariffs back and forth on each other. Can Trump and Xi get negotiations back on track? YDSTIE: Well, both sides hope so. And if they don't, the dispute could get even nastier. The U. S. already has tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into the U. S. On January 1, those tariffs are set to go up from 10 percent to 25 percent. And President Trump says if there's not progress, he'll levy tariffs on another $267 billion worth of Chinese products. That would raise the cost of virtually every Chinese import into the U. S. Of course China already has tariffs on U. S. goods, too, and they say they'll respond to any U. S. escalation. KELLY: OK, so no shortage of threats from either side. But on substance, how far apart are China and the U. S. ? YDSTIE: Well, that's the problem. They're not close, not close at all. But in recent weeks, U. S. and Chinese officials have been trying to hammer out at least some kind of cease-fire in this trade war. Among the things they could do is the U. S. could agree not to raise the current tariffs from 10 to 25 percent as planned and not put tariffs on the additional amount of Chinese goods. In exchange, you know, China might reduce a few tariffs on U. S. products or make some commitment to reduce its trade surplus with the U. S. KELLY: Which I guess would walk them back from the cliff a little bit. But what about the central demand that the U. S. has made of China, which is ending the theft of intellectual property? What kind of prospects are you seeing for progress there? YDSTIE: Well, not a lot at this meeting. Making real progress in those areas will take time, and the groundwork really hasn't been laid. U. S. trade ambassador Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday, quote, \"China has not come to the table with proposals for meaningful reform. \" So a breakthrough deal is highly unlikely. One possibility, though, is that they might agree on a framework for moving forward on these issues where the U. S. wants action. But the Chinese have complained that the Trump administration hasn't been clear on exactly what it wants, so there's still a lot of work to do. KELLY: One thing we know about President Trump is he likes to make deals. Do we know how motivated he is and how motivated Xi is to come to some kind of agreement? YDSTIE: Yeah, I think there are reasons for both presidents to want to make some kind of deal. For Trump, there are growing pressures to make progress on trade. One is the U. S. stock market. It's still well off, its recent highs, partly because of uncertainty caused by trade tensions. And remember; Trump kind of used the stock market as a measure of the success of his policies. Also, remember; earlier this week, GM said Trump's tariffs cost the company an additional billion dollars. That was at the same time as GM announced the shutdown of several U. S. auto plants. And that certainly got the president's attention. As for President Xi, you know, China's economic growth has slowed considerably, and these trade issues are contributing to that. He would like to eliminate the drag on China's economy. So we'll see what happens on Saturday. KELLY: We'll see - the words of the president. NPR's John Ydstie, thank you. YDSTIE: You're very welcome. KELLY: And, John, you knew we weren't going to let you escape the studio without mentioning that we're not going to get to talk to you quite so often going forward because this is your last day. YDSTIE: This is my last day. KELLY: How many years - you're retiring after how many years at NPR? YDSTIE: Thirty-nine years, almost. . . KELLY: Thirty-nine. YDSTIE: . . . Four decades. KELLY: We threw you a farewell party. . . YDSTIE: Yes, you did. KELLY: . . . On Tuesday in the NPR canteen in which I got all choked up. I have no idea how you made it through all the toasts. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Well, what the listener can't see is the enormous smile on John's face right now. KELLY: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: We are sending you into this next. . . YDSTIE: Yeah. CORNISH: . . . Chapter. . . KELLY: Well, we. . . CORNISH: . . . Cheerily I think. YDSTIE: Yeah, you are. But, you know, I feel so fortunate to have been part of this wonderful organization for four decades. KELLY: Yeah. YDSTIE: You know, watched it become a force - this makes a profound difference in the lives of millions of people. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity. I've had to bear witness to some inflection points in history like the collapse of the Soviet Union, the creation of the European Union and the first Gulf War, the global financial crisis. But among the greatest privileges has been to do this with you and all of our NPR colleagues, the best colleagues anyone could hope for. I'll miss seeing you every day, but I hope I'll be back now and then to do a project or fill in for someone who needs a break. KELLY: John Ydstie, the feeling is mutual. And we thank you and your family for 39 great years. YDSTIE: Thank you.

KELLY: And we'll see. Well, NPR's John Ydstie joins us now to talk about just what we might see. Hey there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So we've watched this trade dispute between the U. S. and China go from nasty to nastier with both of them slapping tariffs back and forth on each other. Can Trump and Xi get negotiations back on track? YDSTIE: Well, both sides hope so. And if they don't, the dispute could get even nastier. The U. S. already has tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods coming into the U. S. On January 1, those tariffs are set to go up from 10 percent to 25 percent. And President Trump says if there's not progress, he'll levy tariffs on another $267 billion worth of Chinese products. That would raise the cost of virtually every Chinese import into the U. S. Of course China already has tariffs on U. S. goods, too, and they say they'll respond to any U. S. escalation. KELLY: OK, so no shortage of threats from either side. But on substance, how far apart are China and the U. S. ? YDSTIE: Well, that's the problem. They're not close, not close at all. But in recent weeks, U. S. and Chinese officials have been trying to hammer out at least some kind of cease-fire in this trade war. Among the things they could do is the U. S. could agree not to raise the current tariffs from 10 to 25 percent as planned and not put tariffs on the additional amount of Chinese goods. In exchange, you know, China might reduce a few tariffs on U. S. products or make some commitment to reduce its trade surplus with the U. S. KELLY: Which I guess would walk them back from the cliff a little bit. But what about the central demand that the U. S. has made of China, which is ending the theft of intellectual property? What kind of prospects are you seeing for progress there? YDSTIE: Well, not a lot at this meeting. Making real progress in those areas will take time, and the groundwork really hasn't been laid. U. S. trade ambassador Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday, quote, \"China has not come to the table with proposals for meaningful reform. \" So a breakthrough deal is highly unlikely. One possibility, though, is that they might agree on a framework for moving forward on these issues where the U. S. wants action. But the Chinese have complained that the Trump administration hasn't been clear on exactly what it wants, so there's still a lot of work to do. KELLY: One thing we know about President Trump is he likes to make deals. Do we know how motivated he is and how motivated Xi is to come to some kind of agreement? YDSTIE: Yeah, I think there are reasons for both presidents to want to make some kind of deal. For Trump, there are growing pressures to make progress on trade. One is the U. S. stock market. It's still well off, its recent highs, partly because of uncertainty caused by trade tensions. And remember; Trump kind of used the stock market as a measure of the success of his policies. Also, remember; earlier this week, GM said Trump's tariffs cost the company an additional billion dollars. That was at the same time as GM announced the shutdown of several U. S. auto plants. And that certainly got the president's attention. As for President Xi, you know, China's economic growth has slowed considerably, and these trade issues are contributing to that. He would like to eliminate the drag on China's economy. So we'll see what happens on Saturday. KELLY: We'll see - the words of the president. NPR's John Ydstie, thank you. YDSTIE: You're very welcome. KELLY: And, John, you knew we weren't going to let you escape the studio without mentioning that we're not going to get to talk to you quite so often going forward because this is your last day. YDSTIE: This is my last day. KELLY: How many years - you're retiring after how many years at NPR? YDSTIE: Thirty-nine years, almost. . . KELLY: Thirty-nine. YDSTIE: . . . Four decades. KELLY: We threw you a farewell party. . . YDSTIE: Yes, you did. KELLY: . . . On Tuesday in the NPR canteen in which I got all choked up. I have no idea how you made it through all the toasts. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Well, what the listener can't see is the enormous smile on John's face right now. KELLY: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) CORNISH: We are sending you into this next. . . YDSTIE: Yeah. CORNISH: . . . Chapter. . . KELLY: Well, we. . . CORNISH: . . . Cheerily I think. YDSTIE: Yeah, you are. But, you know, I feel so fortunate to have been part of this wonderful organization for four decades. KELLY: Yeah. YDSTIE: You know, watched it become a force - this makes a profound difference in the lives of millions of people. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity. I've had to bear witness to some inflection points in history like the collapse of the Soviet Union, the creation of the European Union and the first Gulf War, the global financial crisis. But among the greatest privileges has been to do this with you and all of our NPR colleagues, the best colleagues anyone could hope for. I'll miss seeing you every day, but I hope I'll be back now and then to do a project or fill in for someone who needs a break. KELLY: John Ydstie, the feeling is mutual. And we thank you and your family for 39 great years. YDSTIE: Thank you.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The two will, obviously, have a lot to discuss - in particular, the trade war that doesn't seem to have an end in sight. As NPR's Rob Schmitz reports, pressure inside China is mounting over Xi's response and how he has managed relations with the U. S. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: On the day he became leader, Xi Jinping gave a speech about his dream for China. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT XI JINPING: (Speaking Chinese). SCHMITZ: \"To achieve this dream,\" he said, \"we must take a Chinese path - a path forged by decades of communist rule and thousands of years of Chinese civilization. \" A path, says economist Sheng Hong, which has led China into a trade war with the United States. HONG SHENG: (Through interpreter) This trade war is not between China and the U. S. It's a war between China's most powerful political interest group on one side while the U. S. and the people of China are on the other. If China yields to the U. S. request for fair trade, this will be good for all Chinese. SCHMITZ: Sheng heads the Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing. He says China seems to have abandoned the decades-old policy of reforming its markets and opening up trade in favor of a new so-called China model of state capitalism dominated by China's state-owned enterprises - a model, he says, that's incompatible with fair trade and is damaging China's economy. SHENG: (Through interpreter) The China model assumes economic growth is due to government control. This is not in line with the facts. One hundred percent of Chinese companies were owned by the state in 1978, and our economy was terrible. As the state gave up market control to the private sector, our economy grew. We must keep doing that. SCHMITZ: That's why Sheng and other prominent intellectuals in China have sacrificed their careers to publicly criticize their government's handling of trade negotiations with President Trump. They argue that what Trump is asking for - opening China's markets to the private sector and eliminating unfair competition from state-run companies - will not only be good for U. S. companies but also for Chinese people because China's private sector employs three times more people than its state-run sector. And it accounts for most of China's economic growth. But Xi Jinping has dug in his heels. China's economy continues to outpace much of the world. And he has continued to promote the state-heavy China model. ARTHUR KROEBER: Xi has kind of painted himself into a corner. SCHMITZ: Arthur Kroeber is author of \"China's Economy: What Everyone Needs To Know. \"KROEBER: He's sort of, like, said, OK. We have this China model. It's doing its own thing. China needs to become this great power. He can't back down from that. SCHMITZ: Kroeber says this style of leadership is a departure from former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, whose credo of dealing with the outside world was hide your strength and bide your time. KROEBER: The genius of the Deng Xiaoping hide and bide strategy is that it gives you a lot of freedom of movement. You have not committed yourself to anything specific that it would be difficult to back down from. SCHMITZ: Kroeber says the problem with Xi Jinping's assertive style is that when he's challenged, as he is now by Trump, he has to stand his ground. And that can become costly. Sheng Hong says this stance also leads to an inability to listen to criticism, like his. Last month, Sheng was about to get on a plane to Boston where he was going to give a talk at Harvard. SHENG: (Through interpreter) Police stopped me at the airport. They said if I left China, it would threaten state security. I was shocked. SCHMITZ: A week after I spoke to Sheng, authorities shut down his economic institute.

S. products as a way to reduce the trade imbalance, which could include agricultural products, like soybeans. John Wesley Boyd is a fourth-generation farmer in Baskerville, Va. , and soybeans are one of his main crops. He had some business in Washington, D. C. , today, so he was nice enough to stop by our studios to talk with me. And I asked him whether he views last night's trade talks as a win for U. S. farmers. JOHN WESLEY BOYD: The president always says he wins when he comes out of these type of meetings. But what will happen will be - remain to be seen because farmers are definitely struggling. And soybeans - the market is pretty much dried up. And they set, you know, a 90-day truce, you know? Ninety days put farmers into planting season. So we're going to need to know what to do way before 90 days. MARTIN: So tell me what's been happening so far. Do I have this right, that you farm 300 acres? BOYD: Three hundred acres of soybeans. . . MARTIN: And soybeans is one of your main crops. So tell me what's been happening with you. BOYD: Well, basically, the market is stale, and a lot of the grain elevators are full to their max. And, out in the Midwestern states, they're not even taking any more grain in. They're actually stockpiling it and covering it with tarps. And this is the worst thing I have seen, you know, since I've been a grain farmer. And the actual price of grain has fallen off, dramatically, to about $8 a bushel. And, for a farmer to break even, we need at least $9 or maybe $9. 50 to actually break even. So the president came up with some 12, $13 billion bailout, which he said would help, you know, farmers and get them over the hump. But that doesn't do it either, you know? It's pretty much like $1. 60 a bushel. In time, the government takes their share out - it equates to less than a dollar that actually goes to the producer himself. . . MARTIN: Have you been able to benefit from this program at all? I mean, one of my colleagues, David Greene, spoke to another fourth-generation farmer. . . BOYD: Yes. MARTIN: . . . Like yourself, in Illinois. And he said that he filled out the paperwork this fall. . . BOYD: I hate to. . . MARTIN: He had had a lot of forward contracts, and he said that they were able to lock in some prices. He says that the turnaround time is quick, that you file your production with the office and that you're paid on a per-bushel basis. And he said that he's making out OK with that. What about you? BOYD: We're not because you still have to go through all of the government loopholes. And I did apply. I'm going to let you know I went into the ASCS (ph) office in my local county - Mecklenburg County, Va. I applied. And, immediately, the NRCS, the agency that - which you have to comply with and have a approved plan on file, immediately came out to my farm and demanded a whole lot of changes that I would have to put into place and, actually - to receive the funds. MARTIN: So you've not gotten any funds. . . BOYD: I haven't gotten any money from it. But I've got a lot of paperwork on necessary changes that I would have to meet to - in order to comply. MARTIN: What is happening to the soybeans that you've already farmed, that you've already - that you had already planted before the tariffs went in? BOYD: My local elevator stopped taking grain about two weeks ago. And, basically, I've been storing it in my chicken house, which is a facility that's secure and is dry. But for farmers that don't have any place to store their grain, they are in trouble because they're going to have to leave it in their field. And when you leave your crop in the field, Michel, when it rains like this, the pods pop open, and you begin to lose a percentage of your crop. And this administration really needs to take heed that farmers are in trouble. MARTIN: President Trump says that, in the long run, these tariffs will work to the benefit of both farmers and manufacturers. BOYD: Right. The issue is. . . . MARTIN: What's your take on that? BOYD: Do farmers have that much time? And that's the issue. I mean, I'll be OK. I'm a seasoned farmer, and I can take a crop loss, you know? And I'll probably be able to go on to the following year. But these farmers, who are farming thousand acre-plus, farming operations - they are in trouble. And you're going to see more bankruptcies from farmers, and this president put them in that position. And he's really dumping on his base and making it more difficult for them to stay in the business. MARTIN: In the long run, what would be more beneficial for you? Is it - you would prefer. . . BOYD: I would prefer. . . MARTIN: . . . A level playing field. . . BOYD: A stable market. Every farmer - a farmer my size is going to want to drive within an hour's distance to his local elevator. And when I get to that elevator, I've already put in the time and energy in my crop. I simply want a fair price. In 2012, I was selling soybeans for $16 a bushel. And here it is. We're heading into 2019, and I'm selling soybeans for $8. Something is terribly wrong with that picture, where the market has just - fell off like that. And it's because he's playing footsie with China and other markets that were pretty stable for American farmers. He's put all that, now, into play and really holding farmers hostage at his political decisions. MARTIN: That's John Wesley Boyd. He's a farmer in Baskerville, Va. He grows corn and soybeans and wheat, among other things. And he was kind enough to stop by our studios in Washington, D. C. Mr. Boyd, thanks so much for talking to us. . . BOYD: Thank you.

S. and China have agreed to hit pause on their escalating trade war. Now comes the hard part - the details. At the G-20 meeting in Argentina this weekend, President Trump and China's president, Xi Jinping, sat down for dinner and, according to the U. S. readout, agreed to a 90-day timeline to reach terms on issues that have dogged the trade relationship for years, everything from intellectual property protections to reducing tariffs. Amy Celico joins me now. She is an expert on China trade. She was senior director for China at the office of the U. S. Trade Representative. Amy Celico, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. AMY CELICO: Great to be here. KELLY: So we know President Trump's take on this meeting, which is that it was extraordinary - his word. He was tweeting that this morning and also tweeting, quote, \"relations with China have taken a big leap forward. \" What is your assessment of how big a leap Trump and Xi made? CELICO: Well, I do think that the temporary halt in escalation of trade tension a significant achievement, and we should be pleased about that. The markets are pleased about that. We don't want to see more tariffs harming both of our economies as we try to deal with much more significant structural issues. Unfortunately I didn't see a lot coming out of the Saturday evening dinner that points to changing the direction - the downward direction in the trajectory of U. S. -China relations in the near term. KELLY: Yeah, this was a dinner from which emerged an agreement but not a lot of details. We've seen this before from President Trump. It's reminding me of the Kim Jong Un summit on North Korea where no one was quite clear afterward exactly what had been agreed. CELICO: Indeed. The devil's in the details. And the two countries have been reporting on the results of the dinner in very different ways. Of course since Saturday night, we've heard from the president some of the steps China may be taking to lower tariff rates and purchase commodities. But in fact, the Chinese government and media statements on the result of the meeting do not reference any Chinese purchase agreements, no tariff lowering measures. They don't even specify that this is a 90-day timetable for this next round of trade negotiations. KELLY: The trade relationship of course doesn't exist in a vacuum. It exists in the context of the overall U. S. -China relationship. I mean, setting - taking trade out of it for a moment, how healthy is that broader relationship? CELICO: What I remain concerned about is both in the United States and in China, national security issues are creeping into economic policymaking, and that makes it very difficult for our two sides to have a constructive relationship going forward. KELLY: You're talking about - what? - tensions over North Korea, tensions over China's rising military might. What? CELICO: I'm referring to Vice President Pence's speech earlier this fall at the Hudson Institute where he accused China of fundamentally trying to undermine the United States politically, diplomatically, economically, commercially. The concerns that I have is the U. S. government may start to restrict, for example, visas to Chinese students coming to study certain topics in the United States for fear of these topics helping China's economy grow and rival the United States. That is a very dark view of the future of China in the world. KELLY: To take this down from the grand diplomatic level and just onto the personal level, you know work as a consultant. You work with Americans who do business in China or are trying to do business in China. How hopeful are you that this trade dispute will resolve in some way that benefits American businesses? CELICO: I am optimistic that people in the United States and people in China want this relationship to be on a positive footing. Unfortunately I am more pessimistic than I've been in 20 years about the prospect for U. S. -China ties because our governments seem to be growing increasingly comfortable with competition that is marked more by mistrust and enmity than management of the two largest economies in the world being competitors and being able to manage that competition constructively. KELLY: That's Amy Celico. She heads the China team at the business advisory firm the Albright Stonebridge Group. Amy Celico, thank you. CELICO: Thank you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   The U. S. and China have agreed to hit pause on their escalating trade war. Now comes the hard part - the details. At the G-20 meeting in Argentina this weekend, President Trump and China's president, Xi Jinping, sat down for dinner and, according to the U. S. readout, agreed to a 90-day timeline to reach terms on issues that have dogged the trade relationship for years, everything from intellectual property protections to reducing tariffs. Amy Celico joins me now. She is an expert on China trade. She was senior director for China at the office of the U. S. Trade Representative. Amy Celico, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. AMY CELICO: Great to be here. KELLY: So we know President Trump's take on this meeting, which is that it was extraordinary - his word. He was tweeting that this morning and also tweeting, quote, \"relations with China have taken a big leap forward. \" What is your assessment of how big a leap Trump and Xi made? CELICO: Well, I do think that the temporary halt in escalation of trade tension a significant achievement, and we should be pleased about that. The markets are pleased about that. We don't want to see more tariffs harming both of our economies as we try to deal with much more significant structural issues. Unfortunately I didn't see a lot coming out of the Saturday evening dinner that points to changing the direction - the downward direction in the trajectory of U. S. -China relations in the near term. KELLY: Yeah, this was a dinner from which emerged an agreement but not a lot of details. We've seen this before from President Trump. It's reminding me of the Kim Jong Un summit on North Korea where no one was quite clear afterward exactly what had been agreed. CELICO: Indeed. The devil's in the details. And the two countries have been reporting on the results of the dinner in very different ways. Of course since Saturday night, we've heard from the president some of the steps China may be taking to lower tariff rates and purchase commodities. But in fact, the Chinese government and media statements on the result of the meeting do not reference any Chinese purchase agreements, no tariff lowering measures.

Prices dropped sharply this morning, though they did mostly recover by the end of the day. Still, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down 3. 6 percent since Monday. NPR's Jim Zarroli has been following the markets closely and joins us now. Hey, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So I thought the economy was doing well these days. Why isn't the stock market getting the message? ZARROLI: Well, it has been doing well. We had 3. 5 percent growth in the third quarter. Unemployment's low. But the thing is the stock market does not care about today. It cares about tomorrow. And there's this growing sense that things aren't as good as they seem and that, you know, growth is going to slow next year, which might not turn out to be true, but a lot of investors are starting to think that. CHANG: OK. So we've been hearing about a possible trade deal between the U. S. and China and how that might be on shaky ground now. How much of concern is that trade deal to investors at this point? ZARROLI: Well, it's a big concern. I mean, last week, it seemed like there was this detente in the trade dispute between the U. S. and China. President Trump said he was not going to raise tariffs again for 90 days so the U. S. and China could talk. CHANG: Right. ZARROLI: He also said a lot of other things like China was going to lower its tariffs on cars, only, as the week went on, it seemed like China was describing the agreement somewhat differently. And then meanwhile, President Trump put out a tweet that said he was Mr. Tariff, which suggested he wasn't feeling all that conciliatory. So there was confusion about just what was agreed to. Here is Scott Anderson, who is chief economist at Bank of the West. SCOTT ANDERSON: I think the market's hopes for a fairytale ending to the U. S. -China trade dispute is fading fast. It looks like this could be a protracted fight between the world's two largest economies that carries on into 2019 and beyond. ZARROLI: And then this arrest of a senior executive at the Chinese company Huawei has really exacerbated tensions. It's an important company in China. It's the biggest telecommunications equipment company in the world - makes smartphones and equipment that connects to the Internet. The Chinese are not happy about this arrest, and having this kind of fight right now is not the kind of thing you want when you're trying to resolve a big trade fight. CHANG: No. So the Dow had another steep drop on Tuesday, and you reported on something called the yield curve inversion. I'm afraid to ask this, but what is the yield curve inversion, and why is it spooking investors? ZARROLI: Well, I will try to explain. Typically investors want more of a return when they lock their money away for long periods, which means that when the government sells something like a 10-year bond, it has to pay a higher interest rate than it would for a two- or a three-year bond. But on rare occasions, that can turn around, and people start demanding higher rates on short-term bonds because they're worried about where the economy is headed in the near term. And the problem with that is it can signal slowing growth or even a recession, and that gets investors in the bond market nervous. CHANG: OK, one more quick thing before we let you go. OPEC met in Vienna today about oil prices, which have been falling pretty hard. Was there anything accomplished there? ZARROLI: Nothing so far. Prices are falling because of this fear, again, about global growth slowing. OPEC's trying to agree on production cuts, which would stabilize prices they hope, but they have their own problems. One of the countries, Qatar, has quit OPEC. Russia, which isn't really an - is not in OPEC member but is supposed to attend the meeting anyway, hasn't weighed in yet, so they're meeting again tomorrow. CHANG: OK, that's NPR's Jim Zarroli.

S. and China. The catalyst today - news that a high-ranking Chinese executive was arrested in Canada at the request of U. S. authorities.

But the business community seems to be nervous that the truce is not going to hold. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So tell us about this Chinese businesswoman who was arrested over the weekend in Canada. HORSLEY: Her name is Meng Wanzhou. She's the chief financial officer of a big Chinese telecom company called Huawei. They're one of the biggest manufacturers in the world of smartphones and telecom networking equipment. Meng is facing possible extradition to the U. S. , but we're not exactly sure why. The Justice Department isn't talking about it. Neither is the White House. But national security adviser John Bolton did speak to Morning Edition today. And he said Huawei's one of the Chinese companies the administration's been concerned about. They're suspected of stealing their competitors' technology. And that's at the heart of the U. S. -China trade dispute. JOHN BOLTON: Whether you're a free trader or not, but maybe particularly if you're a free trader, you should not turn a blind eye when states as a matter of national policy are stealing intellectual property from their competitors. HORSLEY: And you can hear more of that John Bolton interview on Morning Edition tomorrow. That's also when Ming is due to face a bond hearing in Vancouver. CHANG: OK, so news of this arrest broke late Wednesday. And it seems to have rattled financial markets. Why? HORSLEY: Yeah, at one point today the Dow was down more than 700 points. It largely recovered and ended the day off less than 80 points. But everybody's a little bit nervous, especially after that nearly 800-point drop we had on Tuesday. CHANG: Yeah. HORSLEY: Remember, Ailsa; we started out this week, everyone was kind of breathing a sigh of relief. President Trump had had this meeting with President Xi over the weekend. He announced he was going to hold off on boosting tariffs on Chinese imports from 10 to 25 percent while trying to hammer out a deal to protect American technology. As the week has worn on, though, that sigh of relief has given way to more anxiety that the trade truce isn't going to last. And the arrest of this high-ranking Chinese executive just adds to that. CHANG: So what is President Trump saying about all this latest news? HORSLEY: He has not said anything about Meng's arrest, but he did contribute to the stock selloff on Tuesday when he tweeted that he wanted to make a deal with Xi but that if they couldn't, tariffs would be going up. And he added for emphasis, quote, \"I am a tariff man. \" That tweet echoed something Trump said last week shortly before his meeting with President Xi. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're very close to doing something with China, but I don't know that I want to do it because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes. HORSLEY: Now, he's right that billions of dollars are flowing into the U. S. Treasury, but it's mostly money that's already in the United States. It's coming from American businesses and consumers. That's who typically pays these tariffs. And we're starting to get some real data on just what that's costing, what the price tag of those tariffs is. There's an advocacy group called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland that's been crunching census data numbers. And we just got the data for October, which is the first month that the Chinese tariffs really took effect. They found that the Chinese tariffs cost American consumers an extra $2. 2 billion, making October the most heavily tariffed month in history. And here's the thing. It really hasn't depressed imports, but China's retaliatory tariffs have depressed U. S. exports to China. So right now it seems like the trade war's hurting the U. S. more than it's hurting China.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about living in a circular world. TRISTRAM STUART: Food, at the moment, is the single biggest damage that humans do to nature. RAZ: This is Tristram Stuart. He's an environmental activist. And Tristram, he wants us to rethink our entire approach to food. STUART: It is the single biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions. It is, by far, the biggest user of freshwater. It is, by far, the biggest cause of species extinction and habitat loss. The soy and the maize that is being grown has, firstly, a huge, negative environmental impact. We are chopping down the Amazon rainforest right now to grow soy to feed to our livestock. That is a monumental and irrevocable disaster for planet Earth. RAZ: Every year, we throw out roughly 1. 3 billion tons of food around the world. That's about a third of what we grow. And Tristram, he wants to change that. Here's more from Tristram on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STUART: Yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away. I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. And I thought, well, this could serve as a symbol for today. So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply. OK, we start out with nine. That's what's in fields around the world every single year. The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm. That's a problem primarily associated with developing world agriculture, whether it's a lack of infrastructure - refrigeration, pasteurization, grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields. The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock - the maize, the wheat and the soy. Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals. And they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat. So we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste - what ends up in the garbage, what ends up in supermarket bins, what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two. And we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources, especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: I mean, this is - it sounds like there's a - there's several pieces of the puzzle to - that need to be fixed - right? - to resolve this. But it sounds like a big piece of this puzzle is that if we could just use food waste more efficiently, we wouldn't have to grow so much more food. STUART: That's right. We don't have to grow way more food, particularly not in rich countries. At the moment, we put our food scraps into the garbage. RAZ: Yeah. STUART: And a garbage collector comes and takes it, along with all the other trash, and drives it to a landfill site, where it is buried. It decomposes anaerobically - in the absence of oxygen because it's underground - and produces methane, which contributes even more to global warming. RAZ: Yeah. STUART: Instead of treating it as a massive economic burden with no value whatsoever - it's just a cost to the economy. That food scraps - just like if you were producing food on a farm or in a restaurant, those food scraps are a resource. They're a valuable resource. And if we collected that food waste, took it to a plant and cooked it and then sent out to farms, that's a business. That is an economically hugely valuable business. RAZ: So just to clarify, you're talking about recycling our food waste and turning it into animal feed. STUART: That's absolutely right. The function of pigs and chickens could be to upcycle the byproducts and the waste from the human food supply chain. They're perfectly kind of designed to eat our leftovers and upcycle that waste back into food for us - eggs, meat and also manure, which can go back on the land and feed the crops and the vegetables. And if you think about what happened during the Second World War and, indeed, in the first, where there was a real pinch on food supplies for the Allies, it became illegal to grow crops and feed them to livestock. You could only feed them scraps. And the systems put in place at that time for collecting every shred of food on every street corner that went to the pigs that then fed the population and fed the armies, now, that was a resource efficiency drive at the time of war. Right? It was an existential threat. Guess what? We have a new existential threat. It is called environmental catastrophe. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, could it be possible? I mean, could you actually create a system where pigs and chickens are fed food that humans don't eat? I mean, could you do that in an efficient way that wouldn't require, you know, all these soy and corn crops to be grown just to feed these animals? STUART: The short answer is yes, absolutely. And not only can you, but those systems already exist. If you go to parts of the world like Japan, South Korea, where governments have caught on to the fact that there is a massive resource crisis. And they have their own local issues of having to import, of course, food from other parts of the world. There are government incentives and government guidelines on maximizing the amount of food scraps from the food system that go into industrial processing plants that cook the food scraps so they're completely safe, totally sterile, and get them out to pig farms and turn back into what is branded as eco pork and ends up on the same shop shelves as the food waste. . . RAZ: Wow. STUART: . . . That fed them came from. So those systems exist. They're industrial. They're scaled. They're - you know, that's normal, in fact, historically and geographically. And that is, you know, practiced all over the USA in small bits and bobs. But, you know, there's no reason at all why it shouldn't be centralized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STUART: Some food waste, as I said at the beginning, will inevitably arise. So the question is, what is the best thing to do with it? In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago. We domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food. If you cook food for pigs, just as if you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe. If we did that and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon. If we feed our food waste, which is the current sort of government favorite way of getting rid of food waste, to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity, you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs. RAZ: I mean, it sounds like to solve this problem would require an enormous systemic series of policy changes. Like, governments have to harness their power to make this happen. But that also makes me feel helpless, you know, to wait for politicians to solve this problem. And I wonder whether it also requires just behavioral changes among ordinary people to just decide that they are going to try and make a contribution. Is that even possible? STUART: It's not just possible, we're already doing that. We haven't got anything like as far as we need to. And we need to speed this up way, way, way faster than is currently the case. But if you look at food waste reduction in the U. K. , we achieved a 21 percent reduction in food waste in households. RAZ: Yeah. STUART: And I believe there is a way of tipping, socially, into a system that completely changes the dominant paradigm in our society and shifts away from pure financial maximization to something much more wholesome. That is not impossible. Financial maximization is a recent construct. It didn't used to be the heart of our society. And it sure as hell can't be in the future. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: That's Tristram Stuart. He's an environmental activist and founder of the nonprofit craft beer maker Toast Ale. You can see Tristram's full talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about living in a circular world. TRISTRAM STUART: Food, at the moment, is the single biggest damage that humans do to nature. RAZ: This is Tristram Stuart. He's an environmental activist. And Tristram, he wants us to rethink our entire approach to food. STUART: It is the single biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions. It is, by far, the biggest user of freshwater. It is, by far, the biggest cause of species extinction and habitat loss. The soy and the maize that is being grown has, firstly, a huge, negative environmental impact. We are chopping down the Amazon rainforest right now to grow soy to feed to our livestock. That is a monumental and irrevocable disaster for planet Earth. RAZ: Every year, we throw out roughly 1. 3 billion tons of food around the world. That's about a third of what we grow. And Tristram, he wants to change that. Here's more from Tristram on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STUART: Yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets that I often visit to inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away. I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there. And I thought, well, this could serve as a symbol for today. So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that I found in the bin represent the global food supply. OK, we start out with nine. That's what's in fields around the world every single year. The first biscuit we're going to lose before we even leave the farm. That's a problem primarily associated with developing world agriculture, whether it's a lack of infrastructure - refrigeration, pasteurization, grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields. The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock - the maize, the wheat and the soy. Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals. And they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat. So we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one in meat and dairy products. Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins. This is what most of us think of when we think of food waste - what ends up in the garbage, what ends up in supermarket bins, what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two. And we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on. That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources, especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAZ: I mean, this is - it sounds like there's a - there's several pieces of the puzzle to - that need to be fixed - right? - to resolve this. But it sounds like a big piece of this puzzle is that if we could just use food waste more efficiently, we wouldn't have to grow so much more food. STUART: That's right. We don't have to grow way more food, particularly not in rich countries. At the moment, we put our food scraps into the garbage. RAZ: Yeah. STUART: And a garbage collector comes and takes it, along with all the other trash, and drives it to a landfill site, where it is buried. It decomposes anaerobically - in the absence of oxygen because it's underground - and produces methane, which contributes even more to global warming. RAZ: Yeah. STUART: Instead of treating it as a massive economic burden with no value whatsoever - it's just a cost to the economy. That food scraps - just like if you were producing food on a farm or in a restaurant, those food scraps are a resource. They're a valuable resource.

I'm Guy Raz. So we've all been told that if the economy is growing and if we keep producing and consuming, that's a good thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)BARACK OBAMA: We are at a moment when our economy is growing. BILL CLINTON: This is good news for America and more evidence that our economy continues to surge ahead. . . GEORGE W BUSH: So long as we pursue pro-growth policies that put faith in the American people, our economy will prosper, and it will continue to be the marvel of the world. RAZ: But what if we're wrong? What if growth isn't the answer to a better world? (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Moments ago, the numbers for America's economic growth, or GDP, were just released. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The economy grew by 7. 4 percent. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: It's just 1. 2 percent. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: . . . Grew 4. 1 percent. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: . . . Grew half a percent. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: . . . 8. 2 percent in the April to June quarter. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: . . . Up 2. 2. That's a one-tenth lower number than we were originally. . . RAZ: Generally, how do we measure - like, how do we know whether an economy is doing well or not? Like, how do most economists measure that? KATE RAWORTH: Well, that's an excellent question. And you know what? It never actually gets asked in an economics degree. I mean, wouldn't you think, when students were studying economics, that the first thing you'd ask is, well, what is an economy for, and what does success look like? But that never actually comes up. It's just skipped right over. And so how you measure how well an economy is doing just becomes a deeply assumed turning towards GDP growth. Throughout my education and far too much throughout the education of students today, the assumption that, well, if this policy and that policy will lead to growth, job done. RAZ: This is Kate Raworth. RAWORTH: I am a renegade economist. I'm passionate about rewriting economics so that it's actually fit for this century that we are in. RAZ: Most if not all policymakers, economists, they all agree this is a good thing, that growing an economy is good. It increases prosperity. I mean, it would almost be political suicide - right? - for somebody to say, growth is a bad thing. Let's stop it. But in general - right? - most of them agree. The consensus is that growth is good. It spreads prosperity. RAWORTH: It is indeed. It is a deeply powerful narrative. It could almost be political suicide to question it. Of course, that's exactly what Bobby Kennedy did in the 1960s, and he made a very famous speech. His brother, John, ran for election in 1960 on the promise of a 5 percent growth rate. So it was - the growth narrative was absolutely at its height as John F. Kennedy was elected. But then Bobby comes along some years later, and he questions it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT F KENNEDY: If we judge the United States of America by that, that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising. RAWORTH: And he says, in essence, GDP measures everything except that which we fundamentally value - the laughter of our children, the prosperity of our own lives, the health of our communities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KENNEDY: It measures neither our wit nor our courage. RAWORTH: It's been questioned for many, many decades. And this questioning, I think, is just getting stronger and stronger. And it's time to replace it with something fit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KENNEDY: It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. RAZ: Kate Raworth picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RAWORTH: Global GDP is 10 times bigger than it was in 1950, and that increase has brought prosperity to billions of people. But the global economy has also become incredibly divisive, with a vast share of returns to wealth now accruing to a fraction of the global 1 percent. And the economy has become incredibly degenerative, rapidly destabilizing this delicately balanced planet. Our politicians know it, and so they offer new destinations for growth. I think it's time to choose a higher ambition because humanity's 21st century challenge is clear - to meet the needs of all people, within the means of this extraordinary, unique, living planet so that we and the rest of nature can thrive. Progress on this goal isn't going to be measured with the metric of money. We need a dashboard of indicators. And when I sat down to try and draw a picture of what that might look like - strange, though this is going to sound - it came out looking like a doughnut. But let me introduce you to the one doughnut that might actually turn out to be good for us. So imagine humanity's resource use radiating out from the middle. That hole in the middle is a place where people are falling short on life's essentials. They don't have the food, health care, education, political voice, housing that every person needs for a life of dignity and opportunity. We want to get everybody out of the hole, over the social foundation and into that green doughnut itself. But we cannot let our collective resource use overshoot that outer circle, the ecological ceiling, because there we put so much pressure on this extraordinary planet that we begin to kick it out of kilter. We cause climate breakdown. We acidify the oceans, a hole in the ozone layer - pushing ourselves beyond the planetary boundaries of the life-supporting systems that have, for the last 11,000 years, made Earth such a benevolent home to humanity. So this double-sided challenge to meet the needs of all within the means of the planet, it invites a new shape of progress - no longer this ever-rising line of growth, but a sweet spot for humanity, thriving in dynamic balance between the foundation and the ceiling. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAWORTH: I'm not against an economy spending more money on the goods and services people need. The problem I have with the current obsession we have in our economy's growth is that we are structurally addicted to growth. We've structured the expectation of an ever-growing GDP into our financial system, into our political system, into our social lives. And so the design principles that politicians and economists should be looking at and reporting on is showing whether our economies are regenerative and distributive by design. And then whether or not the GDP - goods and services sold - is going up or fluctuating, or down a bit and then up, or up and bit and then down, that's a secondary thought because where we want to get to is somewhere not just for more growth, but an economy that meets the needs of all within the means of the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: So if our addiction to growth is the problem, is there a way to rethink how we live? From the clothes we wear, to the food we eat, to the materials we use to make everything around us, could we reframe all of that to build a more circular system? Well, today on the show, we're going to explore that very idea and how most of the things we need today are already right in front of us. And for Kate Raworth, this circular approach could be the key to a new kind of economy, an economy that would not only help our planet but also imitate the way it works. RAWORTH: So let's think about the structure and the design of, let's say, 20th century industry. I would call it linear and degenerative. It's linear because think of a long pipe. We take us materials - energy and materials - we stuff them in the pipe. We process them, make them into things we want, use it for a while and then throw it away. So it's this take, make, use, lose linear process. And it's degenerative because it's running down the living planet on which we depend. It's polluting the waters, creating a hole in the ozone layer. It's deforesting the land. It's filling the atmosphere with excess, you know, waste, carbon dioxides. So it's degenerative. We need to move away from that linear process to a circular one in which the waste from one process becomes food for the next. And if we want an example, nature is, like, jumping up and down, with her hand in the air, saying, look at me. Look at me. (LAUGHTER)RAWORTH: I'm the example you need. I've been circular for 3. 8 billion years, please. And I'm thriving. You could learn a lot from me. There is no waste in nature. Everything decomposes and comes back as something else. So nature is the ultimate example of circular, regenerative design. RAZ: This - I mean, if we could create this kind of cyclical system, are there any hints of it happening anywhere around the world that we can start to look at and say, OK, that's - that's a model for us? RAWORTH: Yes, it's popping up all over in the way that most of the good things in life do. It's never going to be in one place. But I see it in individual industries or in particular countries. So in cars, there's a company called Open Motors who are making 100 percent electric, modular cars that actually you won't need to own. Why would you want to own a car? Gah (ph), you just want to get somewhere. It'll be a self-driving car. It'll be mobility as a service. In countries - China, actually, is really taking circular economy seriously and looking across its own economy. It's popping up in different places there. In cities - so the city of Amsterdam, the city of London is saying, hey, we really want to take this seriously. So let's jump out of a single product and a single industry and let's look across it through a city scan and ask ourselves, where does all the material flow in this city? And how can we loop materials 'round here instead of having them being shipped all over the world. And then, at an industry level, there's a company like Bio-bean, who will collect coffee grounds from cafes all over a city and turn them into what they call Coffee Logs. They can be used in fires, as an energy source. So just like the best things in life, it's popping up all over because this is an idea that once people get the idea, then they look around at the industry they're in, the city they're in, the country they're in, the community they're part of and say, and what would it mean to start closing the loops here? RAZ: Yeah. I mean, you describe yourself as a renegade economist. Do you ever feel like you're fighting a lone battle? RAWORTH: Oh, I don't feel alone at all. And the ideas I'm talking about, of course, have been around for many decades. RAZ: Sure. RAWORTH: And just as with the renewable energy sector - right? - it's been around for decades. And there were some funny tinkerers who put solar panels on their house roof in the '70s, and people thought they were quirky. And people just persist and persist and keep going until the scale begins to build, the technology improves. And you know what? One day it just makes sense. Even in your pocket, it makes sense to do this instead of buying gas and coal and oil. And I believe this transition is going to do the same thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAWORTH: I just want to jump away from the old economic thinking that rules so much of the world. And how do we leap into today's understanding with the science that we recognize now about our dependence on our planetary home that we are rapidly pushing out of balance? How do we quickly bring that into economics? But I profoundly believe that 21st century economics of regenerative and distributive design, it's going to be practiced first and theorized later. So if I want to convince you, I'm not going to spew out a theory. I'm going to show you examples and take you to places where it's popping up. And we see it on the ground. We see that it's working. We see that it makes sense with the planet. It makes sense with the community. And one day, the textbooks will catch up and start telling the story. RAZ: That's economist Kate Raworth. Her book is called \"Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways To Think Like A 21st-Century Economist. \" You can see Kate's full talk at ted. com. On the show today, ideas about building a circular world.

We take us materials - energy and materials - we stuff them in the pipe. We process them, make them into things we want, use it for a while and then throw it away. So it's this take, make, use, lose linear process. And it's degenerative because it's running down the living planet on which we depend. It's polluting the waters, creating a hole in the ozone layer. It's deforesting the land. It's filling the atmosphere with excess, you know, waste, carbon dioxides. So it's degenerative. We need to move away from that linear process to a circular one in which the waste from one process becomes food for the next. And if we want an example, nature is, like, jumping up and down, with her hand in the air, saying, look at me. Look at me. (LAUGHTER) RAWORTH: I'm the example you need. I've been circular for 3. 8 billion years, please. And I'm thriving. You could learn a lot from me. There is no waste in nature. Everything decomposes and comes back as something else. So nature is the ultimate example of circular, regenerative design. RAZ: This - I mean, if we could create this kind of cyclical system, are there any hints of it happening anywhere around the world that we can start to look at and say, OK, that's - that's a model for us? RAWORTH: Yes, it's popping up all over in the way that most of the good things in life do. It's never going to be in one place. But I see it in individual industries or in particular countries. So in cars, there's a company called Open Motors who are making 100 percent electric, modular cars that actually you won't need to own. Why would you want to own a car? Gah (ph), you just want to get somewhere. It'll be a self-driving car. It'll be mobility as a service. In countries - China, actually, is really taking circular economy seriously and looking across its own economy. It's popping up in different places there. In cities - so the city of Amsterdam, the city of London is saying, hey, we really want to take this seriously. So let's jump out of a single product and a single industry and let's look across it through a city scan and ask ourselves, where does all the material flow in this city? And how can we loop materials 'round here instead of having them being shipped all over the world. And then, at an industry level, there's a company like Bio-bean, who will collect coffee grounds from cafes all over a city and turn them into what they call Coffee Logs. They can be used in fires, as an energy source. So just like the best things in life, it's popping up all over because this is an idea that once people get the idea, then they look around at the industry they're in, the city they're in, the country they're in, the community they're part of and say, and what would it mean to start closing the loops here? RAZ: Yeah. I mean, you describe yourself as a renegade economist. Do you ever feel like you're fighting a lone battle? RAWORTH: Oh, I don't feel alone at all. And the ideas I'm talking about, of course, have been around for many decades. RAZ: Sure. RAWORTH: And just as with the renewable energy sector - right? - it's been around for decades. And there were some funny tinkerers who put solar panels on their house roof in the '70s, and people thought they were quirky. And people just persist and persist and keep going until the scale begins to build, the technology improves. And you know what? One day it just makes sense. Even in your pocket, it makes sense to do this instead of buying gas and coal and oil. And I believe this transition is going to do the same thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) RAWORTH: I just want to jump away from the old economic thinking that rules so much of the world. And how do we leap into today's understanding with the science that we recognize now about our dependence on our planetary home that we are rapidly pushing out of balance? How do we quickly bring that into economics? But I profoundly believe that 21st century economics of regenerative and distributive design, it's going to be practiced first and theorized later. So if I want to convince you, I'm not going to spew out a theory. I'm going to show you examples and take you to places where it's popping up. And we see it on the ground. We see that it's working. We see that it makes sense with the planet. It makes sense with the community. And one day, the textbooks will catch up and start telling the story. RAZ: That's economist Kate Raworth. Her book is called \"Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways To Think Like A 21st-Century Economist. \" You can see Kate's full talk at ted. com. On the show today, ideas about building a circular world.

S. employers added 155,000 jobs in November. The Labor Department released those numbers this morning. Although employers added fewer jobs in November than in the previous few months, the unemployment rate remained at 3. 7 percent. That is a 50-year low. So what do these numbers mean? What do they tell us about the overall health of the U. S. economy? To ask those questions, let's turn to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributor to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So what did we learn from these numbers? WESSEL: Well, as you said, we learned that the job market continues to do pretty darn well, though the pace of job growth has slowed a little bit. Unemployment's at a 50-year low. And it's interesting. Wages are finally, finally, finally starting to inch up. Hourly wages were up about 3 percent over the past year. That's more than enough to offset inflation. But workers are working on average fewer hours, so weekly paychecks are actually not growing. Overall, I'd say the job market is not good for everyone, but it's sure one heck of a lot better than it was just a few years ago. GREENE: OK, but there are still people who are not going to be feeling the effects of this economy yet, and that's a theme that we've been hearing about for a while now. WESSEL: Right. Of course. But the numbers tell us that more and more people are feeling the effects of the strong labor market. We still have a big gap between winners and losers in the economy. It's still better to have a college education than be a high school dropout. But if you look at some of the underlying details of the report, for instance, one measure that a lot of economists pay attention to is how many people are working part time but say they want a full-time job. Well, at last report, there were about 4. 8 million of those. A few years ago, there were 8 million of them. So lots of people are doing better even though not everybody is. GREENE: And what about a statistic we often talk about, which is people who are actually looking for work compared to people who have just given up and are sitting on the sidelines of the economy? I know it's something you often talk about that takes us to a layer deeper than just looking at the unemployment rate. WESSEL: Absolutely. The headline unemployment rate, the one that we all talk about, only counts people who are telling the government, yes, I'm looking for a job in the last several weeks and I didn't find one. But there are a lot of people who are discouraged workers or might be on disability or might otherwise be on the sidelines of the economy, and another encouraging thing is there are fewer of those. So economists like to look at people in the prime working ages of between 25 and 54. A few years ago, 25 percent of those people, men and women, were not working - some looking for work, some not. Today, it's only 20 percent - still high but it's definitely moving in the right direction. GREENE: OK. Just putting all of these pieces together, it is sounding like a generally optimistic outlook with some caveats. Is that safe to say? I mean, the economy is looking pretty good? WESSEL: Well, remember; everything I told you, we're kind of looking in the rearview mirror. So the economy is looking pretty good now, and it's looking much better than it did a few years ago. The question really now is can this last? And there are some clouds on the horizon. The stock and bond markets are uneasy about the outlook. The global economy's slowing down. The benefits of the tax cuts will wear off. There's the trade war. We really can't keep adding jobs at this pace because we simply don't have enough workers. So the outlook is a little cloudy, but for now, things are really good. GREENE: And what about inflation? I know the Fed is often interested in inflation. You said that there are some things that are offsetting that risk. But could that become a problem? WESSEL: It could. The question is, if unemployment goes too far, do wages shoot up, then prices, then the Fed slams on the break by raising interest rates? But for now, inflation is really, really slow. It's not even at the Fed's 2 percent target consistently. GREENE: Always making sense of the economic numbers for us, David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributor to The Wall Street Journal and most importantly for us a frequent voice on our program.

S. On Friday, we learned that the U. S. unemployment rate stands at 3. 7 percent. That's a record 50-year low after U. S. employers added 155,000 jobs in November. However, the week was also full of dramatic swings in the stock market, which analysts suggest may be due to ongoing tensions between the U. S. and China over trade. To help us get a sense of what last week's events mean and what we should be watching for in the coming months, we are joined now by David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. David, thanks so much for joining us once again. DAVID WESSEL: It's a pleasure. MARTIN: All right. So let's start with the pain. Last week was stressful for people watching the Dow fall hundreds of points. It was up and down all week but mostly down. And, as I understand it, U. S. stocks were worth about a trillion dollars less at the end of the week than at the beginning. What is going on here? WESSEL: Well, you're right. It was up and down but mostly down. Stocks overall were, depending on how you measure them, down around 5 percent in a week, which is a lot. You know, one of the problems with diagnosing the stock market is that everybody has a theory, and they - you never know which ones are the right ones. But it certainly seems that, one, there is a lot of concern about the U. S. trying a trade war. There's also some concern that maybe the U. S. economy is going to slow in 2019 or 2020, and we're going to have a recession. And maybe the Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates too much. So I think there are a lot of things going on, and they all added up to gloom on the stock market. MARTIN: Well, it wasn't all bad news, though. There were 155,000 jobs added. And so what does this new report about employment tell us? WESSEL: You know, the employment report is looking in the rearview mirror. But it tells us that the economy is in very good shape. We did add a few thousand fewer jobs in November than we had in the previous months. But unemployment is, as you said, at a 50-year low. And all the other measures of the labor market are looking strong except wages. The question going forward is, are wages about to take off? Are we going to have too much inflation? And then is the Fed going to raise interest rates and cause a recession? Or is - are we finally getting to the point where workers are going to be benefiting, and the Fed will let this go on for a while? And the market's a little confused about that, and that's contributing to the uncertainty. MARTIN: And, finally, can I ask you, what - there are the numbers and then there's how people feel about them. How do Americans feel about the economy right now? WESSEL: Well, if you look at the measures of consumer confidence, they're improving. People feel pretty good about the economy. But, on the other hand, you know that there are a lot of people who feel they've been left out of the benefits of globalization and technology. Many of these people voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or voted for some of the Democrats in 2018. They don't really care what happens to the stock market. But some of the same uncertainty that's driving investors to be cautious is making Americans worry. Does our government have the capacity and the tools and the willingness to fix what ails the economy for working people? And I think that's an open question. MARTIN: That's David Wessel.

I'm Terry Gross. The future of the driverless car is going to affect the future of how we travel and what we do in cars. But driverless cars are also likely to transform roads, cities, suburbs, jobs, the economy and daily life. My guest Samuel Schwartz expects it to be a very disruptive technology. Schwartz is the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future,\" which he says is about the good, the bad and the ugly of how driverless cars will change our world. He knows a lot about transportation systems. He served as the traffic commissioner of New York City and chief engineer of the city's Department of Transportation. He now has his own consulting firm and has worked with cities around the world on transportation-related issues. Later in our conversation, after we talk about the future, we're going to talk about traffic problems that plague us today. We're going to use the words driverless car interchangeably with the words autonomous vehicle, or AV. Sam Schwartz, welcome to FRESH AIR. In your book, you write that AVs, autonomous vehicles, will be the most disruptive technology to hit society worldwide since the advent of the motorcar. Give us a couple of examples of industries or jobs or roadways that we might not realize will be profoundly affected by AVs once they start to really dominate. SAMUEL SCHWARTZ: I think everybody is expecting fewer drivers, and, you know, that's no surprise. But it also means that there're probably going to be fewer repair shops because AVs lend themselves to fleet operations, especially if they're going to be offering rides, as opposed to selling maximum vehicles. So car dealerships may disappear. So this is going to have wide impacts. Truckers, of course, are going to be impacted - how we move about in so many different ways. But lots of industries will be affected. The insurance industry, certainly, will be affected since we will have fewer crashes, and about a third of the insurance industry is based on crashes. And if we have fewer crashes, there are going to be fewer cases in court. There'll be less of a burden on the court system. GROSS: So kind of nobody's going to have a job, is what (laughter) - is what you're saying. SCHWARTZ: No, not quite, but. . . GROSS: You know, I've always - until reading your book, I thought of AVs - autonomous vehicles, driverless cars - as looking a lot like my car, except that I wouldn't have to sit in the driver's seat, or if I was in the driver's seat, I wouldn't have to do anything. But as you point out in your book, once you have an autonomous vehicle, you get to rethink the whole design of the car and probably also what the car is made of. I mean, let's face it. Our cars are designed for, like, the gas engine under the hood, and the steering wheel and the brake pedal. So give us a sense of, visually - like, of how a car might be designed differently. SCHWARTZ: A lot of people have the image that you have, Terry. And a lot of them look - they kind of look - the Google car looks like a smaller car, like a smart car, and it's got some intelligence on top of it. But I liken this a bit to the cellphone. In 1982, I was traffic commissioner. I had one of the first cellphones that I could use during emergencies. And the cellphone came - with a man carrying it - on a 12-volt battery and this huge phone. And today - the cellphone of today doesn't look anything like the cellphone that I had in 1982. The same thing can happen with cars. It could - the autonomous vehicle of the future, most people think that by the second half of the century, at least, and maybe sooner, will have no steering wheel, will have no brake. It will be a room. It could be a room any size. It could be a conference room. It could be, you know, the width of a house. It - there's no reason to think it's going to look like a car, other than that's what we're used to. So others are beginning to think of these vehicles as being something totally different - different uses. And I see that as a real potential - as a meeting place, a sleeping place, an eating place. Medical facilities will come to you. It'll look like a hospital room or a doctor's office - a place to be examined by a doctor remotely in which a remote stethoscope listens to your heart, and your blood pressure is taken, and all those types of things are possible. Some of this is good. But we should be - go forward with our eyes wide open. GROSS: What's your assessment so far of the safety of autonomous vehicles and what that would be like in the future? I mean, on the one hand, you don't have a driver's misjudgment or a driver falling asleep at the wheel, so that could eliminate certain crashes. On the other hand, technology is always subject to failure, and computers often mess up, and they - you know, everybody's been on the computer when it just kind of freezes, and you can't work anymore. So imagine that happening to your car. SCHWARTZ: And it could happen, and, of course, hacking could happen. But many of the features that autonomous vehicles are - operators are claiming are needed, you don't need in the autonomous mode. So there is automatic braking features. There are lane-control features. There are blind-spot monitoring. There's a whole host of things that are being offered today to people who could afford it. So the low-income people are not getting all these safety features that could cut down on crashes tremendously. And then you take the driver out of it. Yes, you'll - you can reduce crashes further because you don't have to worry about the judgment of a driver, but you may create other types of crashes. Right now, the industry isn't sharing anything. This is really an industry that has tons and tons of data, but they're not sharing it with the public. The only data that's accessible is the state of California, which is reporting anytime there is a crash when a vehicle is in autonomous mode. And so far, the results are not good. So far, we know of three deaths, and not because of any reporting. That's the media reporting of three deaths in autonomous mode. For conventional cars, that would take 260 million miles before that would occur. And here we have three deaths, and AVs have driven maybe 10 or 15 million miles. In California, which requires the reporting of crashes, the cars in autonomous mode are crashing nine or 10 times more often than the conventional cars. Will they solve a lot of that? Yes, they're going to. They could solve a lot of the safety problems in the next few years. Everybody could have automatic braking. Everybody could have lane-control protections and could have blind-spot monitoring and other safety features. But there is this meme that we have to wait until we have autonomous vehicles for safety, instead of the meme that maybe we could do a lot now. GROSS: So what kind of features are you talking about? SCHWARTZ: Right now, in - for example, I have a car, a 2017 Volvo, that will stop on its own if I'm not paying attention and about to rear-end another car. There are features that will let me know if I am leaving the lane. The car itself will tug and tell me that I'm crossing a lane. And so if I'm drowsy, if I'm not paying attention or if I had too much to drink, which I would never do, I would know that. I know that there's a warning if there's a car in my blind spot and I'm trying to change lanes. So there are lots of features that exist today that if the industry that is claiming, safety, safety, safety, and that's why we need AVs, would really focus on safety, they'd say, we could have - by 2022, every single car sold in America could be the safest car possible, and we'll make it even safer eventually with autonomous vehicles. But so far, the track record is not very good with autonomous vehicles. They can't figure out what a pedestrian is or the pedestrian is going to do. They can't separate a child from a dog. There's sometimes - a tree branch overhanging the road will be taken as something in the way. So, you know, we're far from perfecting. GROSS: How good are AVs at recognizing a human being? SCHWARTZ: They're in the high 90s - they will - percent-wise. But there are times that they'll have a false reading, or they will still say, I think this is a person. And this is what happened with the Uber crash in Tempe, Ariz. , that killed a woman. The woman was walking with a bicycle. So you would think, A, it would recognize the woman and, two, it would also recognize a bicycle. But the system said, hmm, I'm not sure what this is; it doesn't look right to me, so I don't want to stop suddenly because that also contributes to crashes; I'm going to plow right ahead. And it plowed right ahead and killed her. GROSS: Wow. Yeah. I think I didn't understand how that happened. My guest is Samuel Schwartz. He's the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He is the former New York City traffic commissioner and the former chief engineer of New York City's Department of Transportation. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sam Schwartz. He's the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He knows a lot about roads and cars and traffic. He's New York City's former traffic commissioner and former chief engineer of the Department of Transportation. He has his own consulting firm now. So let's talk about how AVs could affect transportation in terms of, like, traffic. And, you know, driverless cars are great if they're not stuck in traffic (laughter). And they're going to affect the amount of traffic on the road. Then they'll also affect what the road looks like. You lay out a scenario. There's a family with a couple of kids, two parents. The AV takes one parent to work, drops them off work, comes back home, picks up the kids, takes them to school, drops them off at school. The autonomous vehicle comes back home, picks up the second parent, takes them to work. And then the car does - I'm not sure what. I'm not sure where it stays (laughter) in between all of these trips. But you point out, in between trips, you have an empty car. You have what you describe as, like, a zombie car. So what does that mean in terms of, like, the number of cars that's going to be on the road? SCHWARTZ: Well, one way to look at the future is the intent of many people in the AV industry is to replicate Uber, Lyft, Via and other car services but without a driver. So in lots of cases, you - it would be an app or whatever succeeds an app. You will call for a car. The difference between that and an Uber today is there will be no driver. So the - we've already been able to determine a lot of things about these new app-based services. The average app-based service, when it carries you 1 mile, it needs to travel 1. 6 miles. So a 10-mile trip means that vehicle would have traveled 16 miles over the course of the day. And that's because it's empty during portions of the day. The car has to get into position to be near where there's density of people. So we already know it increases vehicle miles traveled. We also know that there's a concentration - unless we're smart, there's a concentration of where the well-to-do are. It's a concentration in most cities like New York, like Philadelphia, like San Francisco and Chicago that a lot of the well-to-do are now near or in city centers, where we already have the best transportation and the best transit systems. So what we've been finding is the congregation of the Ubers and Lyfts, A, where we already have good transportation service, B, where many of our wealthiest citizens live and, C, where we already had the worst traffic. So the future, unless we change that model, is quite bleak because there'll be many, many more autonomous vehicles out there because it'll be so inexpensive to run them, especially if they're run as a fleet. There'll be no downtime. The average car today is in - 95 percent of the time sits idle. These cars will be moving around doing their job 80, 90 percent of the time. So far more vehicles will be on the road. The other thing is there is this hype from the industry that autonomous vehicles are so efficient, they could follow each other so closely that we could replicate on a highway the capacity of a train. That's nonsense. A train or a bus in an exclusive lane could move 100 people in 60 feet, or certainly a subway car, whereas an autonomous vehicle, unless we change our behavior, is going to have one person per car - even if it has one person per car - it may have zero, less than that - will be moving, at most, two or three people in that same distance. So it - the math doesn't work. GROSS: So are you, like, making an argument here that, in spite of AVs, we need good public transportation, like trains that can move a lot of people at one time with high density within each car? SCHWARTZ: Autonomous vehicles are coming. There's no doubt about it. But we should maintain good public transportation systems. We should - and I use the adjective good because there are bad public transportation systems out there. Ninety percent of the country has lousy public transportation. It's called a bus that comes around every half hour or hour. It largely serves poor people. When a system only serves poor people, it's a poor system. Often it's largely people of color. We have an opportunity to transform public transportation in those areas, not to offer a half-hour service, but we can triple the service by using micro-transit AV vehicles, small buses that are smart buses that are on-demand that know where the people are, know where they want to get off. We already have that technology. We have a company here called Via that is doing it in New York, Chicago and a few others. We have Ford Chariot that's beginning to do it in San Francisco and a few other places. The technology is here. So AVs could be terrific for lower-density public transportation. But we're going to still need, in the big cities or in places where we want to move lots of people - the Northeast Corridor - you're going to still need trains. You're still going to need subways, streetcars. We can't substitute cars for that kind of service. GROSS: So, you know, we're talking about cars changing. And we're talking about the road infrastructure. What kinds of new highways will driverless cars require? Like, how might highways change? SCHWARTZ: If we're really smart, we can have less infrastructure if autonomous vehicles really look something like cars. If they have a width of 6 feet as cars have today, if you have a three-lane highway - the average three-lane highway is 36 feet - you're probably going - three 12-foot lanes - you're only going to need, say, 21 feet. So you can either add more lanes and add more capacities to highways or do something else with all that land that will be unleashed and not have to maintain as much infrastructure. GROSS: But let me interrupt you for a second because you are saying that we're going to be able to, like, eat and sleep and have romantic evenings in our car. So that requires room. But if you're making the car smaller because there isn't going to be a driver, then there isn't going to be a - you know, space to, like, live in your car the way you described it before. SCHWARTZ: Yeah. So I go through the good, the bad, the ugly. GROSS: OK (laughter). SCHWARTZ: What I'm painting right now is the good. GROSS: OK. SCHWARTZ: And the good is they look like cars. They don't look like conference rooms. They don't look like houses. They don't look like coffee shops. They look like cars. What a great opportunity if they stay in - looking like cars because of the narrowness of cars. They're 6 feet wide, but we have 12-foot lanes because people weave back and forth. They're imprecise in their driving. They're not paying attention. An autonomous vehicle could be like a tracked vehicle - stay in lane. So for - a 6-foot vehicle could have a 7-foot lane. So in that three-lane highway that's 36 feet - you can get a three-lane highway down to 21 feet, and it'll be a more efficient highway in terms of moving vehicles 'cause the autonomous vehicles could be more closely together. GROSS: GM recently announced plans to shut down five factories in North America and cut about 14,000 jobs. Earlier this year, Ford announced it will stop making sedans. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler stopped making small and mid-sized cars. I think GM is also going to be cutting back its, you know, mid-sized cars. And the emphasis seems to be in two directions - one on AVs, autonomous vehicles, and the other on, like, trucks and SUVs. So we seem to be heading in two opposite directions at the same time in a way. Like, the most fuel-efficient and the least (laughter) fuel-efficient cars and, you know, more lightweight autonomous vehicles and incredibly, like, big and heavyweight larger vehicles. Do you see us heading in two opposite directions at the same time? SCHWARTZ: Yeah. I'm very disappointed in that the auto industry - and that, you know, they're reflecting the desires of the American people to be in bigger cars, to be in heavier vehicles and to have these front ends that are so high. That has an impact. That's why pedestrian deaths - that's one of the main reasons pedestrian deaths have soared - is that people are getting hit by SUVs, getting hit not - no longer with knee injuries - and this comes from ER doctors who've seen me, who talk to me. There's a real connection between the health industry right now and transportation. They say in the past, someone got hit by a car, it was a knee injury. It was leg injury. Now it's a chest injury, and those are more likely to be fatal. So I'm really not happy about that. But yes, it is going to be a problem - moving heavier vehicles and trying to consume less energy. GROSS: My guest is Sam Schwartz, author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's the former traffic commissioner of New York City. And after a break, we'll talk about the kinds of traffic nightmares we face today. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLES MINGUS'S \"A FOGGY DAY\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Sam Schwartz, author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel\" about driverless cars and how they're likely to change the future of transportation, roads, jobs, cities and daily life. Now we're going to talk about the traffic nightmares we face today. Schwartz is an expert on that. He served as traffic commissioner of New York City and the chief engineer of the city's Department of Transportation. He now has a consulting firm which works with cities in the U. S. and other countries on transportation and traffic-related issues. There are so many changes going on right now in who drives and what they drive and what the roads are like, and I'd like to spend some time talking about that 'cause I'm as interested in what's happening right now as I am as what's going to happen in the future as more and more AVs come onto the road. And you know a lot about what's happening now because your consulting firm advises, you know, different cities around the world how to deal with current changes. So let's look at what's happening in some places in America right now. As you point out, millennials are generationally less likely to own a car or even drive a car than previous generations. So let's start with, why do you think that is? SCHWARTZ: For a variety of reasons. And I did write a previous book, \"Street Smart,\" in which I interviewed a lot of millennials. They came up with lots of reasons - you know, the cost, the - certainly the availability of other forms of transportation with the apps that you have today. The loans that they still have from college make it difficult. The - there was also an interesting thing that I learned talking to millennials - is they saw it as old-fashioned. They saw it from the back of the car. Many of them grew up in suburbs - saw very unhappy parents fighting over who's going to drive the kids to soccer practice and school and to the dentist and all of those things. And they didn't - that's not a lifestyle that they want. So there's been a big 20 percent drop in millennials. It doesn't mean the majority don't drive. The majority do drive. But it's gone from 90 percent driving to 70 percent driving. A 20 percent drop is like an earthquake in transportation. GROSS: And of course bicycles have become much more popular. But also millennials are taking advantage of app-based car services like Uber and Lyft. And I'm wondering how you think app-based car services like Uber and Lyft are affecting larger traffic patterns in urban areas. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, you know, I've been in the transportation business for a half century. I was a New York City cab driver back in 1968. And I watched transportation evolve over time. I have never seen anything as rapid as what has happened this decade. So Uber and Lyft - we were caught flatfooted, all those of us in city planning. We never saw it coming. We never thought it would be as popular as it is. But it is so popular that in five years, a brand new service eclipsed the number of people taking taxi rides in just about every city from taxi industries that have been around for a hundred years. It has rapidly increased the amount of miles driven in the densest part of cities, so it's made congestion much worse in those places. And it's not provided the kind of service improvements in transit since it's taking a lot of people out of transit. In New York City, perhaps half the people in Uber and Lyft come out of transit. In California, which is really a car capital of the world, it's 33 percent of Uber and Lyft drivers - Lyft passengers say that they came out of public transportation. In Denver, in Boston - any city, it's the same thing. So we're putting more cars on the road and we're putting them in the worst traffic spots. So it's been a shock to the system. If we can go to - when these services came in, they talked about taking people to transit. That would be the best use of these services. GROSS: Another thing that I think is really changing the roads in cities are the delivery services, like the trucks that deliver groceries to your door through various apps and the bicycles that deliver food from restaurants through various apps to your door. And the delivery trucks - you know, when they double-park, that takes up a lot of space. And I know they're only running in and out, but it still kind of backs up traffic for that amount of time. So what's your impression about how the convenience that so many of us are taking advantage of through these delivery services, including deliveries on things that - you know, on goods that you order through the Internet - how these delivery trucks are affecting traffic? SCHWARTZ: They're having a big impact, these micro-deliveries where you can have a - you know, toothpaste delivered, and that could be the only thing in the package. It adds to many more trucks. So we're seeing an increase in the number of trucks that are traveling in cities. It may work well in - again, in low-density areas, but in cities, it's been a problem. What we're seeing is some of the fulfillment centers are now using Uber and Lyft to make these micro-deliveries so, again, adding far more traffic. If we go back, you know, again, to the last century, people walked to stores. People drove to stores. People then collected and bought far more goods than they would at one time than they are now getting, every single day, a little package delivered. GROSS: I think bicycles are having a huge impact on traffic, especially millennials who don't have a car and don't always need or want to take, you know, a vehicle service like Uber or Lyft. You know, you bicycle, but many urban roads are not really designed for bicycles. Where I live, for instance, in Philadelphia, it's an old city. It's a Ben Franklin-era city in some ways. And the streets are very narrow except for a couple of the main streets in Philly. And to squeeze in parked cars and drivers and bikes, you know, on one road is often really challenging. And there's wonderful things to be said environmentally and in terms of convenience about the positive nature of bicycles, but it's also, I think, having some adverse effects for life on the roads. SCHWARTZ: Well, you know, I - again, I'd like to change the mindset a bit and remember that for hundreds of thousands of years, since the first cities started, it was the pedestrians that were walking, and the carriages had to go around them or move at the same speed. And somehow we've accepted the fact that we need lots of cars, lots of vehicles, and the intruders are the bike riders and the pedestrians, and they shouldn't be second-class citizens. What happened in cities like New York City, Seattle and others that really went - I wouldn't say all out but at least in their central business districts provide far more pedestrian zones, far more bicycle lanes, the total number of cars coming in has gone down. And so we can get by with fewer cars. If we get by with fewer cars, then suddenly maybe Chestnut and Walnut in Philadelphia could have different uses. Maybe the cars go very slowly, which they do anyhow. But if you go to many European cities, you'll see the mix of pedestrians and cars moving very slowly. We may have to use examples like that, but we have to change our mindset. GROSS: So what is your greatest frustration now as a driver when you're driving as opposed to using public transportation? SCHWARTZ: You know, having been traffic commissioner, having been in charge of traffic enforcement, my blood boils when I see violations. And when I see violations where people are illegally parked or people are turning against a red light when they're not permitted, those things really drive me crazy. In New York City, we have government workers who drive in at twice the rate of anyone else because they get placards to park their cars. That drives me nuts. If I were back as traffic commissioner, I'd be telling all of them - in fact, I did that, and I told so many diplomats that I was invited to what I am told is the best-attended session of the U. N. General Assembly. GROSS: (Laughter) They wanted you to fix their tickets (laughter). SCHWARTZ: I had the - the Israelis and Arabs were on the same side as. . . GROSS: (Laughter). SCHWARTZ: . . . Iraq and Iran in the 1980s. And it was just me being interpreted into a dozen languages. And one who would've gone by and just seen that scene not hearing what was going on would assume this lone guy at the table that the whole world was focusing on had the answer to world peace. It was all about parking. GROSS: That is really, really hilarious. Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Sam Schwartz. He's the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's also New York City's former traffic commissioner and the former chief engineer for New York City's Department of Transportation. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JERRY GRANELLI, ROBBEN FORD, BILL FRISELL AND J. ANTHONY GRANELLI'S \"AIN'T THAT A SHAME\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sam Schwartz, author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's also New York City's former traffic commissioner and former chief engineer for New York City's Department of Transportation. He now has his own consulting firm. So let's talk briefly about your time as New York City traffic commissioner and chief transportation engineer in New York. One of the things I've always wondered is, how do you get traffic lights synced up? 'Cause I could see the possibility of syncing them up, say, going north-south, but what about the intersecting streets going east-west? Like, and you were doing that before, like, personal computers. So just tell us a little bit about the difficulties of making that happen. SCHWARTZ: Actually, I learned how to do signal timing right near you at the University of Pennsylvania 50 years ago, and we did it by using graphs. And we used the speed and distance graphs to figure out - if a vehicle is moving at 30 miles an hour in six seconds, it'll be at the next street so we have to change the signal at the next street. Now, that's easy to do when you have just a linear problem. But when you have a grid problem, how do you do it crosstown? Well, we soon learned that we couldn't do it on every street, but we could do it on every fourth street. So it's a mathematical problem. But ultimately, the conclusion that I came to in the 1980s, and that's after a dozen years at - working at the traffic department, was that we're not going to solve the traffic problem by moving more cars and that the best signal program for an area like Midtown Manhattan or center city is one that recognizes when the number of vehicles in the center city or the Midtown area is getting to a critical volume. And at that point, begin to slowly entry of vehicles into it using the signal system kind of as a belt tightening the number of cars coming in. I first learned that in the city of Nottingham, England, which did that in the 1970s. I call it metering of high-density sectors, but we can't solve the problem of north, south, east, west. We really have to solve the problem as a grid problem. GROSS: Shortly after you popularized the word gridlock - and you are the guy who popularized it - I was witness to an amazing gridlock in Manhattan. And I was fortunately a pedestrian at that moment (laughter) - not in a car. But it was a symphony of horns honking. And like, all around, the intersections were just totally bumper-to-bumper with cars. There was no place for any car in the area to move. And I always wondered, like, how does a gridlock like that - when it's, like, a super gridlock, how does it end? SCHWARTZ: OK. Well, it starts because people are piggish. It starts because people block intersections which then block the perpendicular movement. And then. . . GROSS: Oh, you're trying to make it through the (laughter) - you're trying to make it through the right. SCHWARTZ: Right. GROSS: And so is the car. . . SCHWARTZ: Yes. GROSS: . . . In front of you. And yeah. And that's really a recipe for gridlock. SCHWARTZ: Right, right. So. . . GROSS: So yeah. So a gridlock's created. SCHWARTZ: Right. So a bird's-eye view would show you're blocking yourself. So the key to that - and I've witnessed many gridlocks - is you have to slow the traffic coming into the area. On April 9, 1980, there was a thunderstorm - a terrible storm during the transit strike. And gridlock was happening. I don't know if it's the day you're talking about. And what I did was I took many of the bridges and tunnels and I reversed the lanes so all lanes went outbound. Imagine Manhattan now as a bathtub. GROSS: (Laughter). SCHWARTZ: And I turned all the faucets off that were bringing traffic in. I didn't let traffic into Manhattan for over an hour, and let the traffic go out the drain. I drained the traffic from Manhattan. So you need to do that. What happens on a daily basis is literally the traffic cop manually wrestling with the traffic to get moving. And sometimes it could last for many hours. And I actually keep a record of the 10 worst gridlocks to ever hit New York City. GROSS: Was one of them around Christmas one year? SCHWARTZ: Yes, it was around Christmas one year. It was on a matinee day. And what happened was everybody came into the city for the matinee. And many of them were not regular drivers. And they ended up blocking each other, and we had so many pedestrians at the same time. Nothing moved. And ultimately, the cops had to come and wrestle the traffic. GROSS: I think that's the gridlock that I witnessed. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: Do a lot - did a lot of people hate you in New York 'cause you were regulating traffic in ways that helped some people but hurt others? SCHWARTZ: Well, yeah. I mean, a lot of people have complained to me. And even today - I mean, I'm long gone. But during my tenure under my supervision, ultimately, we wrote about 50 million summonses and towed about 8 million cars. So I was not terribly popular. And also when I inherited the city's infrastructure, I closed so many bridges that were in danger of falling - and a few of them did fall - that people saw me and got scared and perhaps went the other way. Or I created bridge phobia which I think created a business for a lot of psychiatrists. GROSS: (Laughter) All right. You know, I - I'm leaving this interview so conflicted because I see all the points you're making, but I drive. I use parking ramps when I need to. I take taxis or, you know, app car services when I need to. I use all of that, and I use it at my convenience for my needs. And you're making me feel, like, a little guilty about everything that I do. But on the other hand, we all need to get to where we're going in the best way that we can. So I don't really have a question here. Maybe this is more of a confession. I don't know what it is (laughter). SCHWARTZ: Well, I end the book with a quote by John F. Kennedy when he was president - the car is not the villain. What he called for was balanced transportation, and that's what I'm calling for. There are absolute times I take an Uber. I'm multi-modal man. I take a bus. I take a subway. I drive. I do all those things. What we need is a better balance, in that the pendulum just swung in the direction of too many people driving. If the pendulum goes back, taxis will flow better. Those people that are driving will get to their destinations faster. Public transportation will have more revenue. There is a better way. GROSS: Sam Schwartz, a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much. This is really interesting. I appreciate it. SCHWARTZ: Thank you. And please don't feel guilty the - when next time you drive. GROSS: (Laughter) OK. SCHWARTZ: (Laughter). GROSS: Sam Schwartz is the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's a former traffic commissioner of New York City. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The future of the driverless car is going to affect the future of how we travel and what we do in cars. But driverless cars are also likely to transform roads, cities, suburbs, jobs, the economy and daily life. My guest Samuel Schwartz expects it to be a very disruptive technology. Schwartz is the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future,\" which he says is about the good, the bad and the ugly of how driverless cars will change our world. He knows a lot about transportation systems. He served as the traffic commissioner of New York City and chief engineer of the city's Department of Transportation. He now has his own consulting firm and has worked with cities around the world on transportation-related issues. Later in our conversation, after we talk about the future, we're going to talk about traffic problems that plague us today. We're going to use the words driverless car interchangeably with the words autonomous vehicle, or AV. Sam Schwartz, welcome to FRESH AIR. In your book, you write that AVs, autonomous vehicles, will be the most disruptive technology to hit society worldwide since the advent of the motorcar. Give us a couple of examples of industries or jobs or roadways that we might not realize will be profoundly affected by AVs once they start to really dominate. SAMUEL SCHWARTZ: I think everybody is expecting fewer drivers, and, you know, that's no surprise. But it also means that there're probably going to be fewer repair shops because AVs lend themselves to fleet operations, especially if they're going to be offering rides, as opposed to selling maximum vehicles. So car dealerships may disappear. So this is going to have wide impacts. Truckers, of course, are going to be impacted - how we move about in so many different ways. But lots of industries will be affected. The insurance industry, certainly, will be affected since we will have fewer crashes, and about a third of the insurance industry is based on crashes. And if we have fewer crashes, there are going to be fewer cases in court. There'll be less of a burden on the court system. GROSS: So kind of nobody's going to have a job, is what (laughter) - is what you're saying. SCHWARTZ: No, not quite, but. . . GROSS: You know, I've always - until reading your book, I thought of AVs - autonomous vehicles, driverless cars - as looking a lot like my car, except that I wouldn't have to sit in the driver's seat, or if I was in the driver's seat, I wouldn't have to do anything. But as you point out in your book, once you have an autonomous vehicle, you get to rethink the whole design of the car and probably also what the car is made of. I mean, let's face it. Our cars are designed for, like, the gas engine under the hood, and the steering wheel and the brake pedal. So give us a sense of, visually - like, of how a car might be designed differently. SCHWARTZ: A lot of people have the image that you have, Terry. And a lot of them look - they kind of look - the Google car looks like a smaller car, like a smart car, and it's got some intelligence on top of it. But I liken this a bit to the cellphone. In 1982, I was traffic commissioner. I had one of the first cellphones that I could use during emergencies. And the cellphone came - with a man carrying it - on a 12-volt battery and this huge phone. And today - the cellphone of today doesn't look anything like the cellphone that I had in 1982. The same thing can happen with cars. It could - the autonomous vehicle of the future, most people think that by the second half of the century, at least, and maybe sooner, will have no steering wheel, will have no brake. It will be a room. It could be a room any size. It could be a conference room. It could be, you know, the width of a house. It - there's no reason to think it's going to look like a car, other than that's what we're used to. So others are beginning to think of these vehicles as being something totally different - different uses. And I see that as a real potential - as a meeting place, a sleeping place, an eating place. Medical facilities will come to you. It'll look like a hospital room or a doctor's office - a place to be examined by a doctor remotely in which a remote stethoscope listens to your heart, and your blood pressure is taken, and all those types of things are possible. Some of this is good. But we should be - go forward with our eyes wide open. GROSS: What's your assessment so far of the safety of autonomous vehicles and what that would be like in the future? I mean, on the one hand, you don't have a driver's misjudgment or a driver falling asleep at the wheel, so that could eliminate certain crashes. On the other hand, technology is always subject to failure, and computers often mess up, and they - you know, everybody's been on the computer when it just kind of freezes, and you can't work anymore. So imagine that happening to your car. SCHWARTZ: And it could happen, and, of course, hacking could happen. But many of the features that autonomous vehicles are - operators are claiming are needed, you don't need in the autonomous mode. So there is automatic braking features. There are lane-control features. There are blind-spot monitoring. There's a whole host of things that are being offered today to people who could afford it. So the low-income people are not getting all these safety features that could cut down on crashes tremendously. And then you take the driver out of it. Yes, you'll - you can reduce crashes further because you don't have to worry about the judgment of a driver, but you may create other types of crashes. Right now, the industry isn't sharing anything. This is really an industry that has tons and tons of data, but they're not sharing it with the public. The only data that's accessible is the state of California, which is reporting anytime there is a crash when a vehicle is in autonomous mode. And so far, the results are not good. So far, we know of three deaths, and not because of any reporting. That's the media reporting of three deaths in autonomous mode. For conventional cars, that would take 260 million miles before that would occur. And here we have three deaths, and AVs have driven maybe 10 or 15 million miles. In California, which requires the reporting of crashes, the cars in autonomous mode are crashing nine or 10 times more often than the conventional cars. Will they solve a lot of that? Yes, they're going to. They could solve a lot of the safety problems in the next few years. Everybody could have automatic braking. Everybody could have lane-control protections and could have blind-spot monitoring and other safety features. But there is this meme that we have to wait until we have autonomous vehicles for safety, instead of the meme that maybe we could do a lot now. GROSS: So what kind of features are you talking about? SCHWARTZ: Right now, in - for example, I have a car, a 2017 Volvo, that will stop on its own if I'm not paying attention and about to rear-end another car. There are features that will let me know if I am leaving the lane. The car itself will tug and tell me that I'm crossing a lane. And so if I'm drowsy, if I'm not paying attention or if I had too much to drink, which I would never do, I would know that. I know that there's a warning if there's a car in my blind spot and I'm trying to change lanes. So there are lots of features that exist today that if the industry that is claiming, safety, safety, safety, and that's why we need AVs, would really focus on safety, they'd say, we could have - by 2022, every single car sold in America could be the safest car possible, and we'll make it even safer eventually with autonomous vehicles. But so far, the track record is not very good with autonomous vehicles. They can't figure out what a pedestrian is or the pedestrian is going to do. They can't separate a child from a dog. There's sometimes - a tree branch overhanging the road will be taken as something in the way. So, you know, we're far from perfecting. GROSS: How good are AVs at recognizing a human being? SCHWARTZ: They're in the high 90s - they will - percent-wise. But there are times that they'll have a false reading, or they will still say, I think this is a person. And this is what happened with the Uber crash in Tempe, Ariz. , that killed a woman. The woman was walking with a bicycle. So you would think, A, it would recognize the woman and, two, it would also recognize a bicycle. But the system said, hmm, I'm not sure what this is; it doesn't look right to me, so I don't want to stop suddenly because that also contributes to crashes; I'm going to plow right ahead. And it plowed right ahead and killed her. GROSS: Wow. Yeah. I think I didn't understand how that happened. My guest is Samuel Schwartz. He's the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He is the former New York City traffic commissioner and the former chief engineer of New York City's Department of Transportation. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sam Schwartz. He's the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He knows a lot about roads and cars and traffic. He's New York City's former traffic commissioner and former chief engineer of the Department of Transportation. He has his own consulting firm now. So let's talk about how AVs could affect transportation in terms of, like, traffic. And, you know, driverless cars are great if they're not stuck in traffic (laughter). And they're going to affect the amount of traffic on the road. Then they'll also affect what the road looks like. You lay out a scenario. There's a family with a couple of kids, two parents. The AV takes one parent to work, drops them off work, comes back home, picks up the kids, takes them to school, drops them off at school. The autonomous vehicle comes back home, picks up the second parent, takes them to work. And then the car does - I'm not sure what. I'm not sure where it stays (laughter) in between all of these trips. But you point out, in between trips, you have an empty car. You have what you describe as, like, a zombie car. So what does that mean in terms of, like, the number of cars that's going to be on the road? SCHWARTZ: Well, one way to look at the future is the intent of many people in the AV industry is to replicate Uber, Lyft, Via and other car services but without a driver. So in lots of cases, you - it would be an app or whatever succeeds an app. You will call for a car. The difference between that and an Uber today is there will be no driver. So the - we've already been able to determine a lot of things about these new app-based services. The average app-based service, when it carries you 1 mile, it needs to travel 1. 6 miles. So a 10-mile trip means that vehicle would have traveled 16 miles over the course of the day. And that's because it's empty during portions of the day. The car has to get into position to be near where there's density of people. So we already know it increases vehicle miles traveled. We also know that there's a concentration - unless we're smart, there's a concentration of where the well-to-do are. It's a concentration in most cities like New York, like Philadelphia, like San Francisco and Chicago that a lot of the well-to-do are now near or in city centers, where we already have the best transportation and the best transit systems. So what we've been finding is the congregation of the Ubers and Lyfts, A, where we already have good transportation service, B, where many of our wealthiest citizens live and, C, where we already had the worst traffic. So the future, unless we change that model, is quite bleak because there'll be many, many more autonomous vehicles out there because it'll be so inexpensive to run them, especially if they're run as a fleet. There'll be no downtime. The average car today is in - 95 percent of the time sits idle. These cars will be moving around doing their job 80, 90 percent of the time. So far more vehicles will be on the road. The other thing is there is this hype from the industry that autonomous vehicles are so efficient, they could follow each other so closely that we could replicate on a highway the capacity of a train. That's nonsense. A train or a bus in an exclusive lane could move 100 people in 60 feet, or certainly a subway car, whereas an autonomous vehicle, unless we change our behavior, is going to have one person per car - even if it has one person per car - it may have zero, less than that - will be moving, at most, two or three people in that same distance. So it - the math doesn't work. GROSS: So are you, like, making an argument here that, in spite of AVs, we need good public transportation, like trains that can move a lot of people at one time with high density within each car? SCHWARTZ: Autonomous vehicles are coming. There's no doubt about it. But we should maintain good public transportation systems. We should - and I use the adjective good because there are bad public transportation systems out there. Ninety percent of the country has lousy public transportation. It's called a bus that comes around every half hour or hour. It largely serves poor people. When a system only serves poor people, it's a poor system. Often it's largely people of color. We have an opportunity to transform public transportation in those areas, not to offer a half-hour service, but we can triple the service by using micro-transit AV vehicles, small buses that are smart buses that are on-demand that know where the people are, know where they want to get off. We already have that technology. We have a company here called Via that is doing it in New York, Chicago and a few others. We have Ford Chariot that's beginning to do it in San Francisco and a few other places. The technology is here. So AVs could be terrific for lower-density public transportation. But we're going to still need, in the big cities or in places where we want to move lots of people - the Northeast Corridor - you're going to still need trains. You're still going to need subways, streetcars. We can't substitute cars for that kind of service. GROSS: So, you know, we're talking about cars changing. And we're talking about the road infrastructure. What kinds of new highways will driverless cars require? Like, how might highways change? SCHWARTZ: If we're really smart, we can have less infrastructure if autonomous vehicles really look something like cars. If they have a width of 6 feet as cars have today, if you have a three-lane highway - the average three-lane highway is 36 feet - you're probably going - three 12-foot lanes - you're only going to need, say, 21 feet. So you can either add more lanes and add more capacities to highways or do something else with all that land that will be unleashed and not have to maintain as much infrastructure. GROSS: But let me interrupt you for a second because you are saying that we're going to be able to, like, eat and sleep and have romantic evenings in our car. So that requires room. But if you're making the car smaller because there isn't going to be a driver, then there isn't going to be a - you know, space to, like, live in your car the way you described it before. SCHWARTZ: Yeah. So I go through the good, the bad, the ugly. GROSS: OK (laughter). SCHWARTZ: What I'm painting right now is the good. GROSS: OK. SCHWARTZ: And the good is they look like cars. They don't look like conference rooms. They don't look like houses. They don't look like coffee shops. They look like cars. What a great opportunity if they stay in - looking like cars because of the narrowness of cars. They're 6 feet wide, but we have 12-foot lanes because people weave back and forth. They're imprecise in their driving. They're not paying attention. An autonomous vehicle could be like a tracked vehicle - stay in lane. So for - a 6-foot vehicle could have a 7-foot lane. So in that three-lane highway that's 36 feet - you can get a three-lane highway down to 21 feet, and it'll be a more efficient highway in terms of moving vehicles 'cause the autonomous vehicles could be more closely together. GROSS: GM recently announced plans to shut down five factories in North America and cut about 14,000 jobs. Earlier this year, Ford announced it will stop making sedans. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler stopped making small and mid-sized cars. I think GM is also going to be cutting back its, you know, mid-sized cars. And the emphasis seems to be in two directions - one on AVs, autonomous vehicles, and the other on, like, trucks and SUVs. So we seem to be heading in two opposite directions at the same time in a way. Like, the most fuel-efficient and the least (laughter) fuel-efficient cars and, you know, more lightweight autonomous vehicles and incredibly, like, big and heavyweight larger vehicles. Do you see us heading in two opposite directions at the same time? SCHWARTZ: Yeah. I'm very disappointed in that the auto industry - and that, you know, they're reflecting the desires of the American people to be in bigger cars, to be in heavier vehicles and to have these front ends that are so high. That has an impact. That's why pedestrian deaths - that's one of the main reasons pedestrian deaths have soared - is that people are getting hit by SUVs, getting hit not - no longer with knee injuries - and this comes from ER doctors who've seen me, who talk to me. There's a real connection between the health industry right now and transportation. They say in the past, someone got hit by a car, it was a knee injury. It was leg injury. Now it's a chest injury, and those are more likely to be fatal. So I'm really not happy about that. But yes, it is going to be a problem - moving heavier vehicles and trying to consume less energy. GROSS: My guest is Sam Schwartz, author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's the former traffic commissioner of New York City. And after a break, we'll talk about the kinds of traffic nightmares we face today. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CHARLES MINGUS'S \"A FOGGY DAY\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Sam Schwartz, author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel\" about driverless cars and how they're likely to change the future of transportation, roads, jobs, cities and daily life. Now we're going to talk about the traffic nightmares we face today. Schwartz is an expert on that. He served as traffic commissioner of New York City and the chief engineer of the city's Department of Transportation. He now has a consulting firm which works with cities in the U. S. and other countries on transportation and traffic-related issues. There are so many changes going on right now in who drives and what they drive and what the roads are like, and I'd like to spend some time talking about that 'cause I'm as interested in what's happening right now as I am as what's going to happen in the future as more and more AVs come onto the road. And you know a lot about what's happening now because your consulting firm advises, you know, different cities around the world how to deal with current changes. So let's look at what's happening in some places in America right now. As you point out, millennials are generationally less likely to own a car or even drive a car than previous generations. So let's start with, why do you think that is? SCHWARTZ: For a variety of reasons. And I did write a previous book, \"Street Smart,\" in which I interviewed a lot of millennials. They came up with lots of reasons - you know, the cost, the - certainly the availability of other forms of transportation with the apps that you have today. The loans that they still have from college make it difficult. The - there was also an interesting thing that I learned talking to millennials - is they saw it as old-fashioned. They saw it from the back of the car. Many of them grew up in suburbs - saw very unhappy parents fighting over who's going to drive the kids to soccer practice and school and to the dentist and all of those things. And they didn't - that's not a lifestyle that they want. So there's been a big 20 percent drop in millennials. It doesn't mean the majority don't drive. The majority do drive. But it's gone from 90 percent driving to 70 percent driving. A 20 percent drop is like an earthquake in transportation. GROSS: And of course bicycles have become much more popular. But also millennials are taking advantage of app-based car services like Uber and Lyft. And I'm wondering how you think app-based car services like Uber and Lyft are affecting larger traffic patterns in urban areas. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, you know, I've been in the transportation business for a half century. I was a New York City cab driver back in 1968. And I watched transportation evolve over time. I have never seen anything as rapid as what has happened this decade. So Uber and Lyft - we were caught flatfooted, all those of us in city planning. We never saw it coming. We never thought it would be as popular as it is. But it is so popular that in five years, a brand new service eclipsed the number of people taking taxi rides in just about every city from taxi industries that have been around for a hundred years. It has rapidly increased the amount of miles driven in the densest part of cities, so it's made congestion much worse in those places. And it's not provided the kind of service improvements in transit since it's taking a lot of people out of transit. In New York City, perhaps half the people in Uber and Lyft come out of transit. In California, which is really a car capital of the world, it's 33 percent of Uber and Lyft drivers - Lyft passengers say that they came out of public transportation. In Denver, in Boston - any city, it's the same thing. So we're putting more cars on the road and we're putting them in the worst traffic spots. So it's been a shock to the system. If we can go to - when these services came in, they talked about taking people to transit. That would be the best use of these services. GROSS: Another thing that I think is really changing the roads in cities are the delivery services, like the trucks that deliver groceries to your door through various apps and the bicycles that deliver food from restaurants through various apps to your door. And the delivery trucks - you know, when they double-park, that takes up a lot of space. And I know they're only running in and out, but it still kind of backs up traffic for that amount of time. So what's your impression about how the convenience that so many of us are taking advantage of through these delivery services, including deliveries on things that - you know, on goods that you order through the Internet - how these delivery trucks are affecting traffic? SCHWARTZ: They're having a big impact, these micro-deliveries where you can have a - you know, toothpaste delivered, and that could be the only thing in the package. It adds to many more trucks. So we're seeing an increase in the number of trucks that are traveling in cities. It may work well in - again, in low-density areas, but in cities, it's been a problem. What we're seeing is some of the fulfillment centers are now using Uber and Lyft to make these micro-deliveries so, again, adding far more traffic. If we go back, you know, again, to the last century, people walked to stores. People drove to stores. People then collected and bought far more goods than they would at one time than they are now getting, every single day, a little package delivered. GROSS: I think bicycles are having a huge impact on traffic, especially millennials who don't have a car and don't always need or want to take, you know, a vehicle service like Uber or Lyft. You know, you bicycle, but many urban roads are not really designed for bicycles. Where I live, for instance, in Philadelphia, it's an old city. It's a Ben Franklin-era city in some ways. And the streets are very narrow except for a couple of the main streets in Philly. And to squeeze in parked cars and drivers and bikes, you know, on one road is often really challenging. And there's wonderful things to be said environmentally and in terms of convenience about the positive nature of bicycles, but it's also, I think, having some adverse effects for life on the roads. SCHWARTZ: Well, you know, I - again, I'd like to change the mindset a bit and remember that for hundreds of thousands of years, since the first cities started, it was the pedestrians that were walking, and the carriages had to go around them or move at the same speed. And somehow we've accepted the fact that we need lots of cars, lots of vehicles, and the intruders are the bike riders and the pedestrians, and they shouldn't be second-class citizens. What happened in cities like New York City, Seattle and others that really went - I wouldn't say all out but at least in their central business districts provide far more pedestrian zones, far more bicycle lanes, the total number of cars coming in has gone down. And so we can get by with fewer cars. If we get by with fewer cars, then suddenly maybe Chestnut and Walnut in Philadelphia could have different uses. Maybe the cars go very slowly, which they do anyhow. But if you go to many European cities, you'll see the mix of pedestrians and cars moving very slowly. We may have to use examples like that, but we have to change our mindset. GROSS: So what is your greatest frustration now as a driver when you're driving as opposed to using public transportation? SCHWARTZ: You know, having been traffic commissioner, having been in charge of traffic enforcement, my blood boils when I see violations. And when I see violations where people are illegally parked or people are turning against a red light when they're not permitted, those things really drive me crazy. In New York City, we have government workers who drive in at twice the rate of anyone else because they get placards to park their cars. That drives me nuts. If I were back as traffic commissioner, I'd be telling all of them - in fact, I did that, and I told so many diplomats that I was invited to what I am told is the best-attended session of the U. N. General Assembly. GROSS: (Laughter) They wanted you to fix their tickets (laughter). SCHWARTZ: I had the - the Israelis and Arabs were on the same side as. . . GROSS: (Laughter). SCHWARTZ: . . . Iraq and Iran in the 1980s. And it was just me being interpreted into a dozen languages. And one who would've gone by and just seen that scene not hearing what was going on would assume this lone guy at the table that the whole world was focusing on had the answer to world peace. It was all about parking. GROSS: That is really, really hilarious. Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Sam Schwartz. He's the author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's also New York City's former traffic commissioner and the former chief engineer for New York City's Department of Transportation. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JERRY GRANELLI, ROBBEN FORD, BILL FRISELL AND J. ANTHONY GRANELLI'S \"AIN'T THAT A SHAME\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Sam Schwartz, author of the new book \"No One At The Wheel: Driverless Cars And The Road Of The Future. \" He's also New York City's former traffic commissioner and former chief engineer for New York City's Department of Transportation. He now has his own consulting firm. So let's talk briefly about your time as New York City traffic commissioner and chief transportation engineer in New York. One of the things I've always wondered is, how do you get traffic lights synced up? 'Cause I could see the possibility of syncing them up, say, going north-south, but what about the intersecting streets going east-west? Like, and you were doing that before, like, personal computers. So just tell us a little bit about the difficulties of making that happen. SCHWARTZ: Actually, I learned how to do signal timing right near you at the University of Pennsylvania 50 years ago, and we did it by using graphs. And we used the speed and distance graphs to figure out - if a vehicle is moving at 30 miles an hour in six seconds, it'll be at the next street so we have to change the signal at the next street. Now, that's easy to do when you have just a linear problem. But when you have a grid problem, how do you do it crosstown? Well, we soon learned that we couldn't do it on every street, but we could do it on every fourth street. So it's a mathematical problem. But ultimately, the conclusion that I came to in the 1980s, and that's after a dozen years at - working at the traffic department, was that we're not going to solve the traffic problem by moving more cars and that the best signal program for an area like Midtown Manhattan or center city is one that recognizes when the number of vehicles in the center city or the Midtown area is getting to a critical volume. And at that point, begin to slowly entry of vehicles into it using the signal system kind of as a belt tightening the number of cars coming in. I first learned that in the city of Nottingham, England, which did that in the 1970s. I call it metering of high-density sectors, but we can't solve the problem of north, south, east, west. We really have to solve the problem as a grid problem. GROSS: Shortly after you popularized the word gridlock - and you are the guy who popularized it - I was witness to an amazing gridlock in Manhattan. And I was fortunately a pedestrian at that moment (laughter) - not in a car. But it was a symphony of horns honking. And like, all around, the intersections were just totally bumper-to-bumper with cars. There was no place for any car in the area to move. And I always wondered, like, how does a gridlock like that - when it's, like, a super gridlock, how does it end? SCHWARTZ: OK. Well, it starts because people are piggish. It starts because people block intersections which then block the perpendicular movement. And then. . . GROSS: Oh, you're trying to make it through the (laughter) - you're trying to make it through the right. SCHWARTZ: Right. GROSS: And so is the car. . . SCHWARTZ: Yes. GROSS: . . . In front of you. And yeah. And that's really a recipe for gridlock. SCHWARTZ: Right, right. So. . . GROSS: So yeah. So a gridlock's created. SCHWARTZ: Right. So a bird's-eye view would show you're blocking yourself. So the key to that - and I've witnessed many gridlocks - is you have to slow the traffic coming into the area. On April 9, 1980, there was a thunderstorm - a terrible storm during the transit strike. And gridlock was happening. I don't know if it's the day you're talking about. And what I did was I took many of the bridges and tunnels and I reversed the lanes so all lanes went outbound. Imagine Manhattan now as a bathtub. GROSS: (Laughter). SCHWARTZ: And I turned all the faucets off that were bringing traffic in. I didn't let traffic into Manhattan for over an hour, and let the traffic go out the drain. I drained the traffic from Manhattan. So you need to do that. What happens on a daily basis is literally the traffic cop manually wrestling with the traffic to get moving. And sometimes it could last for many hours. And I actually keep a record of the 10 worst gridlocks to ever hit New York City. GROSS: Was one of them around Christmas one year? SCHWARTZ: Yes, it was around Christmas one year. It was on a matinee day. And what happened was everybody came into the city for the matinee. And many of them were not regular drivers. And they ended up blocking each other, and we had so many pedestrians at the same time. Nothing moved. And ultimately, the cops had to come and wrestle the traffic. GROSS: I think that's the gridlock that I witnessed. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Do a lot - did a lot of people hate you in New York 'cause you were regulating traffic in ways that helped some people but hurt others? SCHWARTZ: Well, yeah. I mean, a lot of people have complained to me. And even today - I mean, I'm long gone. But during my tenure under my supervision, ultimately, we wrote about 50 million summonses and towed about 8 million cars. So I was not terribly popular. And also when I inherited the city's infrastructure, I closed so many bridges that were in danger of falling - and a few of them did fall - that people saw me and got scared and perhaps went the other way. Or I created bridge phobia which I think created a business for a lot of psychiatrists. GROSS: (Laughter) All right. You know, I - I'm leaving this interview so conflicted because I see all the points you're making, but I drive. I use parking ramps when I need to. I take taxis or, you know, app car services when I need to. I use all of that, and I use it at my convenience for my needs. And you're making me feel, like, a little guilty about everything that I do. But on the other hand, we all need to get to where we're going in the best way that we can. So I don't really have a question here. Maybe this is more of a confession. I don't know what it is (laughter). SCHWARTZ: Well, I end the book with a quote by John F. Kennedy when he was president - the car is not the villain. What he called for was balanced transportation, and that's what I'm calling for. There are absolute times I take an Uber. I'm multi-modal man. I take a bus. I take a subway. I drive. I do all those things. What we need is a better balance, in that the pendulum just swung in the direction of too many people driving. If the pendulum goes back, taxis will flow better. Those people that are driving will get to their destinations faster. Public transportation will have more revenue. There is a better way. GROSS: Sam Schwartz, a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much. This is really interesting. I appreciate it. SCHWARTZ: Thank you. And please don't feel guilty the - when next time you drive. GROSS: (Laughter) OK. SCHWARTZ: (Laughter).

S. -Mexico border have been controversial to say the least. But between 2007 and 2010, more than 500 miles of secure fencing were built along the southern border. Cardiff Garcia and Stacey Vanek Smith, who host the Indicator podcast from Planet Money, decided to look into what the economic impact of the existing wall has been. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Jesus Morales lives in Naco, Ariz. That's a little town of about a thousand people right on the border with Mexico. JESUS MORALES: My mom was born here. My grandma was born here. My great-grandmother on my grandpa's side, my mom's side - she was born here way before this was even a state. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Jesus has always had family on both sides of the border. But when he was young, Jesus says it didn't really even feel like a border. MORALES: We still had a chain-link fence, and they would just jump through there. They'd come to the convenience store, buy their groceries and just walk right back. VANEK SMITH: That chain-link fence was eventually replaced by a solid metal barrier and then an imposing iron fence or what often gets referred to as the border wall. GARCIA: Donald Trump has been talking about a wall along the U. S. -Mexico border ever since he was on the campaign trail. It's one of his big issues. VANEK SMITH: But this is not the first time a president has pushed for a border wall. Back in 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Secure Fence Act. And part of the logic behind building a wall is economic. It's about jobs. There's this idea that undocumented workers take jobs, and then they push down the wages for those jobs. GARCIA: Melanie Morten is an assistant professor of economics at Stanford. And she's one of the authors of a paper about the economic effect of the Secure Fence Act. VANEK SMITH: The first question Melanie and her colleagues asked - did the wall work? Did the number of undocumented workers coming from Mexico drop as a result of the wall? MELANIE MORTEN: And so we find that the wall did change migration patterns but that the total effect was small. GARCIA: Really small. The number of undocumented workers coming into the U. S. fell by . 6 percent after the wall went up. VANEK SMITH: Melanie says people seemed to have found ways around the wall. And Jesus Morales in Naco, Ariz. , says this was consistent with what he saw. MORALES: When they put that metal wall, the solid metal wall, they actually cut it. And they did a little door and put (laughter) hinges on the Mexican side. So they would open that little door. People would run in. They'd close the door. VANEK SMITH: The other thing Melanie and her team looked at was how the expansion of the wall affected wages for U. S. workers. GARCIA: Her team specifically looked at the wages of U. S. workers before the wall was built and then after. MORTEN: We estimate that the wall led to a gain of income of only 40 cents per year for low-educated U. S. workers. VANEK SMITH: Forty cents per year - that was the increase in wages that low-skilled U. S. workers saw because of the border wall. GARCIA: And Melanie's team calculated that every U. S. citizen paid the equivalent of $7 to build the wall. And so, Melanie says, even the low-skilled workers who saw a tiny uptick in wages lost money in the long run. VANEK SMITH: Jesus Morales in Naco, Ariz. , says he doesn't think Naco should go back to the days of the chain-link fence. But he says all of the border wall talk he's been hearing, pro and con, just doesn't seem to have anything to do with his experience of the actual border. MORALES: You know, a lot of these politicians kind of demonize the border. Oh, yeah - no, no, it's hell on earth. No, it's not. I'd actually invite them to come and look at the border. VANEK SMITH: He says it's a lot more nuanced and a lot more boring than everyone seems to think. Stacey Vanek Smith. GARCIA: Cardiff Garcia, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF JAM DA SILVA SONG, \"BEM TRANQUILO\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:  President Trump's calls for a wall to be built on the U. S. -Mexico border have been controversial to say the least. But between 2007 and 2010, more than 500 miles of secure fencing were built along the southern border. Cardiff Garcia and Stacey Vanek Smith, who host the Indicator podcast from Planet Money, decided to look into what the economic impact of the existing wall has been. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Jesus Morales lives in Naco, Ariz. That's a little town of about a thousand people right on the border with Mexico. JESUS MORALES: My mom was born here. My grandma was born here. My great-grandmother on my grandpa's side, my mom's side - she was born here way before this was even a state. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Jesus has always had family on both sides of the border. But when he was young, Jesus says it didn't really even feel like a border. MORALES: We still had a chain-link fence, and they would just jump through there. They'd come to the convenience store, buy their groceries and just walk right back. VANEK SMITH: That chain-link fence was eventually replaced by a solid metal barrier and then an imposing iron fence or what often gets referred to as the border wall. GARCIA: Donald Trump has been talking about a wall along the U. S. -Mexico border ever since he was on the campaign trail. It's one of his big issues. VANEK SMITH: But this is not the first time a president has pushed for a border wall. Back in 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Secure Fence Act. And part of the logic behind building a wall is economic. It's about jobs. There's this idea that undocumented workers take jobs, and then they push down the wages for those jobs. GARCIA: Melanie Morten is an assistant professor of economics at Stanford. And she's one of the authors of a paper about the economic effect of the Secure Fence Act. VANEK SMITH: The first question Melanie and her colleagues asked - did the wall work? Did the number of undocumented workers coming from Mexico drop as a result of the wall? MELANIE MORTEN: And so we find that the wall did change migration patterns but that the total effect was small. GARCIA: Really small. The number of undocumented workers coming into the U.

(LAUGHTER)KELLY: Jimmy Kimmel kicking off a segment where millennials tried and failed to open a can of tuna. But is it really true that millennials are the death of all these things, or is something else at play? Well, NPR's Alina Selyukh, herself a millennial, has been actually digging through heaps of data. There are heaps of data on all this, Alina? ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Yes. KELLY: OK. SELYUKH: Believe it or not. KELLY: All right, so we're having this conversation on Christmas Eve. SELYUKH: Yes. KELLY: And I gather among the heaps of data you have been digging through that that includes a poll, an NPR-\"PBS NewsHour\"-Marist poll. And you found some interesting holiday data. What'd you find? SELYUKH: Holiday edition of your favorite millennials-are-killing-things trope. The new data found some generational differences in how we shop and celebrate. Specifically, adults under 30 - mostly millennials - are the only age group among all holiday shoppers with a clear preference for paying with plastic (laughter). KELLY: Really, millennials are the only ones who like credit cards? SELYUKH: No, they're not the. . . KELLY: As a proud Gen Xer, I'm going to raise my eyebrows at that one. But go on. SELYUKH: They're not the only ones who are preferring plastic over cash. They're the ones who prefer it more than all the other age groups. Millennials are also the only age group to strongly prefer the greeting happy holidays to Merry Christmas. KELLY: As you were researching this, you went back and tried to find the roots of this whole millennials are killing fill in the blank. And you found it has roots in the Great Recession. SELYUKH: It started with the Great Recession when millennials came of age to a market where people had a hard time finding jobs. Throw in trillion-ish dollars of student loan debt. That really changes how you think about your finances. I spoke to a number of millennials, and one of them was Parth Shah, who is 24 and lives in New York City. PARTH SHAH: It's just not realistic anymore to expect homeownership if you basically have somewhat of a mortgage just in terms of student loans. You're already starting in the hole. SELYUKH: More importantly, millennials are a huge group. We're talking pretty much everyone born in the '80s and most of the people born in the '90s. This is a group that is about to outnumber baby boomers as the largest living generation of adults, taking huge chunk of purchasing power in the U. S. KELLY: And you've got some numbers from the Fed, actually, from a Fed study that backs up this theory. SELYUKH: Exactly. The Federal Reserve studied all the age groups and their financial preferences. And what they found is that millennials actually have the same tastes as all our generations. They're just poorer. Millennials have, quote, \"lower earnings, fewer assets and less wealth\" than previous generations at their age. KELLY: In the spirit of Christmas, Alina, and as we all seek peace on earth, is there anything you found that millennials and older generations do agree on? SELYUKH: Right. In the NPR, \"PBS NewsHour\" and Marist poll, there were a number of items where all age groups agreed. And one of them was millennials are not alone in their penchant for fake trees. Millennials were the ones who said they were most likely to put up a Christmas tree, but all generations told the survey that they planned to deck the halls with artificial cheer/trees (laughter).

Yesterday Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the heads of the six biggest U. S. banks and then said they have enough money to lend, which made experts wonder whether that's a concern. Today Mnuchin met with an advisory group known as the Plunge Protection Team, and then the Dow fell nearly 3 percent. It doesn't help that we're in the middle of a partial government shutdown and President Trump is attacking the head of the Federal Reserve. Binyamin Appelbaum is covering this for The New York Times and joins us now. Welcome. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM: Thank you. SHAPIRO: Why is the treasury secretary taking all of these unusual steps - calling the heads of the bank, convening the Working Group on Financial Markets or Plunge Protection Team? Why is he doing all of this now? APPELBAUM: President Trump really hedged his political fortunes to the rise of the stock market during the first 18 months of his term. And as the market has fallen in recent months, he has become increasingly upset and has put a huge amount of pressure on his advisers, particularly Secretary Mnuchin, to reverse the decline of the stock market. So Secretary Mnuchin over the weekend decided he had a plan for doing that. And he reached out to the banks, seeking reassurance everything was going OK, reached out to financial regulators, seeking assurance they weren't seeing anything wrong and then went out before the public and said, hey, we don't have a problem here. SHAPIRO: Which of course made the public wonder whether there was actually a problem there. APPELBAUM: That's exactly right. People didn't know they were supposed to be worried about liquidity until Secretary Mnuchin announced on Sunday that everything was fine. It's sort of the equivalent of a banker standing on the front steps of their institution, waving their arms and shouting, we have lots of money in the vaults; don't worry about anything. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) And then at the same time, President Trump is attacking the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. There have been reports that Trump has thought about firing Powell. What impact is that having? APPELBAUM: This is not helping to reassure Wall Street. Investors, even if they disagree with the Fed's recent decisions to raise interest rates, really value the idea of an independent institution. They want monetary policy to be independent of politicians. That's the reason the Fed was created. The idea of the president increasingly inserting himself or trying to insert himself into Fed decision-making is deeply unnerving to many people on Wall Street. SHAPIRO: You know, so much of what makes something economically strong is intangible like faith and confidence. Is there an actual economic problem here, or is Washington threatening to create one just by undermining faith and confidence? APPELBAUM: So all of the economic data right now looks really good actually. Unemployment is at the lowest levels in half a century. Inflation is under control. Consumers have been spending money. But as you said, we know that the economy can turn on sentiment, what John Maynard Keynes famously called animal spirits. If people get upset, worried, scared, that can in and of itself be enough to drive the economy downward, potentially into a recession. So these fears and anxieties, even if they're not about anything real, can become something real. SHAPIRO: And if they do become something real, do the titans of Wall Street, the heads of the banks and so on trust the leaders in the Trump administration to lead them through it? APPELBAUM: It's a very interesting question because we've seen much of the generation that dealt with the last financial crisis leave the government not just at the level of presidential appointments but below that. The career staffs at institutions like the Fed and the Treasury have begun to turn over pretty substantially, so a lot of the people who have any experience dealing with a financial crisis have left. And I think there is reason to wonder how well the new guard would deal with a real crisis. SHAPIRO: That's Binyamin Appelbaum, Washington correspondent for The New York Times.

S. troops overseas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hello, and merry Christmas. Very special people. Thank you very much. SHAPIRO: Before that, the president spoke to reporters about the partial government shutdown, now in its fourth day, and the economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I have great confidence in our companies. We have companies, the greatest in the world, and they're doing really well. They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy. SHAPIRO: While the president asks investors to buy, many are selling. The Dow saw its worst Christmas Eve close in history, and the S&P 500 is down 20 percent from its September peak. We're going to discuss what this all means for the economy more broadly with Catherine Rampell of The Washington Post. Hi. CATHERINE RAMPELL: Hey. Great to be here. SHAPIRO: Let's start with the latest, the Dow's worst Christmas Eve close ever. Analysts say this is now more than just a correction, possibly a bear market. At the same time, we often say the stock market does not equal the economy. So should people be worried? RAMPELL: You are absolutely right to emphasize the fact that the stock market is not the economy. Nonetheless, there are a number of unforced errors that affect both the stock market and the economy - and we're seeing that in the numbers recently - including a lot of concern over the ongoing trade war, for example. We still have tariffs, of course, steel and aluminum tariffs, on products coming in from Canada, from Mexico, from lots of other countries. So those kinds of factors filter through both to manufacturers who operate in the United States, farmers who are trying to sell their products abroad to China and other nations, as well as, of course, to the investors who hold stock in the companies that make those kinds of products. SHAPIRO: OK. So on the one hand, there are worrisome signs with stocks, with trade and manufacturing, with tariffs. On the other hand, unemployment is around a 50-year low right now. So how do you balance those two things, and what does it mean for the overall picture of the economy? RAMPELL: So right now the headline numbers for the economy - including unemployment, including GDP growth, things like consumer spending - they still look relatively strong. In some cases, historically strong, as you point out. The question is, I guess, how sustainable those numbers will be. We are in one of the longest expansions on record. So statistically speaking, you know, we are sort of overdue for a turn of some sort. SHAPIRO: One of the most significant laws that the last Congress passed was this massive tax cut. How does that factor into the economic picture when you look at it today? RAMPELL: Well, right now it looks like the tax cut gave us a nice, sort of one-time fiscal stimulus - both the tax cut and, of course, the increase in government spending that was passed earlier this year. And as a result, we've seen more money in consumers' pockets, their ability to spend more money. The question is how sustainable those consequences will be. And if you look at basically every single outside forecaster - outside of the White House, that is - they all say that the consequences of that one-time stimulus will fade. SHAPIRO: When you put this all together - tariffs, stocks, unemployment, et cetera - are experts more optimistic or pessimistic looking ahead to 2019? RAMPELL: I would say that they're worried. Most economists are not forecasting an immediate recession. And by immediate, I mean next year. If you actually look at this recent Wall Street Journal survey of Wall Street economists, more than half of them are expecting a recession by 2020. But again, we're very far into a recovery right now so maybe that's not so surprising. SHAPIRO: That seems really striking that more than half of the economists in the survey think that within a couple years the U. S. could be in a recession. RAMPELL: Yes. It is striking. In a sense, it's not all that surprising, given that we're about to break the record for longest expansion ever - ever recorded in history. So of course, at some point, the economy is going to turn. That's what business cycles do. That's why they're called cycles. The question is, you know, how worried should we be about that? What will ultimately push us into a downturn, and how equipped are we to handle that downturn when it inevitably comes? And honestly, that's what I'm much more worried about, given how much political dysfunction we've seen so far. SHAPIRO: Catherine Rampell covers the economy for The Washington Post. Thanks so much. RAMPELL: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  At the White House this Christmas morning, President Trump delivered an annual message to U. S. troops overseas.

And as a result, we've seen more money in consumers' pockets, their ability to spend more money. The question is how sustainable those consequences will be. And if you look at basically every single outside forecaster - outside of the White House, that is - they all say that the consequences of that one-time stimulus will fade. SHAPIRO: When you put this all together - tariffs, stocks, unemployment, et cetera - are experts more optimistic or pessimistic looking ahead to 2019? RAMPELL: I would say that they're worried. Most economists are not forecasting an immediate recession. And by immediate, I mean next year. If you actually look at this recent Wall Street Journal survey of Wall Street economists, more than half of them are expecting a recession by 2020. But again, we're very far into a recovery right now so maybe that's not so surprising. SHAPIRO: That seems really striking that more than half of the economists in the survey think that within a couple years the U. S. could be in a recession. RAMPELL: Yes. It is striking. In a sense, it's not all that surprising, given that we're about to break the record for longest expansion ever - ever recorded in history. So of course, at some point, the economy is going to turn. That's what business cycles do. That's why they're called cycles. The question is, you know, how worried should we be about that? What will ultimately push us into a downturn, and how equipped are we to handle that downturn when it inevitably comes? And honestly, that's what I'm much more worried about, given how much political dysfunction we've seen so far. SHAPIRO: Catherine Rampell covers the economy for The Washington Post. Thanks so much.

ROMER: Dickens' target wasn't just Thomas Malthus, either. It was all the political economists who were trying to describe human behavior as if it were governed by natural laws. Dickens biographer Michael Slater. SLATER: He just hated questions to do with humanity being dealt with in a sort of coldly scientific mathematical sort of way. He was all for the heart rather than the head as it were. ROMER: Malthus, by the way, ended up being wrong.

The city of Detroit has reached a major milestone. Five years ago, it went bankrupt - was saddled with more than $18 billion in debt. Well, now Detroit is not only out of bankruptcy but is issuing bonds backed by its own credit instead of bonds guaranteed by state government or insurers. As Quinn Klinefelter of member station WDET reports, while the city's economy is improving, some Detroiters fear it may be leaving behind those who toughed it out when the times were bad. QUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: Detroit shed $7 billion of debt by going bankrupt. It then restructured and declared itself open for investment. New development poured in led by hometown businessman Dan Gilbert who invested more than $5. 5 billion in about a hundred Detroit properties, moved his mortgage company and Bedrock real estate firm downtown and is now reportedly the city's largest private employer and taxpayer. At a recent groundbreaking for a new downtown office tower backed by Gilbert, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan marveled at just how fast the once bankrupt city is changing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE DUGGAN: Well, isn't this an amazing week in Detroit? I mean, we. . . (APPLAUSE)DUGGAN: . . . We started Monday with a historic commitment by the corporations to help transform Detroit neighborhoods. And three days later on Thursday, we're here with Dan Gilbert and Bedrock - an announcement that's going to help transform the skylight. KLINEFELTER: Moody's Investors Service analyst David Levett says the city government is balancing its budget now, saving funds to cover pension obligations Detroit will have to resume paying in 2024. And he estimates impending job cuts in Detroit's auto industry really won't hit much of the city's workforce. But Levett cautions that Detroit's public school system has no money to make badly needed repairs, and investors are not spreading their wealth across the city. DAVID LEVETT: The growth in the city has been largely concentrated in the greater downtown area. There's still declining population if you look at the city as a whole. And the income levels are still low in the city as a whole. KLINEFELTER: And some here expressed concern that investment is skewed towards bringing new upscale residents downtown, neglecting the neighborhoods where most Detroiters live. The exodus from those neighborhoods has slowed to a mere trickle of what it's been over the past few decades. And in some, people are actually moving in. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: OK. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Thank you for coming in. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: No problem. KLINEFELTER: The Art in Motion Studio and Gallery sits on what's called the Avenue of Fashion - once a prime shopping area. Owner Kay Willingham says she's stayed in this neighborhood for almost 50 years. While there are crime issues like any big city, there's also a vibrancy. KAY WILLINGHAM: Families are moving back in 'cause that's one thing that had not happened. We see a lot of families that are moving in. And I think that's a great thing because that's what this community needs. They're not afraid to get out and try something new. They're not afraid to go for a walk, take the dog out, take the kids out - where, at this neighborhood for a long time, that wasn't happening. KLINEFELTER: Detroit officials are targeting hundreds of millions of dollars to build up neighborhoods already doing well like this one. Willingham says that can be a mixed blessing. WILLINGHAM: Now we're getting ready to go into construction next year, which is a good thing. They're getting ready to take the median out. They're expanding the sidewalks, putting in bike lanes. But that's going to be a two-year process. So for a small business, that's a lot to endure to keep business going. KLINEFELTER: In other neighborhoods, stretching across Detroit's 143 square miles, residents are still waiting for a rejuvenation. (SOUNDBITE OF RAIN FALLING)KLINEFELTER: A soft rain is falling on heavy traffic along Jefferson Avenue, connecting a mostly barren edge of Detroit with the affluent Grosse Pointe suburbs. Detroit officials have plans to lure new business to the area, providing tax breaks, assembling parcels of land, even offering to match investors' money with grant funding. But community activist Luther Keith says too many stores here still sit empty. LUTHER KEITH: To bring them back requires somebody to walk down this block of closed storefronts and say, I think we can change this; I'm going to put up the store - first storefront; I'm going to open the first coffee shop. KLINEFELTER: The city recently announced it will renovate two vacant buildings in the area to create new residential units - half of them affordable housing for people with low incomes. Keith says that helps offset fears among some Detroiters that the city's tearing down of tens of thousands of blighted buildings makes way for new upscale residences while overlooking resources for those already in the neighborhoods. But he says the enduring challenges to transforming Detroit go far deeper. KEITH: The real issue in Detroit is not gentrification. It's poverty - poor people. We need jobs. We need investment so folks can take care of themselves. KLINEFELTER: Detroit's poverty rate has dropped slightly, but almost half of Detroit children live below the poverty line. City officials say there are jobs here. And they're offering training in skilled trades, everything from construction work to database administration. (SOUNDBITE OF TURN SIGNAL BLINKING)KLINEFELTER: Detroiter Thomas Sampson supports himself driving for the ride-share service Lyft. As he cruises towards downtown, he says he and others like him are making Detroit's post-bankruptcy economy work for them even if they're not the kind of new property owners the city wants to fill its tax base. THOMAS SAMPSON: But because we have the decisions that was made. . . COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Turn left. Then turn right. SAMPSON: . . . And now we've got all these folks that's coming down. It enables me to do well in the ride-share program. And that's what's the most important thing about Detroit - is, you know, we're strong. We're resilient. You know, when we fall, we get back up. KLINEFELTER: That's a mantra Detroit officials have adopted, too, touting the resurgence of the Motor City moving past bankruptcy far faster than experts anticipated but with many miles to go on the road to resurrection.

Now, this is affecting federal employees in different ways. In the agencies affected, some people are working and will likely get paid for the time later. Some are furloughed. And in the past, they have gotten backpay later on as well. But for contract workers, it is grim. Many are out of work indefinitely and might not get paychecks at all. That includes 71-year-old Lila Johnson. She does cleaning work overnight at the U. S. Department of Agriculture. LILA JOHNSON: We have floor men that are keeping the floors clean, you know, other ladies cleaning bathrooms. You got people cleaning the area, making it safe for the people to walk when they come back to workGREENE: But not right now. The Agriculture Department is partially shut down, and Lila Johnson's supervisor told her not to come in, which has been really difficult because she's the breadwinner in her family and also takes care of two great-grandchildren. JOHNSON: It's hard on me right now because I got everything, you know, hitting me. I got car notes, insurance, life insurance, rent. I have food to put on the table for the children myself. And it's just hard. I have other bills to pay. GREENE: And I want to bring in another voice now. It's Jaime Contreras. He is vice president of the SEIU 32BJ service workers union, which represents federal contract workers, including Lila Johnson. They put us in contact with her as well. He is in our studios here in Washington. Welcome. JAIME CONTRERAS: Pleasure to be here. GREENE: So how typical is Lila Johnson's situation? CONTRERAS: I mean, Lila Johnson is one story of 71 at the Department of Agriculture. You have similar stories at State Department, where people were let go. They were told not to come to work. And those people are not sure if they're going to get paid or not. GREENE: How many do you think, in total, are we talking about in all the agencies that are affected? CONTRERAS: Well, in this area, we - our union represents around 2,000 contracted out workers at federal agencies. In this particular cycle of government shutdown, it's close to 800 workers. GREENE: Eight hundred or so. CONTRERAS: You know, we have 400 security officers that keep the Smithsonian Institution safe. Their funding runs out next Tuesday. They have no idea what's going to happen after that. And that's just not - it's not fair. It's not right. It's not what we should be doing for the people who keep our buildings - our federal buildings safe and clean. GREENE: And it sounds like Lila Johnson - I mean, she really relies on these paychecks to help her great-grandchildren, to put food on the table, I mean, to pay the rent. How long can a lot of these workers go without money coming in and without the prospect of knowing when they'll get money? CONTRERAS: Well, these are workers who already work two jobs in order to be able to maintain their households. These are people who live paycheck to paycheck. They have, for the most part, no savings 'cause they spend all their money. One day that you don't get paid, it has an effect on their livelihood. Some people have to borrow money from other relatives. Some people have to call their bank and say, hey, I'm going to be late because I'm not getting paid. And some of these corporations work with you, some of them won't. And so they start accumulating late fees, and they have to deal with that mess. So it's just wrong. It's wrong to do that to people - working families. Whether you're black, brown, white, I mean, we want a government that works. We want people who are going to be able to make deals and put people and country in front of politics. And that's not what we have in this country at this moment. GREENE: Well, President Trump, as you know, has said - he's made this claim that the people who have been impacted by this understand the need for the shutdown. He says that they understand that he needs to fight for border security. What are you hearing from the workers who you represent? CONTRERAS: I absolutely disagree with that. I mean, if you talk to any of the workers, workers understand that this president, this administration is playing games with their livelihoods. And for him to continue to push an issue that he knows is not going to get support in the Senate - and even though he has his friends of the Freedom Caucus in the House, you know, why don't you sign the bipartisan compromise that was done a week or so ago and not put the country and people through this mess that we're in right now? GREENE: Some have blamed Democrats as well, I mean, saying they have really dug in on this issue and there are things that they could do to compromise - figure out some sort of barrier to give President Trump a little bit of what he wants - actually negotiate. I mean, are some of your workers actually pointing the finger at both sides and saying, come on, Washington? Like, just come up with something so we can get back to work here. CONTRERAS: There's always finger-pointing to both sides, but we know who's in charge. The fact of the matter is Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they're in charge in the White House. They don't want to compromise. I mean, the president said it on national TV - I'll be proud to shut down the government over the border wall. GREENE: Has your union been able to do anything to help some of these workers as they've been going through this? CONTRERAS: We're working with some of our, you know, allies in the community. Through the labor council here in D. C. , we had the Community Services Agency, who is taking collections for our members to try to help them cope through this mess until they, you know - our wonderful politicians figure out what to do with opening up the government, which, right now, is completely uncertain. Until we have a new Congress, these workers are living in limbo. GREENE: What kind of work did you do before taking over a leadership job at the union? CONTRERAS: Well, you know, one of the things that makes it a little more personal for me is because, you know, I'm an immigrant. I came to this country in 1988 during the civil war in El Salvador. I came here undocumented. My parents had no choice but to bring me undocumented. Since then, I became a citizen. I served in the United States Navy, and I've been working for the union for over 23 years now. But I started as a rank-and-file cleaner at 1800 M St. many, many years ago. And so. . . GREENE: That's a building in Washington, D. C. CONTRERAS: It's a building in Washington, D. C. So I was a cleaner. This, to me, is personal because it's - when I served this country in the U. S. military, as a veteran, to me, it's offensive what this president is doing, you know, vilifying immigrants, made this wall the top priority of his administration when immigrants, everybody knows, have and continue to contribute in so many ways to this economy, to this country, to the culture. It's not a reason to shut down the government. It's not a reason to put regular, working people like Lila Johnson and others at risk of losing their homes, paying their bills or feeding their families. GREENE: Jaime Contreras is the vice president of the SEIU 32BJ service workers union that represents many of the federal contract workers who are put out of work right now as part of the partial government shutdown. Thank you very much for your time. CONTRERAS: Thank you for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF TIGRAN HAMASYAN'S \"LILAC\") DAVID GREENE, HOST:  The federal government remains partially shut down this morning, and it does not look like the White House and Congress are any closer to an agreement over President Trump's demand for a border wall. Now, this is affecting federal employees in different ways. In the agencies affected, some people are working and will likely get paid for the time later. Some are furloughed. And in the past, they have gotten backpay later on as well. But for contract workers, it is grim. Many are out of work indefinitely and might not get paychecks at all. That includes 71-year-old Lila Johnson. She does cleaning work overnight at the U. S. Department of Agriculture. LILA JOHNSON: We have floor men that are keeping the floors clean, you know, other ladies cleaning bathrooms. You got people cleaning the area, making it safe for the people to walk when they come back to work GREENE: But not right now. The Agriculture Department is partially shut down, and Lila Johnson's supervisor told her not to come in, which has been really difficult because she's the breadwinner in her family and also takes care of two great-grandchildren. JOHNSON: It's hard on me right now because I got everything, you know, hitting me. I got car notes, insurance, life insurance, rent. I have food to put on the table for the children myself. And it's just hard. I have other bills to pay. GREENE: And I want to bring in another voice now. It's Jaime Contreras. He is vice president of the SEIU 32BJ service workers union, which represents federal contract workers, including Lila Johnson. They put us in contact with her as well. He is in our studios here in Washington. Welcome. JAIME CONTRERAS: Pleasure to be here. GREENE: So how typical is Lila Johnson's situation? CONTRERAS: I mean, Lila Johnson is one story of 71 at the Department of Agriculture. You have similar stories at State Department, where people were let go. They were told not to come to work. And those people are not sure if they're going to get paid or not. GREENE: How many do you think, in total, are we talking about in all the agencies that are affected? CONTRERAS: Well, in this area, we - our union represents around 2,000 contracted out workers at federal agencies. In this particular cycle of government shutdown, it's close to 800 workers. GREENE: Eight hundred or so. CONTRERAS: You know, we have 400 security officers that keep the Smithsonian Institution safe. Their funding runs out next Tuesday. They have no idea what's going to happen after that. And that's just not - it's not fair. It's not right. It's not what we should be doing for the people who keep our buildings - our federal buildings safe and clean. GREENE: And it sounds like Lila Johnson - I mean, she really relies on these paychecks to help her great-grandchildren, to put food on the table, I mean, to pay the rent. How long can a lot of these workers go without money coming in and without the prospect of knowing when they'll get money? CONTRERAS: Well, these are workers who already work two jobs in order to be able to maintain their households. These are people who live paycheck to paycheck. They have, for the most part, no savings 'cause they spend all their money. One day that you don't get paid, it has an effect on their livelihood. Some people have to borrow money from other relatives. Some people have to call their bank and say, hey, I'm going to be late because I'm not getting paid. And some of these corporations work with you, some of them won't. And so they start accumulating late fees, and they have to deal with that mess. So it's just wrong. It's wrong to do that to people - working families. Whether you're black, brown, white, I mean, we want a government that works. We want people who are going to be able to make deals and put people and country in front of politics. And that's not what we have in this country at this moment. GREENE: Well, President Trump, as you know, has said - he's made this claim that the people who have been impacted by this understand the need for the shutdown. He says that they understand that he needs to fight for border security. What are you hearing from the workers who you represent? CONTRERAS: I absolutely disagree with that. I mean, if you talk to any of the workers, workers understand that this president, this administration is playing games with their livelihoods. And for him to continue to push an issue that he knows is not going to get support in the Senate - and even though he has his friends of the Freedom Caucus in the House, you know, why don't you sign the bipartisan compromise that was done a week or so ago and not put the country and people through this mess that we're in right now? GREENE: Some have blamed Democrats as well, I mean, saying they have really dug in on this issue and there are things that they could do to compromise - figure out some sort of barrier to give President Trump a little bit of what he wants - actually negotiate. I mean, are some of your workers actually pointing the finger at both sides and saying, come on, Washington? Like, just come up with something so we can get back to work here. CONTRERAS: There's always finger-pointing to both sides, but we know who's in charge. The fact of the matter is Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they're in charge in the White House. They don't want to compromise. I mean, the president said it on national TV - I'll be proud to shut down the government over the border wall. GREENE: Has your union been able to do anything to help some of these workers as they've been going through this? CONTRERAS: We're working with some of our, you know, allies in the community. Through the labor council here in D. C. , we had the Community Services Agency, who is taking collections for our members to try to help them cope through this mess until they, you know - our wonderful politicians figure out what to do with opening up the government, which, right now, is completely uncertain. Until we have a new Congress, these workers are living in limbo. GREENE: What kind of work did you do before taking over a leadership job at the union? CONTRERAS: Well, you know, one of the things that makes it a little more personal for me is because, you know, I'm an immigrant. I came to this country in 1988 during the civil war in El Salvador. I came here undocumented. My parents had no choice but to bring me undocumented. Since then, I became a citizen. I served in the United States Navy, and I've been working for the union for over 23 years now. But I started as a rank-and-file cleaner at 1800 M St. many, many years ago. And so. . . GREENE: That's a building in Washington, D. C. CONTRERAS: It's a building in Washington, D. C. So I was a cleaner. This, to me, is personal because it's - when I served this country in the U. S. military, as a veteran, to me, it's offensive what this president is doing, you know, vilifying immigrants, made this wall the top priority of his administration when immigrants, everybody knows, have and continue to contribute in so many ways to this economy, to this country, to the culture. It's not a reason to shut down the government. It's not a reason to put regular, working people like Lila Johnson and others at risk of losing their homes, paying their bills or feeding their families.

Government employees are still getting paid for work they did before the shutdown, but the checks will soon be stopping. Among the 800,000 people to be affected nationwide are many people who struggle to make ends meet even in the best of times. Here's NPR's Tom Gjelten. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: U. S. government workers on the whole make more than private sector workers, but there are plenty on the low end. Federal employees are paid according to their position on what's called the General Schedule. GS-1 workers start out at about 19,000 a year. An employee at the other end can make as much as 136,000. About 1 out of 8 full-time government workers makes less than $40,000 a year. Paul Kiefer, who works at an IRS service center in Austin, Texas, is in that general range. PAUL KIEFER: I'm looking at everybody's returns to make sure everything is correct. And if there's an error, I may have to correct that error. GJELTEN: A lot of responsibility, not a lot of income in today's economy. And it's about to stop at least temporarily. KIEFER: Right now I'm worried about whether or not I can make a credit card payment, whether or not I can pay for the electricity, getting any food, pay for the rent, whether or not I'm going to be thrown out onto the street. GJELTEN: It's that serious? KIEFER: It's very serious. GJELTEN: Kiefer was also affected by a previous government shutdown. In that case, he eventually got back pay but only because Congress authorized it. There's no guarantee he'll get it this time. Brooke Cole, who works at a Coast Guard air station in Port Angeles, Wash. , is also caught up in the shutdown - also worried about what it'll mean. BROOKE COLE: I'm not ashamed to talk about my finances at all. I think, you know, there's a lot of Americans hurting out there. You know, just to give you some perspective, I only have about $1,000 in savings. And if this continues through mid-January, I'm not going to have enough money saved up to pay for my bills and expenses. GJELTEN: She has a long list. COLE: I have to pay my rent. I have to - you know, I have a car payment. I have child care payments. You know, I have student loan payments, utility payments - all sorts of fun stuff (laughter). GJELTEN: Cole works directly for the U. S. government. There are also many who work indirectly through contractors. A 2009 study found that 1 out of 5 government contract workers have incomes below the poverty threshold. They'll also be affected by this shutdown. Even some military members are affected. Brooke Cole's husband is on active duty in the Coast Guard stationed in Texas. And because the Coast Guard belongs to the Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department, he's likely to suffer during the shutdown. COLE: If he doesn't get paid, we're both going to be in a world of hurt, especially because we maintain two households. I have credit cards available to me. I - you know, I might have to be forced to use those. I might have to call creditors to, like, you know, see if I can extend payments. GJELTEN: Some Trump administration officials have downplayed the seriousness of this shutdown, but they don't deny it will have an impact. The government's Office of Personnel Management website has sample letters furloughed employees can send to their creditors asking for leniency. The office suggests workers conclude their appeals by saying, I appreciate your willingness to work with me and your understanding during this difficult time. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Washington.

We had one of the largest gains of the year only to have it drop again. This whiplash is leading to a lot of uncertainty. Here today to help us make sense of it all is Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar. Welcome. Thanks for joining us. RANA FOROOHAR: Thanks for having me. GONYEA: So why are we seeing this volatility right now? FOROOHAR: Well, there's a few reasons, and some of them are long-term reasons that we knew were already in the mix. And that's the fact that, look - it's been 10 years of a recovery cycle. It may not feel like that to some people, but we've actually been in an economic recovery for a long time now. So we were due for a bout of volatility and possibly even a market correction. So that's one of the factors that are in the mix right now. There are other things that are more specific to this administration and the politics of the moment. President Trump's trade war with China over the last few months has created some market jitters. And, in recent days, his questioning of Jerome Powell's authority at the Fed, and also treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin coming out and saying, well, the banks have enough money if there's a downturn - well, it makes people wonder, are we going to have a downturn? That increases jitters as well. There's also a certain amount of volatility that's natural during a holiday period when a lot of people are not trading. There's money on the sidelines. That increases volatility as well. GONYEA: Well, you mentioned the White House and some of the signals coming out of there. How much impact is this president having on the markets with his tweets? FOROOHAR: Well, quite a bit, unfortunately. As I say, we're already at a point where we were probably due for some troubles anyway. China's slowing. Europe is looking to be more volatile. So there were already trouble. But he is pouring kerosene on that fire with his tweets. This is a time when we are probably going to be slowing down economically, possibly having market volatility, possibly having a correction. What we need is a president that is reassuring, making stable policy decisions and supporting the market and supporting the people that are in charge of the market, like the Fed. And that's not happening. GONYEA: You mentioned that we're in a transition and that the financial narrative is changing. What is it. . . FOROOHAR: Yeah. GONYEA: . . . Changing to? FOROOHAR: Well, the last 10 years, even though we've been recovering from the financial crisis of 2008, there's been a single narrative. And that has been that interest rates are low. Money is pretty easy. The Fed is bolstering the markets. Well, recent data - low unemployment rates, pretty good growth over the last few quarters - has forced the Fed into a different position. There's been a rate hike. There may or may not be more rate hikes in the future, but it's clear that we're moving out of this decade of easy money, and we are moving into a period that, frankly, is more like a historic normal where you are going to have ups and downs. You are going to have turmoil in the markets. There are also industry-specific issues like the FAANGs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. All the tech stocks are under threat from regulation. And those are the stocks that have lifted the markets in recent years, and they're now leading the downturn. GONYEA: And this volatility, this changing narrative - what does that mean for the average investor? FOROOHAR: Well, it depends on what your horizon is in terms of your money. If you're saving for your retirement, and you're not going to need that money for a number of years, the key really is to sit tight. You do not want to sell or make any sudden portfolio moves in a period of volatility. Now, if you need your money, if you need cash in the short-term future in the next month and maybe the next year, then it's possible that you do want to wait for one of the up cycles, which is bound to come. We're going to see lots of ups and downs in the next few months, so you might want to move your investments into more conservative places or even to cash. GONYEA: What advice do you give people who are thinking of investing or who are just worried about their 401(k)? FOROOHAR: Well, again, I would say that if you have a medium- to long-term horizon, don't make any sudden move. U. S. stocks are still a pretty good place to be. Oftentimes, when there's a global slowdown, you start to see a lot of people going into U. S. assets because they're considered a safe haven. Now, this administration and the politics of the moment has definitely created some jitters. But the time to sell, the time to shift your retirement assets, is not in the middle of a change cycle economically like we're going through. Sit tight, don't make any sudden moves and be prepared to strap in for some more volatility. GONYEA: Rana Foroohar is with the Financial Times. Thank you. FOROOHAR: Thank you.

NPR's senior business editor Uri Berliner has been following the gyrations and joins us now. Hi, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Hey, Debbie. ELLIOTT: So the big question on everybody's mind is, why has the stock market been bouncing around so much this week? Aren't traders supposed to be on vacation, like everybody else? BERLINER: That's a question a lot of people are asking. This is normally a quiet time of year in the markets, but we've had a lot of political drama recently. We have the partial government shutdown, President Trump has been haranguing the Fed chairman Jerome Powell over raising interest rates, the resignation of the defense secretary, Jim Mattis. All of that may be a factor. And also, most of the buying and selling these days - it's not done by human traders. It's automated and relies on computer models. So the buying and selling, a lot of it gets triggered by algorithms. ELLIOTT: So all of this up and down felt a little scary at times, like there was this terrible fall for the market. Can you sort of help us put this in perspective? How bad is it? BERLINER: Yeah, I get it when people have that pit in their stomach. You know, it feels pretty rotten if you see the Dow falling, like, 600 or 700 points in a day, especially when they're these sudden plunges. And it makes a lot of people nervous, understandably. But if you step back, it's really a different story. The Dow is down about 7 percent this year. The S&P is about the same. Those aren't historically terrible numbers. And keep in mind that stocks have gone pretty much straight up since 2009. So if - say you started investing in 2009 or 2010, you're doing great. If you happened to start buying this past September, you're not doing so well. But overall, it's been a really good run in the stock market. ELLIOTT: So this recent volatility - is that having an impact on the bigger economy? BERLINER: Well, you know, overall, the economy is still doing really well. Growth is strong. Unemployment's at a nearly 50-year low. Shoppers - they spent very freely over the holidays. And so far, there's no evidence the stock market is putting the brakes on the economy. That could change, of course, if things get worse. Companies could get pessimistic. They could stop expanding so much and hiring new workers. But it's good to keep in mind the American economy is a lot more than the stock market and, for now, still looks pretty good. ELLIOTT: So as we're heading into a new year next week, should we be worried about another roller coaster week? BERLINER: You know, we've been getting used to them for a while now, so who knows? ELLIOTT: Thanks so much. That's NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner. BERLINER: Thanks.

All of that may be a factor. And also, most of the buying and selling these days - it's not done by human traders. It's automated and relies on computer models. So the buying and selling, a lot of it gets triggered by algorithms. ELLIOTT: So all of this up and down felt a little scary at times, like there was this terrible fall for the market. Can you sort of help us put this in perspective? How bad is it? BERLINER: Yeah, I get it when people have that pit in their stomach. You know, it feels pretty rotten if you see the Dow falling, like, 600 or 700 points in a day, especially when they're these sudden plunges. And it makes a lot of people nervous, understandably. But if you step back, it's really a different story. The Dow is down about 7 percent this year. The S&P is about the same. Those aren't historically terrible numbers. And keep in mind that stocks have gone pretty much straight up since 2009. So if - say you started investing in 2009 or 2010, you're doing great. If you happened to start buying this past September, you're not doing so well. But overall, it's been a really good run in the stock market. ELLIOTT: So this recent volatility - is that having an impact on the bigger economy? BERLINER: Well, you know, overall, the economy is still doing really well. Growth is strong. Unemployment's at a nearly 50-year low. Shoppers - they spent very freely over the holidays. And so far, there's no evidence the stock market is putting the brakes on the economy. That could change, of course, if things get worse. Companies could get pessimistic. They could stop expanding so much and hiring new workers. But it's good to keep in mind the American economy is a lot more than the stock market and, for now, still looks pretty good. ELLIOTT: So as we're heading into a new year next week, should we be worried about another roller coaster week? BERLINER: You know, we've been getting used to them for a while now, so who knows? ELLIOTT: Thanks so much. That's NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner. BERLINER: Thanks.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.
