The state of New York boosted its minimum yesterday. And throughout the year, three more states plus five major cities will be doing the same. As NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, a majority of states now have a minimum wage higher than the federal government's, which is currently set at $7. 25. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: About half of the states increasing their minimum wages are doing so because of ballot measures or a legislation that passed in 2014. The rest are doing so as part of automatic step increases. This comes almost exactly a year after Pres. Obama called for raising the federal minimum to $10. 10 an hour. Congress hasn't acted on that, but by executive action, the president increased the base wage to $10. 10 for federal contractors, a raise that also goes into effect today. Now the state with the highest minimum wage is Washington state, at $9. 47 an hour, which exceeds the federal rate by more than $2. Christine Owens is executive director of the National Employment Law Project. She says the states' actions could spur more national movement. CHRISTINE OWENS: For the first time, we will have 29 states plus the District of Columbia with higher minimum wage rates than the federal rate. And we think that this kind of activity at the state level will increase the pressure on Congress to act to raise the federal minimum wage. NOGUCHI: And Owens argues there is an economic advantage to raising the minimum. OWENS: Roughly 3 million low-paid workers will get a wage increase. That will pump additional resources into the economies of those states. NOGUCHI: Many employers in the affected industries disagree. Scott DeFife is executive vice president of public policy for the National Restaurant Association. He says in areas where the increases are big, it you could have a chilling impact on hiring. SCOTT DEFIFE: If there is too much pressure on wages, there may be less of those jobs per establishment. And in certain areas of the country, you could see stagnating growth in the industry. NOGUCHI: Restaurants employ more than 13 million people. But DeFife says only 5 percent of them earn the minimum wage. He argues with so many states raising their rates, it creates less momentum for a federal increase. DEFIFE: People say, oh, well, 20, 30 states have done it. And I was like, great, I think that actually lessens the pressure on Congress. NOGUCHI: The last time the federal minute wage was increased was in 2009. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

That is a penalty that hurts poor people the most and can even keep them stuck in poverty. NPR's Joseph Shapiro explains. JOSEPH SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Here are the penalties for serious driving offenses in Wisconsin - if you get caught drunk driving, it's your first offense, you lose your license for nine months. For hit-and-run driving -JOHN PAWASARAT: Well, you get one-year revocation for that. SHAPIRO: That's researcher John Pawasarat. PAWASARAT: Even though they've left an accident causing bodily harm, they get a revocation for one year. JOSEPH SHAPIRO, BYLINE: But, get this - if you don't pay the ticket for a minor driving offense, you lose your license for two years. Like, if you get stopped for driving with a broken tail light, but then you don't pay. PAWASARAT: It's well beyond any other penalty. SHAPIRO: So hit-and-run driver - 12 months, broken tail light, don't pay the ticket - 24 months. Does this make sense? PAWASARAT: It's an incredible policy, a policy of punishing people who can't pay their fines. SHAPIRO: It's a policy we found repeated in states across the country. People who don't pay their court fines, for nonviolent offenses - mostly for driving violations - get their driver's license suspended. It's a twist on an NPR investigation that we called \"Guilty And Charged. \" That showed the rise of court fines and fees and how the costs - that can reach hundreds or even thousands of dollars per person - most hurt poor people, like the people who live in this neighborhood. PAWASARAT: We're pretty much in the heart of Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods. SHAPIRO: Pawasarat runs the Employment and Training Institute at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. He studies these neighborhoods, block by block, to understand the barriers to getting a job, like having your driver's license suspended and how losing it can set off a spiral of bad consequences for the poorest people. PAWASARAT: Two out of three African-American men in this neighborhood of working age don't have a driver's license and are consequently unable to access the jobs that are beyond the bus line. MCARTHUR EDWARDS: If you have a suspended license, man, it hinders you because most jobs are not in the inner city nowadays. So the inner-city jobs that we have are not able to provide for our families. SHAPIRO: That's McArthur Edwards. He was stopped by police and ticketed for driving with a broken light over his back license plate. When he didn't pay the $64 fine, his driver's license was suspended for two years. He kept driving and got more tickets. He's 29 now. From time to time, he gets hired to work in warehouses around the city, but those are temporary jobs, often at around minimum wage. This month he doesn't have enough money to pay both the landlord and the light bill. He wants to be a good father to his four children. EDWARDS: And I want my kids to look up to me. I want my kids to be like, man, my father did that, you know, or I need these or I want these or the school said I needed this and I can't afford to buy it or I can't provide for my children, you know? I don't want that to be that way. SHAPIRO: Recently, he responded to ads for long-distance truck drivers. Two companies promised to train him, but not until he's got a valid driver's license. So he came to the Center for Driver's License Recovery and Employability, where lawyers and caseworkers helped him get his license. They arranged for him to pay off $600 on the $1,800 he owed then cleared the rest with community service at the food pantry. ANGELA CATANIA: All right, so you had your road test last week, correct? SHAPIRO: Case manager Angela Catania helps him with the last step - to set up the road test he needs to pass. CATANIA: OK, and how did that go? EDWARDS: It went fine from my point of view. CATANIA: OK. EDWARDS: But I failed it. CATANIA: Do you have another one rescheduled? EDWARDS: Yes. CATANIA: OK. SHAPIRO: Statistics from Wisconsin's Department of Transportation show that the most common reason people lose their license is because they don't pay the fine on a ticket for a non-moving traffic offense. Those make up 56 percent of all suspensions in Wisconsin. Nationwide, one study found similar numbers - about 40 percent of suspensions are for unpaid traffic tickets and for things like not paying child support or getting caught with drugs - things that have nothing to do with unsafe driving. People with money pay off their tickets and are done with the courts. When people don't pay, a minor ticket can set off a chain of problems, like for Angel Hinton, who also came to the center for help. ANGEL HINTON: I always parked in that same place for two years. They never ticketed my car. SHAPIRO: Hinton had a small janitorial business. Money was tight so she challenged the parking ticket she got outside of a suburban office building she cleaned on Sunday mornings. But the unpaid ticket meant she couldn't renew her car registration. She then got more tickets for expired tags. She missed a court date. She says she wasn't notified. That triggered an arrest warrant. And one day, she got stopped by police, pulled out of her car and handcuffed in front of her young daughter. Without a license, she could no longer drive to the places she cleaned. HINTON: This basically ruined my life. I mean, I was to the point that I'm building my business, I'm growing, and now I'm back to depending on public assistance. JIM GRAMLING: People should pay their tickets, no doubt about it. They should be held accountable for what they've done that violated the traffic laws. SHAPIRO: Jim Gramling is a former municipal court judge. He helped start the Center for Driver's License Recovery - retired on a Friday, started working as a volunteer lawyer on Monday. GRAMLING: But, at some point, a balance has to be introduced into this. And the balance is if people don't pay because they're low-income and can't budget that expense, what's an appropriate penalty? SHAPIRO: He says most judges never ask people if they have the money to pay traffic tickets. So he argues for alternate penalties, to let people pay in small monthly amounts or arrange for community service instead. And the retired judge lobbies state lawmakers to end the two-year suspension on failure to pay a ticket, a penalty longer than the suspension for drunk driving or hit-and-run driving. GRAMLING: Don't let those suspensions sit on low-income people and prevent them from getting the license they need to get to and from work, get a job or just live like everybody else. SHAPIRO: Municipal court officials declined to speak about the policy of two-year suspensions, but the threat of losing a license does push people who can pay to pay. Still, a new analysis of city records by the nonprofit Justice Initiatives Institute, says there's no evidence that the long suspensions stop people from driving and getting more tickets. Mostly, the report says, the two-year suspensions just put poor people more in debt. Joseph Shapiro, NPR News.

Maybe not the most family-oriented places, but plenty of oil field workers do come to town with their families in tow. Wyoming Public Radio's Melodie Edwards reports the challenge is finding these families adequate housing. MELODIE EDWARDS, BYLINE: For the last month, the Foshee family - mom, dad, three kids, a dog and a cat - have all been living in a 24-foot camper at the High Plains RV Park on the outskirts of Gillette in northeast Wyoming. But the family has just moved into a roomier 31-foot camper. Here's what 9-year-old Clay loves about the move. CLAY: The special features. EDWARDS: The special features? CLAY: Yeah. EDWARDS: What are the special features? CLAY: It has a radio. EDWARDS: He also likes the indoor toilet since it means he doesn't have to run to the campground bathroom in the middle of the night. His dad, Ronnie, got laid off his welding job in Texas two years ago when the oil fields went bust there. For a while, he got odd jobs and came home every few weeks. But he says he refused to do the man camp thing - bunking with a bunch of guys. RONNIE FOSHEE: It just don't seem comfortable, I guess. And to be that far away from your family, you should be comfortable. EDWARDS: So when Ronnie landed a good paying welding job in Wyoming, his wife Rachel was relieved. RACHEL FOSHEE: I had a week to pack up the house and take what we needed and left the rest behind. EDWARDS: As a trained welder, Ronnie makes good money - $25 an hour plus benefits and overtime. But even so, keeping a family together is hard and expensive. Between the camper and the lot, the Foshees are playing a thousand dollars a month. It cost that much because Gillette has very few places to rent. Chris Estes is the director of the National Housing Conference. CHRIS ESTES: There's a health impact if people aren't well-housed, the educational impact on kids when they're in unstable housing. EDWARDS: And Estes says leaving it up to private enterprise to fill the need doesn't work. ESTES: The market's usually going to respond in a pretty short-term way. And I think if you want your communities to be attractive places to live long-term, it takes some coordination and partnership. EDWARDS: For instant, partnerships with the energy companies themselves. Reliant Asset Management is one that made its name running man camps. Now they've been hired by Key Energy in Williston, North Dakota to build and manage family camps for employees. These have three-bedroom cabins, complete with school bus pickup and playgrounds. Property manager Danny Heisler says as the epicenter of the nation's energy surge, Williston has been a sort of boomtown case study. DANNY HEISLER: It was a scarier place to be. It wasn't a friendly, family environment. EDWARDS: But for people who have come back to Williston more recently, it's a happier and safer place. Key Energy pays for half the cost of these cabins. And Heisler says it's this kind of company-supported family housing that's helping to change the city's vibe. HEISLER: With the amount of money that rent costs in Williston, there's no better option. You just can't beat it when your company's paying for, if not all, half of your housing. EDWARDS: It's an option Foshee wishes she had. She takes me out to see the tiny trailer the family just moved out of. The sun is setting over the winter prairie. RACHEL FOSHEE: It's so pretty here 'cause I'm used to pine trees. And here, you can see the sky here. EDWARDS: But with the price of oil falling rapidly, it might not be long before Ronnie is looking for work again and they're making the decision one more time about how to keep the family together.

But in Europe the financial picture is not so rosy. The euro hit a nine-year low against the dollar yesterday, raising new questions about the long-term prospects for Europe's single currency. Callum Williams covers the European economy for The Economist magazine. We reached him on the line in London. CALLUM WILLIAMS: Good morning. WERTHEIMER: So why is the euro dropping? WILLIAMS: Well, there's two reasons, really. The first is that there have been signs in the last few days that the European Central Bank, the ECB, is kind of on the verge of engaging in what the Fed, and what the Bank of Japan and what the Bank of England have done, which is quantitative easing. Now what that means is buying the debt essentially of countries in the eurozone. And the reason they'll probably do that is in order to basically - to increase finance, to increase an equility (ph) to the financial system. Now the euro falls because of that because essentially there'll be more euros sort of floating around. So that's the first reason the euro's falling. And then the second reason is because there is now going to be, on January the 25, an election in Greece, which was sparked by various, complicated, political sort of processes. But there will be an election in Greece in the next few weeks. And most likely someone a - someone who used to be considered part of the radical left, but is now kind of moving slightly towards the center, but someone who sort of scares investors is probably going to become the next Greek prime minister. And that means that people who hold euros - investors who hold euros - are kind of thinking maybe this isn't, you know, maybe I don't want to have euros anymore. So they're selling them. So that's also pushing the price of the euro down. WERTHEIMER: Does it automatically mean, when the euro is weak, that European economies are weak? WILLIAMS: No. I mean, one of the things that people have been saying for a long time is that especially the weaker eurozone members - so we're looking at Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, to a lesser extent France - the way they're going to get out of the economic doldrums that they find themselves in at the moment is through exporting. And of course a weak euro makes those exports cheaper from those countries. And indeed, I mean, as the euro has fallen in value the trade position of the eurozone has improved. So, no, I mean, it's not a bad thing in itself that the euro is falling, but it is a sign that investors are getting worried about the future park of the euro as a whole. WERTHEIMER: Tomorrow the Consumer Price Index for Europe comes out. We're hearing those numbers will show Europe headed for deflation. What would that mean, and how bad would it be? WILLIAMS: So deflation is where prices on a sort of yearly basis are falling. And that has a number of bad consequences. One is that the economy tends to slow down because if you're going to buy a car, and you reckon that this time next year the car will be cheaper because prices are falling, then you tend to postpone that purchase of the car. And if everyone does that it, means that the economy sort of grinds to a halt. So deflation really worries economists. WERTHEIMER: What do you suppose all of this means for people on this side of the Atlantic, which is where we and the United States are just beginning to be confident that our economy is roaring back? WILLIAMS: Well, that's a very good question. I mean, a lot of people, say in Britain as well, are kind of looking at the eurozone and the sort of thinking thank God we didn't enter. And, you know, feeling rather smug about the whole thing. In practice though, this is actually really, you know, bad news for the rest of the world, particularly America and the U. K. America's a large trading partner with the eurozone. The eurozone is Britain's largest trading partner. And so if, you know, if those economies are weak, if people in those countries are not importing American goods, British goods, then the economic recovery could be kind of disrupted. And so even if you're not in the eurozone, this is still an important story. WERTHEIMER: Callum Williams is economics correspondent for The Economist magazine. We reached him in London. Thank you very much. WILLIAMS: Thank you. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  In in this country, unemployment is dropping, gas is cheaper than it's been in years and GDP is on the rise. But in Europe the financial picture is not so rosy. The euro hit a nine-year low against the dollar yesterday, raising new questions about the long-term prospects for Europe's single currency. Callum Williams covers the European economy for The Economist magazine. We reached him on the line in London. CALLUM WILLIAMS: Good morning. WERTHEIMER: So why is the euro dropping? WILLIAMS: Well, there's two reasons, really. The first is that there have been signs in the last few days that the European Central Bank, the ECB, is kind of on the verge of engaging in what the Fed, and what the Bank of Japan and what the Bank of England have done, which is quantitative easing. Now what that means is buying the debt essentially of countries in the eurozone. And the reason they'll probably do that is in order to basically - to increase finance, to increase an equility (ph) to the financial system. Now the euro falls because of that because essentially there'll be more euros sort of floating around. So that's the first reason the euro's falling. And then the second reason is because there is now going to be, on January the 25, an election in Greece, which was sparked by various, complicated, political sort of processes. But there will be an election in Greece in the next few weeks. And most likely someone a - someone who used to be considered part of the radical left, but is now kind of moving slightly towards the center, but someone who sort of scares investors is probably going to become the next Greek prime minister. And that means that people who hold euros - investors who hold euros - are kind of thinking maybe this isn't, you know, maybe I don't want to have euros anymore. So they're selling them. So that's also pushing the price of the euro down. WERTHEIMER: Does it automatically mean, when the euro is weak, that European economies are weak? WILLIAMS: No. I mean, one of the things that people have been saying for a long time is that especially the weaker eurozone members - so we're looking at Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, to a lesser extent France - the way they're going to get out of the economic doldrums that they find themselves in at the moment is through exporting.

The drop came after a report that consumer prices actually fell in December from the previous December. Falling energy prices were the biggest factor. But there's no question the European economy remains weak. And that is putting more pressure on the European Central Bank to do something bold to stimulate growth. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The European Central Bank said that consumer prices in the Eurozone fell two-tenths of a percentage point in December, compared to the year before. It was the first time prices had fallen since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. The report said much of the drop could be attributed to the dramatic worldwide decline in oil and gas prices. Ben May is senior Eurozone economist at Oxford Economics. BEN MAY: This is all about the fall in the oil price, really. And in that respect, I guess you could argue that this is a positive development. ZARROLI: May said lower energy prices will give European households more money to spend on other things, so it could help stimulate growth. But even when energy costs were factored out, inflation was still very low, lower than most economists think is healthy. And it once again raises the frightening process of deflation, a broad drop in wages and asset values. That hasn't happened so far, but Gregory Claeys of the research firm Bruegel says Europe is suffering from an ongoing economic stagnation, and the low inflation report is a reflection of that. GREGORY CLAEYS: I think it's not only in the countries that have been troubled, like, Greece, Spain or Portugal, but it's now a move that you observe in most of the country of the Eurozone, like France, also. ZARROLI: Claeys says even wealthy countries like Germany and the Netherlands are feeling the pain of the region's slowing economy. CLAEYS: So this also explains why fundamentally we see this falling inflation, which is now near zero percent. ZARROLI: Today's report puts new pressure on the European Central Bank to act. The ECB has been deeply concerned about inflation over the years and it's been criticized for imposing strict austerity measures on weak economies, such as Greece. In the process, it's been slow to pursue the kinds of bold measures taken by the U. S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to stimulate growth. In recent months that's begun to change, and European officials have taken some steps to encourage more bank lending, for instance. But ECB President Mario Draghi hinted last month that the ECB is ready to go further. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARIO DRAGHI: It's both time to look at what the effect these measures are having and will have, and also time to be prepared to further action if needed. ZARROLI: In fact, the ECB will meet on January 22, and there's widespread expectation that it's ready to take up the kinds of large-scale asset purchases pursued by the U. S. Federal Reserve, measures that go by the name quantitative easing. Again, Ben May. MAY: If you look at all of the comments from various ECB members over recent weeks, it pretty much guarantees that they'll do something. If they did nothing, that would be a major surprise to markets and have some quite nasty consequences. ZARROLI: If nothing else, today's report drives home the point that the threat of higher inflation is a distant one. That means European officials have more room to experiment, to look for ways to bring back the kind of growth that has eluded the region for so long. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

It's the best performance for the U. S. auto industry since 2006. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: President Obama, who famously bailed out Chrysler and General Motors, celebrated the industry's rebound today at a Ford Motor Plant in Wayne, Michigan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Plants like this one built more than just cars, they built the middle class in this country. And that was worth fighting for. (APPLAUSE)BLOCK: The administration sees the resurgent auto industry as part of a broader turnaround for U. S. manufacturing. But as NPR's Scott Horsley reports, the gains aren't necessarily being shared with America's factory workers. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama's backdrop today was a unionized assembly plant in Michigan; the traditional epicenter of the U. S. auto industry. But you might get a better feel for what's happening in that industry by traveling south to a nonunion parts plant in a place like Selma, Alabama. That's where Latasha Irby works making foam car seats for a Hyundai supplier. After nine years on the job, Irby makes $11. 33 an hour. LATASHA IRBY: You would think that if you're working for an auto manufacturer, you would get more. I mean, we're getting paid like Walmart wages. HORSLEY: Irby's story is not unusual. While the U. S. auto industry has added hundreds of thousands of jobs since bottoming out during the recession, many of those jobs are in nonunion parts plants where pay and benefits are typically lower. Auto suppliers increasingly rely on temporary firms to staff their factories. As a result, auto workers no longer command the premium pay they once did. Sarah Leberstein, who wrote about the trend for the National Employment Law Center, sees a similar decline in pay for other factory workers. SARAH LEBERSTEIN: New manufacturing jobs simply aren't as good as the ones that we've lost in recent years. HORSLEY: For most of the last decade, factory workers, on average, earned less than other private sector employees. One out of four manufacturing workers now makes less than $12 an hour. LEBERSTEIN: That's just not a living wage. Workers aren't earning enough to support their families. So this really calls into question whether manufacturing jobs are living up to their promise. States and local governments are throwing a lot of money in tax breaks and subsidies to manufacturers that are promising good jobs, but too often are not delivering. HORSLEY: The Obama administration has actively promoted manufacturing, setting up several specialized institutes for that purpose. And U. S. factories did add more than 170,000 jobs last year. White House economist Jason Furman still highlights that as though factory jobs paid what they used to. JASON FURMAN: You have seen over at least the past year, an improvement in the mix. The jobs that are being added a faster pace are in higher-wage sectors like construction and manufacturing. HORSLEY: To be sure, a strong manufacturing sector has other benefits, including above-average investment in research and development. And as the broader job market improves, wages should start climbing as well. But factory work is no longer the sure-fire gateway to the middle class it once was. That's something for political leaders to think about before donning their hard hats and safety goggles. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.

New figures show consumer prices dropping. Deflation makes it harder for people to pay their debts. Adding to this trouble is new anxiety over Greece. Greek politicians, some of them, want to renegotiate terms under which Greece accepted a bailout a few years ago. Economist Platon Tinios says Greece's economy was finally growing. PLATON TINIOS: It was not exactly a takeoff, but I mean, it was showing signs of starting to work again. In 2014, well, the last quarter actually - we actually had the first rise in GDP for seven years. Tourism helped a lot - had a very good tourist season last summer. And some of these reforms had started to pay off. INSKEEP: Sounds good, but Greeks have tired of austerity measures and opposition politicians are denouncing them as an election approaches. TINIOS: Reform was always seen as something which was imposed from outside by the creditors who have given Greece the largest loan ever given to a country. INSKEEP: Greece, of course, is preparing for an election in a few weeks, which seems to have come about for reasons not directly related to the economy, but is that intensifying the anxiety here? TINIOS: It is intensifying the anxiety because there is an insecurity about what the policy stance will be after the election. The government itself did not complete the negotiations with our creditors. And the current support program actually ends on the 28 of February. The new government will probably have two weeks' time to negotiate a new support package, which is very, very hard for - especially for the current opposition party. They're on record saying that they'll try to renegotiate everything, more or less, starting from scratch. And the loan that was given to Greece, in addition to the money, had a number conditions about structural reforms to the Greek economy. And these structural reforms have meant austerity in the public sector, changes in labor relations - for example, making things much more flexible and privatizations and so on. So what the left-wing opposition is opposing is the conditions that have - that come with the loan. INSKEEP: You mentioned that some of the reforms that were put in place a few years ago have just begun to work. What's an example of a reform that's beginning to work? TINIOS: Well, some of the reforms about competitiveness - for example, making sure that the Greek costs are lower relative to competitors in the hope that this might kick-start some exports. There's been spectacular improvement in public sector finances. The thing that actually led us into the crisis was the state was spending far more than it was taking in. Now we're actually collecting more than we were spending. But those improvements were secured at the cost of social policy, which has been severely cut back. Poverty has increased and average incomes have fallen by a quarter. So, I mean, this is the largest deterioration in any Western country since the Second World War. INSKEEP: I want to repeat that you said average incomes have fallen by a quarter - 25 percent - and that is an average that's across the country. TINIOS: That's right, and unemployment is up to 30 percent. Unemployment among young people under 25 is over 50 percent. So the opposition, they point to this and they say that this is a humanitarian disaster. INSKEEP: Is there some level on which this crisis is just going to have to resolve itself? Germany and the other European powers have the money. Greece needs the money. Greek voters can demand whatever they want, but in the end, Greece is going to have to pay the bill. TINIOS: The problem about the Greeks' crisis - and this is how it feeds into Europe - is that if we can't pay our bills, the one thing that we could possibly do is try to print money, and if we tried to print money, we would have to exit the euro. So we'll have to essentially give up our currency. This was the situation Greece found itself in 2012, and our European partners then decided that, you know, a Greek exit - what is known as a grexit - was just too painful to countenance. Now we are essentially back to where we were in 2012. Grexit is being talked about the last couple of weeks. The real danger people here are worried about is that we might sort of overplay our hands. We might bluff our way out of the eurozone. INSKEEP: Platon Tinios is an economist who teaches at the University of Piraeus in Athens. Thanks very much. TINIOS: Thank you, Steve.

That's according to a new study by a national labor union which blames that possible loss on a recent change in federal rules on aviation fuel taxes. The Federal Aviation Administration says state and local taxes on jet fuel can only be spent on airports or aviation-related purposes. NPR's David Schaper has more. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Many states charge a sales tax on the jet fuel that airlines buy at airports. And some cities and counties add on their own taxes, too, especially those that have major hub airports such as California, Illinois, Georgia and New York. Some of those cities and states then spend that revenue on the airports. But some also spread the money around to help pay for other transportation needs, to better fund education or just to augment the general budget. But the FAA recently clarified its rule governing such aviation fuel taxes, saying that the money raised can only be spent on aviation. So it can no longer go to roads and schools. ADAM YALOWITZ: It hurts local taxpayers. SCHAPER: Adam Yalowitz is a tax policy research analyst for the labor group UNITE HERE, which represents airport and airline industry employees. His recent study suggests that state and local governments will lose about $190 million a year under the FAA rule change. YALOWITZ: Either the local schools are going to take a hit and other local budgets, or taxpayers are going to foot the bill. SCHAPER: In California, for example, the 1. 75 percent sales tax on jet fuel raises $76 million a year. Illinois has a one-and-a-quarter percent sales tax, to which the city of Chicago adds another quarter percent, raising a combined $22 million. Michigan, New York, Clayton County, Georgia and other state and local governments could lose significant amounts of revenue, too. In an era of multibillion-dollar city and state budgets, Yalowitz admits it may not sound like a ton of money, but. . . YALOWITZ: This is at a time when state and local governments are still struggling to make ends meet. And the airlines are making record profits. SCHAPER: Yalowitz says this is part of the recent pattern in which the airlines have been given a billion dollars a year in state and local tax breaks. He accuses them of not paying their fair share. The airlines' response? JEAN MEDINA: Not at all. We completely disagree with that. SCHAPER: Jean Medina is a spokesperson for the industry group Airlines for America. MEDINA: Airlines and airline customers in particular pay far more than their fair share. On a federal tax rate, airline customers pay more in taxes for airfare than they do on alcohol or tobacco or firearms - products that are taxed to discourage their use. SCHAPER: Medina points to the September 11 security fee, which just went up last summer, the passenger facility charge, which some in Congress would like to raise, among other taxes. Plus, she says, the rule clarification by the FAA doesn't reduce the state and local jet fuel taxes at all. MEDINA: What this action does is it really stops revenue diversion so that taxes that are being paid can benefit the customers and the flying public and the communities by putting those monies back into the local airports as Congress intended. SCHAPER: The FAA is giving state and local governments three years to change their own laws to comply with the rule. Critics of the rule hope to use that time to convince Congress to change it. David Schaper, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  State and local governments could soon be losing tens of millions of dollars that some of them spend on roads, schools and other needs. That's according to a new study by a national labor union which blames that possible loss on a recent change in federal rules on aviation fuel taxes. The Federal Aviation Administration says state and local taxes on jet fuel can only be spent on airports or aviation-related purposes. NPR's David Schaper has more. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Many states charge a sales tax on the jet fuel that airlines buy at airports. And some cities and counties add on their own taxes, too, especially those that have major hub airports such as California, Illinois, Georgia and New York.

They plan another vote on the Affordable Care Act. Today the House will debate and likely pass a bill that would change Obamacare. It would alter the law's definition of full-time work. Right now, 30 hours per week counts as full-time. That would become 40 hours per week, and that would reduce the number of workers to whom employers must offer health insurance. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The bill before the House today was already passed there during the last Congress. Republicans touted it as a way to prevent employers from capping workers' hours. Here's Susan Brooks, an Indiana representative, arguing for the change in Obamacare last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REPRESENTATIVE SUSAN BROOKS: By redefining a full-time employee as someone who works 30 or more hours a week, the Affordable Care Act has caused workers' hours to be reduced in vital industries across the nation. YDSTIE: The argument is that by requiring companies to offer health insurance coverage to employees working 30 hours or more, Obamacare creates an incentive for managers to reduce the workers' hours below 30. That way, employers could avoid providing coverage or paying a fine. The change to 40 hours a week has been supported by businesses, most prominently in the restaurant sector, says Joe Antos, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. JOE ANTOS: Moving from to 30 hours to 40 hours is something that businesses have supported. They'd like to see less intrusion and the way they handle their workforces. YDSTIE: Antos says moving the threshold to 40 hours a week is a minor change in the ACA that will affect only a small number of people. But Sherry Glied, dean of the School of Public Policy at New York University, says the current 30-hour-a-week threshold was a good idea. SHERRY GLIED: The good thing about the 30 hour threshold is that hardly anybody works about 30 hours. Only about 2. 5 percent of all workers in large firms work schedules that are between 30 and 34 hours. YDSTIE: By contrast, Glied says, if the threshold requiring employer-sponsored coverage were raised to 40 hours a week, many more workers would be at risk of losing hours. GLIED: 40 hours a week is kind of the standard amount of hours that people work. That's where the bulk of American employees are already working. But if you stick the threshold at 40 hours, it's much easier for employers by just reducing hours by one to move a lot of people below the threshold. YDSTIE: Joe Antos counters that most 40-hour a week workers already are offered health insurance by their employers. ANTOS: And are going to continue to offer employee health benefits. In other words, the rule doesn't really affect them. YDSTIE: But Glied's research finds that even if you count only workers who don't currently get health insurance through their employers, there would still be twice as many at risk of losing hours if the threshold were moved to 40 hours a week. Glied says the facts suggest that describing this legislation as an effort to protect workers is a smokescreen. GLIED: Employers don't like the employer mandate because some of them are going to wind up spending more money. That doesn't sell very well, politically. So instead, people have latched onto this idea that it's going to cause big changes in hours. And that's probably just not going to happen. YDSTIE: Joe Antos says he agrees with many Republicans that it would be much better to do away completely with the ACA requirement that businesses provide health care coverage for their workers. But he says politics require the Republican leadership to satisfy their base quickly by pushing this change in the threshold for coverage. It is likely to pass the House and go to the Senate, but the White House said on Tuesday that if the bill reaches President Obama's desk, he will veto it. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

S. , we learned today that the economy created more than a quarter of a million new jobs in December, capping off the strongest year of job growth in 15 years. The unemployment rate also fell, but as NPR's John Ydstie reports, the data for December also included some disappointments on wages and workforce participation. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: First, the good news - according to the government's data, U. S. employers added 252,000 jobs last month. That exceeded the forecast of many economists, including Carl Tannenbaum of Northern Trust in Chicago. CARL TANNENBAUM: This morning's readings on payroll creation were undoubtedly very strong, both with the reading for December, which was very good, and the upward revisions to the prior two months. YDSTIE: The upward revisions put the average job growth in the past three months close to 300,000. The strong employment growth helped push the unemployment rate down two-tenths to 5. 6 percent. Unfortunately, the forces behind that fall weren't all positive. TANNENBAUM: Part of the reason for that, unfortunately, was a decline in labor force participation, which is a trend that we have been hoping will stabilize as those discouraged by poor labor market conditions eventually return to the labor market. YDSTIE: But instead, more workers quit looking for a job and left the labor force. Part of that is due to older baby boom workers retiring, says Tannenbaum, but it also suggests the economy isn't creating enough opportunities to draw many people back into the labor force. TANNENBAUM: And they are clearly people who are outside the labor force looking in who would like to rejoin it. YDSTIE: Another disappointment in the December data was a fall in wages. November's report showed an uptick that created some confidence that sluggish wage growth was picking up. Instead, wages fell two-tenths of a percent. Tannenbaum suggests that could ease concerns about inflation at the Federal Reserve and keep the focus on jobs. TANNENBAUM: With wages falling off a little bit, it certainly doesn't seem imminent that the Federal Reserve would be increasing interest rates. YDSTIE: Overall, says Tannenbaum, the positives jobs picture is one of several factors lifting the U. S. economy as the new year begins. TANNENBAUM: The jobs created and the incomes that come with them will be good for consumer spending. We're likely to have less of a fiscal drag from government austerity. Sectors like housing and investment, which have been a little slower than usual, should also kick in.

The country gained another 252,000 jobs in December. That sounds good news, but as NPR's Chris Arnold tells us this latest jobs report also dashed some hopes for bigger paychecks.

ARNOLD: Money is the rub with this recovery. Employers are hiring more people. That's good, but overall the real wages that they're paying remain flat, and this jobs report in particular was disappointing. A month ago it looked like wages were starting to pick up, but now those November numbers were revised lower and in December wages actually fell a bit. HARRY HOLZER: So there is this ongoing puzzle and economists are trying to figure this out. ARNOLD: Harry Holzer is a former chief economist for the Labor Department. He says the puzzle is that the official unemployment rate has now fallen to 5. 6 percent. And, historically, that's meant that there's enough demand for labor to push up wages. So. . . HOLZER: How can it be that we haven't seen any growth, adjusted for inflation, so far? Probably the real answer to that is that there's still more slack in the labor market. ARNOLD: In other words, the unemployment rate just isn't as good a yardstick this time around. Many workers have dropped out of the labor force or are working part time. That's not captured in the unemployment rate figure. Now, just about everybody agrees that if employers keep hiring more workers at some point wages will rise, but the question then is by how much? Holzer says if you look back at the 30-year period after World War II. . . HOLZER: The rising tide was lifting all the boats, so you had strong wage growth year-in, year-out, and over a 30-year period, you know, the average worker's earnings were more or less doubled. ARNOLD: Since the early 1970s, though, it's been a very different story. Holzer says overall wages, adjusted for inflation, have only risen 20 percent since 1973. And when you look at big chunks of what used to be the middle-class - take, working-age men with a high school education - their wages haven't risen at all. In fact, they've fallen. HOLZER: All less-educated men are earning less than they did 40 years ago. That's just a really new story in American history. You know, people ought to know that that's really different than anything we've experienced in the past. ARNOLD: And that's troubling to both liberal and conservative economists. Michael Strain is a labor economist with the American Enterprise Institute. MICHAEL STRAIN: I'm very concerned about it. I think that taking kind of the short-term view, there's a policy response, which is for the Fed to continue its campaign of stimulating the economy.

He says the American car companies turned to pickup trucks in part because they were really good at making them. BRAGMAN: That's really where the profit centers were. That's where their strengths were. That's where their engineering know-how was. And that's what they focused on. GLINTON: Even though cars have become more important to each of the Detroit automakers, trucks are a big deal. As central as they are to profits, they pose a problem - fuel economy. Right now, each truck company is taking a gamble so they can meet the government's strict new fuel standards. To talk about those gambles, we're going to head over to each of the Detroit Three. PETE REYES: We've been the number one selling full-size pickup for 37 years in a row. And we're not going to give that crown up to anybody. GLINTON: Pete Reyes is the Ford F-150 chief engineer. At Ford, that's a really important job. Morgan Stanley estimates the company gets 90 percent of its profits from its F-series trucks. Ford's gamble is making its truck body out of aluminum. REYES: You know, if you take weight out of the base rig, it can carry more. And it's more productive. We're thrilled that we're able to make what may appear to be a big bed, but what is, in reality, a very proven plan or a traditional move, now in a high-volume vehicle. SANDOR PISZAR: Every month is truck month. It's game on. GLINTON: Next step is GM. Depending on how you count, the company often beats Ford in a given month. Their strategy in the war, open a new front. Back when trucks were getting bigger and more butch, the Detroit car companies abandoned smaller trucks. GM's Sandor Piszar says smaller trucks will help with fuel economy targets and winning new customers. PISZAR: You know, the introduction of this truck I think shows our serious commitment to the truck space - because you're right. A lot of people have written off this segment - eh, what's the point? But if you dig deeper, the customers are there. They just don't have a product that's satisfying their needs. GLINTON: Last on the list is Ram from Fiat Chrysler. Ram's big gamble is diesel. Ram's pushing to make diesel available on a wide scale. But Ram's Bob Hegbloom had this bit of wisdom about the upcoming truck war. BOB HEGBLOOM: We all like to win. We're all very competitive. So to say that we're not all out there battling and want to be the biggest and the best out there - you know, I think anyone would be lying to you. GLINTON: What they earn and learn from this new breed of truck will go into your next sedan. Winning the truck battle isn't about smack talk. In Detroit, it's the whole Megillah. It's the future. From the Detroit Auto Show, Sonari Glinton, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:   This week, the North American International Auto Show kicks off in Detroit. It's like the auto industry's prom, Super Bowl and quinceanera rolled into one. And for Detroit automakers, there's likely no bigger prize than being the number one truck. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   That's because the car companies make most of their profits on pickup trucks. For more than three decades, Ford has been the king of trucks. But there are some new contenders for the throne, as NPR's Sonari Glinton reports from the Detroit Auto Show. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: It's the award season in Hollywood and Detroit. But picture of the year ain't got nothing on who wins at the truck stakes. And the nominees are. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Chevrolet Colorado. (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Ford F-150. (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And the Lincoln MKC. GLINTON: And the winner is. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The 2015 North American Truck of the Year is the Ford F-150. (APPLAUSE) GLINTON: Awards are nice. But that's not the real prize. You see, the Detroit car companies - General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler - they're essentially truck companies that also sell cars. That wasn't always the case. AARON BRAGMAN: You started to see that in the '80s and '90s when the big pickups started to become lifestyle vehicles, when they replaced the sports car in terms of the ultimate expression of masculinity. GLINTON: Aaron Bragman is with cars. com and more importantly for this story, pickuptrucks. com. He says the American car companies turned to pickup trucks in part because they were really good at making them. BRAGMAN: That's really where the profit centers were. That's where their strengths were. That's where their engineering know-how was. And that's what they focused on.

JOE WERTZ, BYLINE: The sign on the front door says closed, but this kitchen is open for business. Pecan Creek used to be a cafe, but owner Chad Igo closed the restaurant years ago to focus on catering exclusively to the oil industry. CHAD IGO: We do everything from steak, prime rib, catfish, all the way down to barbecue brisket. WERTZ: But Igo knows that on-site dining in the oil patch is a luxury. IGO: We're kings when it's good. They love us. But as soon as it gets tight, we're the first ones to get cut. WERTZ: Some energy companies are slashing spending and idling rigs. Igo hasn't heard of any large-scale layoffs, but the oil field is anxiously waiting. IGO: Again, we're nervous. We don't know. I mean, $40-a-barrel oil? It's going to shut everything. I mean, it's going to. They won't do it. I mean, it's going to catch up sooner or later. They will shut down. GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN: We're hoping that this will be a temporary, short-term drop in the price of a barrel of oil. But that's hard to predict, so we're being cautiously optimistic in planning that there might be a potential slump in the economy. WERTZ: Governor Mary Fallin and other lawmakers are warning state agencies that low oil prices could stall the state economy. The crash could deepen a $300 million state budget gap. MARK SNEAD: The oil and gas industry is by far the largest single source of tax revenue to the state. WERTZ: Mark Snead is an economist and the president of RegionTrack, which provides economic forecasting for state finance officials. He's telling lawmakers to build their budget with $60-a-barrel oil in mind. SNEAD: The share of earnings of workers in the state from oil and gas is actually slightly higher today than it was in 1982. WERTZ: The 1980s oil boom and the devastating bust that followed lingers in many Oklahomans' minds. The industry recovered, and $130-a-barrel oil helped insulate the state from the worst effects of the Great Recession. Those record prices plunged in 2009, but again recovered until recently. JENNIFER ETRIS: Well, I cheat. WERTZ: Back in the Pecan Creek kitchen in the Western Oklahoma oil patch, Jennifer Etris is mixing up gallons of her signature condiment. ETRIS: I use two - two of these ranch dressing mixes instead of one. It's known all over the world, my ranch dressing. WERTZ: By the end of the week it'll disappear into the stomachs of hungry roughnecks, frack crews, truck drivers and tool-pushers. The catering company grosses about a million dollars a year and employs about a dozen people. Those are big numbers for a town with less than 3,000 people. IGO: Last year we dumped $300,000 worth of payroll into Cordell, America. And that's something we're proud of. I mean, because we're - it's a small town. WERTZ: For now, Pecan Creek is holding steady. Igo is confident because he, like many Oklahomans who depend on the energy industry, survived the last crude crash. But this time around Igo has a fallback. He bought a building down the road just in case he has to stop catering to the oilfield and get back in the restaurant business.

So with all that money at stake, consider this - many Americans don't bother to shop around. They don't search for better interest rates for a mortgage. That's one take-home in a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Many Americans really love getting a good deal. We'll shop around to save 10 or 20 bucks on a pair of pants or winter coats for the kids. But with mortgages, nearly half of us don't even call around to different banks to hear what interest rates they're offering. And 75 percent of us - we only fill out an application with one lender. Richard Cordray is the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He sat down with NPR to talk about the report. RICARD CORDRAY: It is a surprising finding, and it suggests that they're still fairly intimidated by the mortgage transaction. Or they're a little distracted because at the same time, they're picking out a house. ARNOLD: But especially in these days of stagnant wages, this is serious money. Cordray says on a $200,000 loan - a loan at four percent versus four-and-a-half percent - that is a big difference. CORDRAY: The difference in even a half percent of interest racks up pretty quickly over five years to about $3,500. And over the life of a 30-year loan, obviously far more than that. ARNOLD: You also pay off more principal more quickly with a lower rate. So why don't more people shop around? Are they intimidated, confused, distracted, all of the above? We called up Brigitte Madrian. She's a behavioral economist at Harvard, and she studies how human nature gets in the way of us making better financial decisions. BRIGITTE MADRIAN: So one is that interest rates seem small. ARNOLD: A half of 1 percent difference - our brains say, well, whatever. MADRIAN: Consumers don't really understand compound interest. And it's the effect of these small interest rate differences applied to a large sum of money - which a mortgage is - and then compounded over time. ARNOLD: Another thing our brains do, Madrian says, is that we tend to look at cost savings in relative terms. MADRIAN: So if a store is offering a discount - $10 on a $30 pair of shoes - that's a 33 percent discount - people will drive 20 minutes out of their way because it's a big relative difference in price whereas they might not drive 20 minutes out of their way to save $300 on a car if that $300 is only 1 percent of the price of the car because 1 percent seems small. ARNOLD: There's actually a name for this behavior if you want to impress your friends. Madrian says it's called the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. So OK. Many of us humans could use some help with our financial decisions. That's why in addition to coming out with the report, Richard Cordray says the CFPB is also today launching a toolkit on its website. CORDRAY: A set of tools which will help empower consumers to shop more effectively and make the best deals they can for themselves and their families. ARNOLD: There's a rate tracker tool. Cordray says you can plug in your credit score and ZIP code and other info, and it'll tell you the range of interest rates that lenders are offering that day. Of course, there's a lot of financial information out there on the Internet - some good, some bad, some ugly. Cordray says one goal here is to give people some tools that they can trust since his agency is not trying to sell you anything. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

S. recently or sent your American-made products abroad, you've probably noticed the dollar is getting stronger. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, the stronger dollar is the sign of a healthier U. S. economy. But it also has the potential to erode growth. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There are a number of factors behind the dollar's rise, says economist Jens Nordvig, a currency expert at Nomura Securities. The main one is the health of the U. S. economy. JENS NORDVIG: When you compare the U. S. economy to the rest of the world, you really have a situation where there's a pretty dramatic outperformance of U. S. growth relative European growth, Japanese growth or global growth in general. YDSTIE: But former IMF Chief Economist Simon Johnson emphasizes it is relative. The dollar is being measured against the currencies of other countries. SIMON JOHNSON: It's a lot, also, about problems elsewhere in the world, including in the euro area and including in Japan, but also in emerging markets. YDSTIE: Europe and Japan are both struggling to grow at all. The dollar's value has risen about 15 percent relative to their currencies, the euro and the yen, just since the summer. Nordvig says there are a number of channels through which the dollar is pushed up. One is driven by global investors who want to share in the gains the U. S. economy is making. NORDVIG: That can be foreign companies buying U. S. companies. We call it foreign direct investment. That flow has picked up over the last 12 months. YDSTIE: Global investors can also decide to buy individual U. S. stocks. But to do both of those things requires them to buy dollars to make those purchases. The greater demand drives up the dollar's value. The dollar's value is also pushed up by the prospect of higher interest rates on U. S. government bonds. Of course, the Federal Reserve has signaled it will begin pushing up rates around the middle of this year. But even now, Nordvig says, the returns on U. S. 10-year bonds are four times that of comparable German bonds. NORDVIG: And that's obviously something that European investors are looking at and global investors are looking at. And they are making transfers out European investments and into U. S. investments. YDSTIE: The stronger dollar is good news for U. S. travelers, whose dollars buy more in foreign countries, and it means U. S. consumers can purchase imported products more cheaply, from French wine to South Korean TVs to foreign oil. The stronger dollar puts downward pressure on global oil prices, though it's a minor factor in oil's current fall. But Simon Johnson, who's now a professor at MIT, says the stronger dollar can hurt some Americans. JOHNSON: If you're exporting from the U. S. manufacturing, for example, and your costs are in dollars, then it's become harder to export - all your products are more expensive in foreign currencies. DYKE MESSINGER: We're just beginning to see our customers mention it. YDSTIE: That's Dyke Messinger, whose company manufactures machines that make curbs and gutters. The company, called Power Curbers, is based in Salisbury, North Carolina. MESSINGER: Our German, European competitors, their prices may be slightly more favorable than it was. It really hadn't been a factor, but now people are going to notice. And so we're having to adjust a little bit. YDSTIE: For now, Messinger says, the strengthening U. S. market for his product is offsetting any difficulty the stronger dollar is causing in the export market, so the trade-off is worth it. But if the dollar strengthened another 15 percent, Messinger says it could start to bite. Jens Nordvig does not expect that to happen this year, but he does expect the strong growth trend in the U. S. to continue. NORDVIG: We have some headwinds that the dollar being stronger is going to be negative for some specific companies that export a lot. But I think the positives outweigh the negatives. YDSTIE: Those positives include an improving jobs market, falling energy prices and more optimistic consumers. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Of course, not everyone who turns 62 or 65 retires right away, but enough do that some companies worry about not having enough experienced workers. NPR's Yuki Noguchi has this report on companies taking action. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: For 33 years, Dave Tobelmann developed new products for General Mills - things like battered fish sticks and fruit snacks. DAVE TOBELMANN: Make it look good. Make it taste good. Make sure the costs are right. Make sure we can manufacture it consistently. NOGUCHI: Five years ago at age 57, Tobelmann decided to hang up the lab coat around the same time as a number of other colleagues. TOBELMANN: Yeah, I went to a lot of retirement parties. NOGUCHI: Losing veteran workers is a challenge, even for big companies like General Mills. TOBELMANN: Let's say you have 30 people retire in a year. And the average years of experience of 30 years. So you just had a thousand years walk away. That's hard to lose. NOGUCHI: The need is not across-the-board. Not all retirees are in demand. But the older worker brain-drain is a big concern for industries like mining and health care, which are trying to retain older employees because demand is increasing, and fewer younger workers are rising through the ranks. In a survey out this week, the Society for Human Resource Management reports a third of employers expect staffing problems in coming years. Mark Schmit is executive director of the association's research arm. MARK SCHMIT: When you have large numbers that are leaving and a pipeline that is not entirely as wide as the exit pipeline, you'll have temporary gaps. NOGUCHI: Take, for example, the insurance business. SHARON EMEK: The average age is in the late-50s in this industry. NOGUCHI: That's Sharon Emek, who sold an insurance business five years ago after three of the four partners reached retirement age. She then started Work at Home Vintage Employees, a company that contracts insurance industry retirees. EMEK: It's a big crisis within the industry, where they're trying to recruit young talent and keep young talent. And the industry's constantly writing about the problem. NOGUCHI: Employers are trying to hang on to older talent by offering flexible work hours, more attractive health care benefits or having retirees return to mentor younger workers. And more people are, in fact, working later either because they want to or have to. According to AARP, about 1 in 5 workers over the age of 65 works, compared to 1 in 10 three decades ago. Soon after retiring, Tobelmann, the food product developer, returned to General Mills. He worked through Your Encore, a staffing firm specializing in retiree placement. Proctor and Gamble, Boeing and other companies started Your Encore to prepare for baby boomers retiring. Tobelmann says the benefits for the company are obvious. TOBELMANN: I already know how to speak the language. I know how the company operates. I know how the businesses operate. I know how they make money. I know how projects proceed. I know all the processes. NOGUCHI: At Michelin North America, more than 40 percent of the workforce is approaching retirement age. Retirees have, on average, two-and-half decades of experience. Dave Stafford, who heads human resources, says last year, the company had to plan around losing most of a lab team made up entirely of older workers. DAVE STAFFORD: If we're doing our job well, we'll know that there's a risk. We'll start to staff to compensate for the fact that that risk may come to fruition. NOGUCHI: Michelin encourages retirees to stick around part-time, especially those in technical maintenance, where talent is chronically scarce. But it's not always easy to accommodate. Dale Sweere is HR director for Stanley Consultants, an engineering consulting firm based in Muscatine, Iowa. DALE SWEERE: Sometimes they have a very limited number of hours that they want to work. And to try to work around their schedule sometimes can be a bit of a challenge. NOGUCHI: But, Sweere says, the company has always offered phased retirement because experienced workers have relationships with clients that are valuable to hang on to. SWEERE: It's kind of a running joke around here that we have their retirement party on a Friday, and they show up for work again on Monday. NOGUCHI: Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Scott Simon. JOSEPH JEAN-BAPTISTE: I'm Joseph Jean-Baptiste from Miami, Florida. Gas prices have been beautiful. I've been putting Supreme - 93 - because prices are so low. ANGIE CHISLEY: Angie Chisley, Waldorf, Maryland. I have three kids, so cheaper gas is better because it pays for the bills and gets more stuff for my children. And yeah, I save a lot of money in gas, a lot. SIMON: Falling oil prices are great for a family budget, but they are not so great for other segments of the economy, especially banks. Lending money to energy companies is usually a pretty profitable business. But if the price of oil drops low enough, the threat of default becomes real. Indeed, it's happened before, in the 1980s. And bank defaults are not good for anyone. Charles Peabody, a banking analyst at Portales Partners, joins us from our studios in New York. Thanks very for much for being with us. CHARLES PEABODY: My pleasure. SIMON: Explain to us how this relationship works out, that ties the banks to energy companies. PEABODY: Well, there are several exposures and potential ripple effects. The first is, as energy companies cut their capital expenditure budgets, you're going to see less demands for loans. And so we expect a significant slow-down in corporate loans in the first half of 2015. Beyond that, if energy prices remain depressed, there will be problems created in the credits and potential write-offs in 2016 and beyond. SIMON: And this creates a ripple effect in the economy? PEABODY: It does. You know, what we saw in the '80s and what the banks underestimated was that ripple effect to Main Street. So your local Caterpillar or Deere dealer may suffer. Your local shopping mall may be hurt. Your local Main Street mom-and-pop shops may be hurt. SIMON: What do you think bankers learned during the 1980s slow-down that might change the kind of evaluations they make today? PEABODY: Very little. I think, you know, bankers continue to make the same mistakes decade after decade and cycle after cycle. SIMON: Well, like what? PEABODY: Underestimating the risk and, you know, their exposure to certain sectors. I think, in terms of the exposure to the energy industry, the banking industry has done a better job of confining that exposure. Most banks have low to mid-single-digit exposure as a percentage of their long portfolio to energy. But I think they'll underestimate the ripple effect and the volatility that we see in price corrections in various asset classes, and energy's just a symptom of that process. SIMON: I think a lot of people remember what happened in the 1980s with falling oil prices. They saw businesses go under in unemployment. What would you project might be on the horizon this time? PEABODY: It's going to start with a slow-down in growth, in particularly, areas like Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota et cetera, the energy producing states. It's going to spill over into Main Street and you're going to see an increase in non-performing assets in the banking system. And most of that will start the second half of this year. And then you'll start to see significant write-offs and loan losses recording in 2016. SIMON: There's been no secret that over the past generation, or more at this point, a lot of people in the United States are interested in making the United States, you know the phrase - energy independent. PEABODY: Correct, and as a part of that, there's the assumption that asset prices will always rise. And the assumption is you continue to drill more, you know, holes. So what caught the bankers this time and every time is, when you get very violent corrections and asset prices, which will change collateral values, and you get very significant changes in the assumption of growth. SIMON: And a lot of that hasn't registered yet? PEABODY: No, there are long lead and lag times between the event and the fallout of that event. SIMON: Charles Peabody.

CASTELE: Thom Dammrich is the president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association. He says any extra money in the pockets of boaters is good for business.

And many people here are already boat owners. Bob and Nancy Chizmar have been boating up and down the Great Lakes for 38 years. Bob says they have changed their habits over time. BOB CHIZMAR: We don't go out and just ride around like we used to. You know, our boat burns maybe 25 gallons an hour. CASTELE: Gas in the Cleveland area is going for around $2 a gallon, down 40 percent from a year ago. And if those prices don't take off again, Nancy Chizmar says she might consider another adventure. NANCY CHIZMAR: If it stayed this low, we'd probably do a last hurrah and take a nice, long trip. We've been to Niagara Falls by boat.

If they can make five trips on that budget, maybe this year they can make seven trips on that same budget. CASTELE: And salespeople in other parts of the industry are gearing up to ride that wave, too. Jeff Klein sells boat lifts. He says sales have recovered in the past few years and he sees low gas prices opening up a chance for even more business. JEFF KLEIN: Boaters, they'll go out more and be out on the water a lot more, and consequently they'll be using their boat lifts more and they'll be breaking or replacing them with new ones. So we look forward to it. CASTELE: But it typically costs more to fill up at a marina than at a gas station. And boaters say they're waiting to see how much they'll have to pay for that marina fuel this season. Boater Jerrold Saxton says he's not convinced prices will stay low, but he accepts boating is an expensive hobby. JERROLD SAXTON: Someone told me the definition of a boat is a hole in the water that you pour money into. And it's true it's going to be expensive, if you're a power boater.

CASTELE: But if low fuel prices hold out, boaters here are hoping that hole of money will be shallower by the time the Lake Erie ice melts.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When you're president of the United States, what you say about the economy matters a lot, because the economy isn't just about numbers and widgets. It's about people's lives and hopes. The health of the economy is intertwined with the national psyche. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others. KEITH: In February 2009, President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress and a nation in the throes of the worst recession in generations. Obama used the word crisis 11 times. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: You don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis because you live it every day. It's the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. KEITH: The month before, the economy shed nearly 800,000 jobs. And the situation would get worse before it got better. But in that first address, President Obama and his speechwriters figured the American people weren't simply looking to him for sympathy and an accounting of economic doom. Obama ran on a message of hope. And he needed to offer some. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: Tonight, I want every American to know this - we will rebuild. We will recover. And the United States of America will emerge stronger than before. (APPLAUSE)KEITH: But since then, Obama has had a hard time hitting the right note when talking about the economy. In that first speech, he was an outsider. But in the years that followed, it was his economy. In 2010, he reframed, saying the worst of the storm had passed. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again. KEITH: But just barely. The recession was technically over, but there was a huge disconnect between Obama's words and what Americans were experiencing. One in ten people still couldn't find work. In 2011, it was the same story - an optimistic Obama talking to an unconvinced American public. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: The stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again. KEITH: And so it went, year after year. Obama described green shoots and good news that economists say were real. But many people watching at home simply didn't feel. And each year, Republicans in their official response had no problem finding very real pain to highlight. The contrast between Obama's assessment and the GOP response was never starker than in 2012. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: The state of our union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to turn back now. KEITH: And here's then-Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels with the GOP response. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)MITCH DANIELS: The president did not cause the economic and fiscal crises that continue in America tonight. But he was elected on a promise to fix them, and he cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse. KEITH: The economy wasn't actually worse. The unemployment rate was no longer rising. It was coming down. And that trend has continued. In 2014, U. S. businesses added more jobs than in any year since the go-go 90s. This time, when President Obama stands at the front of the House chamber and talks up the economy, polls, consumer confidence surveys and $2-a-gallon gas all indicate the American public is more likely to agree with his assessment.

He'll explain that in a moment. Over the past 42 years, as we have lived through bubbles and crashes, novel investment instruments, scandals and fads, Burton Malkiel has been updating \"A Random Walk\" and standing by its central message. The investor, who buys and holds a broadly based index fund, who effectively invests in the market as a whole, does better in the long run than all the stock pickers and Wall Street pundits. Well, this year, he's up to the 11th edition of \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street,\" and Burton Malkiel joins us from Princeton, New Jersey, where he is a professor of economics. Welcome to the program. BURTON MALKIEL: Thank you. SIEGEL: And first, a brief definition of the efficient market theory. MALKIEL: Basically, the efficient market theory says that there are a lot of smart people around the world and that if information arises about a particular company or about an economy, that information gets reflected in market prices without delay. So that if, let's say, a drug company has developed a drug that will give that company double the value that it had before the announcement, the price will double right away. It won't double slowly over time. You won't have time to read the news and get in. The market is very efficient at digesting news. Now, that doesn't mean that market prices are always correct. In fact, they're far from perfect. But the point is it's very efficient at reflecting news, and if they're incorrect no one knows for sure whether they're too high or too low. And therefore, simply buying a portfolio of stocks, given the tableau of market prices that you have at any point in time, is likely to give you a better performance than trying to go and picks stocks and buying one stock and selling another. SIEGEL: Now, you do acknowledge in the book that George Soros and others looked at the crash of 2008 - the near collapse of the international financial system - and said, so much for efficient markets. Academic models of the economy didn't see disaster coming. This thinking - efficient markets -stands accused of contributing to, if not causing, the financial crisis - to which you say? MALKIEL: To which I say markets are not always correct. Markets are often wrong. Markets don't anticipate the things that happen. If you look at the whole of active managers, including these very highly paid hedge fund managers, you don't see that they, over the long pull, have outperformed a simple strategy of buying and holding all the stocks in the market. SIEGEL: One school of thought that has grown up in the years since you first wrote \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" is behavioral economics and behavioral finance. You devote a chapter to it in the book. Should our confidence in the efficiency of the market be tempered by the idea, backed by lots of research and granted a Nobel Prize, that we typically are very irrational in economic behavior? MALKIEL: We are indeed irrational in many things. And in fact, part of the reason for putting a chapter on behavioral finance in is to protect us from what we have learned about our irrationality. And one of the parts of irrationality that is very clear - the evidence is crystal clear that when we are optimistic, we tend to buy stocks. When we are pessimistic, we tend to sell them. More money went into the stock market at the height of the Internet bubble in early 2000 than ever before, and more money came out of the stock market in the third quarter of 2008, at the height of the crisis, than ever before. So what we learn that we've done is we put the money in at the top. We tend to take it out at the bottom. And what I've always recommended is you just buy that portfolio and you hold it through thick and thin, and that gives you a superior performance to anyone who tries to pick individual stocks and tries to get in and out of the market based on their view whether the market is too high or too low. SIEGEL: At one point you quote Warren Buffett, the investor, with a wonderful analogy that - he says, if you know that you're going to eat a lot of hamburgers, and you are not a cattleman yourself or in the beef business, you'd like to see the price of beef be low rather than high. So if you're going to buy a lot of stocks, you want to buy when the price is very low rather than when it's very high, but that's exactly the opposite of what people do. MALKIEL: Exactly. And I think for most people who are saving for retirement, they're going to be investing year after year after year. And so for those people, while everyone prays for higher stock prices, you actually ought to pray for lower stock prices because it's as if the hamburgers you're going to buy next year - do you want them to be more expensive or less expensive? So for people who are accumulating a retirement fund, it's just fine if the market goes up and down. Yes, you'll buy some things at the top, but you'll also then buy stuff at the bottom. The only people who should pray for higher stock prices are people who are in retirement who are liquidating their portfolios. Everybody else should actually be very happy when stock prices go down.

Solar panel prices dropped more than half in the last four years. But government subsidies expire soon, and natural gas prices also keep dropping.

Calls to the agency may involve extra time on hold. NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Taxpayer service is poor and getting worse. That's the blunt headline of a report written by the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the IRS. It calls the declining quality of service the top problem for taxpayers. How bad? The IRS is predicting it will only be able to answer half of the 100 million calls it expects from taxpayers this year. And those who do get through can expect to wait a half-hour to hear a live voice.

Have some projects that you could do while you're waiting on the phone. And you may have to call a number of times if you need to get through to the IRS. NAYLOR: Olson says it's worse than she's ever seen it. More individuals and businesses are filing tax returns than ever before. Over 150 million individual returns came into the IRS last year. This year, things will be more complicated for many taxpayers because of the Affordable Care Act, meaning more taxpayers are likely to seek assistance. In the meantime, the IRS' budget has been reduced. OLSON: If you look at it in terms of inflation, we have estimated it's about a 17-and-a-half percent decrease from 2010 levels. NAYLOR: The reduced budgets and increased responsibilities mean the IRS is supposed to do way more with a lot less. Olson says it's taxpayers who are losing out. OLSON: We can't get through to the IRS to get answers to our tax law questions. It increases our burden because we have to pay tax professionals to get answers to our questions. And this is all for the privilege of paying taxes, which is not a painless thing for people. So why are we putting more pain on taxpayers? NAYLOR: Republicans, who now control Congress and who led the effort to reduce the IRS budget, don't seem too concerned about the agency's woes. It goes back to GOP charges that the agency targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota. SENATOR JOHN THUNE: I don't think that, based on the IRS' record over the last couple years, there's a whole lot of sympathy for the complaints that they're now making about not having enough funding. Obviously, they have a job to do. It's an important job. We want to make sure that they have the resources to do that job, to collect the taxes. But wasting resources targeting conservative groups and other things like that obviously is something that we take great issue with. NAYLOR: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen says the agency's budget is so lean, it may have to close down for two days and furlough employees. Colleen Kelly, president of the NTEU, the union which represents IRS employees, says lawmakers are doing harm and not just to IRS workers. COLLEEN KELLY: You don't starve them to try to set them up to fail. You especially don't do that to an agency that impacts the entire country, the entire U. S. economy. And it also opens it wide open for tax cheats. NAYLOR: The IRS says the budget cuts will also mean fewer audits.

OLSON: We can't get through to the IRS to get answers to our tax law questions. It increases our burden because we have to pay tax professionals to get answers to our questions. And this is all for the privilege of paying taxes, which is not a painless thing for people. So why are we putting more pain on taxpayers? NAYLOR: Republicans, who now control Congress and who led the effort to reduce the IRS budget, don't seem too concerned about the agency's woes. It goes back to GOP charges that the agency targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota. SENATOR JOHN THUNE: I don't think that, based on the IRS' record over the last couple years, there's a whole lot of sympathy for the complaints that they're now making about not having enough funding. Obviously, they have a job to do. It's an important job. We want to make sure that they have the resources to do that job, to collect the taxes. But wasting resources targeting conservative groups and other things like that obviously is something that we take great issue with. NAYLOR: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen says the agency's budget is so lean, it may have to close down for two days and furlough employees. Colleen Kelly, president of the NTEU, the union which represents IRS employees, says lawmakers are doing harm and not just to IRS workers. COLLEEN KELLY: You don't starve them to try to set them up to fail. You especially don't do that to an agency that impacts the entire country, the entire U. S. economy. And it also opens it wide open for tax cheats. NAYLOR: The IRS says the budget cuts will also mean fewer audits. And while that may sound like good news, it also means about $2 billion less for the treasury than would've been collected.

We're going to hear a voice from the beginning. He's a man who lives in a place the president visited early in his first term. By returning to that place, we can see what's changed in the economy in six years for better and for worse. Elkhart County, Indiana, suggests why the economic recovery doesn't always feel as good as the numbers indicate. On the morning of the State of the Union speech, here's NPR's Tamara Keith. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Elkhart County, Indiana - recreational vehicle capital of the world, except when no one was buying RVs. In February, 2009, the unemployment rate in Elkhart bumped up against 20 percent. President Obama picked it for his first big trip in office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUDIENCE: (Chanting) Obama. Obama. Obama. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you. KEITH: Obama took the stage at Concord High School and turned to a very nervous man in a borrowed suit and said, go ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ED NEUFELDT: Good afternoon, everyone. OBAMA: Good afternoon. NEUFELDT: My name is Ed Neufeldt. KEITH: If Elkhart was the symbol of the recession, then Ed Neufeldt became the face of the unemployed worker. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NEUFELDT: On September the 17, 2008, all of the employees of Monaco Coach were informed that, due to the economy, they would be closing their doors. KEITH: Neufeldt was suddenly unemployed after 32 years working in the RV industry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NEUFELDT: I am hoping and praying and believing that President Obama will put the people in Elkhart County and the country back to work. (APPLAUSE)KEITH: Obama was there to promote the $800 billion Recovery Act. $170 million in stimulus money would go to Elkhart County, according to ProPublica. Six years later, Neufeldt is behind the wheel of a Kia, showing me around Elkhart County. NEUFELDT: Now, I'm going to turn right here and show you some of the plants that were closed down. The one over there - in 2009, there was nobody in that building. KEITH: Before the crash, Neufeldt and thousands of others reported for work before dawn in these big warehouses, building RVs. As the recession hit, a number of major employers went bankrupt. GUS FEILER: We lost 75 percent of our volume overnight. It was not a recession. It was a damn depression. KEITH: Gus Feiler's company, Williamsburg Furniture, makes couches and sleeper sofas and captain's chairs for RVs. He went from 140 employees to 40. And the ones that were left took huge pay cuts. Feiler says he refinanced everything he could just to keep the doors open. And now? FEILER: Those of us that were lucky enough to survive - we're back. (SOUNDBITE OF SEWING MACHINE)KEITH: Filer shows me around his three massive, interconnected buildings. More than a dozen women rapidly sew upholstery. There are saws buzzing and nail guns firing. Captain's chairs for high-end motor coaches are flying out the door again. FEILER: It is good to hear that noise again. 2009, 2010 were very silent - turn your stomach. KEITH: Feiler says his big problem now is finding employees. He'd hire 30 more today if he could. As Neufeldt draws me by those once-abandoned warehouses, it's clear from the smokestacks and the parking lots full of pickup trucks, they're humming again, too. NEUFELDT: Evidently, by the looks of the cars there, they've got people working at all these buildings. KEITH: Today, the unemployment rate in Elkhart County, Indiana is right around 5 percent. That's a bit better than the national average and almost back to what it was before the recession. The saying is if you can pass a drug test, you can get a job in Elkhart. Ed Neufeldt - he has three jobs - all part-time. NEUFELDT: Yeah, everybody's working that wants to work. But you could probably - really, I drew more on unemployment than I'm making working these three jobs now. KEITH: His main job - stocking shelves for a local bread company, going store to store, moving the older loaves to the front. NEUFELDT: Got to make everything look pretty. KEITH: He also works at a grocery store. And in the evenings, he cleans a doctor's office. Neufeldt remembers before the recession hit his wife telling him he had it made. NEUFELDT: I was 62 at the time. She said, just work about three more years. We've got a great 401k going. And I think I lost maybe $50,000 when we had that crash. KEITH: If Neufeldt was the face of the unemployed worker six years ago, today he's the face of a recovery that left some people behind. MAYOR LARRY THOMPSON: Ed is a survivor. You know, he was going to do whatever it took. KEITH: Larry Thompson is the longtime mayor of Nappanee, Indiana, at the southern end of Elkhart County. THOMPSON: I'm a small-town Republican mayor. KEITH: Thompson stood in abandoned RV factories and wondered if his community would ever come back. And now it is. THOMPSON: Whatever full employment is, we're close. KEITH: Mayor Thompson gladly competed to bring stimulus money to his county. The so-called green jobs didn't last. But the upgrades to the sewer plant made a lasting difference. Ultimately, he has mixed feelings about the Recovery Act. THOMPSON: But it gave us hope that if we just hang in there and work hard and all work together, this thing will come back. KEITH: It gave Ed Neufeldt hope, too. He believed in that guy he introduced in the high school gym, even though he never voted for him. But now Neufeldt gets upset when he thinks about how divided the country is. NEUFELDT: If we go out somewhere, which is not very often, they'll say, oh, did you know Ed introduced President Obama? And I used to - years ago, I was kind of proud. Now I say, shh, don't tell anybody. KEITH: And this is the President's challenge. The economy is back though it is far from perfect. And when you ask people in Elkhart County where the credit goes, they don't talk about President Obama or his policies. They talk about the free-enterprise system and a community that stuck together.

Deflation and the falling euro mean visitors to Berlin pay less for currywurst. It also affects Americans at home, as is apparent to anyone who takes a drive through the Southeast. From WABE in Atlanta, Susanna Capelouto reports. SUSANNA CAPELOUTO, BYLINE: Interstate 85, from Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Atlanta, has a German nickname. CHRISTOPH SANDER: We have come to call this the Autobahn because that's the focus of German investment to the region. CAPELOUTO: Christoph Sander represents Germany as a consul in six Southern states. I-85 is a road he travels a lot to visit German businesses. SANDER: Two-hundred fifty companies around the Atlanta metro region, about 200 companies in the Charlotte region - and then we have 130 or so between Spartanburg and Greenville. CAPELOUTO: German car brands like BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche have brought thousands of jobs to the region. And last week, Governor Nathan Deal used his State of the State address to thank Mercedes for moving its U. S. headquarters from New Jersey to Atlanta. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL: The Mercedes-Benz slogan is the best or nothing. The company that accepts nothing but the best chose Georgia. I'll take that. CAPELOUTO: Mercedes also got more than $23 million in tax incentives to come to Atlanta. But Germans aren't the only ones bringing jobs. Plenty of French, British, Dutch and Irish firms have a strong presence in the South. And that's why the region should pay attention to what happens in Europe, says Jeff Rosensweig. He teaches international business at Emory University. JEFF ROSENSWEIG: In America, we forget how close our ties are. CAPELOUTO: European firms bring investment to the U. S. , which could dry up if Europe's economy does poorly. Rosensweig also points out U. S. companies get big profits from European subsidiaries. But now, he says, there's this. . . ROSENSWEIG: Accumulating fear that Europe, you know, one of the great potential engines of the world economy, is an engine that's stuttering. CAPELOUTO: The euro has already taken a hit against the dollar, making it more expensive for Europeans to travel. That could hurt another big European connection to the south - Florida tourism. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR\")UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) When you wish upon a star. CAPELOUTO: Many Europeans visit Disney World, and Naples is very popular, too. Europeans, drawn to its beautiful beaches and shops, pumped $216 million into the local economy last year. JoNell Mody is with the convention and visitors bureau there. JONELL MODY: Well, they come, and they stay longer, and they typically spend more money than a U. S. visitor. And they also like to come when they have the bulk of their vacation time, which is the summer, which is our slower season. So they're a very, very important part of helping us stabilize our tourism economy. CAPELOUTO: Economists like Rosensweig want the European Central Bank to pull out all the stops, much like the U. S. Federal Reserve did during the U. S. recession, and help stabilize European markets. ROSENSWEIG: When Europe does well, we do well. And the reverse is true also. I don't want either of us to sneeze because the other one might catch cold.

(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. CORNISH: But wait - just the other day, Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, suggested that growth didn't come from the Democrats. Here's what he said on the Senate floor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration's long tenure in Washington, the expectation of a new Republican Congress. CORNISH: So who should get credit for a possible economic recovery? We're going to ask Kenneth Rogoff. He's professor of economics at Harvard University and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. Welcome to the program. KENNETH ROGOFF: Thank you. CORNISH: So you just heard those two quotes. Do you hear two parties claiming real credit, or is there some hedging in those boasts? ROGOFF: Well, they were both there when it happened. I mean I think there's just no debating that this recovery, given the depth of the financial crisis, has really been very solid. Both parties are trying to claim credit for it, but it's certainly true for a long time the Republicans were criticizing President Obama and saying it's not good enough. But if you look at other countries, it really could have been a lot worse. CORNISH: At this point, what is the consensus among economists about what actually did help the economy recover? ROGOFF: Ah, consensus among economists - you're asking a tall order. I think there's no doubt that the Federal Reserve did a lot of heavy lifting, although it had to do a lot of experimentation along the way to see what worked. I think that the so-called bank stress test where back in May 2009 they tried to figure out just how bad things were - that also was something that helped tremendously. It sort of put a floor under how bad the panic was. And then the fiscal stimulus started under George Bush - President Obama essentially doubled it when he came in. And I think all of these things contributed. People don't know. There's a lot of debate. Certainly, what the Federal Reserve did, everybody agrees was great. CORNISH: Talk a little bit more about the Federal Reserve. I mean, do they essentially deserve most of the credit? And they're not exactly controlled by the president, right - by the executive office? ROGOFF: So what the Federal Reserve did the most was take out the panic. It did things like simply put money into the system so that people knew they'd be able to get their money out. It did things that were just incredibly out-of-the-box, but so too did the government. And the truth of the matter is when you face a crisis like this, you throw the kitchen sink at it. You're never quite sure what worked, but thankfully we didn't have another Great Depression. CORNISH: You're at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, talking to economists from around the world. What are they saying, I mean especially economists, say, from Europe which isn't recovering in the same way? ROGOFF: I think actually everyone everywhere in the world is looking at the United States and wondering how it's managed to do so well, wondering how they could do things better. And that may seem very strange being in the United States where we wish it was a lot better, but Europe is in much worse shape in large part because they don't really have a central government over the Eurozone. Imagine if Texas and Massachusetts had to agree on every policy the way, say, Germany and France do. And even the European Central Bank - that's the equivalent of Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve - they don't really have the same remit that the Federal Reserve does. And so they've been trying to struggle with that. But even you can go to Asia, other places, and everyone admires how the U. S. economy has managed to take this huge punch and manage to come back and now is really something of the envy of the world. CORNISH: That's Kenneth Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University and former chief economist of the IMF. Thank you so much for speaking with us. ROGOFF: My pleasure.

Here's how he defined it. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. It means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement. CORNISH: The president said that the budget he sends to Congress in two weeks will address the challenges middle-class families face in all of these areas and more. And during his speech the president sketched out his proposals. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, members of the Republican-controlled Congress were unimpressed. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The president wants to provide help for middle-class families in more than a half dozen different ways. One would be providing a new $500 tax credit for families where both spouses are working. Another would be to dramatically expand child care benefits to up to $3,000 a year for each child under five. The president said last night it's time to stop treating child care as a side issue. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: . . . Or as a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. YDSTIE: The president also called for legislation from Congress mandating equal pay for women and boosting the minimum wage. He's also pushing a plan to make it easier for workers to save for retirement through their employer. And Obama proposed making two years of community college free. He pointed to Tennessee which has Republican leadership and Chicago with its Democratic mayor as places where it's already happened. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: I want to spread that idea all across so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. YDSTIE: To help pay for that, the president would consolidate six current overlapping provisions that provide help to students. Most controversially, he would once again make the proceeds from 529 educational savings accounts taxable. That produced objections from Republicans today including Kansas representative Lynn Jenkins. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CONGRESSMAN LYNN JENKINS: Middle income families that have worked hard and saved to send their children to college should receive our support, not a tax bill to pay for his agenda. YDSTIE: Republicans also took issue with the president's proposal for paid sick leave. He pointed out that the U. S. is the only advanced country that doesn't mandate paid sick leave, forcing parents to choose between a paycheck and a sick child. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)OBAMA: Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of pay, sick leave. It's the right thing to do. YDSTIE: Alabama Republican Representative Martha Roby said she and her colleagues have a better approach. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CONGRESSMAN MARTHA ROBY: We couldn't agree with you more that we need to be helping working moms and dads. So he has the right goal, he just has the wrong approach. More mandates on the workforce is not the way to go. YDSTIE: Roby introduced a bill today in the house that would instead allow workers to trade overtime hours worked for sick leave. To pay for his plans, the president proposed raising taxes on well-off individuals and big banks, including raising the taxes on income from investments like capital gains and dividends to 28 percent. House Speaker John Boehner made clear the president's ideas are not welcomed by Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CONGRESSMAN JOHN BOEHNER: All the president really offered last night was more taxes, more government, more of the same approach that has failed the middle class for decades. YDSTIE: But Boehner's suggestion for a better approach was also familiar. Replace Obamacare, fix the broken tax code, and balance the federal budget. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

With its economy threatened with recession and deflation, the Eurozone has finally embarked on a stimulus program that's much like the U. S. Federal Reserve's quantitative easing. That program is credited with helping the United States boost its growth rate after the great recession. NPR's John Ydstie joins me to offer some of the details here. John, good morning. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Morning, David. GREENE: So what exactly was announced this morning? YDSTIE: Well, as with the Fed's program, this one involves massive purchases of government and private bonds by central banks in the 19 countries that use the euro. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, said the purchases will amount to 60 billion euros a month and run until September of 2016, or until inflation reaches a more healthy level of around 2 percent. GREENE: And for those of us who are not economists, can you just remind us how bond purchases are supposed to, you know, help and boost growth and inflation? YDSTIE: Well, when central banks buy these bonds they actually create money that's injected into the financial system. And all that money should reduce interest rates and spur borrowing and economic activity, creating jobs and consumer demand. As consumers start buying more goods and services there's upward pressure on prices, which should help boost inflation back to healthier levels. GREENE: And are people optimistic that this will work? YDSTIE: Well, there had been some concern that it wouldn't be large enough to be effective, but the 60 billion euros a month and the length of the program through September of 2016 make it actually larger than expected. One problem is that interest rates in Europe are already very low, so there's a question about whether pushing them down further will really boost borrowing and growth. And Mario Draghi reiterated again this morning that more needs to be done by individual governments to boost growth. GREENE: Well, John, if there was desperation here - I mean, the United States concluded a third round of this type of stimulus last October. Why is Europe coming to this so late? YDSTIE: Well, largely because Germany had opposed it. It saw the path to growth as through balancing budgets and restructuring economies. That hasn't worked so well. Now, partly because Europe experienced deflation in December, those objections have been overcome. GREENE: And, briefly, I mean, are we going to feel the effect of this new European program here in the United States? YDSTIE: Yes, anticipation of this has made the dollar stronger against the euro, which could hurt some U. S. exporters. But it's also contributed to lower U. S. interest rates, which is positive, and, all in all, it should help the global economy. GREENE: All right, that's NPR's John Ydstie talking to us about a new stimulus program announced in the Eurozone this morning. John, thanks. YDSTIE: You're welcome.

Monterey, on California's central coast, has developed a relationship with the Army that eases the financial burden on the military. Krista Almanzan from member station KAZU reports. KRISTA ALMANZAN, BYLINE: George Helms is taking me on a driving tour on the Presidio of Monterey. It's home to the Defense Language Institute. So we're now on the Army's installation in Presidio of Monterey? GEORGE HELMS: That's correct. ALMANZAN: And looking over here, just, like, on the right, you can see how close the city is to the presidio. HELMS: Very, very close. ALMANZAN: So close that houses and streets of the outside community dead end at the presidio's gate. HELMS: If you think about it, the presidio sits inside the City of Monterey's boundaries. So it makes it pretty convenient for us. ALMANZAN: Helms is the city's general services superintendent. His department is based right on the installation, where it handles everything from building remodels to street and sewer maintenance for both the city and the Army. He drives past the schools where the military teaches nearly two dozen languages, including Pashto, Hebrew and Korean. Helms says the main goal of this partnership known as the Monterey Model is to keep the base in the community by keeping the costs down for the Army. HELMS: Most of the good ideas come from the line staff who see things happening every day and then come back to me and say, let's try this. I think we can make it more efficient. ALMANZAN: We stop by a dorm, where one member of that line staff, Bob Tuscany, is fixing a door lock. BOB TUSCANY: Basically, what we have going on here is the card key is not working and opening the door lock. ALMANZAN: It used to be when things went wrong with these card key locks, the Army had to replace them at a cost of $700 apiece. But Helms' staff figured out a way to fix them for just $70. HELMS: The day that you become complacent is the day it becomes too expensive to operate this installation. And then we become very susceptible to a BRAC action. ALMANZAN: BRAC - base realignment and closure. And that gets to the heart of what motivated this unique partnership. Twenty years ago, the nearby Fort Ord Army base closed and resulted in a $500 million loss to the region. And city officials worried other area military installations like the Presidio of Monterey would be future targets of the unpredictable BRAC process. HANS USLAR: It's so complex. I think no one can tell you what really the rationale is. ALMANZAN: Hans Uslar was part of the team that worked on the city's first contract to provide lower-cost services to the Army back 1998. He's now Monterey's assistant city manager and says while the city can't exactly BRAC-proof itself, there are some things it can control. USLAR: One of those elements is cost of operating a base. So we hope that we contribute to that by having a lower cost for military base. ALMANZAN: As a contractor, the city saves the federal government money by not adding a profit to the services it provides. It also shares equipment. And economies of scale means lower prices on everything, from resurfacing streets to purchasing lamp posts. It all adds up to a savings of roughly $2 million a year for the Army. TIM FORD: There's an evolution in the military happening on how we look at installations. ALMANZAN: Tim Ford is CEO of the Association of Defense Communities, a DC-based nonprofit. FORD: I think we're starting to move away from this idea that a base has to be a city unto itself. It has to provide all of these services separate from the community. ALMANZAN: Ford says partnerships being developed elsewhere include the sharing of everything, from garbage collection to plowing snow. Back at the presidio, superintendent George Helms says it just makes sense. HELMS: Why would you stop at the gate? Why would you have a fence line separate your maintenance? ALMANZAN: Since the Monterey Model started about 15 years ago, it has inspired other partnerships in the Army. And now the Air Force is exploring the idea, too. For NPR News, I'm Krista Almanzan.

It's one more sign of how much the economy is improving. But there's a big potential downside that's evoking comparisons to the subprime mortgage broom. Dealers are extending loans to a growing number of people with weak credit, and more of them are having trouble making payments. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: When Chris Westervelt moved from Texas to Alaska to take a job, he decided to trade in his Mazda for a car that could handle snow and ice. CHRIS WESTERVELT: I started looking at vehicles that had four-wheel-drive capabilities, and I ended up settling on a Jeep Wrangler. ZARROLI: He went to a dealer who let him test drive a car. WESTERVELT: He said, go ahead and take the Jeep home, you know, come back sometime tomorrow and, you know, we'll get everything settled. So after driving around a little bit and coming back, the store manager actually got a little aggressive with me. He's like, you've already put 200 miles on my Jeep. What am I going to do? I can't resell this. ZARROLI: He agreed to buy a car, but when he tried to negotiate the loan, he discovered that, thanks in part to a billing dispute with his cell phone company years before, his credit score was low. WESTERVELT: They just said that based on whatever merits that they judge on that I did not meet their requirements. ZARROLI: Westervelt was offered a loan with an interest rate of 18 percent, which he was able to bring down a bit after his mother cosigned a loan. The monthly payment was half again as much as he'd hoped to spend. Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says more people like Westervelt are taking out auto loans. MARK ZANDI: We're seeing a lot more lending and a lot more lending to people with lower credit scores, so-called subprime auto lending. ZARROLI: Zandi says the auto boom is one reason the economy is doing better. But it's come at a cost. The number of subprime borrowers missing payments is at its highest level since 2008. Chris Kukla of the Center for Responsible Lending says the increase in auto lending has clear echoes of the subprime mortgage boom of the mid-2000s. It's driven by investors seeking higher returns. CHRIS KUKLA: Americans are borrowing more to buy a car, and so in order to make it, quote-unquote, \"affordable,\" they have to stretch out those loan terms. ZARROLI: Auto financing industry officials say comparisons to the mortgage market are misguided. Jack Tracey of the National Automotive Finance agency says the subprime boom was fueled by the erroneous assumption among investors that housing prices would always rise. He says no one thinks that about autos which depreciate quickly. JACK TRACEY: That's just not been the case with the auto financing market. Securitizations have performed through bad times and now in the good times. There's no reasonable expectation that this industry would blow up. ZARROLI: Tracey says the rise in subprime auto lending is an outgrowth of the fact that more people are returning to the workforce. TRACEY: The ability to provide auto financing, be it prime or nonprime, is very important for our economy and for the health of our citizens in keeping people employed and money coming in. Not everybody can get on a bus and go to a job. Most people in the country need to have transportation. ZARROLI: Economist Mark Zandi doesn't dispute that. And he says people shouldn't exaggerate what's happening. For one thing, the auto industry is a lot smaller than the mortgage market. ZANDI: I wouldn't send off red flares at this point, but I think we should be shining a very bright light on practices in the industry just to make sure that things are being done properly so that this does not become a problem in the future. ZARROLI: Zandi says that as subprime auto lending rises, it's important to remember one lesson from the housing bust - regulators need lots of information about what's happening in the markets, and they need to monitor it closely before troubles get out of hand. Jim Zarroli, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  The number of Americans buying cars and trucks approached a record high last year. It's one more sign of how much the economy is improving. But there's a big potential downside that's evoking comparisons to the subprime mortgage broom. Dealers are extending loans to a growing number of people with weak credit, and more of them are having trouble making payments. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: When Chris Westervelt moved from Texas to Alaska to take a job, he decided to trade in his Mazda for a car that could handle snow and ice. CHRIS WESTERVELT: I started looking at vehicles that had four-wheel-drive capabilities, and I ended up settling on a Jeep Wrangler. ZARROLI: He went to a dealer who let him test drive a car. WESTERVELT: He said, go ahead and take the Jeep home, you know, come back sometime tomorrow and, you know, we'll get everything settled. So after driving around a little bit and coming back, the store manager actually got a little aggressive with me. He's like, you've already put 200 miles on my Jeep. What am I going to do? I can't resell this. ZARROLI: He agreed to buy a car, but when he tried to negotiate the loan, he discovered that, thanks in part to a billing dispute with his cell phone company years before, his credit score was low. WESTERVELT: They just said that based on whatever merits that they judge on that I did not meet their requirements. ZARROLI: Westervelt was offered a loan with an interest rate of 18 percent, which he was able to bring down a bit after his mother cosigned a loan. The monthly payment was half again as much as he'd hoped to spend. Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says more people like Westervelt are taking out auto loans. MARK ZANDI: We're seeing a lot more lending and a lot more lending to people with lower credit scores, so-called subprime auto lending. ZARROLI: Zandi says the auto boom is one reason the economy is doing better. But it's come at a cost. The number of subprime borrowers missing payments is at its highest level since 2008. Chris Kukla of the Center for Responsible Lending says the increase in auto lending has clear echoes of the subprime mortgage boom of the mid-2000s. It's driven by investors seeking higher returns. CHRIS KUKLA: Americans are borrowing more to buy a car, and so in order to make it, quote-unquote, \"affordable,\" they have to stretch out those loan terms. ZARROLI: Auto financing industry officials say comparisons to the mortgage market are misguided. Jack Tracey of the National Automotive Finance agency says the subprime boom was fueled by the erroneous assumption among investors that housing prices would always rise. He says no one thinks that about autos which depreciate quickly. JACK TRACEY: That's just not been the case with the auto financing market. Securitizations have performed through bad times and now in the good times. There's no reasonable expectation that this industry would blow up. ZARROLI: Tracey says the rise in subprime auto lending is an outgrowth of the fact that more people are returning to the workforce. TRACEY: The ability to provide auto financing, be it prime or nonprime, is very important for our economy and for the health of our citizens in keeping people employed and money coming in. Not everybody can get on a bus and go to a job. Most people in the country need to have transportation. ZARROLI: Economist Mark Zandi doesn't dispute that.

They are expected to elect the first anti-austerity party in the Eurozone. But the new leadership will still have to find a way to get Greece out of a deep depression. Joanna Kakissis reports from Athens. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Maria Tsitoura is a lively grandmother in her 70s. Like many retirees in Greece, she shares her small pension with her grown children, whose salaries have dropped by more than half in the last four years. And more than a quarter of Greeks are unemployed. Four years of austerity, which came in exchange for billions in bailout loans, have crushed the economy. Greeks are now poised to elect Syriza, a leftist party that calls austerity fiscal waterboarding. Christoforos Vernadakis is a pollster who is running as a parliamentary candidate on the Syriza ticket. MARIA TSITOURA: (Through interpreter) Europe's austerity experiment has failed. And as a result, the old political parties, viewed as tools of this austerity policy, have fallen apart. KAKISSIS: One of those parties is New Democracy, the Conservative Party of the outgoing prime minister, Antonis Samaras. He is warned that Syriza is reckless and untested. If the party wins, it must find a way to pay off the country's debt while keeping its generous promises to voters, says economist Jens Bastian. JENS BASTIAN: If it wants to implement its ambitious economic and welfare agenda, where's it going to find the money for that? It will need financial assistance from international, in particular, European partners. That is a matter of negotiation and of compromise, consensus building. KAKISSIS: But Vernadakis says the party wants to kick out the troika, the representatives of international lenders. He calls them foreigners infringing on Greek sovereignty. CHRISTOFOROS VERNADAKIS: (Through interpreter) The only thing we have to talk to our creditors about is debt. How will we pay it back? How can we do it quickly? That's all. KAKISSIS: Syriza says Greeks must ask for debt relief, something Germany, the biggest Eurozone lender, has rebuffed. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY)ALEXIS TSIPRAS: Thank you. First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin. KAKISSIS: But that attitude may change with the Syriza victory, especially if another hard-charging anti-austerity party, Podemos, comes to power in Spain, another troubled European economy.

According to gasbuddy. com, a gallon of regular gas sells for less than $2 in more than half of all states - that's less than $2. As NPR's Uri Berliner reports, that will be especially welcome in areas of the country where there's no avoiding getting behind the wheel. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Sue Beates pays close attention to energy prices. It's part of her job. She's the curator at the Drake Well Museum in Titusville, Pa. , where the exhibits explain the history of the oil industry. But it's outside of her working hours when those prices become personal. SUE BEATES: I drive 46 miles each way, so up through two snow belts to get to work. BERLINER: Gas prices falling by nearly half. BEATES: It's had a huge impact. BERLINER: What do you do with it? BEATES: Buy meat. (LAUGHTER)BEATES: Instead of beans and rice, there's meat on the menu. BERLINER: Because so many household costs are fixed, Beates says when gas was nearly $4 a gallon, it affected what she put in her cart at the supermarket. BEATES: When you're paying mortgage, car payments, utilities, that fuel cost makes a huge difference, and the only place to cut back would be food. BERLINER: The average American household should save around $750 this year from lower gas prices according to the Energy Department. But Thomas Kinnaman, an economist at Bucknell University, says that word average - it doesn't tell a full story. THOMAS KINNAMAN: It's not that we're not all average families. We're not average drivers. We have very different driving habits. BERLINER: So, for example, he says in rural Pennsylvania, where I've come for this story and where Kinnaman teaches, people typically drive twice as much as they do in, say, a suburb of Philadelphia, Washington and New York.  And if you live in a rural area and money's tight, those savings from cheap gas make an enormous difference. I caught up with Regina and Lawrence Wilson in a shopping center outside their hometown of Lewisburg, Pa. REGINA WILSON: Well, weekly, it costs us, like, $80 a week to fill up our tank. So we are saving, like, half of that. BERLINER: What can you afford to do that you didn't do before? WILSON: I can buy me a pair of shoes (laughter). I can buy my grandkids stuff. Like, it saves a lot. BERLINER: Those savings were a big deal because they don't have cash to spare. Lawrence Wilson says he's been shoveling snow for the local housing authority and doing the occasional restaurant job. Regina used to be a home health aide until she got sick. Now she drives to the doctor nearly 20 miles away three times a week. WILSON: So now I put $10 gas in this car, it'd get me at least almost to half a tank. And I can get to the doctor, and I can get back home, and still have gas left to go do a little food shopping if I want. BERLINER: About 15 miles away, just off I-80, long haul trucker Teresa Arevalo is sitting in her cab at a Flying J truck stop. She's on a break, just delivered a load of toilet paper. Her 53-foot trailer is empty. TERESA AREVALO: What do I normally carry? Anywhere from water to vodka to toilet paper to kitty litter to flour to plastic bottles to - basically general commodity. Everything that goes to your stores except for - I don't do hazmat loads. BERLINER: Cheap fuel is helping her employer, JB Hunt, but it's good for Arevalo, too, when her deliveries are done and it's time to drive home. That's five hours from the company terminal in Dallas to her place in San Antonio. AREVALO: Oh, it's great. I can go more places and less money out of my pocket. BERLINER: Arevalo says lately, she's been saving more than a $100 a month. Forecasters are predicting that gas will stay cheap throughout the year. But if history is a guide, there's no counting on these low prices for the long haul. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

What comes to mind when you think of Scandinavia - great education systems, the world's happiest people, healthy work-life balance, maybe? Well, one man, a British transplant living in Denmark, didn't buy it. So he's trying to set the record straight about his adoptive homeland. Michael Booth is the author of a new book titled \"The Almost Nearly Perfect People - Behind The Myth Of The Scandinavian Utopia. \" And when I spoke with him, he started by telling me the real definition of that word, utopia. MICHAEL BOOTH: It literally means, in Greek, does not exist. MARTIN: Does it? BOOTH: Yeah. So this is my message to everyone. Utopia doesn't exist, unfortunately. MARTIN: (Laughter). BOOTH: And it certainly doesn't exist up here in the chilly north. MARTIN: You are coming to this as an outsider, but you do make your home in this part of the world by choice. BOOTH: Yeah, almost of my own free will. I'm married to a Danish woman. And Scandinavian women are pretty strong, and you generally just do what they tell you to do. And my wife told me to come and live with her in Denmark. So I did. MARTIN: So let's walk through a big - a few of the big points in the books. One of things I think Americans, in particular, think of when you talk about Scandinavia is the social welfare system and the correspondingly high taxes that go with it. What about this part of the culture plays into the myth? BOOTH: Let's take Denmark for example. The income tax is about - the top rate is just over 50 percent, but there's all sorts of other very heavy taxes. MARTIN: Fifty percent. BOOTH: Most people reckon about three quarters of your income ends up in the state's coffers. MARTIN: What do you get for it? BOOTH: Well, exactly. That's the quid pro quo, isn't it? What you get is free education, very cheap preschool care, functioning public transport, a free health service - all the things that many Americans dream of. The question is you're paying the highest taxes in the world, is the education system the best in the world? Are the hospitals the best in the world? No, they're not. MARTIN: Let's just stay in Denmark for the time being. Are Danes satisfied with the status quo? BOOTH: Actually, that's the perfect word for the Danes. You may have heard they're supposed to be the happiest people in the world. MARTIN: Yeah. BOOTH: And they have regularly topped these happiness rankings. They haven't, actually, in the last few years. They've dropped dramatically in line with their economy. So I'm afraid the side message here is money does make you happy. But I've spoken to some of these people who are behind these ranking lists. And they secretly admit it's not about happiness, but they just use the word happy to grab the headlines. It's really, as you said, it's about satisfaction and contentedness. And the Danes are massively content. MARTIN: You spend a good portion of time in the book talking about the issue of immigration. How have these countries learned to integrate immigrant populations? Which have done it really well and which ones have not? BOOTH: Oh, that's a long - I mean, how long have you got to talk about this? It's a very complex subject, and it differs, really, from country-to-country because you have Sweden which has had basically an open door policy. They've welcomed many thousands of refugees from Syria - incredibly impressive humanitarian gesture. On the other hand, they have problems. They have ghettos. They have crime levels that are getting quite excessive. And in the last election, their far right party, the Sweden Democrats, which has its roots in the neo-Nazi party, scored 13 percent of the popular vote. And then we have Norway where there were the tragic events of the Anders Behring Breivik terrorist attack. MARTIN: We should just remind people that happened in 2011. BOOTH: That's right. His kind of beef was with multiculturalism, as he saw it, in Norway. MARTIN: You take a look at the cultural historic differences among these countries. I mean, we in America, I think, in particular, are guilty of just kind of lumping them all together. I was fascinated to learn that the Norwegians kind of get short shrift. BOOTH: Yeah. I thought of Scandinavians as just one big homogenous bearded, cycling, maybe with a pipe. But they are radically different even within Sweden. You're right. The Norwegians - they are kind - or traditionally, were thought of as the country bumpkin. But then in the '70s, they struck oil. So they are now the Beverly Hillbillies. If there is a God, he has a great sense of humor because he gave the cash to the Norwegians. You know? MARTIN: (Laughter) When you go back to Britain or visit other parts of the world,  what do you end up missing about the North? BOOTH: I don't miss the licorice and the marzipan which you can't avoid here. What I miss, oh, God. Oh, I do love Denmark. Honestly, it's great. Let me think of something. MARTIN: (Laughter) The beer? BOOTH: No, I don't really like beer very much. MARTIN: No, OK. BOOTH: There is a fantastic new Nordic food movement here, and I write a lot about food. So there, that's what I miss. MARTIN: All right. Michael Booth - his new book is called \"The Almost Nearly Perfect People - Behind The Myth Of The Scandinavian Utopia. \" Hey, Michael, thanks so much. BOOTH: Oh, there's always one question I've never been asked before. You really got me there. MARTIN: Is that true? BOOTH: You know, apart from my family, honestly, and friends. MARTIN: This has really stumped you. BOOTH: It's terrible. I'm having an existential crisis. MARTIN: Come on. Are there mountains? BOOTH: They have nice beaches. MARTIN: Coffee? BOOTH: No, I don't drink coffee. (Laughter) But you're right, they have the best coffee in the world. I'll say that next time someone asks me. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  OK.

S. economy continues to recover, stark differences are emerging between people with just a high school education and those who finished college. Graduates of four-year colleges are nearly twice as likely to have a job as those with just a high school diploma [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In the audio of this story, as in a previous Web version, we incorrectly say that four-year college graduates are nearly twice as likely to have a job compared to Americans with a high school diploma. We should have said the unemployment rate is nearly twice as high for Americans with a high school diploma as it is for those with a four-year college degree or more]. But economists say that doesn't mean everybody needs a four-year degree. In fact, millions of well-paying jobs are opening up in the trades as NPR's Chris Arnold reports in our series on millennials. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: When Haley Hughes was graduating high school this past summer, she had good grades, she was on the honor roll every year, and she'd applied to a bunch of four-year colleges. And you got in to all the ones you applied to or. . . HALEY HUGHES: Yeah, I got into everything, but I didn't really - I wasn't excited about it, really, I guess. ARNOLD: Today, Hughes, who's 18, is sitting in an apprenticeship classroom at NSTAR, the big power utility company around Boston, and this class is actually kind of exciting. LARA ALLISON: OK, FR - what's FR? UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: (In unison) Fire retardant. ALLISON: Fire retardant. Fire retardant what? ARNOLD: The instructor, Lara Allison, is teaching Hughes and other students how to protect themselves if they're down under a manhole cover in an underground substation and something bad happens. ALLISON: It's an arc flash. That's the thing we worry the most about. Now, an arc flash is highly, highly energized. It's basically electricity that's jumping and trying to go from one place and find another source. OK? So it gets you. The idea is it's really, really hot. ARNOLD: On her apprenticeship already, Hughes has been down working in those underground substations. HUGHES: I loved it. It was great. ARNOLD: Hughes says another thing that's great is that taking this path to the high-skilled trades - it's a lot cheaper than a four-year college would've been. HUGHES: Yeah, like, the student loans would be ridiculous because the schools I was looking at, they were like $40,000 a year. So in the long run it was going to be a ton of money. ARNOLD: By comparison, NSTAR, the utility, is partnering with nearby Bunker Hill Community College so the young people here end up with a two-year associate's degree. Hughes has some scholarships, the utility pays some, so it ends up being $1,200 a semester, which gets her a lot of on-the-job experience and classes. HUGHES: English, math, a computer course - this semester taking a psychology group dynamics class. Then we have classes directly related to NSTAR, so we have, like, a DC theory, AC theory, like, a physics class and an engineering class. And we also have to take a business etiquette class this summer. ARNOLD: Ninety percent of the students in this NSTAR apprenticeship program get jobs with the power utility at graduation. NSTAR is changing its name to Eversource Energy, by the way. And the starting base pay for those jobs is around $58,000 a year. Now, overall, the numbers show that people are better off with a four-year college degree than a two-year degree or less. But reality, as it often does, has more nuance than that. ANTHONY CARNEVALE: The more education you get, the more money you'll make on average, but averages lie. ARNOLD: Anthony Carnevale is the director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. He says the problem with those averages is that people who work at Radio Shack or Target get lumped in with master carpenters and electricians. CARNEVALE: You can get a particular skill in a particular field and make more than a college graduate - that is, sometimes less education makes more. ARNOLD: For example, Carnevale says, the average electrician makes $5,000 a year more than the average four-year college graduate. And the country is going to need a lot more skilled tradespeople. CARNEVALE: The baby boom workers are retiring and leaving lots of openings for millennials, and they're substantial. So among electricians, for example, there are just about 600,000 electricians out there. ARNOLD: Carnevale says half of those jobs will open up over the next decade. That'll mean a lot of opportunity for that millennial generation born between 1980 and 2000. We'll need more pipe-fitters, nuclear power plant operators, carpenters, welders, utility workers - it's a big, long list. But the problem, of course, is that not enough young people are getting that kind of training. CARNEVALE: We made a mistake. ARNOLD: Carnevale says since the early 1980s, most high schools have been focusing on getting students ready for college instead of vocational training. CARNEVALE: In the process we basically obliterated the modernization of the old vocational educational programs, and they've been set aside. ARNOLD: Carnevale says, basically, we should bring them back. And, he says, we need to be preparing a lot more young people for good, well-paying jobs in the trades. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

His is a name that the U. S. Labor Movement despises and fears. Walker weakened unions in his own state and appears ready to make his battles with labor the centerpiece of a bid for the White House. Here's NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Scott Walker's approach on a recent Saturday in Iowa  was telling. In a downtown Des Moines theater full of conservative activists, he spoke for 22 minutes. But right off the top, and at length, he told the tale of how he took on public employee unions in Wisconsin. That effort - largely successful - triggered massive protests at the state Capitol and brought years of turmoil, including a fractious attempt to recall him from office. This is from that candidate forum in Des Moines. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER: You know, you all know about the protests. I mean, at one point, there were 100,000 or more protesters in and around our state Capitol. They were banging on the drums. They were blowing the horns. They had signs and banners. GONYEA: Walker, now fresh off re-election to a second term, walked back and forth across the stage. He said what people may not know is that protesters - as many as 1,000 of them - showed up outside his home while his family was there. And he told the Iowa crowd there were death threats. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)WALKER: Most of those death threats were directed at me, but some of the worst were directed at my family. I remember one of the ones that bothered me the most was someone literally sent me a threat that said they were going to gut my wife like a deer. GONYEA: It was a line designed to shock the audience. And one that set Walker apart from the other speakers that day, including Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie. Those are all GOP household names - not so Walker. In fact, it's likely few in the theater had ever seen him in person, even if they knew his record. But here's how it sounded as he wrapped up his remarks. (APPLAUSE)GONYEA: Now for a reaction from a leading labor activist who knows a Scott Walker's record all too well. STEVE ROSENTHAL: Scott Walker is an extremely divisive guy. He created a war zone in Wisconsin, pitting families against families, neighbors against neighbors. That's how he won. GONYEA: That's Steve Rosenthal, a former political director for the AFL-CIO who currently works as a Democratic strategist and organizer. His animus toward Walker and his policies is widely shared by labor activists all across the country. ROSENTHAL: There were labor leaders who called him the poster child a few years ago, public enemy number one, who really went all out to try to beat him in Wisconsin and weren't successful. The fact that he is now potentially emerging on the national stage is really scary. And you can see a scenario where he could become the Republican nominee. GONYEA: Back in Iowa, Dennis Goldford, who teaches political science at Drake University, attended that forum where Walker spoke. He notes that the Wisconsin governor portrays himself as a victim when he talks of huge protests at his home and of death threats. DENNIS GOLDFORD: He emphasized this sense of being under threats by opponents who oppose everything he stands for. But the more important subtext was that he's tough enough to take on these elements that threaten the very way of life these conservative Republicans believe is under siege.

Well, oil prices are now plunging. You wouldn't be wrong to think those fuel charges might go away. They haven't. In fact, FedEx Ground raised them yesterday. Susanna Capelouto, from member station WABE in Atlanta, reports. SUSANNA CAPELOUTO, BYLINE: It's a cold morning at Atlanta's International Airport, but Jeremy Strickler has a big smile. JEREMY STRICKLER: We're flying to Jamaica. CAPELOUTO: He's looking forward to a week of sun and fun. But he had to pay $400 for his flight to a Caribbean country, and a third of his fare went to taxes and fees. STRICKLER: Ticket prices are still high. You would think they would come down. They probably will in time, but the airlines are making money now. JEAN MEDINA: While airlines are reporting profits, it's modest. CAPELOUTO: Jean Medina is with Airlines for America, a group that lobbies for major cargo and passenger airlines. She says carriers are still adding surcharges, but only on international flights. Each carrier determines what fee to tack on, and they can use those additional revenues to cover any expenses, not just fuel. MEDINA: While fuel has come down, other costs have been increasing - cost of labor, cost of aircraft rent, cost of buying new planes. CAPELOUTO: Still, the plunge in oil is a huge factor in an industry where 30 percent of all expenses are for fuel. For example, American Airlines predicts it will save $5 billion this year, so consumer advocates are crying foul. Travelers United is a group representing passengers. It has sent a letter to airlines asking them to lower airfares. Chairman Charlie Leocha says airlines slapped on surcharges when prices were high, but never explained the rules for lowering them. CHARLIE LEOCHA: It seems to have absolutely no connection with reality. It's just a random fee that the airlines vary as they want to. CAPELOUTO: Leocha blames recent major airline mergers and less competition for the slow response to the nearly 50 percent jet fuel price drop, but airlines aren't alone in being slow to respond. If you send a package, flowers or order a pizza, chances are you will still be paying surcharges. TIM MCINTYRE: Delivery charges are meant to offset far more than just fuel prices. CAPELOUTO: Tim McIntyre is with Domino's Pizza. He says everything from the uniforms to the bags that keep the pizza warm is part of the delivery equation. He says franchises are free to drop the fuel surcharge if they want. MCINTYRE: They should pay attention to the fees charged by their local competition and to make the best decision for their businesses. CAPELOUTO: Tom Smith, an economist at Emory University, says businesses can be slow to adjust to drops in volatile energy prices. TOM SMITH: When prices go down, you still want to hedge against the possibility that going forward they might go up again. And so it's a lot harder to drop prices than it is to increase them. CAPELOUTO: But not all businesses are free to hang onto surcharges. Ask Atlanta's cabdrivers. WONDIMU: They have to come down now. CAPELOUTO: A driver who gave his name as Wondimu is waiting for customers at the Atlanta airport. He used to charge a $2 fuel fee, but once the price of gas dropped below $2. 90, city law says no more surcharge. He's kind of glad it's gone. WONDIMU: It was not really helping us. When we tell them this is fuel charges, it's surcharge, it's aggravating the customers, too. CAPELOUTO: Many economists predict that soon worries about aggravated customers will force other businesses to follow suit.

A barrel of crude has dropped from a high of over $100 to less than $50 today. Houston Business Journal calls it the Oilpocalypse. Energy companies are expecting a 23 percent drop in quarterly profits. Oil services giant Schlumberger will cut 9,000 jobs. Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips are slashing their budgets by a third. It's a familiar cycle and one that oilmen learn how to survive. John Burnett profiles an independent producer in Texas who has seen it all before. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Three things put Luling, Texas on the map - Watermelon, smoked meat. . . TRACY PERRYMAN: Two slices of brisket and a ring of sausage. BURNETT: . . . And oil. Tracy Perryman's family has been in the oil business in Luling since the 1920s, when a wildcatter drilled down a half-mile through ancient limestone and struck oil. Nearly a century later the field is still active. PERRYMAN: In Caldwell County there's still almost 9,000 producing wells. BURNETT: Tracy Perryman, production manager of his family's small oil company, B. J. P. Inc. , digs into his brisket in the dining room of the venerable Luling City Market. Unlike the stereotype of the flamboyant and boorish Texas oilman, he wears work clothes and speaks softly. He looks out the window and considers what the price drop has meant for traffic rumbling through his home town, located about an hour south of Austin. PERRYMAN: Gravel trucks, oil field trucks, oil haulers, rigs - all that kind of thing. You can just see, going right through Luling, it's maybe half as much or less in activity that it was when oil was a $100 a barrel. BURNETT: As it happens, the Luling field lies just north of the monster Eagle Ford shale formation. Fracking and horizontal drilling have made it one of the world's most prolific oil fields. The old Luling wells are what are called stripper wells. They produce less than 15 barrels a day. Perryman sits on the tailgate of his pickup next to a hillside of mesquite and post oak. The dirt is stained black and the air smells of rotten eggs. PERRYMAN: This well that we're currently sitting by produces about a barrel and a half of oil a day and about 20 barrels of salt water. It was drilled in the early '60s. We anticipate that it will continue to produce for many, many years. BURNETT: So what happens to a small oilman like you when prices drop in half? PERRYMAN: When oil is up, we know it's going to go down. We try to spend the money on our equipment and our production to get it in good shape. So when it does go down we have no debt, we have good equipment and we can ride through the hard times and get ready for the next boom. BURNETT: In better times, his company bought new pump jacks, pipes, tanks, vehicles, forklifts and machine tools. They fixed roads and fences and they paid cash. Today everything has changed. They'll defer down-hole maintenance on wells. They'll ignore potholes in their roads rather than call the gravel truck. And they'll try to repair broken equipment instead of replace it. They've been here before. PERRYMAN: I don't believe that hard times are here yet. In April of '98, we'd seen oil go down to $9 a barrel. That was tough because it was costing us $18, $19 a barrel, the expense of it just to get it out of the ground. BURNETT: Most small independents like Perryman cannot afford to explore for oil. They buy up properties from the majors, who decide to sell off marginal wells when they become less profitable. The Perryman family purchased its wells years ago from Humble Oil, which became Exxon. ED LONGANECKER: Smaller independent oil and gas producers like Tracy Perryman are of critical importance obviously to our state and our national economy. BURNETT: Ed Longanecker is president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. He says in Texas, the nation's biggest crude oil producer, 41 percent of all wells in the state are stripper wells like the ones in Luling. LONGANECKER: The reason smaller independents can survive is because they are not drilling $5, $10, $15 million horizontal wells in the sweet spots, you know, from an acreage standpoint, in some of these shale formations. BURNETT: Perryman's company owns 116 wells, all of them shallow and vertical. Together they produce about 100 barrels a day. Last summer when prices were high, they paid $10,000 a day. Today it's half that. But year after year, the moaning pumpjacks keep bobbing up and down. So with every stroke of this pumpjack, it's pulling a couple of quarts of oil out of the ground? PERRYMAN: Oil and saltwater. You get enough of these wells, you can make a living - even at $45 a barrel - in Luling. BURNETT: John Burnett, NPR News, Austin. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Hard times have hit the oil field. A barrel of crude has dropped from a high of over $100 to less than $50 today. Houston Business Journal calls it the Oilpocalypse. Energy companies are expecting a 23 percent drop in quarterly profits. Oil services giant Schlumberger will cut 9,000 jobs. Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips are slashing their budgets by a third. It's a familiar cycle and one that oilmen learn how to survive. John Burnett profiles an independent producer in Texas who has seen it all before. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Three things put Luling, Texas on the map - Watermelon, smoked meat. . . TRACY PERRYMAN: Two slices of brisket and a ring of sausage. BURNETT: . . . And oil. Tracy Perryman's family has been in the oil business in Luling since the 1920s, when a wildcatter drilled down a half-mile through ancient limestone and struck oil. Nearly a century later the field is still active. PERRYMAN: In Caldwell County there's still almost 9,000 producing wells. BURNETT: Tracy Perryman, production manager of his family's small oil company, B. J. P. Inc. , digs into his brisket in the dining room of the venerable Luling City Market. Unlike the stereotype of the flamboyant and boorish Texas oilman, he wears work clothes and speaks softly. He looks out the window and considers what the price drop has meant for traffic rumbling through his home town, located about an hour south of Austin. PERRYMAN: Gravel trucks, oil field trucks, oil haulers, rigs - all that kind of thing. You can just see, going right through Luling, it's maybe half as much or less in activity that it was when oil was a $100 a barrel. BURNETT: As it happens, the Luling field lies just north of the monster Eagle Ford shale formation. Fracking and horizontal drilling have made it one of the world's most prolific oil fields. The old Luling wells are what are called stripper wells. They produce less than 15 barrels a day. Perryman sits on the tailgate of his pickup next to a hillside of mesquite and post oak. The dirt is stained black and the air smells of rotten eggs. PERRYMAN: This well that we're currently sitting by produces about a barrel and a half of oil a day and about 20 barrels of salt water. It was drilled in the early '60s. We anticipate that it will continue to produce for many, many years. BURNETT: So what happens to a small oilman like you when prices drop in half? PERRYMAN: When oil is up, we know it's going to go down. We try to spend the money on our equipment and our production to get it in good shape. So when it does go down we have no debt, we have good equipment and we can ride through the hard times and get ready for the next boom.

S. job market is finally getting back on track more than five years after the great recession. The government's monthly jobs report shows an increase of more than a million jobs over the past three months. The unemployment rate did go up a notch, but as NPR's John Ydstie reports, even that is a positive sign. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There were lots of accolades from economists for this jobs report. John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo, says it's the best report in five years. JOHN SILVIA: Since the great recession it's probably the best report we've seen, because not only do you have a gain in jobs for January, but you also have December and November revised up as well. So it's a pretty solid report. YDSTIE: The revisions put November's job gain at a whopping 423,000, December at a very strong 329,000 and January's at a very respectable 257,000. Altogether, more than a million jobs were created, making it the best three months of job growth since 1997. The unemployment rate did rise a notch to 5. 7 percent, but Silvia says that happened because people on the sidelines are returning to the labor force to look for work as the economy improves. SILVIA: People say, OK, now I've got an opportunity. There's a possibility of me getting a job. Now I get off the couch and go out and look for jobs. And that's a positive sign for the economy. YDSTIE: Job creation was broad-based in this report. Construction jobs increased by 39,000, healthcare was up 38,000, and manufacturing added 22,000 jobs. Among the few negatives in the report, oil and gas extraction lost a couple thousand jobs following a plunge in oil prices. CME Group economist Blu Putnam said the pullback in that sector is unlikely to hurt the broader economy. BLU PUTNAM: The small job losses that we are probably going to lose over the course of the year in the energy sector will be more than offset by a large factor in the rest of the economy. YDSTIE: Putnam says the vibrant job growth is likely to convince Federal Reserve policymakers to raise their benchmark interest rate soon. It's been near zero since 2008. PUTNAM: We would suggest that this report keeps the fed on track toward a very small rate rise in the summer of 2015. YDSTIE: John Silvia agrees. He thinks fed officials will begin to move rates rates back to a more normal level at their June meeting. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

Those falling prices have also slowed drilling here in the U. S. , and that's led to layoffs in the energy sector. But this morning, the Labor Department's monthly employment report came out, and it shows that overall, job growth is strong. Here's NPR's John Ydstie. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The report showed an increase of 257,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate did tick up a notch to 5. 7 percent, but even that appears to be a positive signal. That's because it was likely driven higher by workers reentering the labor force because they're more confident now about finding a job. In fact, the labor force increased by more than 700,000 people in January. CME Group economist Blu Putnam says the January report was good on almost every front. BLU PUTNAM: This is a very, very broad-based jobs report, a very good signal for the economy. YDSTIE: One of the few disappointing areas was a loss of 3,000 jobs in the mining sector. Putnam says that's possibly the leading edge of job losses that will hit the energy sector because of the plunge in oil prices. But he doesn't think that will hurt the broader economy. PUTNAM: The small job losses that we are probably going to lose over the course of the year in the energy sector will be more than offset by a large factor in the rest of the economy. YDSTIE: The robust employment market was evident in the January numbers. Construction jobs were up 39,000, health care was up almost that much and manufacturing jobs increased by 22,000. Upward revisions for job growth in November and December pushed the average job creation in the past three months to 336,000 - a very robust pace. And average hourly wages rose strongly, too - up 12 cents an hour. But Putnam cautions that the previous month showed a wage decline. PUTNAM: If you average the two months, it's basically - we're starting to head in the right direction, which is a little higher hourly wages. But it's still relatively sluggish by historical standards. YDSTIE: On the positive side, though, Putnam says the number of hours worked is creeping up, and 3 million more people have gained jobs in the past year, so overall income is increased enough to propel the economy forward at a healthy rate.

How many do you have? NICK HANAUER: Five, six. RAZ: Five or six? HANAUER: Yeah. RAZ: Which one? HANAUER: You know, I just have a house here. I have a house in Mexico. I have a house in San Juan Islands. I have oddly two ski houses - trying to sell one. RAZ: So Nick Hanauer is very rich, but he didn't come from money. And having so much, he admits, it's a little weird. HANAUER: It makes my wife super uncomfortable (laughter). RAZ: When you talk about, like, being rich? HANAUER: Well, when anybody talks about. . . RAZ: Yeah. HANAUER: . . . Our circumstance. You know, I work hard and I'm reasonably smart, but I was definitely and have repeatedly been in the right place at the right time. RAZ: Nick co-founded a tech company, which later sold to Microsoft for $6. 4 billion. So he's not just a 1-percenter. Nick's, like, in the top . 01 percent, which brings us to our next sin - greed.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GOLD DIGGER\")WEST: (Singing) But she ain't messing with no broke, broke. RAZ: Really? HANAUER: Absolutely it's a sin. Greed is a sin because humans are social creatures. And they simply cannot survive without the opposite of greed, which is cooperation. RAZ: People like Nick Hanauer - the top 1 percent - will soon control more than half of the world's wealth. And Nick believes the growing gap between rich and poor is bad for everyone. And he thinks the driving force behind that gap is greed. Here's part of Nick's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANAUER: You see, the problem isn't that we have some inequality. Some inequality is necessary for a high-functioning capitalist democracy. The problem is that inequality is at historic highs today, and it's getting worse every day. And if wealth, power and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top, our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a neo-feudalist rentier society like 18th-century France, you know, France before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks. So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world - wake up. Wake up. It cannot last because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society, the pitchforks will come for us, for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality. It has never happened. There are no examples. You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state or an uprising. The pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this. It's not a matter of if; it's when. RAZ: Coming up, Nick Hanauer's plan to fight the sin of greed. That's in a minute. On the show today - the Seven Deadly Sins. I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're deep in the pit of sin, slogging our way through sloth and gluttony and lust and wrath. And before the break, we were talking to Nick Hanauer, your basic tech gazillion-aire from Seattle, about greed. So what do you think makes people that way? Like, what do you think makes people greedy? HANAUER: So I think that the most powerful dynamic in human societies is the yearning for status. RAZ: Yeah. HANAUER: I think the people who end up being extraordinarily successful - it's been my observation - tend to care enormously about status, particularly business people, right? Because the only point of money, you know, the only reason to have a 300-foot-long boat is because they're bigger than 200-foot-long boats. RAZ: Yeah. HANAUER: You know, people do these things to prove that they have more money and more status than others. And so, you know, I think that that drives a ton of human behavior. RAZ: And in his TED Talk, Nick says that if nothing changes, the consequences, not just for poor people, but also for rich people, could be disastrous. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANAUER: So what do I see in our future today you ask? I see pitchforks, as in angry mobs with pitchforks, because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of avarice, the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind. I'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong. What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks, but it's also terrible for business, too. So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford. When Ford famously introduced the $5 day, which was twice the prevailing wage at the time, he didn't just increase the productivity of his factories, he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made. Ford intuited what we now know is true. Raising wages increases demand, which increases hiring which, in turn, increases wages and demand and profits. And that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity is precisely what is missing from today's economic recovery. RAZ: It's for all these reasons that Nick's been doing things that might seem to run counter to his self-interest, like promoting higher taxes on people like him. And, in his hometown of Seattle, Nick lobbied the city council to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. It's now the highest in the country. And he says all of these ideas aren't just good for poor people, they'll actually help rich people, too. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANAUER: The work of democracies is to maximize the inclusion of the many in order to create prosperity, not to enable the few to accumulate money. Government does create prosperity and growth by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive - balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn't bad for capitalism, it's essential to it. Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective, a capitalism that will ensure that America's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world. Or, alternatively, we could do nothing, hide in our gated communities and private schools, enjoy our planes and yachts - they're fun - and wait for the pitchforks. Thank you.

Or, alternatively, we could do nothing, hide in our gated communities and private schools, enjoy our planes and yachts - they're fun - and wait for the pitchforks. Thank you.

We'll know what effect that's having on job creation overall when the government's monthly employment report comes out later this morning. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: A report released yesterday by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas concluded, not surprisingly, that the plunge in oil prices is leading to layoffs in energy and related industries. The firm said about 21,000 job cuts in January were directly attributable to the sharp decline in oil prices. Economist Blu Putnam of the CME group says those cuts will not be fully apparent in the government's January jobs numbers released today but will become more obvious in the coming months. BLU PUTNAM: I think we will see a little bit of a pullback in the - you know, the oil and gas drilling industry. But I do expect it'll be more than compensated for in other sectors of the economy. YDSTIE: Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, agrees. LIZ ANN SONDERS: We're creating well more jobs on a monthly basis by a long shot than we're losing in oil and gas. YDSTIE: Sonders says most businesses and consumers will benefit from lower oil prices. Last year, average monthly job growth was close to 250,000, more than 10 times the number of energy industry job cuts the Challenger survey counted in January. Surveys of economists do expect the government's report released today will show a bit of a pullback in overall job creation. Estimates are in the 235,000 range, with the unemployment rate ticking down a notch to 5. 5 percent. Today's report will also provide another look at whether sluggish wage growth is picking up. Wages have barely kept up with inflation through much of this recovery. That's kept consumers cautious and held back growth. But Putnam says that's changing. He says the slow progress on wages combined with more hours worked and strong job creation are making a difference. PUTNAM: We're creating jobs at a pace of about 3 million a year. So that's a lot more people getting paid. You put all of those three things together, and total labor income is growing nicely. YDSTIE: Putnam says the positive effect on consumption is clearly visible in the strong auto sales in the last quarter. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

It could go as high as $15. 25 an hour, a big increase from the current California minimum of $9 an hour. And it could happen relatively fast. As NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, a $15 minimum wage is generating excitement and some anxiety. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Los Angeles wouldn't be the first city to pass a $15 minimum wage. San Francisco and Seattle have already done it. But what's different here is the sheer size of the city and the number of working poor. There are an estimated 800,000 people here living below the federal poverty line and more than 500,000 workers earning the minimum wage - more than half-a-million people. One of them is Samuel Homer. SAMUEL HOMER: Yeah, it would make a big difference for me. SIEGLER: Homer is marching at this union-sponsored 15 in 2015 rally you can hear in the background. He's 20, works at Burger King and is putting himself through college. He doesn't have a car, which makes life in LA pretty tough. And some days, he says, he hardly has enough money for bus fare, let alone tuition. HOMER: It's definitely hard - hard to pay a lot of bills, you know, and it's hard for me to get hours while I'm still in school because there's two things I have to focus on, you know, the money that I have to, you know, have to, you know, feed myself and help out with my family, and then there's money that I need for my school. SIEGLER: So the $6 an hour bump that's being talked about in some corners of City Hall could be a big deal for someone like Homer. It would also be a big deal for employers. If the minimum wage were to go up by $6 across the board, we're talking millions of dollars more in costs to be absorbed by businesses. CHRIS PLAYER: We've been here since 1992. Actually, we opened up a week before the LA riots. SIEGLER: And you can imagine people like Chris Player are pretty anxious. PLAYER: We would have to go two routes. We would either have to lay off the paid employees and then it'd just be family-ran, or we would definitely have to increase the price. Player owns this small cafe called C. W. & Chris Fish and Chicken. It's on a worn stretch of Western Avenue in South LA. He's mopping the floors and getting ready for another busy lunch rush. PLAYER: I'm afraid for most businesses around here that actually have to pay a lot of employees - that they would go under. SIEGLER: Bernard Parks represents this neighborhood on the City Council. It has some of the highest crime rates in the city. Unemployment is high as well. His neighborhood isn't getting touched by the booms happening right now in nearby downtown or Hollywood. BERNARD PARKS: We only have 20,000 jobs in my district. Every minimum wage increase that we've seen - if it's too high, it causes unemployment. SIEGLER: Parks supports raising the minimum wage, but he worries the conversation in LA right now is moving too fast. PARKS: If you have a big city like LA doing something, you're going to find a lot of people will fall in line without any thought because they believe that we've done the research. The fact is, we've not done the research. And the harm that we'll do to our business community is unconscionable. SIEGLER: Parks' frustration is rooted in the fact that no city or state has yet looked to raise its minimum wage as fast or as much as what's being talked about here, a potential $6 increase all at once. Economists are split over how big of an impact this will have on businesses, but there's general agreement that LA's next move is going to be watched closely around the country. Chris Tilly directs the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UCLA. CHRIS TILLY: LA is the size of a state. If LA takes this step, that's going to be something that all kinds of government units across the country are going to take note of, even if the federal government remains paralyzed on this issue. SIEGLER: In a lot of ways, Los Angeles does face issues on the same scale that many states do. There are 4 million people inside the city limits, big gaps between the rich and poor, so the repercussions, good or bad, of a policy decision like this could be huge. It's one of the reasons why Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council have now delayed votes on the matter, deciding instead to commission another study. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

S. economy as a sailboat. Positive job growth has been like a pretty steady wind, pushing the economy forward. But there are also some tricky crosswinds out there, unpredictable ones. A big drop in oil prices and a stronger dollar do help the economy along, but in other ways can hurt it, add to that a recent slowdown in global growth. NPR's John Ydstie reports on whether crosswinds are likely to push the U. S. economy forward or knock it off track. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Lots of economists have suggested the big drop in oil prices is a gift to consumers that will propel the economy upward. David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors is one of them. He argues cheaper oil will ultimately be a positive. DAVID KOTOK: The U. S. comes out a big winner on a falling energy price, but it takes time to filter through and into the full economy. YDSTIE: And it starts out as a negative shock to the oil sector. Kotok says cuts in production and energy company payrolls will cost the U. S. economy up to $150 billion. That's made investors nervous. As oil prices fell sharply in January, they sent stock markets gyrating. But as lower energy prices filter through the economy, Kotok says the positive effects worth $400 billion will overwhelm the negative. Economist Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, agrees. LIZ ANN SONDERS: The U. S. economy is 68 percent consumer spending. So right there, you know that falling oil prices is a benefit. YDSTIE: Since it puts money in consumers' pockets. And low energy prices also benefit many businesses whose hiring will more than offset the losses in the energy sector. But Sonders says the oil and gas layoffs are making headlines. SONDERS: The crash in oil prices happened fast and furiously, and now we're getting those series of layoffs. And rig counts are dropping. And now people are concerned, is this going to carry further into the economy? How much of this a function of weak global growth? YDSTIE: And there's good reason to be concerned, says Jeffrey Snider, head of global investment research at Alhambra Partners. JEFFREY SNIDER: Whenever you see oil prices collapsed, especially by something like 60 percent, something else is coming on. So therefore any benefit that might come to consumers in the form of lower energy prices is being overwhelmed by whatever it is that's causing oil to fall in the first place. YDSTIE: And falling oil prices are a clear sign of a dangerously weak global economy, says Snider. SNIDER: You have economies from Europe, Japan, China that are either in or very close to recession or some form of growth that is significantly degraded. YDSTIE: And Snider says recent data suggest U. S. consumers are saving most of the windfall they get from lower energy prices, not spending it to fuel growth. SNIDER: And that's an indication of very cautious behavior. YDSTIE: Cautious behavior that he says suggests underlying problems in the U. S. economy, including slow wage growth. Snider says another crosswind is chilling profits for American exporters and multinationals. That's the strong dollar. Liz Ann Sonders agrees earnings at multinationals are being hit. But she argues a strong dollar signals confidence in the U. S. economy that is historically associated with strong growth. SONDERS: We're not an export-oriented economy. You know, most other countries that want to try to lower the value of their currency is because a bigger part of their economy is export-oriented. So they want that weaker currency to boost exports. YDSTIE: In the U. S. , exports account for just 13 percent of economic activity. Sonders's bottom line is that the U. S. is likely to weather the crosswinds in the global economy and experience solid growth in 2015. David Kotok goes even further. He says the U. S. will show gradual improvement for the rest of the decade. KOTOK: We're going to do it with a stronger currency, little inflation and low interest rates. It's a pretty picture for the United States. YDSTIE: The strong jobs figures on Friday - more than a million jobs created in the past three months - bolster that optimistic view.

As NPR's Joel Rose reports, low oil prices have emboldened state leaders looking to boost revenue to fix crumbling roads and bridges. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Here's a scene that's all too familiar in much of the country - construction workers performing emergency repairs on a bridge. This one is in Franklin Township, N. J. , and it closed abruptly last month when it was deemed unsafe. TOM BRACKEN: It's living proof that what we've been saying is correct, which is of these 600 and some structurally deficient bridges in New Jersey, there are some that right now are very dangerous. ROSE: Tom Bracken is the head of New Jersey's Chamber of Commerce. He also leads a coalition of business groups that's pushing for more spending on transportation infrastructure. BRACKEN: The number-one issue facing the state of New Jersey, and it needs to be resolved. ROSE: Here's New Jersey Transportation Commissioner Jamie Fox talking to a state planning agency last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE FOX: Now is the time. Gas prices are low. The money has run out. The projects are accumulating. ROSE: New Jersey is a bit of an outlier. It has the second-lowest gas tax in the country after Alaska - just 14 and a half cents per gallon. But a lot of states face a similar problem. Gas tax revenues are flat while the cost of everything else is going up. CARL DAVIS: Asphalt costs are higher, machinery costs are higher, construction workers' wages are usually higher, so the revenues that we're chipping in aren't keeping pace with the costs that we have. ROSE: Carl Davis is with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. He says the federal government can just borrow money to fund transportation projects, but states don't have that luxury, so a growing number are turning to gas taxes. Davis says the trend started in states like Maryland and Pennsylvania. Now, Davis says, at least a dozen states are talking about raising gas taxes, including some you might not expect. DAVIS: Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee - these states haven't seen their gas tax rate go up in over a quarter century. Roads and bridges - it's not a politically divisive issue. These are things that need to be maintained if the economy is going to work. ROSE: Take Utah - Republican Governor Gary Herbert says it's time to rethink the state's gas tax. Here he is on C-SPAN last month. (SOUNDBITE OF C-SPAN BROADCAST)GOVERNOR GARY HERBERT: Nobody wants to raise a tax. My gosh, that's the worst thing you can do as a politician. But the practical realities are we've got to do something. ROSE: Herbert isn't the only Republican governor who's reached that conclusion. In South Carolina, Governor Nikki Haley has proposed raising the gas tax, but only if she also gets big cuts to the state's income tax. In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie has said all options are on the table to deal with the state's transportation woes, though it's clear that a gas tax will be a tough sell with voters. PAT JOHNSON: I think it's totally ridiculous. The taxes in this state are high enough the way it is. ROSE: Pat Johnson lives in Blairstown, N. J. Johnson says she goes out of her way to buy gas here because it's so much cheaper than in neighboring states. JOHNSON: Quite often that is coming back to New Jersey on a very low tank of gas and filling up at the last gas station before I get out of New Jersey. ROSE: That's why gas station owners in the Garden State are worried that business will drop if the gas tax goes up. Sonny Rasaq manages a Shell station in Phillipsburg, N. J. , right across the border from Pennsylvania. SONNY RASAQ: Especially on the weekends like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, we get a lot of business from Pennsylvania. I don't think people will come here if the price is the same. ROSE: But some of Rasaq's customers say they might be willing to pay a little bit more for gas. Megan McGuire lives in Stewartsville, N. J. MEGAN MCGUIRE: I guess it depends on how much, really. I would probably do it just 'cause the roads around here suck. ROSE: That's the sentiment a lot of drivers around the country might share, but that doesn't mean they're eager to pay more at the pump. Joel Rose, NPR News.

But the practical realities are we've got to do something. ROSE: Herbert isn't the only Republican governor who's reached that conclusion. In South Carolina, Governor Nikki Haley has proposed raising the gas tax, but only if she also gets big cuts to the state's income tax. In New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie has said all options are on the table to deal with the state's transportation woes, though it's clear that a gas tax will be a tough sell with voters. PAT JOHNSON: I think it's totally ridiculous. The taxes in this state are high enough the way it is. ROSE: Pat Johnson lives in Blairstown, N. J. Johnson says she goes out of her way to buy gas here because it's so much cheaper than in neighboring states. JOHNSON: Quite often that is coming back to New Jersey on a very low tank of gas and filling up at the last gas station before I get out of New Jersey. ROSE: That's why gas station owners in the Garden State are worried that business will drop if the gas tax goes up. Sonny Rasaq manages a Shell station in Phillipsburg, N. J. , right across the border from Pennsylvania. SONNY RASAQ: Especially on the weekends like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, we get a lot of business from Pennsylvania. I don't think people will come here if the price is the same. ROSE: But some of Rasaq's customers say they might be willing to pay a little bit more for gas. Megan McGuire lives in Stewartsville, N. J. MEGAN MCGUIRE: I guess it depends on how much, really. I would probably do it just 'cause the roads around here suck. ROSE: That's the sentiment a lot of drivers around the country might share, but that doesn't mean they're eager to pay more at the pump.

But as Ben Bergman reports from member station KPCC, most people getting raises will probably never be part of organized labor. BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: The idea of a $15 wage first came to the public's attention in a series of fast-food strikes starting in 2012.

They were part of a multimillion-dollar effort organized by unions. But none of those restaurants have unionized, and they probably never will, admits David Rolf, a Service Employees International Union vice president. DAVID ROLF: Since at least the early 1980s, winning unions for the first time in the private sector has been a Herculean task. The political process provides an alternative vehicle. BERGMAN: And an increasingly successful one. It was voters who approved San Francisco's $15 wage in November, and SeaTac, Washington's a year earlier after a campaign led by Rolf. ROLF: We can't be the movement that's just about us. The labor movement that workers flocked to by the tens of millions in the 1930s wasn't known for negotiating 500-page contracts. They were known for fighting for the eight-hour day, fighting to end child labor. BERGMAN: Rolf is controversial among labor leaders because he's not shy about saying collective bargaining as we know it is dead. ROLF: Any model that shrinks for 50 years in a row in all 50 states is probably not part of the future. BERGMAN: In the mid-20th century, about 1 in 3 American workers belonged to a union. Last year, about 1 in 10 did, the lowest number in nearly a century. Still though, Rusty Hicks, the new head of the Los Angeles Federation of Labor, says unions may be on their way out in the rest of the country, but not in LA. Sixteen percent of the area's workers are unionized, a number that has held steady for more than a decade, something that counts as a victory these days. RUSTY HICKS: LA is on the cutting edge of organizing in this country, from the port drivers, to hotel workers and everything in between. BERGMAN: But it might not be in unions' best interest to be leading the $15 fights, says labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein. NELSON LICHTENSTEIN: In effect, what you have now is the SEIU - its hospital memberships say, or its membership working for the department of motor vehicles - their dues money is helping to raise the wages of fast-food workers and not their own wages. BERGMAN: Because unionized workers earn far more than the minimum wage, in LA, an average of more than $27 an hour. Still, Lichtenstein says having a higher floor could be beneficial in future contract negotiations. LICHTENSTEIN: If you can raise the wages in those sectors which have been pulling down the general wage level, i. e. fast food or retail for that matter, then, you know, it makes it easier for unions to create a higher standard and then go on and try to get more stuff. BERGMAN: There's also the fact it's rare now for workers to stay in the same job their whole career, so people are likely to drift in and out of unions. Robert Matsuda is a studio violinist represented by the American Federation of Musicians. He's all for a $15 wage. ROBERT MATSUDA: I might have to take a minimum-wage job in the near future, so it might directly affect me. BERGMAN: Because even though Matsuda works for well above the minimum wage now, he worries that may not last. He's getting fewer gigs as more film and TV scoring work gets outsourced overseas.

It's money they could be using to hire workers and pay dividends in the United States. But they're reluctant to do that, in part because of the way the U. S. tax system works. President Obama proposed some big changes in the tax code last month, changes that would encourage U. S. companies to bring more money home. A lot of people in Washington agree with the goal, but there is sharp disagreement about how to accomplish it. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Last month the European Union issued a report about Amazon and the taxes it pays. The online retailer does a lot of business in Europe, but its corporate tax rate is in the single digits says Crawford Spence of the University of Warwick in England. CRAWFORD SPENCE: Amazon has big operations in the U. K. , but they pay very little tax here because most of their tax is paid in Luxembourg. ZARROLI: And it's not alone. Big U. S. companies such as Starbucks and Apple have pared down their tax bill by funneling revenue into tax havens like Luxembourg and Ireland. Spence says it's totally legal. SPENCE: Currently the rules are very complicated, very convoluted, which suits companies very well because there are always loopholes. ZARROLI: The rules proposed by President Obama last month would change that. The president wants to lower the tax rate on overseas corporate revenue, but a 19 percent minimum tax would kick in if the companies use too many loopholes and tax havens says Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California Law School. EDWARD KLEINBARD: These kinds of games are exactly the reason why you need the minimum tax. The minimum tax is the safeguard against these kinds of abuses. ZARROLI: And the president has proposed something else. Under current law, U. S. companies can make all the money they want overseas and as long as they keep it there, they never pay a dime of U. S. taxes. That gives them a big incentive to keep profits overseas, and companies such as Apple have huge stashes of money sitting offshore. Under the proposal, companies would pay a 14 percent tax on that money regardless of whether they bring it back home. Whether these proposals will go anywhere is unclear. Kleinbard is optimistic. KLEINBARD: The last serious Republican effort from a year ago had exactly the same concepts. The numbers were lower, but that's what good faith negotiations are all about. ZARROLI: In other words, the president's proposals represent the kickoff of a lengthy round of bargaining with Congress. So far, Republican leaders say they're open to negotiating, but Ken Kies of the Federal Policy Group says many business leaders don't like the White House proposals. KEN KIES: A lot of multinationals think they would be put in a worse competitive situation than they are today because at least today they don't pay U. S. tax on that income until they actually bring it back to the United States, whereas the president's proposal would impose an immediate 19 percent tax. ZARROLI: Kies, former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, is skeptical that corporate tax reform can go anywhere in this political climate. KIES: It's hard to do tax reform under the best of circumstances and I wouldn't say these are the best of circumstances. With a president who's in his last two years in office, it's really hard to do really big things. ZARROLI: Kies says a lot of people in the business world want to see tax reform because they're tired of the uncertainties surrounding the issue, but they won't go along with it if they end up paying more.

It is the third partial shutdown in operations at these ports in a week. The closures are the result of a labor dispute between shipping lines and the union that represents 20,000 dockworkers. It's been dragging on for eight months now. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports from the nation's busiest port complex, Los Angeles and Long Beach. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Even before the labor dispute between the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, there was a major congestion crisis brewing at West Coast ports like this one. And the shutdowns this weekend are only making things worse. I've just climbed up to the top of this bluff here overlooking the massive port complex. I can see one, two, three, four, five, six huge container ships just idling. There's at least six more there on the horizon. PHILLIP SANFIELD: If you think about being on a tarmac for a couple of hours at an airport, some of these people have been waiting offshore for weeks to get in. SIEGLER: This is Phillip Sanfield with the Port of Los Angeles. He's standing down on the docks inside the port where things are eerily quiet. In front of us are two massive container ships. It looks like someone abandoned them in a hurry, and the cranes towering above them are just hanging there idle. SANFIELD: We need to get back on schedule, and we're hearing from customers throughout the country and beyond that it is affecting their businesses. So we need to get this cargo moving. SIEGLER: Even a partial shutdown of operations is a big deal here. At the combined ports of LA and Long Beach, about $1 billion in cargo comes through every day, most from Asia - electronics, clothes, toys, car parts. And then there's the export side of things. And one industry especially caught the middle of all this right now is agriculture. California's citrus industry is blaming the port shutdowns and congestion for a 25 percent drop in export business. DUSTY FERENCE: Season to date it's estimated that this has impacted the California citrus industry by a reduction of about $500 million in export sales. SIEGLER: Dusty Ference is director of grower services at the industry trade group California Citrus Mutual. He says all this is coming at a really bad time because this is the industry's peak export season ahead of the Chinese New Year. FERENCE: We're getting reports now that, not including trucking time, these containers are sitting on the docks for 10 days and in some cases longer. SIEGLER: Some industries are now turning to the air to ship freight. Some of Ference's growers are trucking cargo down to the port of Houston, but going a long way through the Panama Canal is expensive and not always practical. So mostly they're just waiting and hoping things get resolved quick. The Pacific Maritime Association's president has warned of an all-out, quote,\" meltdown\" on West Coast ports if the union doesn't accept what he calls its generous contract offer.

S. As Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports, the industry that sustains Oklahoma's economy may be to blame. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Medford, population about 900, is out on the flat, flat prairie of northern Oklahoma. It's the kind of place where people give directions from the four-way stop in the middle of town. It seems pretty sedate, but it's not. DEA MANDEVILL: Yeah, we are shaking all the time, all the time. MORRIS: Dea Mandevill is the city manager here. And she says that the afternoon I stopped by, two earthquakes had already rumbled through Medford. MANDEVILL: Light day (laughter). The day's not over yet. We still have several more hours, so. . . MORRIS: Mandevill may be laughing it off, but Austin Holland, the state seismologist, isn't. AUSTIN HOLLAND: I certainly regret starting smoking again, but there are some days where nicotine and coffee are about what get me through the day. MORRIS: Holland says that Oklahoma used to have, on average, one or two perceptible earthquakes a year. Now they're averaging two or three a day. HOLLAND: As far as we know, this has never happened before. MORRIS: Holland thinks modern oil production techniques are triggering the jump in quakes. A few years back, companies figured out how to drill sideways through layers of shale, and then break, or frack, the rock, releasing a torrent of oil. It sparked a massive boom here, but the technique produces much more water than oil - tens of billions of gallons of very salty, toxic water. The only economical way to dispose of it, Holland says, is to force it deep into the earth. HOLLAND: That pressure acts as a lubricant. It's not actually the water itself lubricating, but the pressure. And the best way to think about that is an air hockey table. MORRIS: That's right, air hockey with huge slabs of rock as the pucks. Holland says injecting water near faults can deliver just enough lubricating pressure to set them in motion. It's called induced seismicity. RYAN LADRA: It was that loud or louder, but it was coming from everywhere. I mean, the walls, the roof. MORRIS: Ryan Ladra is standing at his parents' battered house describing the Prague earthquake. It happened four years ago, a magnitude of 5. 6, the strongest ever recorded in Oklahoma. LADRA: When it hit, it hit so violent and hard that we thought the house was coming down on top of us. MORRIS: The house's stone chimney collapsed, striking Ladra's mom, Sandra, who is suing companies that ran nearby wastewater injection wells. But Kim Hatfield with the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association says he's not convinced there's a connection. He says oil companies have been pumping brine down wastewater injection wells for decades. And more than 3,200 of them dot the state. KIM HATFIELD: You're going to find out that all tornadoes are close to injection wells as well. If a meteor strikes the state of Oklahoma, I'm going to guarantee that it's going to be close to an injection well. MORRIS: Still, evidence linking injection wells to earthquakes is building. And though the oil industry wields enormous clout in Oklahoma, the agency regulating it is ramping up. Matt Skinner with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission admits that the agency's never actually denied a permit for a disposal well. He says it's recently closed a few bad ones and is scrutinizing applications for new ones like never before. MATT SKINNER: When we're saying we're doing everything we can, what we're really saying is we're doing everything we know today. Tomorrow, we may know something more. MORRIS: Back in Medford, Dea Mandevill says she worries about an earthquake rupturing the big natural gas pipeline here. But then she beams, looking out over the new park the little town's just built with oil boom tax money. MANDEVILL: We have a new swimming, splash pad, new sidewalks and a new basketball/tennis court. MORRIS: It illustrates the complex relationship between oil and earthquakes in Oklahoma. MANDEVILL: You put up with a few things falling off your walls, a few nights being woken up in the middle of the night with the shakes. Overall, it's been good. MORRIS: You'd take the earthquakes? MANDEVILL: I'll take the earthquakes for all the benefits that Medford's had so far. MORRIS: But those benefits are starting to sag a little. With oil prices low, companies are laying off workers here. On the bright side, less oil coming out of the ground would mean less wastewater going back deep down into it and, just possibly, fewer earthquakes. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris.

As Frank Morris of member station KCUR reports, the industry that sustains Oklahoma's economy may be to blame. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Medford, population about 900, is out on the flat, flat prairie of northern Oklahoma. It's the kind of place where people give directions from the four-way stop in the middle of town. It seems pretty sedate, but it's not. DEA MANDEVILL: Yeah, we are shaking all the time, all the time. MORRIS: Dea Mandevill is the city manager here. And she says that the afternoon I stopped by, two earthquakes had already rumbled through Medford. MANDEVILL: Light day (laughter). The day's not over yet. We still have several more hours, so. . . MORRIS: Mandevill may be laughing it off, but Austin Holland, the state seismologist, isn't. AUSTIN HOLLAND: I certainly regret starting smoking again, but there are some days where nicotine and coffee are about what get me through the day. MORRIS: Holland says that Oklahoma used to have, on average, one or two perceptible earthquakes a year. Now they're averaging two or three a day. HOLLAND: As far as we know, this has never happened before. MORRIS: Holland thinks modern oil production techniques are triggering the jump in quakes. A few years back, companies figured out how to drill sideways through layers of shale, and then break, or frack, the rock, releasing a torrent of oil. It sparked a massive boom here, but the technique produces much more water than oil - tens of billions of gallons of very salty, toxic water. The only economical way to dispose of it, Holland says, is to force it deep into the earth. HOLLAND: That pressure acts as a lubricant. It's not actually the water itself lubricating, but the pressure. And the best way to think about that is an air hockey table. MORRIS: That's right, air hockey with huge slabs of rock as the pucks. Holland says injecting water near faults can deliver just enough lubricating pressure to set them in motion. It's called induced seismicity. RYAN LADRA: It was that loud or louder, but it was coming from everywhere. I mean, the walls, the roof. MORRIS: Ryan Ladra is standing at his parents' battered house describing the Prague earthquake. It happened four years ago, a magnitude of 5. 6, the strongest ever recorded in Oklahoma. LADRA: When it hit, it hit so violent and hard that we thought the house was coming down on top of us. MORRIS: The house's stone chimney collapsed, striking Ladra's mom, Sandra, who is suing companies that ran nearby wastewater injection wells. But Kim Hatfield with the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association says he's not convinced there's a connection. He says oil companies have been pumping brine down wastewater injection wells for decades. And more than 3,200 of them dot the state. KIM HATFIELD: You're going to find out that all tornadoes are close to injection wells as well. If a meteor strikes the state of Oklahoma, I'm going to guarantee that it's going to be close to an injection well. MORRIS: Still, evidence linking injection wells to earthquakes is building. And though the oil industry wields enormous clout in Oklahoma, the agency regulating it is ramping up. Matt Skinner with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission admits that the agency's never actually denied a permit for a disposal well. He says it's recently closed a few bad ones and is scrutinizing applications for new ones like never before. MATT SKINNER: When we're saying we're doing everything we can, what we're really saying is we're doing everything we know today. Tomorrow, we may know something more. MORRIS: Back in Medford, Dea Mandevill says she worries about an earthquake rupturing the big natural gas pipeline here. But then she beams, looking out over the new park the little town's just built with oil boom tax money. MANDEVILL: We have a new swimming, splash pad, new sidewalks and a new basketball/tennis court. MORRIS: It illustrates the complex relationship between oil and earthquakes in Oklahoma. MANDEVILL: You put up with a few things falling off your walls, a few nights being woken up in the middle of the night with the shakes. Overall, it's been good. MORRIS: You'd take the earthquakes? MANDEVILL: I'll take the earthquakes for all the benefits that Medford's had so far. MORRIS: But those benefits are starting to sag a little. With oil prices low, companies are laying off workers here. On the bright side, less oil coming out of the ground would mean less wastewater going back deep down into it and, just possibly, fewer earthquakes.

S. is that it's gotten a lot worse in recent years. But a report out today challenges that idea. It says wealthy people haven't done nearly as well as most people think. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The great recession exacted a huge toll on people in every income group, and recovering from it has been a long and grueling process. To some economists, the recovery has exacerbated the very real trend toward income inequality in the United States. French economist Thomas Piketty has noted that between 2009 and 2012 incomes grew, but almost all of the growth went to the wealthiest 1 percent. It's a claim that has been repeated often, but Stephen Rose of George Washington University says it needs to be put in perspective. STEPHEN ROSE: Looking at this little spike between 2009 and 2012 and making a big deal of it in my mind is game playing. ZARROLI: Rose says the wealthy did indeed reap most of the income gains between 2009 and 2012, but only if you include capital gains like stock sales. And he says doing that can be misleading. Rose says rich people made a lot of money in the stock market after 2009, but much of that was simply making up lost ground after the even bigger hit they took in 2008. What looks like income growth was simply a bounce back from their earlier losses. ROSE: From 2007 to 2013, average incomes are down by about 10 - 12 percent. But the incomes of the top 1 percent are down by nearly 30 percent. ZARROLI: Rose says something else is often forgotten when talking about the years after the great recession. Working and middle-class people lost income during the period, but some of that was offset by what are called government transfers - food stamps and unemployment compensation, for instance. He says it's clear that some of the policies put in place by the Obama administration, such as the payroll tax cut, actually had a positive impact on people's incomes, and this has often been overlooked when economists such as Piketty calculate how much money people made. Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research says these are valid points. But he says that doesn't mean that income inequality is not a big problem. Baker says since 1980 or so, a significant portion of income growth has gone to people at the very top of the economic ladder. DEAN BAKER: I don't think there's any doubt there's been very small gains to those at the middle, and those at the top have really been disproportionately the beneficiaries of growth. ZARROLI: Rose doesn't deny that inequality is a problem, and he says he isn't trying to make the case that it's getting any better. But he says people on both sides of the political spectrum need to understand what really happened during the recession and in the years that followed. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

It's been seven years since the housing crash and the housing market and the economy are both recovering. But housing advocates say you still have to have a near perfect credit score to get a home loan from a major bank. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: At first look, it seems like the trouble in the housing market's quieted down. There are fewer foreclosures, home prices have stabilized and even risen back up a bit. But, as any parent with young kids will tell you, when things get too quiet that can be a bad sign. Mike Calhoun is the president of the Center for Responsible Lending. He says that's basically what's going on here. MIKE CALHOUN: This has been a quiet disaster. Average families are unable to get home loans. That includes everyone from new households. It includes people who lost their job through the recession and are trying to get back into homeownership now that they're back on their feet and should qualify for mortgages. ARNOLD: And Calhoun says there are a lot of people like that who can't qualify for home loans because of overly tight lending standards. CALHOUN: That is pushing more than a million people a year out of being able to get a home loan. ARNOLD: One measuring stick that Calhoun's using here is a person's credit score. He says most home loans getting made by banks and other lenders are routed through the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They're a key gateway that loans have to pass through to get approved and guaranteed. And Calhoun says the average credit score for borrowers getting those loans is now around 750. CALHOUN: To put that in perspective, the average American household has a credit score of under 700. ARNOLD: Calhoun says back before the housing bubble in just normal, regular old times, the average credit score for people getting home loans was around 700 and so many average Americans could qualify. So why do people need credit scores that are so much higher today? To find out we sat down with Mel Watt. He's the director of the regulatory agency overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. MEL WATT: Well, I think it is preventing people from getting into home ownership, but it is not a function of Fannie and Freddie's credit box being too narrow. It's the function of lenders being unwilling to lend. ARNOLD: Mel Watt is saying that the loan requirements imposed by Fannie and Freddie are not overly restrictive. Some housing advocates would like to see them loosened up a bit more. Conservative watchdogs say no. They say we went too far promoting homeownership in the past. Mel Watt says he's striving to strike the right balance there. But in any case, he says at this point the real bottleneck is with the banks. WATT: The challenge is to get lenders to make loans. ARNOLD: Mike Calhoun says J. P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America in particular have pulled back sharply on mortgage lending. Both banks declined interviews. And both have also been hit with multibillion-dollar settlements over loans that went bad. David Stevens is the CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. He says in recent years some banks have been lending more, but. . . DAVID STEVENS: The larger banks paid an extraordinary amount of money in settlements and fines and those that dealt with the most amount of punitive response have greater trepidation. They're trying to make certain that that never happens again. ARNOLD: Mel Watt for his part says the banks don't need to be so nervous.

On the front lines are oil services companies that do everything from drilling to providing electrical power at well sites. NPR's John Ydstie reports hundreds of thousands of jobs are threatened as companies try to adjust. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: In a packed auditorium in Houston, Gary Evans, who runs the oil and gas company Magnum Hunter Resources, has a tough message for the people who provide critical services to companies like his. GARY EVANS: We've got to lower our cost. YDSTIE: And he says that means the services they provide - everything from fracking to trucking - are going on sale, big-time. When there's a big sale coming at Neiman Marcus, he says, you don't spend your money until the sale prices appear. And right now he's waiting for the deep discounts in oil services before he spends any more money. EVANS: No drilling, no completion, no fracking, no nothing; cut it completely off January 1. We tell our vendors when you're ready to do it at 40 percent below what you were charging me in December we'll go back to work. YDSTIE: The room is silent, absorbing the prospect of a 40 percent cut in income. EVANS: I hate to say that to a lot of my service company friends, but that's the reality. We've had over a 50 percent drop in commodity prices, so we've got to have a bigger drop in service costs. YDSTIE: Out in the hallway after Evans's bombshell, Ken Sapien says his engineering firm, RRC, which provides things like seismic survey and electrical grid designs for drilling sites, is feeling the squeeze. KEN SAPIEN: Yes, we've been approached by a few of our clients asking us to drop our prices. YDSTIE: And Sapien says the firm doesn't have much choice if it wants to hang on to business. SAPIEN: If you don't take the cut there's somebody out there that's going to work for that price. So, like I said, for us it's more about the relationship. I mean, money is important, don't get me wrong, but it means more to continue to have those guys as our clients. YDSTIE: Earlier this month, Halliburton, a giant in the oil services business, said it is laying off 6,400 workers. Before that, Baker Hughes, which is merging with Halliburton, announced it's slashing about 7,000 jobs. And another giant - Schlumberger - is cutting 9,000 jobs. More than 100,000 layoffs have been announced worldwide so far. Clint Walker is general manager of CUDD Energy Services, a medium-sized player in the oil fields that provides services including fracking, water management and well control. CLINT WALKER: There's a tremendous amount of people that are being laid off in the industry and the thing about these jobs - they're good-paying jobs. Most of these jobs are in, you know, $80,000 to $120,000 range. YDSTIE: Walker says what his firm provides to oil companies is knowledge, sophisticated equipment, reliability and safety. He says that becomes a challenge if your income is cut 40 percent. WALKER: You know, you just have to get through it and create enough cash flow in order to maintain that equipment because the last thing you want to do is put a piece of equipment that's not reliable and - God forbid - get anybody hurt out there. YDSTIE: As Walker suggests, the deep cost-cutting could increase the risk of accidents and injured workers. It could also increase the risk of accidents that damage the environment. That's an unwelcome prospect for an industry already under scrutiny because of its use of controversial hydraulic fracturing, not to mention incidents like the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Walker says the industry can only hope for a quick turnaround in prices. But another big increase in oil inventories was announced today, and that sent prices lower once again. John Ydstie, NPR News.

Exactly when that will happen is still a question. On Capitol Hill today, Fed Chair Janet Yellen didn't give too much away, but she did offer a bit of guidance. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Yellen was testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, giving her twice-yearly report to Congress on the U. S. economy and Fed policy. And the Fed's interest rate question loomed over everything. The Fed's benchmark rate has been near zero for more than six years as the Fed has tried to boost the economy and create jobs. And Yellen began her remarks by saying the job market is improving on many dimensions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: In short, considerable progress has been achieved in the recovery of the labor market. The room for further improvement remains. YDSTIE: And as long as there is room for improvement, most Fed officials would like to hold off raising rates. During their past two meetings, Fed policymakers have said they will remain patient. And Yellen said that word signals that rates won't be raised until after a couple more meetings. She reiterated that today which suggests the first rate hike is unlikely to happen before June. But Yellen indicated the time for a rate hike is getting closer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: If economic conditions continue to improve as the committee anticipates, the committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. YDSTIE: But before that moment, Yellen said the Fed will remove the word patience from its official statement. The deliberate Fed march toward a rate hike got different responses from members of the committee. Democrats generally reacted like Senator Charles Schumer of New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SENATOR CHARLES SCHUMER: Let me urge you to act with caution before raising rates. While there may be data points, positive signs of economic growth, let me be clear - I believe the Fed should remain committed to its current accommodative policy until it sees clear evidence that shows a consistent improvement in wages. YDSTIE: Yellen agreed she too would like to see improvement in wage growth before raising rates. But some Republicans expressed other concerns. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Let me share a completely opposing point of view from that of the senator from New York, which will not be a shock. YDSTIE: This is Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOOMEY: The financial and economic crisis is over. It's been over for years, at least six or seven years. And yet, we still maintain crisis-level interest rates. YDSTIE: And, Toomey said, those low Fed rates mean rock-bottom returns for retirees who have savings in CDs, bank accounts and money market funds. He said keeping rates low also risks future inflation and financial stability. Yellen acknowledged those are the risks of waiting too long to raise rates. But she pointed out that right now inflation is below the Fed's 2 percent target and falling, largely because oil prices have plunged. And, Yellen said, raising rates too soon also carries risks. YELLEN: We would risk undermining a recovery that is really just taking hold. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YDSTIE: Yellen said the Fed continues to balance those risks as it looks for the right moment to begin raising rates. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

YDSTIE: And as long as there is room for improvement, most Fed officials would like to hold off raising rates. During their past two meetings, Fed policymakers have said they will remain patient. And Yellen said that word signals that rates won't be raised until after a couple more meetings. She reiterated that today which suggests the first rate hike is unlikely to happen before June. But Yellen indicated the time for a rate hike is getting closer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YELLEN: If economic conditions continue to improve as the committee anticipates, the committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis. YDSTIE: But before that moment, Yellen said the Fed will remove the word patience from its official statement. The deliberate Fed march toward a rate hike got different responses from members of the committee. Democrats generally reacted like Senator Charles Schumer of New York. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SENATOR CHARLES SCHUMER: Let me urge you to act with caution before raising rates. While there may be data points, positive signs of economic growth, let me be clear - I believe the Fed should remain committed to its current accommodative policy until it sees clear evidence that shows a consistent improvement in wages. YDSTIE: Yellen agreed she too would like to see improvement in wage growth before raising rates. But some Republicans expressed other concerns. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Let me share a completely opposing point of view from that of the senator from New York, which will not be a shock. YDSTIE: This is Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOOMEY: The financial and economic crisis is over. It's been over for years, at least six or seven years. And yet, we still maintain crisis-level interest rates. YDSTIE: And, Toomey said, those low Fed rates mean rock-bottom returns for retirees who have savings in CDs, bank accounts and money market funds. He said keeping rates low also risks future inflation and financial stability. Yellen acknowledged those are the risks of waiting too long to raise rates. But she pointed out that right now inflation is below the Fed's 2 percent target and falling, largely because oil prices have plunged. And, Yellen said, raising rates too soon also carries risks. YELLEN: We would risk undermining a recovery that is really just taking hold. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) YDSTIE: Yellen said the Fed continues to balance those risks as it looks for the right moment to begin raising rates.

ROY WILLIAMS: Over the last five years, the stars really aligned. The community's investment in itself just blossomed. The energy industry blossomed. MORRIS: The midsized oil companies based here hit big in the domestic fracking boom. They uncorked a torrent of oil, flooding Oklahoma City with money and attracting new residents.

That doesn't happen in downtown Oklahoma City, though. There's no drilling rigs in downtown Oklahoma City. MORRIS: I'm standing right now next to a row of oil drilling rigs. These are big trucks that look a little bit like ladder trucks from a fire department parked in a row, idle because the companies laid off all the people who used to run them. DANNY MORGAN: When you see a rig like that sitting in the yard, that just means that there's no longer demand to keep it in the field, and there's just not enough work out there for you. MORRIS: Danny Morgan, who runs Morgan Well Services in Prague, Okla. , says these rigs had been running 24/7, with 40 or 50 people working on each one. But all that new oil helped create a glut. Now Oklahoma wells cost more to put in than they're worth, and companies are cutting deep.

MORRIS: Steve Agee is the dean of the business school, Oklahoma City University, and former oil company executive. He says he's seen this kind of thing before. AGEE: I started in the business on July 6, 1982, one day after the Penn Square Bank failed here in Oklahoma City. MORRIS: Talk about kicking over a string of dominoes. Penn Square was the first of hundreds of oil-related bank failures in the 1980s, when an oil glut caused a sharp drop in prices. AGEE: The severity of the drop in prices reminds me of the '80s, but the situation is completely different. FRED RUSSELL: We're not cowboys, Indians and oil barons anymore. MORRIS: Fred Russell, financial adviser in Tulsa, says Oklahoma found new ways to make money - biotech, aviation, business services. RUSSELL: The pain of the last busts has led to an involuntary diversification of our economy. MORRIS: Banks have evolved, too. Dan Ellinor, chief operating officer of Bank of Oklahoma, says regulations are stricter, lending practices tighter. Energy companies do hold 20 percent of the money his bank has out on loan. That's a high percentage, and those companies are losing money fast, but Ellinor says he's not fretting yet. DAN ELLINOR: No. We've been here before, so not nervous right now - not at all.

Half of them could be built in the small community of Grays Harbor, which is about 50 miles north of the mouth of the Columbia River. And it's from there that Ashley Ahearn of member station KUOW reports. AL CARTER: This is the industrial route. ASHLEY AHEARN, BYLINE: Al Carter's lived in Grays Harbor pretty much his whole life. He served as a county commissioner for eight years. He's pro-development and pro-business. When he was in office he called himself an infrastructure guy. CARTER: Sewer, water, roads - that was my three mantra things that I used to say all the time. Those are infrastructure things in a community that makes a community grow. And with those things, if you build those things then people will come to those places. AHEARN: Carter wants to see more businesses set up shop in Grays Harbor. This county has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state. He's not against oil coming through his community. For him, it's an issue of balance and scale. Three oil terminals are proposed to be built in Grays Harbor. At maximum capacity, more than 700 ships and barges would come in and out each year. Eight or more trains would roll through town each day, delivering oil to those ships. Carter says that's too much. CARTER: For me, the biggest thing is I don't think any one thing should dominate the whole landscape. That much oil - all we're going to be is an oil terminal. Nothing else is going to come here. Nobody else is going to want to come here. There won't be any room for anything else. AHEARN: In the short-term, constructing the terminals would create hundreds of jobs. Longer-term, according to research from the oil companies, the terminals would lead to about 150 jobs. Paul Queary is a spokesperson for Westway Terminals and Imperium Renewables, two of the three companies that want to build here. The oil companies say they are committed to the highest levels of public safety and environmental protection. PAUL QUEARY: They will help support the existing refinery jobs elsewhere in Washington, and they will bring domestically produced oil to U. S. refineries and help increase U. S. energy independence. AHEARN: Environmentalists say the terminals proposed for the Northwest aren't just being built to move oil to U. S. refineries. They could also export crude from the Canadian oil sands. Right now, it's illegal to export U. S. crude. Oil prices have been dropping, but industry experts say that more infrastructure - like pipelines, railroads, and terminals - are still needed to catch up with the North American oil boom. TOM KLOZA: The Northwest is the most likely market for Bakken crude or North Dakota crude to go to. AHEARN: Tom Kloza is an energy analyst for Oil Price Information Service. He says that as the Northwest gets less oil from Alaska, refineries here need to make up the difference with North Dakota crude. KLOZA: Whether it's the most hospitable is going to depend on the way the local communities and regulators look at the environmental consequences. AHEARN: Members of the Quinault Indian Nation unload hundreds of pounds of freshly caught Dungeness crab at their docks at the mouth of Grays Harbor. Roughly one-fifth of the tribe makes their living fishing and crabbing. They're worried about what an oil train derailment or a ship accident could do to their way of life. Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault, stands nearby. She sees the oil terminals as a symptom of a much bigger problem that threatens her people - climate change. She says the Quinault aren't anti-jobs. FAWN SHARP: We're simply anti making shortsighted, narrow decisions. AHEARN: Last year, the ocean flooded into the Quinault's tribal village, forcing a state of emergency. The glacier that used to feed the Quinault River is gone. SHARP: We're about - let's look at the science, let's look at the history and culture of the impacts, and make a good public policy decision. AHEARN: The Quinault have joined with local fishing industry groups and environmentalists in opposition to the Grays Harbor oil terminals.

One of the largest subprime auto lenders, Wells Fargo, is now putting a cap on those loans. The bank worries that the growth in these loans is getting risky. But for the most part, other banks believe these borrowers are highly motivated to meet their obligations, as NPR's Sonari Glinton reports. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: As consumers, we have choices - tons of choices - not just what to buy, but how to pay for it and when. For example, here in Southern California, where it's warm, you might forget to pay the gas bill every now and then. But we love TV in LA, so you might pay the cable bill early. MELINDA ZABRITSKI: Yeah, absolutely. We refer to that as payment hierarchy. GLINTON: Melinda Zabritski knows a bunch about payment hierarchies. She's director of automotive credit for Experian, the giant credit ratings agency. ZABRITSKI: Several years ago, most people thought that, you know, the mortgage was the very first thing that got paid. And then subsequent other debt obligations like cars and credit cards, you know, gas bill, et cetera. GLINTON: Zabritski says that several years ago, people in the credit world saw consumers change those payment hierarchies. ZABRITSKI: They really began to pay their auto loan first. And it makes sense, especially, you need that car to get to work and you need that job to pay everything else. So with that, we see that delinquency on car loans remains pretty low, and low especially in comparison to other types of debt. GLINTON: Consumers understand that while it can take years to foreclose on your house, you don't have to miss that many payments before the repo man shows up. Now, while consumers have changed, it took a while for the industry to catch up, as Karl Brauer from Kelley Blue Book says. KARL BRAUER: We definitely, you know, whipsawed back and forth from having too much credit to not having hardly any credit after the explosion of the economy, largely due to bad credit being given to too many people. And we're easing back to having fairly easy credit on the car side. GLINTON: That easy credit, along with a lot of pent-up demand, has helped to boost car sales, especially in recent months. With interest rates being low, investors are looking for places to get returns. Now, investors like subprime car loans because they have high interest rates and low default rates. Brauer says there's a but, though. BRAUER: I think it can lead to a little too much exuberance some time or a little too much competition for that money. And then it becomes, you know, well, who's willing to give away the most credit or willing to cut their standards for loans the furthest? And that's where you can get in trouble. GLINTON: Consumers are starting to get loans with longer and longer terms, as long as seven years. Though subprime loans in the car business make up about 20 percent of car loans, which is up from 10 percent during the recession. Question is, is it time now to worry? THOMAS LIBBY: My name is Thomas Libby, and I'm an automotive analyst with IHS Automotive. GLINTON: Libby has an answer. LIBBY: I think maybe this isn't emphasized enough. Times now are actually terrific. GLINTON: Problem is, Libby says, things won't always be this way. LIBBY: This is almost as good as it's ever been. So in a couple of years when it levels out, it will not be in a growth phase. So there'll be even more pressure and then - then there will be more of a possibility of a higher mix of questionable loans with more underwater situation then.

For years, even at the depths of the Great Recession, this city of nearly 300,000 ranked at the top of the nation for its high number of people working. And on a recent visit, NPR's David Schaper found Lincoln working hard at keeping and drawing talent. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Lincoln, Neb. , is not an economic utopia, but it might be close. It never really had the housing boom, so there was no bust. The agricultural economy remains strong, boosting the entire Great Plains region, and. . . ERIC THOMPSON: Compared to most parts of the region, Lincoln has done even a little bit better. SCHAPER: That's economist Eric Thompson, director of the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska. He notes that Lincoln is home to that major university and the state capital. And there are a lot of jobs related to those community anchors. THOMPSON: However, Lincoln's economy is still primarily a private sector economy. There's a significant manufacturing presence in the city, and also a large service sector. SCHAPER: That includes insurance, finance, health care and one of the biggest employers in Lincoln is the railroad, BNSF. And Thompson says what gives Lincoln an extra edge is its workforce. The city ranks high in educational attainment, as a large share of the population has graduated high school and attended college. And he says there's a very strong work ethic. THOMPSON: I like to sum that up by saying people in Lincoln have very good resumes. Their education looks solid. They have a very strong work history. And people with those characteristics just tend to have lower unemployment rates. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Remember folks, this is a great place to live and work. Let's make sure we go do great work. Have a great day. (APPLAUSE)SCHAPER: Across town, the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce recently celebrated the city's economic success, but business leaders here are concerned about one problem. There's a labor shortage. Nick Cusick is owner and CEO of Bison Incorporated, a company that manufactures sporting equipment. NICK CUSICK: Certainly, as an employer who hires a lot of employees at all levels, all kinds of skill levels, but particularly in the trades - welders and machinists and those kind of people - it does make it difficult to find workers. SCHAPER: And as a manufacturer with growing needs, Cusick says he could take his business elsewhere. CUSICK: We have plenty of opportunities. We have plenty of people knocking on our doors, wanting us to move somewhere else. The tradeoff between the quality of the workers and the quantity of workers is the thing that will always keep me in Lincoln. I like the culture of Lincoln. I like the hardworking employees that we have. I just think Lincoln is the place we will always be. SCHAPER: So to boost training in the manufacturing trades, Lincoln's public high schools and community college are developing a career academy. The greater challenge, says Mayor Chris Beutler, is making Lincoln a place where young people want to grow up and stay. MAYOR CHRIS BEUTLER: Our children are going to other places. We had the wealth of intellectual knowledge. We had well-educated young people. And instead of using that to build our own community, we were letting that resource go to other places. SCHAPER: On a walking tour of an area called the Haymarket, Beutler says Lincoln has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in revitalizing its downtown, to create a more culturally vibrant urban center. BEUTLER: This is our old warehouse district. SCHAPER: Beutler points to old brick warehouse buildings that are being developed into loft-style offices and apartments along with new bars, restaurants and hotels. It's a public-private partnership that has renovated some older properties while building some new ones, including a 15,000-seat arena that anchors a new entertainment district. If I had been here five years ago, 10 years ago, what would I be seeing here? BEUTLER: (Laughter) This very place where we're walking, down Canopy Street, you would be walking on oily gravel and rock because this was the old railroad yard. SCHAPER: And how many people lived in this neighborhood a decade ago? BEUTLER: None. SCHAPER: Now hundreds live there and more are coming. The stable job market and newer opportunities in a surprisingly strong high-tech sector are also bringing some people from New York, San Francisco and the Silicon Valley into what some are calling Lincoln, Neb. 's, Silicon Prairie. David Schaper, NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  And here's something Lincoln, Neb. , is proud of - it has one of the lowest jobless numbers in the country. For years, even at the depths of the Great Recession, this city of nearly 300,000 ranked at the top of the nation for its high number of people working. And on a recent visit, NPR's David Schaper found Lincoln working hard at keeping and drawing talent. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Lincoln, Neb. , is not an economic utopia, but it might be close. It never really had the housing boom, so there was no bust. The agricultural economy remains strong, boosting the entire Great Plains region, and. . . ERIC THOMPSON: Compared to most parts of the region, Lincoln has done even a little bit better. SCHAPER: That's economist Eric Thompson, director of the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska. He notes that Lincoln is home to that major university and the state capital. And there are a lot of jobs related to those community anchors. THOMPSON: However, Lincoln's economy is still primarily a private sector economy. There's a significant manufacturing presence in the city, and also a large service sector. SCHAPER: That includes insurance, finance, health care and one of the biggest employers in Lincoln is the railroad, BNSF. And Thompson says what gives Lincoln an extra edge is its workforce. The city ranks high in educational attainment, as a large share of the population has graduated high school and attended college. And he says there's a very strong work ethic. THOMPSON: I like to sum that up by saying people in Lincoln have very good resumes. Their education looks solid. They have a very strong work history. And people with those characteristics just tend to have lower unemployment rates. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Remember folks, this is a great place to live and work. Let's make sure we go do great work. Have a great day. (APPLAUSE) SCHAPER: Across town, the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce recently celebrated the city's economic success, but business leaders here are concerned about one problem. There's a labor shortage. Nick Cusick is owner and CEO of Bison Incorporated, a company that manufactures sporting equipment.

And those prisons require tens of thousands of corrections officers. Many states are facing major staffing shortages, partly because the economic recovery offers other, possibly better jobs.

MILES BRYAN, BYLINE: That jangling is the sound of cadets at Wyoming's Department of Corrections Training Academy practicing how to handcuff prisoners. UNIDENTIFIED CADET #1: I'm going get this all backwards, aren't I? UNIDENTIFIED CADET #2: Make sure you don't do it too tight, OK? BRYAN: Wyoming is currently 20 percent short of its correctional staff, and states like Michigan, Kansas and Texas face similar shortfalls. New recruit Carlos Galan says he ended up joining Wyoming Corrections by chance after his job as a food service manager dried up. CARLOS GALAN: I was out of a job. I had to get out of my comfort zone. BRYAN: Now, Galan says he has always wanted to work in law enforcement. He grew up in Southern California. And in the backseat during his parents' commute. . . GALAN: You saw the Highway Patrol Training Academy there, so that sparked my interest in getting into law enforcement. BRYAN: Did you ever think, like, man, I want to be a corrections officer at a prison? GALAN: It never crossed my mind. BRYAN: That's not what recruiters hope to hear. Lieutenant Aaron Blair is an instructor at the academy and a former corrections officer. He says most of the cadets he gets see the job as a stepping stone to a police or sheriff's department - or as just a job, not as a career. LIEUTENANT AARON BLAIR: You know, law enforcement on the street, they get far more interaction with the good part of society, where we know going in those gates every day we're dealing with convicted felons. It can wear on a person, become very dark. BRYAN: Blair says corrections officers do far more than babysit inmates. Cadets here will learn a conversation technique called verbal judo, along with restraint training. But he says when recruits picture the job, they still see the infamous prison guard villain from the movie \"Cool Hand Luke. \"BLAIR: The guy with the sunglasses, holding the shotgun - a knuckle-dragger, I guess. BRYAN: Blair and prison officials in other states say raises would help make corrections more competitive. Nationwide, the average starting wage is about 15 bucks an hour. Some states are offering recruitment and retention bonuses. But for now, every shift has to be covered. That's meant officers are working a lot of overtime. In states like Kansas and Oklahoma, overtime is mandatory. Leann Bertsch with the Association of State Correctional Administrators says that's a problem. LEANN BERTSCH: They're not meant to not have days off. They're not meant to work extraordinarily long shifts. That creates dangerous situations. BRYAN: Oklahoma, for example, has a correctional officer shortage of about 33 percent and the highest inmate homicide rate in the country. Bertsch's group has fought for more funding for corrections, but she says legislators often prioritize law enforcement that's closer to home. BERTSCH: They're working behind the walls, behind the fences, and oftentimes the policymakers who are setting the compensation for correctional officers don't appreciate the difficult nature of their jobs. DAVID ATHI: We need to look at this as a public-safety position every bit as much as police officers and firefighters. BRYAN: David Fathi is the president of the ACLU's Prison Project. He says high vacancy and turnover rates do often correlate to more violent incidents. But, he says, safety isn't all that's lost. FATHI: They feed the prisoners, take them to the medical clinic, take them to the recreation yard. So if you don't have enough officers, every aspect of prison operation breaks down.

Prices are down dramatically for all sorts of commodities, from metals like lead and copper to crops like corn and wheat. This week, NPR is taking a closer look at the impact of those plunging prices. To begin our coverage, Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider reports on how his city's economy is changing in the wake of oil's dramatic drop. ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: The price of gasoline has ticked up in recent weeks as refineries do seasonal maintenance. But regular unleaded here still costs about a dollar less than it did a year ago. That's good for consumers, who have more money to spend. In Houston, though, the paychecks on which many of those consumers depend come one way or another from the oil business. The world's three biggest oilfield service firms, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, have announced a combined 22,000 layoffs in recent months. Those job cuts are worldwide. But many are falling here, where all three have headquarters. Robert Harrold was recently let go by Halliburton's IT department. ROBERT HARROLD: My manager's manager came by and told me I was needed in a meeting - and locked my computer up and went over next door to HR. And they said, you're being laid off - just like that. SCHNEIDER: This was actually Harrold's second time being laid off by Halliburton in the past 10 years. He says he may turn to security consulting to pay the bills. HARROLD: The oil services company layoffs don't just affect the folks working out in the oil fields. SCHNEIDER: According to a model prepared by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, a drop of about 50 percent in oil prices is associated with a 1. 2 percent drop in Texas employment. If the model proves correct, Texas stands to lose about 140,000 jobs. Jesse Thompson is a business economist at the Dallas Fed's Houston branch. JESSE THOMPSON: So this would be mining jobs, finance, real estate, legal. This would encompass the entire spectrum of employment impact as a result of the price declines. SCHNEIDER: Even with those layoffs, Thompson says Texas is still poised to eke out a modest gain in jobs this year. Houston will fare worse than the state on average, but it won't do as badly as areas closer to the actual drilling in South and West Texas. THOMPSON: We have a lot of construction activity going on as a result of the shale gas production boom in the downstream side and the refining petrochemicals that are going to sort of buttress us against these declines in mining employment. SCHNEIDER: Cheap oil is a boon to refineries. Petrochemical plants rely on natural gas - also cheap - to make their products. All that may be why workers at five nearby facilities were willing to strike and demonstrate downtown when negotiations for a new contract broke down. The strike is now in its fifth week. (SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTOR: What do we want? UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTORS: Fair contract. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTOR: When do we want it? UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTORS: Now. SCHNEIDER: Still, the pain is already spreading across the region's economy. Office construction is on track to decline. Residential construction is expected to follow suit. At a recent meeting of the Houston Apartment Association, developers expressed fear that the region is already overbuilt. Kirk Tate is with Allied-Orion Group. KIRK TATE: They're looking at the number of apartments that are under construction right now that are going to be delivered in the next 12 to 18 months. And they're looking at job growth being reduced 'cause the price of oil. SCHNEIDER: Houston is no stranger to oil downturns. The price collapse of the 1980s scarred the local economy for years. The mantra throughout the latest boom is that the region has learned its lesson. It's diversified. It's better positioned to withstand another bust. That's about to be put to the test.

For almost the last 20 years, she's called this working-class part of town her home. GARCIA: My neighborhood is my family. WILSON: But she's concerned about how her neighborhood could change if the nation's largest oil-by-rail terminal gets built at the Port of Vancouver in Southwest Washington. Many of the homes in the neighborhood, along with an elementary school, are less than a mile from where trains filled with crude oil would unload at the port. Right now, about three oil trains pass through the region every day. If the oil terminal gets built, that would more than double. GARCIA: If there were any type of incident - explosion, over-release of chemicals, spill, earthquake - anything that will cause a safety issue - we're not entirely convinced that our neighborhood will be safe from that.

WILSON: Cain's the developer behind the swanky 32 acre, $1. 5 billion mixed-use project right on the Columbia River. CAIN: We've got a half-mile long park and we'll have great restaurants. It'll be just a beautiful environment. WILSON: An environment Cain hopes does not include the nation's largest oil-by-rail terminal.

It's a joint venture by Tesoro Corporation, an oil company, and Savage Companies, which specializes in supply chain management. Larrabee says the proposed oil terminal will create more than 300 construction jobs in the short term and about 200 additional jobs once it's up and running. LARRABEE: This is a facility designed from the ground up specifically to handle this and specifically for this type of operation. So what that means is we can design all the state-of-the-art safety features in right from the get-go.

It is David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. We're going to talk about tomorrow's jobs report from the Labor Department, the most closely watched monthly snapshot of the U. S. economy. Hi, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning. GREENE: So I guess we're going to get this feel for the economy and its health tomorrow. How is the economy doing right now? WESSEL: Well, the U. S. economy is doing better finally. We've added 3. 2 million jobs in the past year. Economists expect the Labor Department tomorrow will report that another quarter million jobs were ended in February. The official unemployment rate was last reported at 5. 7 percent. That's quite a contrast to the 8 percent we saw two years ago. Other measures of the job market are improving, too. The Fed does this regional economic conditions report and they found businesses pretty upbeat about prospects for this year - more people working, more paychecks, falling gasoline prices, more money to spend. A lot of people are eating out more often, the data show, others are paying down debt. So although the report may be tempered by the bad winter weather, it will be an important gauge of, just how much momentum has the economy been gaining? GREENE: Which makes me want to ask you, and, I mean, I feel like a broken record because we ask you this all the time, there's been this talk of the Federal Reserve and when it might raise interest rates with this momentum that seems to be building. I mean, what is the Fed looking for tomorrow that might cause them to finally make that decision? WESSEL: Well, we are really living through an extraordinary chapter in economic history. The Fed has been holding interest rates near zero for more than six years. And now it's sending a very loud signal, as you suggest, that it expects to raise rates in the not-too-distant future, although it has been very imprecise about what that means. GREENE: Right. WESSEL: Many in the markets are guessing June, more likely in September. But if you listen to the Fed, they say they're data dependent. And that means they'll be scrutinizing tomorrow's report very closely, both to see whether the improving job market is pulling some people off the sidelines, where they've been for many months, or whether more part-time workers have been able to get full-time jobs if they want them and especially whether the pace of wage increases is finally picking up. GREENE: You say finally because wages have been a real area of concern even as the economy has been looking better. I mean, the economy's improving, employers are hiring. Why haven't wages been going up faster? WESSEL: David, that's a very big question now and one that the Fed, along with many workers of course, is focused on. The review of regional economic conditions that the Fed does that I mentioned a moment ago - they call it the Beige Book - found scattered reports of wage increases particularly for people with computer or technical skills, but otherwise very little evidence of a pickup in wages. Before adjusting for inflation, average hourly earnings are up only about 2. 1 percent from a year ago. That's not very much. And so some Fed officials are arguing that they ought to hold off any rate increases until they see more evidence that the job market has tightened enough to force employers to pay more, so inflation gets a little closer to their targets. But other Fed officials are getting itchy. And they say when unemployment's so low, wages are bound to take off, and they want to raise rates before that really happens. GREENE: And just in a few seconds, David, I mean, aside from wages, other areas of concern that sort of make this picture not as great as it might be? WESSEL: Well, the main worry is the rest of the world. It's really in lousy shape. And so the combination of weak demand from overseas customers with the rising foreign exchange value of the U. S. dollar, which makes our exports more expensive, is beginning to hurt U. S. manufacturers and their exports. And so that's something to watch very closely because that could ruin what's otherwise a pretty promising story. GREENE: All right, David. Thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome. GREENE: David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal.

We learned today that employers added nearly 300,000 jobs to payrolls in February. The unemployment rate fell to 5. 5 percent. It's another in a long string of positive reports. Jason Furman is chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. JASON FURMAN: When you see month after month after month like what we've seen lately, it's hard to control your excitement. BLOCK: But for all that excitement, there's little evidence that the steady hiring is leading to increases in wages, and many people remain under-employed. That's the part of the economy we're going to focus on now. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports there are more 6. 5 million people working part-time who'd like to have more hours. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Randa Jama pushes airline passengers on wheelchairs to their gates at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. This had been a full-time job when she took it last fall, but then a couple of months later that changed. RANDA JAMA: They told me that you're working only Saturday and Sunday from now. NOGUCHI: That cut her hours to 12 a week. Sometimes her supervisors ask her at the last minute to stay late or do an extra shift. But since she cut back on babysitters, she can't accommodate. JAMA: I let them go because they can't just wait for me to get full time. Now that I want to work full time, you know, I can't because obviously I changed everything. NOGUCHI: Higher wages are just one issue workers like Jama care about. They say getting enough hours and a predictable schedule are equally important in order to enable them to find additional work or deal with the other obligations in their lives. Aditi Sen is a researcher from the Center for Popular Democracy, a worker advocacy group. ADITI SEN: Nowadays, you have to say you have open availability and that you're free to work whenever. NOGUCHI: But pledging open availability limits a worker's ability to plan or get other work. So far, the law has little to say when it comes to scheduling. Some states, including Minnesota, Connecticut, Maryland and Massachusetts, are considering legislation that would require several weeks' advance notice of schedule changes and institute minimum time off between shifts. Shannon Henderson says she needs more control over her constantly shifting work schedule. The single mom of two says she asks for more than the 33 hours a week she typically gets working at the Wal-Mart in Sacramento. But that's also stressful. SHANNON HENDERSON: In order to get hours, you have to have open availability. For instance, last week I worked all late shifts, which was 2 to 11. And then this week I had all early shifts, which was 6:30 to 2. NOGUCHI: Wal-Mart last month promised to raise its base wage and give workers more control over their schedules. Henderson worries the store won't give her more control without cutting back on her hours. She looks for more steady work when she can. HENDERSON: I do look, but the thing is, with the scheduling being all over the place, it makes it hard for me to actually set time to go look. NEIL TRAUTWEIN: Unquestionably, those are some difficult hours. NOGUCHI: Neil Trautwein is vice president with the National Retail Federation. He says retailers are balancing the consumer demand for 24-7 service with employees' scheduling concerns. Wal-Mart, he says, is responding to workers' demands. TRAUTWEIN: That's the way the market self-adjusts and self-regulates. NOGUCHI: Jason Diaz is a server at a restaurant in New Haven, Conn. He says in order to work 40 hours a week, he's constantly looking for extra gigs. JASON DIAZ: Finding the place is the first problem, and then finding out how to manage that and travel costs, expenses and being to my next job on time - it's pretty difficult. NOGUCHI: He spends his remaining time trying to find a full-time job and taking care of his son. DIAZ: Just in the last two weeks, I got a email from my boss saying, hey, you have to work on Tuesday so figure out what you're going to do with your son. NOGUCHI: So Diaz canceled his son's drum lesson and found babysitting only to discover his boss had made a mistake and he didn't have to work after all. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, we're solving for X, the hidden numbers that shape everything around us like, say, for example, when you flip through the radio dial. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Singing) Taking over from one to 10. KEVIN SLAVIN: When I hear music these days, I wonder. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Singing) Number one. SLAVIN: . . . Why I'm hearing this particular song. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) One, two, three, four - get it. RAZ: This is Kevin Slavin. SLAVIN: . . . What it is in my behavior or the behavior of others or whatever produced this particular track at this particular time. RAZ: Kevin runs a research group at MIT that's obsessed with algorithms, and he thinks that we're now living in a sort of age of algorithms. SLAVIN: Our lives are made up of a series of decisions. What time does the train arrive? And what's on the radio? And what's happening to my retirement stock? And more and more, those decisions are made automatically by machines, increasingly without human supervision. RAZ: So here's an example from Kevin's life. SLAVIN: So yesterday, I had to make my way from New York to Boston, so I needed to take a flight. And so I went online to one of the sites that just sort of lists, you know, what all the prices are and what's the price of that ticket. RAZ: A chain of complex calculations figured out. . . SLAVIN: Routing and where the fuel depots are, projected seat fill, weather patterns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: And once Kevin arrived in Boston, he decided. . . SLAVIN: I'm going to call for a car, and so I use Uber. RAZ: But then, an algorithm decided. . . SLAVIN: What's that going to cost? Is it going to cost whatever it costs? Or is it going to cost 1. 2 times that? Is it going to cost 3. 9 times that, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. RAZ: Then, once he got home. . . SLAVIN: My wife and I are expecting a child. . . RAZ: Oh, wow. SLAVIN: . . . So we were ordering. . . RAZ: Is this your first child? SLAVIN: It is, yeah. RAZ: Congratulations. SLAVIN: Thank you. So we're sort of looking to see, OK, which crib? RAZ: And if you shop on Amazon like Kevin does. . . SLAVIN: A lot of sellers on Amazon aren't actually setting the prices themselves, they're actually just using small algorithms that are looking at the prices of other cribs on there. RAZ: And that changes - and that changes all the time. SLAVIN: Yeah, it changes many times in a second. So the price that we paid may never have been actually approved or even considered by human at any point. RAZ: In fact, Kevin says, you can find these kinds of things wherever you look. Here he is on the TED stage back in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others. There's Dinosaur Planet. There's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix's algorithms, trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next, which is a very, very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects that Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms, determines, in the end, 60 percent of what movies end up being rented, right? So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms, and that's 70 percent of the United States stock market, 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension. . . (LAUGHTER)SLAVIN: . . . Your mortgage. And what could go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: A stunning and dramatic crash on Wall Street yesterday appears to be the result. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: What could go wrong is, is that a year ago, 9 percent of the entire market just disappears. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In a matter of minutes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Nearly 1,000-point drop. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And they called it The Flash Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Flash Crash, which many people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Flash Crash, as it was described. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: Flash Crash of 2:45. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Stocks go do-oop - boink (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: All of a sudden, 9 percent just goes away. (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: It's a fast market. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: The market was down 900 points, we're now down 688. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: And nobody to this day can even agree on what happened. And that's the thing - right? - is that we're writing things, we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And it's - we've rendered something kind of illegible, and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. RAZ: That's - but - that's crazy. SLAVIN: It is crazy, right? And so one of the questions is, when we create mathematical models of such complexity - and let's remember that any given algorithm within the stock market is impossibly complex and then it is the interaction of all of these complex algorithms with one another. This is far beyond what any human could ever, ever hope to understand. And it doesn't leave a forensic trail that provides an explanation; it just provides a bunch of data. RAZ: But you're saying that, actually, increasingly we're solving problems in a way that we don't really even understand? SLAVIN: That's exactly the point. I think that's one of the most important aspects of what's happening, and I think that characterizes our time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SLAVIN: So let me take it back to Wall Street, OK, because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are, it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're 5 microseconds behind, you're a loser. (LAUGHTER)SLAVIN: So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper - throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in - all so that an algorithm could get close to the Internet. And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system - and of course it is - but it's distributed from places, right? In New York, this is where it's distributed from - the Carrier Hotel, located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that, you're a few microseconds behind. But if you zoom out, you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago. It's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber-optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse - just for these algorithms. And when you think about this, that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal 3 microseconds faster, all for communications framework that no human will ever know, that's a kind of manifest destiny. And we'll always look for a new frontier. RAZ: So - I mean, so basically, you could argue that our lives are controlled by algorithms. SLAVIN: I think it's more - the word that I use is shaped. The rough edges of what determines our sense of the day are, in fact, sort of hinted by these mathematical models that are all around us. You know, there's still an awful lot of things that happen in the world that can't nobody predict and probably won't ever be able to. And I think that's great and that's fine. I just think that those unpredictable elements are - have this weird kind of frisson with an increasingly predictable set of models that are sort of at every level of our lives. RAZ: So there's a limit to all this? SLAVIN: Yeah, and it may be - so there is a limit, but I think it's also - it's not just that there's a humility in being reminded that there's a limit, there's also a value in realizing that there's a limit. I think that it's a reasonable dream to have that we can take a fundamentally mathematic model to everything in the world and then just solve all the problems in it, but it's also fundamentally impossible. And I think that there's a great value in recognizing the idea of striving toward something impossible but also the impossibility of the task.

So the price that we paid may never have been actually approved or even considered by human at any point. RAZ: In fact, Kevin says, you can find these kinds of things wherever you look. Here he is on the TED stage back in 2011. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch, and they've tried a bunch of others. There's Dinosaur Planet. There's Gravity. They're using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix's algorithms, trying to do the same thing. It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next, which is a very, very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects that Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms, determines, in the end, 60 percent of what movies end up being rented, right? So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies. So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms, and that's 70 percent of the United States stock market, 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension. . . (LAUGHTER) SLAVIN: . . . Your mortgage. And what could go wrong? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: A stunning and dramatic crash on Wall Street yesterday appears to be the result. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: What could go wrong is, is that a year ago, 9 percent of the entire market just disappears. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In a matter of minutes. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Nearly 1,000-point drop. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: And they called it The Flash Crash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Flash Crash, which many people. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Flash Crash, as it was described. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: Flash Crash of 2:45. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: Stocks go do-oop - boink (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: All of a sudden, 9 percent just goes away. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: It's a fast market. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #7: The market was down 900 points, we're now down 688. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: And nobody to this day can even agree on what happened. And that's the thing - right? - is that we're writing things, we're writing these things that we can no longer read. And it's - we've rendered something kind of illegible, and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made. RAZ: That's - but - that's crazy. SLAVIN: It is crazy, right? And so one of the questions is, when we create mathematical models of such complexity - and let's remember that any given algorithm within the stock market is impossibly complex and then it is the interaction of all of these complex algorithms with one another. This is far beyond what any human could ever, ever hope to understand. And it doesn't leave a forensic trail that provides an explanation; it just provides a bunch of data. RAZ: But you're saying that, actually, increasingly we're solving problems in a way that we don't really even understand? SLAVIN: That's exactly the point. I think that's one of the most important aspects of what's happening, and I think that characterizes our time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SLAVIN: So let me take it back to Wall Street, OK, because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are, it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're 5 microseconds behind, you're a loser. (LAUGHTER) SLAVIN: So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper - throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in - all so that an algorithm could get close to the Internet. And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system - and of course it is - but it's distributed from places, right? In New York, this is where it's distributed from - the Carrier Hotel, located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that, you're a few microseconds behind. But if you zoom out, you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago. It's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber-optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse - just for these algorithms. And when you think about this, that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal 3 microseconds faster, all for communications framework that no human will ever know, that's a kind of manifest destiny. And we'll always look for a new frontier. RAZ: So - I mean, so basically, you could argue that our lives are controlled by algorithms. SLAVIN: I think it's more - the word that I use is shaped. The rough edges of what determines our sense of the day are, in fact, sort of hinted by these mathematical models that are all around us. You know, there's still an awful lot of things that happen in the world that can't nobody predict and probably won't ever be able to. And I think that's great and that's fine. I just think that those unpredictable elements are - have this weird kind of frisson with an increasingly predictable set of models that are sort of at every level of our lives. RAZ: So there's a limit to all this? SLAVIN: Yeah, and it may be - so there is a limit, but I think it's also - it's not just that there's a humility in being reminded that there's a limit, there's also a value in realizing that there's a limit. I think that it's a reasonable dream to have that we can take a fundamentally mathematic model to everything in the world and then just solve all the problems in it, but it's also fundamentally impossible. And I think that there's a great value in recognizing the idea of striving toward something impossible but also the impossibility of the task.

U. S. businesses continued to add jobs to their payrolls at a rapid pace in February. According to the government's monthly employment report, the economy added close to 300,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked down as well. But as NPR's John Ydstie reports, workers still aren't seeing much improvement in their wages. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: To be precise, the economy added 295,000 jobs last month. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate declined two-tenths of a percent. Both numbers exceeded economists' expectations, among them, Megan Greene, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services. MEGAN GREENE: So the headline number of jobs we've added was fantastic - 295,000. Unemployment dropped to 5. 5 percent. I think that beat most expectations. YDSTIE: February continued a string of months with strong job creation, but it was disappointing in one important area - wage growth. Wage has increased a disappointing one-tenth of 1 percent last month, returning to a pattern that Greene thinks is likely to continue. GREENE: We're adding a ton of jobs every month, and that's really good news. But we're adding them in all the wrong sectors if what you want to see is upward pressure on wages. YDSTIE: And last month, there was disappointing job growth in some high-wage sectors like construction and manufacturing. Greene believes the U. S. will see weak wage growth for some time because of a global glut of labor, partly due to sluggish economies in Europe and China. She also says the kind of jobs being created in the U. S. are mostly lower-paying service-sector jobs. GREENE: We're adding most of our jobs at or slightly above minimum wage, and as long as that's the case, you're not going to get a whole lot of upward pressure on wages. And if you don't have a lot of upward pressure on wages, there won't be a lot of upward pressure on inflation either, and that will certainly drive the Fed's policy going forward. YDSTIE: The Fed has signaled it will likely begin raising interest rates this year, maybe as soon as June. Greene says she thinks that's premature given the lack of wage pressure and low inflation. She also believes overall economic growth will be held below historical rates for a recovery because of the mix of jobs being created. Greene says many low-wage jobs are going to workers who've been receiving benefits like food stamps or SNAP, and their wages are barely replacing those benefits. GREENE: Their benefits are actually being reduced, and so net-net, they're kind of in the same position. They're not using their newfound wages to go out and spend and boost the economy, they're just trying to make ends meet. YDSTIE: Until job growth increases for higher-paying positions, says Greene, wage growth will continue to lag. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

It piled up in some places. And yet people in Boston are probably watching all of this and saying whatever. Nine feet of snow have fallen on Boston this winter, most of it last month. Many businesses have been closed, commuters have been stranded like Christopher Clickner. CHRISTOPHER CLICKNER: Oh, well, I've been working from home for the past couple of days just because I can't get to work. It's taken me an hour-and-a-half sitting here trying to catch a bus, and it just hasn't worked at all. GREENE: And the snow hasn't gone anywhere. Traffic and commerce are still being disrupted in Boston, which you might think would hit the local economy hard. Here's Curt Nickisch from member station WBUR. CURT NICKISCH, BYLINE: Bostonians might want to blame their weather woes on Patrick Renna. He is the CEO of a local burrito chain called Boloco. Back in January, he remembers, he was forecasting strong growth at a company board meeting. PATRICK RENNA: And I remember the chairman asking me, so, Patrick, what's the biggest risk and I said weather. And I remember saying but thankfully we've been good so far (laughter). And then two weeks later started the, you know, 102-inch snowfall that we've received since then. So maybe I jinxed it. NICKISCH: Boloco's sales fell 20 percent last month. The company serves people working in Boston office buildings and half of Renna's stores were closed for days. RENNA: In my 20 years of business, it was the worst restaurant month I've ever been involved in. NICKISCH: Unlike someone who waits until a snowstorm passes to buy the new fridge or new car they were going to buy anyway, those burrito sales are gone for good. Michael Goodman is an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. MICHAEL GOODMAN: You're not going to sell two lunches tomorrow to offset the one lunch that you didn't sell today. NICKISCH: But just because workers aren't coming into their Boston offices and grabbing a burrito for lunch doesn't mean their business is down 20 percent, too. AMANDA SCHREYER: I worked from my desk in my living room. NICKISCH: That's Amanda Schreyer, a lawyer. The snowstorms kept her from going to her downtown Boston law firm, but they didn't keep her from going to work. SCHREYER: I have a laptop, and I can connect remotely to my work system. It was really business as usual. NICKISCH: At her firm, Prince Lobel Tye, managing partner Craig Tateronis says billable hours were down 10 percent last month, but he's not too stressed about it. CRAIG TATERONIS: We certainly understand why we have the result we do in February, but we also expect that we will get the productivity back. NICKISCH: Tateronis says his lawyers and paralegals can make it up. The loss of business was temporary, not permanent. And that's the case for many companies affected by the snowstorms here, says Doug Handler. He's the chief U. S. economist at the research firm IHS Global Insight. DOUG HANDLER: We're lucky that Boston is, for the most part, a knowledge-intensive city, and, actually, the permanent economic loss because of that really isn't that significant. NICKISCH: By knowledge-intensive he means financial services firms, universities, computer software companies - places that can limit the damage from the snowstorms. When Handler's team came up with the estimate of the permanent economic loss from the snowstorms, they did it from the comfort of their home. HANDLER: Depends on the time of day, but we start with hot chocolate, for sure (laughter). NICKISCH: The estimate - the permanent loss to the Massachusetts's economy is just over $1 billion. It's not chump change, but annualized, that's just a percentage point off the regional output. That's not a bad outcome considering how much snow still blankets the region.

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: These days, your credit score is your key to the financial kingdom. A bad score means you might have to pay a $100 more a month in car payments. Some landlords check credit scores, so it can make it hard to even rent an apartment, let alone buy a house. Meanwhile, getting a mistake off your credit report has become infamously difficult to do. ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN: The credit reporting system suffers from inaccuracy and often from outright injustice. At least 10 million consumers have errors on their credit reports, through no fault of their own, that affect the cost of borrowing. ARNOLD: That's New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who has just struck a deal with Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. SCHNEIDERMAN: The settlement agreement we're announcing today provides an extraordinary set of reforms. ARNOLD: Right now, if you say there's a mistake on your credit report, regulators say the ratings firms usually just call up the debt collector or the credit card company and if they say it's accurate and that you owe them money it stays on your report, even if it's really a mistake. Now the credit agencies have agreed to do more investigative work themselves. SCHNEIDERMAN: They have to do their own independent investigation and sign an employee with the discretion to resolve disputes to conduct an independent review.

Sidney, Mont. , lies at the western edge of the Bakken oil patch, one of the country's top drilling regions. Pay a visit there, and you'd never know the price of oil is as low as it is. Production is churning right along. But now the town's leaders are bracing for much less oil tax revenue, and they need that money to deal with the effects of the boom. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The mayor of Sidney, Mont. , Rick Norby, is one of the most worried men in America right now. MAYOR RICK NORBY: I haven't slept since I became mayor. So, yeah, it does keep me up at night. SIEGLER: I hope you're kidding. NORBY: No, I really ain't kidding you. SIEGLER: In the past few years, Sidney has been transformed from a sleepy farming town on the state line with North Dakota to an oil boom city. Since Norby took over as mayor this time last year, oil prices have fallen by 50 percent. NORBY: All I can say is all the action is still happening. That's all I can say. I mean, it's not slowing down - period. I mean, we haven't seen a slowdown one bit in anything. SIEGLER: But one thing is changing. Norby expects he'll get about $600,000 less in tax revenue from oil production. He's also bracing for less money from hotel and gambling taxes. This is a big deal when your whole budget is $11 million and your town now has a major highway running right through it. Sidney's Central Avenue is one of the busiest - if not the busiest - highways in the state. Oil tanker trucks full of Bakken crude rubble through downtown, headed for the refineries in Billings. NORBY: It's taking its toll. I mean, you can see this road here. I know - you look out, you can see the divots from the wheel tracks. This was built probably three years ago. SIEGLER: Norby is 52. He's wearing a gray ball cap. The trace of his chew can is worn into the seat pocket of his jeans. He's lived here all his life, and he loves Sidney. After he graduated high school, he farmed sugar beets and corn. A few years before the oil boom hit, he sold the farm and moved back into town. NORBY: I'm thankful I did the move I made then because you could never afford to buy a house in Sidney, Mont. , in my opinion, on what I make, especially being mayor. (Laughter). SIEGLER: On Central Avenue, Norby points out mom-and-pop businesses that have been here since he was a kid. There are some new places - a microbrewery, a steakhouse and casino that caters to the wealthier oilmen and engineers that have moved to town. You really do get the sense that things aren't slowing down here. After work, the Loaf and Jug gas station is still packed with young men in muddy Carharts filling up their pickups. Up the road, dozens of condos with prefab siding are still being built. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Shower stalls - (unintelligible) got a whole truck full of shower stalls. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Laughter). SIEGLER: The money coming from the oil boom pays for fundamental services that are stretched thin. Plus, Sidney is looking for $30 million for a new truck bypass, 70 million for a new water treatment plant. Around town, there are little one-bedroom houses with a half-dozen oil workers packed into them. The population has nearly doubled since 2010. The mayor sends us over to another man with a lot on his mind, Frank DiFonzo. He's Sidney's police chief. Asking him what the boom has done to his workload. . . FRANK DIFONZO: I had a - Amy, do you still have that? SIEGLER: DiFonzo is tired. Behind his John Wayne coffee mug, his desk is cluttered with stacks and stacks of case files. DUI arrests are up 300 percent. Felony assaults - twice that much. DiFonzo says he wouldn't even have talked to us if the mayor hadn't insisted. He's that busy. DIFONZO: I know the mayor told you we could use seven or eight more people, but we could use at least use three or four more people in the immediate time. SIEGLER: The thing is he's probably not going to get the money to hire anyone now, due to the forecasted drop in oil revenues. DiFonzo really needs a detective so that his officers can spend more time out on the streets. The other guy everybody wants us to meet is over at the elementary school - Principal Skinner. The mayor and a couple of the staffers are driving us by the school right now, and it's adjacent lot of mobile homes where teachers live. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Just to give you forewarning, when we meet Mr. Skinner, when he goes to shake your hand, brace yourself. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: He's a big man. SIEGLER: No joke - Jon Skinner is a big, friendly man with a shake that will crush your hand if you're not ready. He was a star football player at the University of Montana. Walking the halls, he knows every student, which is tough in a boom town school where some kids are only here for a couple weeks, then they move. JON SKINNER: You keep up the good work. I like it. Do what you do. Go to recess and have a good math, and I'll see you for computers, OK? SIEGLER: Almost a third of Skinner's students are considered special needs because they're so behind in schoolwork. The extra oil money revenue that's been coming in has helped him hire more teachers and classroom aids. They recently even started a long-term facilities plan, but he says that plan never considered oil falling below $70 a barrel. SKINNER: You're kind of living in limbo a little bit with everything. SIEGLER: And enrollment has stabilized lately. SKINNER: I think the one thing that I'm scared most about is we've got accustomed to having a little bit more funding gradually. And my - one of my biggest fears is that all of the sudden, tomorrow, it's gone. SIEGLER: From the schools to the police station to city hall, people in Sidney are worried right now about what the drop in oil prices is going to mean for them. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: One in the middle. . . SIEGLER: To illustrate all of this, Mayor Rick Norby takes us in his pickup over to the east side of town by the railroad tracks. A long crude oil tanker train is parked just up from the crossing. Ahead of us, the road dead ends near the Yellowstone River, where a man camp of RVs has popped up on the snowy prairie. NORBY: Right now - where we sit right now, we have no city water on the other side of these tracks. SIEGLER: And this is where Norby wants the town to grow. Even when oil prices were high, Sidney struggled to find enough money to do with this boom's impacts. And trying to plan for the future right now with so much uncertainty is nearly impossible. Norby is left hoping the state legislature will tap emergency funds to help out boom towns like his. NORBY: And that's why we are screaming, we're drowning. We need help. SIEGLER: Kirk Siegler, NPR News. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  We're going to look now at what the low price of oil means when you're trying to deal with explosive growth in a boomtown. Sidney, Mont. , lies at the western edge of the Bakken oil patch, one of the country's top drilling regions. Pay a visit there, and you'd never know the price of oil is as low as it is. Production is churning right along. But now the town's leaders are bracing for much less oil tax revenue, and they need that money to deal with the effects of the boom. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: The mayor of Sidney, Mont. , Rick Norby, is one of the most worried men in America right now. MAYOR RICK NORBY: I haven't slept since I became mayor. So, yeah, it does keep me up at night. SIEGLER: I hope you're kidding. NORBY: No, I really ain't kidding you. SIEGLER: In the past few years, Sidney has been transformed from a sleepy farming town on the state line with North Dakota to an oil boom city. Since Norby took over as mayor this time last year, oil prices have fallen by 50 percent. NORBY: All I can say is all the action is still happening. That's all I can say. I mean, it's not slowing down - period. I mean, we haven't seen a slowdown one bit in anything. SIEGLER: But one thing is changing. Norby expects he'll get about $600,000 less in tax revenue from oil production. He's also bracing for less money from hotel and gambling taxes. This is a big deal when your whole budget is $11 million and your town now has a major highway running right through it. Sidney's Central Avenue is one of the busiest - if not the busiest - highways in the state. Oil tanker trucks full of Bakken crude rubble through downtown, headed for the refineries in Billings. NORBY: It's taking its toll. I mean, you can see this road here. I know - you look out, you can see the divots from the wheel tracks. This was built probably three years ago. SIEGLER: Norby is 52. He's wearing a gray ball cap. The trace of his chew can is worn into the seat pocket of his jeans. He's lived here all his life, and he loves Sidney. After he graduated high school, he farmed sugar beets and corn. A few years before the oil boom hit, he sold the farm and moved back into town. NORBY: I'm thankful I did the move I made then because you could never afford to buy a house in Sidney, Mont. , in my opinion, on what I make, especially being mayor. (Laughter).

It passed a law saying workers cannot be forced to join labor unions or pay union dues to keep their jobs. In many states right now there's a concerted effort to pass laws that would weaken the power of labor unions. But unions and their allies are also fighting back. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker became a Republican political star by taking on his state's public employee unions. This week, he went a step further signing a bill that would weaken private-sector unions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER: Wisconsin now has the freedom to work. That is one more powerful tool as we help create not just jobs but career opportunities for many years to come. ZARROLI: So-called right-to-work laws have been on the wish list of business and industry groups for many years but the political power of labor unions made them hard to pass outside the South and Mountain West. The recent sweeping Republican victories in state houses across the country has extended such laws into the Rust Belt. Two years ago, Michigan and Indiana became right-to-work states. Patrick Simmons is a spokesman for The National Right to Work Committee. PATRICK SIMMONS: Since then, we've seen a lot more activity on this issue in general, so we do think momentum is building and that Wisconsin's only going to add to that. ZARROLI: This year, right-to-work laws were introduced in such diverse states as Maine, West Virginia, Missouri and New Mexico. Eric Hauser of the AFL-CIO says the effort to pass such laws has been fueled by outside conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council. ERIC HAUSER: There is a purposeful, concentrated, raw political campaign underway by the right-wing with billions of dollars behind it that is looking for any opportunity it can to attack workers. ZARROLI: The labor movement and its democratic allies have managed to fend off the proposed laws in many places at least so far this year. Right-to-work laws have been stalled in committee or left to die in places such as Missouri and West Virginia. Gary Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University, says unions still have the right to organize under federal law even in right-to-work states. But if they can't require workers to pay dues, the benefits are diminished and they will have less political power than they once did. GARY CHAISON: A few years ago, anyone running for public office - a governor, for instance - would curry favor with the unions and ask for their endorsement. Now they win their elections by opposing unions and fighting the unions. ZARROLI: Chaison says the passage of right-to-work laws in state houses should be a warning sign for labor. CHAISON: They have a tremendous symbolic importance because right-to-work laws are usually passed in states where unions have minimum influence. And what we're seeing now is Wisconsin and Michigan are becoming states where unions have very little power. ZARROLI: Union leaders point out that these defeats have been offset by victories elsewhere such as the passage of laws mandating paid sick leave and higher minimum wages. They say these wins suggest underlying public support for labor's goals. But labor remains a lot weaker than it once was. And in the wake of the recent electoral gains by Republicans, the opposition it faces has only grown more energized. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

It is not such good news for mining towns in Arizona. Carrie Jung reports from our NPR member station KJZZ. CARRIE JUNG, BYLINE: It's hard to miss the Ray Mine near Kearney in southern Arizona. The open pit copper mine spans nearly two square miles and extends more than 1,000 feet into the ground. At first glance, everything looks normal from the road as earthmovers and large haul trucks move around the area. This is one of more than 120 mining operations that dot the landscape in this state. But production at the Ray Mine isn't as high as it was a few years ago. In fact, Asarco, the company that owns it, just announced a round of layoffs. DARLENE HOSEA: They've worked kind of hard, the company and the union, to try to make the transition easy. But how do you transition from a paycheck to (laughter) saying you're not going to have one? So. . . JUNG: Darlene Hosea is a haul truck driver. She's been working at the Ray Mine for the last four years. But recently, she got word she was losing her job. HOSEA: We've had to trim on our finances, things that aren't necessary, like satellite TVs. And, you know, we're doing a little more eating at home and a lot less eating out. JUNG: Officials with Asarco say the layoffs were in response to falling copper prices. The company hasn't released the final number of layoffs planned at the mine, but elected officials from surrounding towns estimate around 130 employees could be affected at this mine and a nearby smelter. Sam Hosler is the mayor of Kearney, a small town just 10 miles east of the mine. He says for the nearly 2,000 people that call this area home, dealing with the threat of layoffs is never easy. But, he adds, layoffs related to copper prices are just a natural part of this mining town's economic cycle. MAYOR SAM HOSLER: That's tough for individuals to deal with. Now, the town itself has a longer memory. . . Used to it? No, especially the younger families. It still hurts. And yes, I think the town will certainly be here one, two, three years from now no matter what happens. JUNG: Hosler says there are peaks and valleys in this cycle. The current valley is coming off a spike originating in the mid-2000s. Mining companies began increasing production after seeing a growing use of the metal in electronic components and a surge in infrastructure investment in the U. S. and China. By 2011, though, demand from both countries dropped off significantly, leaving the market with more supply than demand could support. But Dennis Hoffman, an economist at Arizona State University, says the price drop isn't likely to last too long. DENNIS HOFFMAN: For this to be a permanent change, we're going to have to believe the construction's never coming back in this country and that China is never growing. And those would be pretty surprising events. JUNG: While layoffs are reality for some copper mining companies right now, others are looking to invest. In December, Congress approved a federal land exchange to allow resolution copper to open a mine in the state, over what many believe is one of the largest untapped copper deposits in the world. It joined several other companies that are also expanding their operations in Arizona. Hoffman says, in this industry, long-term is the name of the game when it comes to investment. He compares the current conditions to those of the oil industry. HOFFMAN: There'll be some rigs that are shut down because the price of oil came off a little bit. But are people stopping investing in oil? And the answer is no.

S. dollar is on a roll these days. It's risen strongly against most major currencies over the past several months, but it looks especially pumped up compared to the euro. Less than a year ago, it took almost a dollar and 40 cents to buy one euro. Today, a euro costs just a dollar and six cents, its lowest point in 12 years. NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie joins us to talk about what's going on. Hey there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: First of all, why is this happening? What's causing the dollar to strengthen? YDSTIE: The big reason is that the U. S. economy is doing better than most of the other major economies of the world. China's growth rate is slowing. Europe is barely growing at all, and same with Japan's economy. Meanwhile, the U. S. economy is rapidly creating jobs and growing at a pretty healthy rate. That means more investors around the world are ready to put money in the U. S. - maybe buy a company or buy U. S. stocks. To do that, you need dollars, and when there's more demand for dollars, the price and value of the dollar goes up. And then there's the Central Bank policy that's having an impact. CORNISH: Right. The European Central Bank actually is pumping more money into its economy, right? That's their version of quantitative easing. YDSTIE: Right. And that's creating downward pressure on European interest rates. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is getting closer to raising U. S. interest rates. Again, global investors are attracted by the higher returns on U. S. bonds, and they have to buy dollars to invest in them. That adds to the dollar's strength. CORNISH: So what's the effect of the stronger dollar on the U. S. economy as a whole and, of course, for U. S. consumers? YDSTIE: Well, there are positives and negatives. The big negative, of course, is that U. S. exporters have a harder time selling their products because they're priced in dollars. That hurts their profits, and that's been reflected in recent days in major U. S. stock indexes, which have fallen. They recovered a little bit today. Most of the big companies on those indexes have foreign sales. And if their profits fall, their stocks are less attractive. And fewer profits will trim job creation at those companies and hurt overall U. S. growth. So that's a major negative. CORNISH: You've given us the negatives here, John. I mean, what's the good news? What are the positive effects? YDSTIE: Well, imports are less expensive. So if you are a U. S. business that imports some of its raw materials or components, those are now cheaper. If you're an American consumer who buys imported clothing or electronics or automobiles, you're going to get more for your dollar. Also, a strong dollar puts a downward pressure on oil prices, so it contributes to lower gasoline prices, too. CORNISH: So on balance here, do the positives outweigh the negatives? YDSTIE: Well, if the dollar is strong just because the rest of the world is experiencing weakness, then maybe it's not such a good thing. And there's the difference of opinion about whether it's a healthy U. S. economy that's pumping up the dollar or simply weakness abroad. Historically, a strong dollar has been associated with a strong U. S. economy, but it's not clear yet whether that will be the case this time. CORNISH: That's NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie. John, thanks so much. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Audie. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   The U. S. dollar is on a roll these days. It's risen strongly against most major currencies over the past several months, but it looks especially pumped up compared to the euro. Less than a year ago, it took almost a dollar and 40 cents to buy one euro. Today, a euro costs just a dollar and six cents, its lowest point in 12 years. NPR's economics correspondent John Ydstie joins us to talk about what's going on. Hey there, John. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: First of all, why is this happening? What's causing the dollar to strengthen? YDSTIE: The big reason is that the U. S. economy is doing better than most of the other major economies of the world. China's growth rate is slowing. Europe is barely growing at all, and same with Japan's economy. Meanwhile, the U. S. economy is rapidly creating jobs and growing at a pretty healthy rate. That means more investors around the world are ready to put money in the U. S. - maybe buy a company or buy U. S. stocks. To do that, you need dollars, and when there's more demand for dollars, the price and value of the dollar goes up. And then there's the Central Bank policy that's having an impact. CORNISH: Right. The European Central Bank actually is pumping more money into its economy, right? That's their version of quantitative easing. YDSTIE: Right. And that's creating downward pressure on European interest rates. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is getting closer to raising U. S. interest rates. Again, global investors are attracted by the higher returns on U. S. bonds, and they have to buy dollars to invest in them. That adds to the dollar's strength. CORNISH: So what's the effect of the stronger dollar on the U. S. economy as a whole and, of course, for U. S. consumers? YDSTIE: Well, there are positives and negatives. The big negative, of course, is that U. S. exporters have a harder time selling their products because they're priced in dollars. That hurts their profits, and that's been reflected in recent days in major U. S. stock indexes, which have fallen. They recovered a little bit today. Most of the big companies on those indexes have foreign sales. And if their profits fall, their stocks are less attractive. And fewer profits will trim job creation at those companies and hurt overall U. S. growth. So that's a major negative. CORNISH: You've given us the negatives here, John. I mean, what's the good news? What are the positive effects? YDSTIE: Well, imports are less expensive. So if you are a U. S. business that imports some of its raw materials or components, those are now cheaper. If you're an American consumer who buys imported clothing or electronics or automobiles, you're going to get more for your dollar. Also, a strong dollar puts a downward pressure on oil prices, so it contributes to lower gasoline prices, too. CORNISH: So on balance here, do the positives outweigh the negatives? YDSTIE: Well, if the dollar is strong just because the rest of the world is experiencing weakness, then maybe it's not such a good thing. And there's the difference of opinion about whether it's a healthy U. S. economy that's pumping up the dollar or simply weakness abroad. Historically, a strong dollar has been associated with a strong U. S. economy, but it's not clear yet whether that will be the case this time.

S. to join a major new development bank created by China. Washington deeply opposes the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is due to open later this year. The Obama administration says there's no need for another international lending institution. Some think the new bank could undermine American influence in Asia, as NPR's Jackie Northam reports. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Much of Asia is developing rapidly, and there's little question it needs major investment for all types of infrastructure, says Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. FRED BERGSTEN: The lack of infrastructure - roads, airports, ports, power facilities - are among the biggest barriers to development throughout Asia. NORTHAM: Bergsten says roughly $8 trillion of infrastructure investment will be needed over the next decade. He says the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will help fill that gap. It's believed China is prepared to put up half of the initial $100 billion budget, ostensibly giving it veto power; much the same as the U. S. has with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Ever since China floated the idea of a new development institution about two years ago, Washington has been against it. The administration says it has concerns about transparency, environmental safeguards and procurement practices. Bergsten says there's a larger issue at stake. BERGSTEN: I think the fact that it is China and this is part of the broader competition for global leadership, economic leadership, broader political leadership - that is, I think, a central part of this equation. NORTHAM: The U. S. has pressured Asian allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Australia, not to join the new bank. But then last week, the U. K. , one of America's staunchest allies, became the first Western nation to sign on. And today, Germany, France and Italy followed suit. Matthew Goodman, a senior adviser on Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the Europeans have an incentive to deepen their economic ties with China. But it's a blow to the administration. MATTHEW GOODMAN: Well, I do think it's a setback for the U. S. You know, it's obviously never a happy thing for the U. S. when its closest allies break away from it and do something that it isn't prepared to do itself. NORTHAM: Each of the four European nations issued statements essentially saying they want to work with international partners to help shape and ensure the bank follows the best standards and practices. Goodman says it's better to do that beforehand. GOODMAN: I think there's a question, again; if you're in, you don't have much leverage once you've joined. So if you're going to join you want to have all your questions and concerns answered before you go in. NORTHAM: Still, it's believed the Europeans' move will open the door for more Western countries to join, except the U. S. Goodman says even if it wanted to, it's unlikely Congress would approve membership in and the use of American capital for a Chinese-led bank.

But Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues also signaled they're still in no rush to act. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The chatter before this week's Fed meeting was all about the word patient. In previous meetings, Fed officials had said they could be patient in deciding when to raise their benchmark interest rate. Janet Yellen went as far as to say that as long as the word patient remained in the Fed's post meeting statement, the Fed was unlikely to raise rates in the next couple of meetings. Today, that keyword was removed. But Yellen said the time for a rate hike is still undetermined. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: Today's modification of our guidance should not be interpreted to mean that we have decided on the timing of that increase. In other words, just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn't mean we're going to be impatient. YDSTIE: Beginning last year, many investors and Fed watchers believed that a removal of the word patient at this March meeting would mean a rate hike would likely happen in June. But Yellen cautioned against reaching that conclusion, too. YELLEN: This change does not mean that an increase will necessarily occur in June, although we can't rule that out. YDSTIE: But the Fed's revised forecast for the economy led many analysts to the conclusion that the first rate hike is now more likely later in the year - maybe in September. Fed policymakers lowered their forecast for growth over the next three years and also lowered their inflation forecast for this year to below 1 percent. That's less than half the 2 percent inflation rate the Fed views as optimal for economic growth. Yellen said part of the reason for this slower growth and lower inflation is the strength of the dollar. It has significantly increased in value against other major currencies in the past year. YELLEN: There has been a slight downgrading of estimates of growth for this year. We noted that export growth has weakened - probably the strong dollar is one reason for that. The strength of the dollar is also pushing inflation down. YDSTIE: But Yellen also emphasized that the dollar is stronger partly because the U. S. economy is stronger. She said even with the lowered forecast, economic growth will be above the economy's normal growth rate over the next couple of years. So Yellen was asked what does the Fed need to see to decide it's time to raise rates? YELLEN: We want to see further improvement in the labor market, and we want to feel reasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective. YDSTIE: The downward pressure on inflation from the strong dollar and lower energy prices suggests that goal is still a ways away. Before this meeting, it was thought that financial markets might tank once the Fed removed the word patient from their statement, opening the door to higher rates, but the Fed's weaker forecast for growth and inflation convinced investors the rate hike is still some time off. That sent stocks up sharply and long-term interest rates lower. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

They oversee an institution that, among other things, creates money. They've created a lot of it in the years since the financial crisis, adding more than $3 trillion. One of the Fed's next jobs is to make that money disappear. Here's Jacob Goldstein of NPR's Planet Money team. JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Creating all that money was part of a program called quantitative easing. The Fed used the money to buy bonds and pushed down interest rates on things like mortgages to encourage people to borrow and spend. Today, the crisis has passed, but all that money is still out there, largely in one place. ALAN BLINDER: Surprisingly - very surprisingly - basically all of it went to idle cash in the bank. GOLDSTEIN: This is Alan Blinder. He was vice chairman of the Fed back in the '90s. He says one goal of creating all that money was to get banks to lend more. That really hasn't happened yet. BLINDER: You can ask me - the next question is how come banks haven't reached this point already? And my answer is, damned if I know- it's a puzzle to me. GOLDSTEIN: The economy will start humming again at some point. Banks will start lending out all that money, and if that happens too fast, it could be a problem. Inflation could take off. To be clear, that hasn't happened yet. Inflation is still low. Eventually, though, Fed officials will start destroying the money they created, start winding down quantitative easing. But figuring out exactly when to do this is fraught. Do it soon, you plunge the economy back into another recession. Wait too long, and inflation takes off. BLINDER: What the Fed is worrying about every minute of every day is getting the timing right. So that is exactly the art of the exit - getting the timing right. GOLDSTEIN: The Fed always worries about this. But right now, Blinder says, there's so much money out there that even a small misjudgment could have big consequences. On top of that, the Fed has never done this before. David Blanchflower was at the Bank of England during the financial crisis. He says the Fed did the right thing with quantitative easing. But he says during the crisis, central banks were making it up as they went along, and they're still making it up now. DAVID BLANCHFLOWER: They don't have a nice chapter in a textbook to tell them what they should do. They've never done it before. They're struggling. GOLDSTEIN: So the Fed doesn't know what's going to happen when they finally wind down QE? BLANCHFLOWER: Absolutely not. Sorry. They absolutely don't know. GOLDSTEIN: That sounds terrifying. BLANCHFLOWER: It is - it is terrifying. GOLDSTEIN: The Fed has laid out a basic plan. First, raise short-term rates. That's the part everybody's talking about at today's meeting. Then, when the economy seems strong enough, start slowly pulling that QE money out of the economy. Blanchflower says it's likely to be years before things are back to normal.

The bad news is that many buyers are paying for those cars with different kinds of car loans. They're taking longer to pay back the money. Nearly one-third of new loans now last 74 months or longer. Do a little math; that's more than six years. That may hurt consumers now or hurt the industry later. Michigan Radio's Tracy Samilton reports. TRACY SAMILTON, BYLINE: There comes a day in every car owner's life when she knows it's time. For Carolyn Ballard of Atlanta, Ga. , that happened last July while driving her old SUV with misfiring cylinders. CAROLYN BALLARD: So, I mean, I drove to the dealership with the car literally chugging along. I mean, in traffic on the interstate, I was just sweating, thinking I've just got to get to the dealership so I can get rid of this before I put any more money into it. SAMILTON: Ballard wanted a late-model Honda Accord she'd seen on her local dealership's website. But by the time she got there, it was gone. But there were plenty of new Accords. BALLARD: I said if you can get my payments under $250 a month, I will consider taking this car. SAMILTON: No problem. Ballard got a loan from Wells Fargo at a great rate - 2 and a half percent for 74 months - that's six years. Six-year car loans used to be in the minority. Now they're the norm, and loans of seven or eight years are becoming popular. Ed Kim, an analyst with AutoPacific, says one thing driving the trend is the cars themselves. ED KIM: Consumers are demanding a lot more technology in their vehicles, infotainment technologies. There's also a lot more safety features that are in vehicles now, emissions and efficiency technologies that are in vehicles now that are making vehicles cost a lot more. SAMILTON: But Kim says the main reason is many consumers haven't recovered from the recession, so that new car payment has to be stretched out over more years. Melinda Zabritski isn't too worried for consumers. She's with Experian Automotive, a subsidiary of the credit rating agency Experian. She says longer car loans often make sense, especially for people on a tight budget. MELINDA ZABRITSKI: Well, if we all had the luxury to take, you know, a 36- or 48-month term loan, we would. But the bottom line is, you know, the average consumer just can't afford that. SAMILTON: That reasoning drives consumer advocate Mike Sante nuts. He's with interest. com and says people on a budget are precisely the ones who shouldn't be taking out long loans. MIKE SANTE: They're a way to get people into cars that are more expensive than they should really be buying. It's these kinds of decisions that you make that will truly determine how much money you have later in life. SAMILTON: Sante argues that people should pay off their cars within four years, which can mean buying a less expensive or used car. While it's easy to get a super-long loan at certain automakers like Kia, Honda is trying to buck the trend. After all, the equity that owners still have in their vehicles come trade-in time is a big selling point for Honda, and long loans destroy that equity. Honda Vice President John Mendel says six, seven or eight years is just too long to pay off a car. JOHN MENDEL: I don't know what the average marriage lasts in the U. S. today, might be less than the average car loan. SAMILTON: Mendel hopes his competitors start using more discipline, but that may be wishful thinking. When interest rates go up, a new car will become even more expensive, which will likely push more consumers into longer loans. For NPR News, I'm Tracy Samilton.

And the man behind it - 36-year-old Curtis Carroll. He starts off the class with a motivational speech. CURTIS CARROLL: Financial education for me has been a life saver. And I've always been passionate about trying to make money. The problem with that passion was that it was focused in the wrong area - crime. GREEN: Carroll is serving up to life in prison for a murder he committed when he was 15. When he entered prison, he was illiterate. One day he went to grab the sports page of a newspaper, so his cellmate could read it to him. He accidentally picked up the business section instead. An older inmate asked Carroll if he played the markets. CARROLL: And I was like, the markets, what's that? And he was like, man, that's the stocks, you know? And I was really like, man, no. GREEN: The inmate then told Carroll that's where white people keep their money. CARROLL: And I was like, whoa, white folks. I mean, man, you know, anywhere white people keep their money I want to be there. You know, growing up in the neighborhood everything was always associated with white prosperity, black not. GREEN: Carroll scraped together several hundred dollars by cashing in unused postage stamps he had acquired selling tobacco to prisoners. His first investment was in high-risk penny stocks. He made enough money to keep investing. The whole process motivated him to learn to read. Fast forward to now and Carroll has made thousands of investments. He maintains notebooks filled with the daily stock price fluctuations of hundreds of companies. ZAK WILLIAMS: Wall Street does know what he's talking about. GREEN: Zak Williams is a graduate of Columbia Business School and one of several volunteers who teaches a financial education class with Carroll. He says Carroll's strategies are heavy on short-term, high-risk investments. Williams emphasizes the long term. WILLIAMS: We need to take an approach that's enabling for an inmate to not have to take out a loan or a credit card line that might be considered predatory, high interest. We want to prevent that practice in favor of saving and responsibly investing. SAM ROBINSON: I think it's a life skill. GREEN: San Quentin prison spokesman Sam Robinson. ROBINSON: Most of the skills that address rehabilitation inside of prisons have to do with vocational trades, anger management and victims-awareness type of education. GREEN: This class also touches on the personal component. Prisoners are counseled about their emotional connection to money and the possible pitfalls. Rick Grimes, who is serving a life sentence, says the lessons are valuable, teaching him to manage his money in prison and also invest money to give to his son. RICK GRIMES: I can benefit by helping my family. It still feels good to give back to my community, even though I can't get out right now.

A south Texas county has to go shopping for new inmates now that the federal government has canceled a contract at a private prison there. The trouble started late last month when prisoners rioted and forced the closure of a big for-profit lockup. As NPR's John Burnett reports, local officials aren't sure how they're going to plug the multi-million-dollar budget hole left by the inmates' departure. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: The Willacy County Correctional Center is empty now. The tall security fences and dome-like housing units set out here on the coastal prairie have no one inside them. One morning late last month, the prisoners rioted. They set fires and tore the place up. Guards put down the uprising in about five hours, but the destruction was so severe that the sprawling detention compound has been shut down. All 2,800 inmates were transferred. Willacy County is facing the question, what does it do now that its biggest moneymaker is out of business? I put that question to County Commissioner Beto Guerra. BETO GUERRA: Worst scenario, we'll lose about $2. 3 million annually, which is about 23 percent of our income. BURNETT: So a quarter of the income of Willacy County depends on that prison that just closed. B. GUERRA: Little less than a quarter. BURNETT: This agricultural county in the Rio Grande Valley is one of the poorest in the nation. The main street of Raymondville, the county seat, is lined with Tex-Mex cafes, payday loan offices and Joe Alexandre's jewelry shop. JOE ALEXANDRE: We never expected something like this, to this catastrophe, to happen all at one time. BURNETT: Alexandre was mayor of Raymondville twice before, and now he's running again. He says the prison's water and sewer bill amounted to $50,000 a month - a big boost to his city. Once insurance pays for extensive repairs to the prison, the county needs to fill those beds again. ALEXANDRE: It's a business. And we're going to take all the advantage that we can to bring in more business if possible. BURNETT: More inmates? ALEXANDRE: More inmates, yes. What else can we do? At the moment, we have been depending on inmates. BURNETT: Like other poor communities in America, Raymondville looked to for-profit prisons as a way to generate revenue and create jobs. Willacy built three of them. The correctional center was the largest with a workforce of nearly 400. They're now looking for work. The structure of the deals typically favor the private prison companies. Willacy created a public facilities corporation, sold bonds, built the prison and hired an operator - MTC, Management and Training Corporation. (SOUNDBITE OF PROMO)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: MTC is now the third-largest private operator of adult correctional facilities in the nation. Our reputation is that of rehabilitation, second only to security. BURNETT: MTC contracted with the U. S. Bureau of Prisons to incarcerate low-security male immigrants who were serving out sentences for illegal border crossings and aggravated felonies. For that service, the federal agency paid MTC to manage the prison. Then MTC paid the county $2. 50 per prisoner per day. But ultimately, it's Willacy County that's on the hook for its $63 million debt on the 9-year-old prison. As Willacy has learned, the prison business can be risky. Last month, Standard and Poor's downgraded the county's bond rating, owing to the uncertainty of its future prison income. Aurelio Guerra is Willacy County judge. AURELIO GUERRA: It has not affected us that we know of, but I guess we won't know until we go out and borrow money, which we haven't (laughter). BURNETT: When the U. S. Bureau of Prisons canceled its contract with Willacy last week, it explained that the federal inmate population was down, and it didn't need additional beds. Criminal justice trends ebb and flow. Where once it was easy to find inmates for a private prison, Willacy will likely learn that now it's tougher to fill prison beds, says Bob Libal. He tracks the corrections industry for the Austin activist group Grassroots Leadership. BOB LIBAL: Around the state, we have seen several communities that have had their private prisons fail. And they're left holding the bag when it comes to the debt that they floated. BURNETT: Finally, there's the question of what caused the riot. In the past, inmates have complained of bad living conditions and substandard medical care. MTC emphatically disputes this criticism. The company has hired a third party, the Nakamoto Group, to investigate why the inmates mutinied. Meanwhile, with its biggest prison shuttered, Willacy County plans to cut all nonessentials in its budget, such as the plans for a courthouse renovation and a new hurricane shelter.

Lee was one of the most influential leaders of the last 100 years. He was also an autocrat who used his country's libel laws to silence dissent. His opponents were jailed without trial for years. That said, he transformed the city-state from a malaria-infested swamp into a shiny metropolis. Under Lee's rule Singapore became one of the least corrupt and the richest places on earth and a model for the rest of Asia. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Singapore has been called the 20th century's most successful development story. Linda Lim is an economist who teaches at the University of Michigan. LINDA LIM: I don't think any other economy, even other Asian tigers, have that good a statistical record of rapid growth, full employment with very good social indicators - life expectancy, education, housing, et. cetera - in the first 20 years. ZARROLI: Singapore had little land and no natural resources. But after its independence in 1965, the former British trading port was transformed into a major manufacturing and financial center. The late conservative economist Milton Friedman said on PBS that Singapore showed how to do development right. MILTON FRIEDMAN: If you compare the conditions of people in a place like Singapore with the conditions of people in a place like Red China or, for that matter, in Indonesia, you will see that the economic freedom is a very important component of total freedom. ZARROLI: Conservatives saw Singapore as a free-market success story with low taxes, few capital restrictions and liberal immigration policies that made it one of the most cosmopolitan places on earth. JOSH KURLANTZICK: They have very, very free trade, very low tariffs, very few nontariff barriers. So in that way, it's a very open economy. And they'll boast about how you can start up you own company in Singapore in, like, three hours or something like that. ZARROLI: That's Josh Kurlantzick of the Council on Foreign Relations. But, like Deng Xiaoping's China, which emulated many of Singapore's policies, Lee's government played a big role in the economy. KURLANTZICK: Some of the biggest sectors domestically - shipbuilding, electronics, banking, and now they're very involved in private banking - got their start because Lee Kuan Yew and the government specifically directed State Farm into those areas. ZARROLI: The government also provided social services such as housing and health care in a way a liberal economists applaud it. Linda Lim, who grew up in Singapore, says this brought a certain amount of social peace. She says these policies were designed by Lee's cabinet, but Lee provided the leadership that made them possible. LIM: He understood the politics of this very diverse place and put together the laws, including the labor laws, that created a stable, peaceful place that multinationals were looking for. ZARROLI: Lee himself believes Singapore's growth was tied to the shared values of its different ethnic and religious groups. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW: We have had, since 1965, an undivided society, solidly behind a meritocratic system, pushing for higher standards of education, higher standards of performance and meritocratic at every level. ZARROLI: Singapore today is a mature economy that, like Japan, has seen its growth slow. It's had to compete with other low-wage countries that sometimes emulated its economic policies. Kurlantzick says today it struggles with a problem familiar to the West. KURLANTZICK: People live well but the per capita GDP conceals a high level of inequality. So that is definitely a major issue in Singapore today and one of the things that the current Prime Minister has focused on. ZARROLI: But Singapore remains a big financial center with a high standard of living. And Lee Kuan Yew is remembered as the man who made its prosperity possible. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

KURLANTZICK: Some of the biggest sectors domestically - shipbuilding, electronics, banking, and now they're very involved in private banking - got their start because Lee Kuan Yew and the government specifically directed State Farm into those areas. ZARROLI: The government also provided social services such as housing and health care in a way a liberal economists applaud it. Linda Lim, who grew up in Singapore, says this brought a certain amount of social peace. She says these policies were designed by Lee's cabinet, but Lee provided the leadership that made them possible. LIM: He understood the politics of this very diverse place and put together the laws, including the labor laws, that created a stable, peaceful place that multinationals were looking for. ZARROLI: Lee himself believes Singapore's growth was tied to the shared values of its different ethnic and religious groups. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW: We have had, since 1965, an undivided society, solidly behind a meritocratic system, pushing for higher standards of education, higher standards of performance and meritocratic at every level. ZARROLI: Singapore today is a mature economy that, like Japan, has seen its growth slow. It's had to compete with other low-wage countries that sometimes emulated its economic policies. Kurlantzick says today it struggles with a problem familiar to the West. KURLANTZICK: People live well but the per capita GDP conceals a high level of inequality. So that is definitely a major issue in Singapore today and one of the things that the current Prime Minister has focused on. ZARROLI: But Singapore remains a big financial center with a high standard of living. And Lee Kuan Yew is remembered as the man who made its prosperity possible.

They risk losing their homes unless they make arrangements to pay delinquent property taxes. Quinn Klinefelter of member station WDET reports. QUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: When Detroit emerged from bankruptcy last year, it did so with a razor-thin financial cushion. It desperately needs every bit of tax revenue it can muster. Earlier this year, county officials sent out 72,000 foreclosure notices to homeowners behind on property taxes, 62,000 of them in Detroit alone. They say about 18,000 of these properties are occupied, but fewer than half of those homeowners have paid all of their tax. So officials like City Council member Gabe Leland are knocking on doors in Detroit neighborhoods, reminding residents that the window to pay taxes is quickly closing. GABE LELAND: You got a pretty property here. KLINEFELTER: With Detroit's high unemployment and poverty rates, it's not hard For Leland to find residents facing foreclosure or who knows someone that is. LELAND: It's scary -72,000 in Wayne Country, thousands of those here in the city of Detroit. This is a crisis. And, you know, city, county, we don't want these properties. You know, we want people to stay in their homes, and this is going to put people on the street. KLINEFELTER: Leland supports a moratorium on foreclosures to give homeowners more time to pay taxes or have property values reassessed. But Wayne County Deputy Treasurer Eric Sabree says a moratorium is out of the question because Detroit's property tax revenue is already spoken for. ERIC SABREE: We pledge all the penalties and fees in our bond pledges to borrow money. And we can't do a moratorium on police protection or fire protection. KLINEFELTER: Detroit resident Sandy Combs lives with her partner of two decades, Ken Brinkley, in a house he inherited from an aunt. She lost her job in 2006, while Brinkley had triple bypass heart surgery. Combs says they paid medical bills instead of taxes, were foreclosed on, and their house sold at auction. Then they started paying rent to live there and tried to scrape together enough money to buy it outright. But they discovered that property taxes had not been paid, and the house went up for auction again, this time to a company that wants to evict them. SANDY COMBS: It's going to kill Kenny. He's 82. This house is all he has. He knows he's on his way out. How can these people be so crazy because it's not our fault? KLINEFELTER: It's not uncommon for speculators to buy up properties and jack up rents. JOHN MOGK: What's unique in Detroit is the scale of the problem. KLINEFELTER: That's Wayne State University Professor John Mogk who says speculators have been gobbling up Detroit for decades, gambling that new development will dramatically increase property values. Mogk says other investors buy deteriorating buildings for as little as $500 a piece, then rent them as is. MOGK: And so a great many of these properties are being purchased by what previously we would call slumlords. And they're being rented without being brought up to the city code and milked. And eventually they may stop paying taxes. And as the homes become uninhabitable, they will again revert to the city. KLINEFELTER: It's a desperate cycle that Detroit officials are struggling to break. City officials say they don't want to be landlords. They just want the badly-needed tax revenue. Every time a speculator buys a property and let it sit vacant, it becomes a magnet for blight that does nothing to improve the city's long-term tax base. That's done by homeowners, and it remains to be seen just how many of the thousands facing imminent foreclosure will be able to make payment arrangements so that they can be the ones to provide that tax revenue.

HILLARY STEVENSON: Genscape does the James Bond approach and flies over the storage field twice a week. ARNOLD: That's Hillary Stevenson. She's a manager at Genscape. It's a kind of oil intelligence service that uses planes and helicopters and satellites to track where and how much oil there is all over the world. Some oil tanks in the U.

STEVENSON: By using IR, or infrared technology, cameras and flying over the tanks. ARNOLD: OK, so in Cushing, Okla. , there are these fields just filled with giant oil storage tanks. Some of them are the size of high school football stadiums, and Genscape estimates. . . STEVENSON: We're at about 70 percent utilization right now. ARNOLD: As the storage tanks get closer to full, some people think that that's going to drive oil prices lower. Now, nobody knows that for certain. There are lots of different scenarios, but as storage space gets tight, it gets increasingly more expensive to store oil.

ARNOLD: The price of oil's already fallen from around a hundred dollars a barrel last summer down to $45 or $50 lately. Morse says lack of storage space could drive oil down to around $20 a barrel. But there's plenty of disagreement about that. Brian Busch is the director of oil markets at Genscape. He thinks oil prices could fall, but not by that much. BRIAN BUSCH: If we saw crude oil that was trading in the $30 someplace - $38-$35 - that would not surprise me. ARNOLD: But Busch says you just never know. The recent fighting in Yemen pushed prices higher. If China's economy started suddenly growing faster that could raise prices. An Iran nuclear deal, on the other hand, that would probably push oil prices down. But even putting all those other factors aside, many experts just don't think we're actually going to get that close to running out of storage space. Rob Merriam tracks oil supplies for the Energy Information Administration. He says some of the current oil glut is actually seasonal.

Single-stream recycling ends up at a place called a materials recovery facility, or MRF - as in M-R-F - for short. A MRF is part warehouse, part industrial plant. A single facility can process hundreds of tons every day, using workers and high-tech machines. Brent Batliner manages the St. Louis area recycling division of Republic Services. He's standing next to something called an optical sorter. BRENT BATLINER: This machine is like a large grocery store scanner. It's got infrared scanners that, as material passes underneath it, it will read the chemical makeup of the bottle. LACAPRA: This optical sorter is set to scan for HDPE, or number two plastic. When a milk jug or detergent bottle reaches the scanner, a row of air jets sends it flying off the conveyor and into a storage bunker 25 feet below. BATLINER: Pops it right off the belt. LACAPRA: There are more optical sorters - a machine with a magnetic belt to capture steel and one with spinning magnets that repel aluminum. But even with all that high-tech equipment, single-stream recycling is far from perfect. Batliner says some of the residential single-stream recycling here does end up at a landfill.

The company is evolving over time, and when Wal-Mart makes a business decision, it matters a lot. Think about this; Wal-Mart is the third-largest employer in the world. It trails only the U. S. Defense Department and China's People's Liberation Army. In other words, Wal-Mart is the world's largest employer that does not operate large numbers of tanks and artillery. As the nation's biggest retailer, it influences what other retailers do. When Wal-Mart pushed down prices, its suppliers cut costs by moving overseas. And when Wal-Mart announced it would boost wages, competitors like Target followed suit. So we're going to spend some time examining Wal-Mart's past and future. This company, known for stores in small towns and suburbs, is pushing into center cities. Some local governments are pushing back. There was great controversy before Wal-Mart opened up two stores in Washington, D. C. , a little more than a year ago. One of those two Wal-Marts is just down the street from NPR's headquarters in a changing neighborhood, and our colleague, David Greene, starts our story there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: I am standing right now in downtown Washington, D. C. , at a street corner that really is a reflection of the changing face of the nation's capital. This is a place where power and poverty meet. And from right here, I can see the dome of the U. S. Capitol, and across the street from me, there's a complex of concrete public housing. There's kind of a sleek, new Peruvian chicken restaurant right there. And there is Wal-Mart. You can see skylights inside, and on the outside it's, you know, like, a four- or five-story building - very urban. This is defying all stereotypes of the big-box store we think about. The fact that Wal-Mart chose a place on the cusp of change really gives you an idea of where this company sees its future. And for the next two days, we're going to explore different facets of Wal-Mart. It's America's largest retailer, and it sets trends for the country's economy and its workforce. Now, before we talk about the future, we need to remember how Wal-Mart became the powerhouse it is today, and largely that was in rural communities. Wal-Mart is still arriving in rural places, and we want to turn to one of those places where my colleague Debbie Elliott is right now. It's Robertsdale, Ala. Debbie is on the line. Hey, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Hi, David. How are you? GREENE: I'm well, thank you. So paint me a picture of where you are exactly. ELLIOTT: So I'm in this small town. It's Robertsdale, Ala. , population about 6,000 people. And I am sitting out in the parking lot where the garden department has sort of spilled out. There are pink, potted azaleas for sale. This is your typical Wal-Mart big-box store. GREENE: Debbie, I mean, it was the sense that local mom-and-pop businesses would just go under whenever a Wal-Mart would come to town. Was that part of the debate in Robertsdale, that these low prices Wal-Mart charges would really drive local businesses out? ELLIOTT: You know, it was not. The mayor here, Charles Murphy, met me in front of the store to talk a little bit about the impact. He says while there wasn't a huge political outcry, there was a little bit of concern. MAYOR CHARLES MURPHY: Where we have seen the most competition that they have generated has been through the other two local grocery store chains. ELLIOTT: On the other hand, Mayor Murphy says since the Wal-Mart opened here, other local stores have actually seen a bit of a bump in walk-in traffic. MURPHY: Actually, what you're doing - you're just building a bigger pie. With the production of this store, probably on an average, they're pushing somewhere around 2,000 cars a day. So if you're a local business, then what you want to try to do is try to capture some of those customers that are coming to Wal-Mart to come to your business because now you've got something that stops them in Robertsdale. ELLIOTT: Already you can sort of see how Wal-Mart is beginning to shape the economy here. There's construction underway in the outparcels here. I talked with Mayor Murphy about that as well, and he thinks that Wal-Mart can be a catalyst for new business. And in fact, it brought some state investment - a million dollars the state of Alabama put into improving the roadways around here. And when the mayor looks out over the new corner that's been put in here, he sees potential for more commercial development on the south end of his town. And that's all because the Wal-Mart came. GREENE: Deb, you cover rural America often. I guess I just wonder, as you look back 10, 15 years, people were so concerned about losing the look of their towns when a Wal-Mart would come, small businesses would be driven out. The fact that it sounds like there are more people accepting of this, that you say large chains like Wal-Mart arrive and there's less opposition, what does that say about rural America today? ELLIOTT: Well, I just think that the changes over the last 20 years have taken root, and people don't notice them the way that they once did. Now most people have probably shopped at Wal-Mart somewhere, even if not in their hometown. GREENE: That's NPR's Debbie Elliott who is talking to us from a new Wal-Mart in the city of Robertsdale, Ala. Deb, thanks a lot. ELLIOTT: Thank you. GREENE: Now, as we mentioned, Wal-Mart is really trying to move into communities that look very different from the one that Debbie was just describing to us, and I'm standing in one of those places. We're in downtown Washington, D. C. This Wal-Mart looks entirely different. I'm standing here with NPR's Uri Berliner, who's been spending some time here. And, Uri, tell me what this means. What is Wal-Mart's strategy that brings them to a place like this? URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Well, Wal-Mart, if it wants to grow, it has to be in big cities. It's saturated the small towns and suburbs of America. It's everywhere. But in Northeastern cities and West Coast cities, that's really where Wal-Mart has been blocked or it hasn't really established a presence in walking cities, in blue state cities. GREENE: And this looks so different. We should say where we're standing. I mean, there's a bike rack here. It's like urban bike sharing. I mean, this neighborhood - it's just - it doesn't scream Wal-Mart. BERLINER: Right. There's a Bikeshare. There's a Starbucks around the corner, a luxury apartment building. And one thing you'll notice is that people are walking into the stores on foot. You don't see that in your suburban Wal-Mart. GREENE: All the differences, does that mean different challenges for the company as they come to places like the? BERLINER: A lot of different challenges. There are challenges of design. There's challenges of political opposition that they might not face in a small town or suburb. And then there's challenge of, what do you put in the store? And, David, I've spent some time in this store, and why don't we meet some of the people I've met? DONNA THOMAS: I got a rotisserie chicken (laughter) and a card and my prescription. BERLINER: That's that Donna Thomas (ph). She's walked over to this Wal-Mart near Capitol Hill on her lunch break. Thomas is as an executive assistant at Comcast. THOMAS: It's very practical for me, you know, because a lot of times when I - I don't have a lot of time to go shopping. So it's just convenient. I can just come in here, grab something and go. BERLINER: We're living in grab-and-go times. Meals planned out days in advance - that's just not happening. Justin Massa is the founder of a company called Food Genius that analyzes data for the food industry. JUSTIN MASSA: Depending on the version of the survey that you look at, somewhere between, you know, 70 to 80 percent of us don't know what we're going to have for dinner at about 4 p. m. BERLINER: That's one reason freshly prepared foods are so important to Wal-Mart and its competitors like Target and the big grocery chains. And in densely populated cities like Washington, ready-to-go is even more of a focus. DORN WENNINGER: So in some stores, we might sell lots of iceberg lettuce, for example. BERLINER: Dorn Wenninger is vice president for produce and floral at Wal-Mart U. S. WENNINGER: But in the Washington, D. C. , stores, you may see us selling much more of prepared salads or kits or the full salad bistro bowls, which are really on fire. BERLINER: Back at the store, Morgan Jones (ph) is buying one of those prepared salads. It's Southwest-style, marked down to $1. 99 from $3. 98. Yep, he likes the price. MORGAN JONES: You go to the store - this costs you $10 in a restaurant. It's a good deal, $1. 99 - probably my lunch and my dinner. It's a lot of it. It's a lot of lettuce and stuff, and it's really nice. BERLINER: Jones is studying hospitality at a local committee college. His verdict on Wal-Mart - salads, nice; labor practices, not as nice. JONES: There's a lot of problems. Sometimes they don't treat the cashiers right. They don't treat them right here. So, you know, they won't talk about it, but they don't treat the people right here sometimes. BERLINER: In this way, Jones is like many Wal-Mart customers. Any qualms they may have about worker pay or Chinese imports or Wal-Mart's obliteration of the mom-and-pop store downtown, they're outweighed by those low prices. JONES: I think it's a good deal. They need to treat the people a little bit better here. But other than that, it's a good deal. BERLINER: As Wal-Mart seeks a stronghold in big cities, it needs to do more than offer good deals. The company has plenty of competition, and not just from dollar stores and grocery chains. Wal-Mart is battling it out with restaurants, where, according to Justin Massa of Food Genius, Americans are spending half of their food dollars. MASSA: If you look in dense, urban areas, you will see that kind of split between grocery and restaurants go from, you know, roughly 50/50 to, you know, 70/30, 80/20 in favor of restaurants. BERLINER: And in big cities, Wal-Mart must cater to a different kind of customer, customers arriving by foot or bus, customers with smaller refrigerators and not much storage space, customers like Chi Fei Xie (ph), a law student at Georgetown. He's a buying just what he can carry back home, five minutes away. CHI FEI XIE: Just some salad, some bananas, yogurt, milk, cereal and some ramen noodles. GREENE: That last voice there, one of the customers NPR's Uri Berliner met inside the Wal-Mart here in downtown Washington, D. C. I'm standing with Uri outside the Wal-Mart. And, Uri, really, totally different territory, different questions for this company in a place like this. BERLINER: A lot of challenges here - customers coming into their stores on foot, buying fewer items at a time, customers who walk away from the store with their groceries in a backpack instead of a car or an SUV - very different kind of customer here. GREENE: And fierce opposition when Wal-Mart has come into cities. I mean, like, they were used to facing it in the past, but a different kind here, right? BERLINER: There was a big fight to get two Wal-Mart stores into Washington, D. C. And there are several cities, like Boston and New York and Seattle and San Francisco, where there are still no Wal-Marts. There's often a fight, especially when Wal-Mart comes into big cities. GREENE: And some of those fights have been about jobs. And we're going to hear about that on our next installment on Wal-Mart as our reporting goes on. NPR's Uri Berliner, thanks a lot. BERLINER: You're welcome, David. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Wal-Mart is shifting its business strategy. The company is evolving over time, and when Wal-Mart makes a business decision, it matters a lot. Think about this; Wal-Mart is the third-largest employer in the world. It trails only the U. S. Defense Department and China's People's Liberation Army. In other words, Wal-Mart is the world's largest employer that does not operate large numbers of tanks and artillery. As the nation's biggest retailer, it influences what other retailers do. When Wal-Mart pushed down prices, its suppliers cut costs by moving overseas. And when Wal-Mart announced it would boost wages, competitors like Target followed suit. So we're going to spend some time examining Wal-Mart's past and future. This company, known for stores in small towns and suburbs, is pushing into center cities. Some local governments are pushing back. There was great controversy before Wal-Mart opened up two stores in Washington, D. C. , a little more than a year ago. One of those two Wal-Marts is just down the street from NPR's headquarters in a changing neighborhood, and our colleague, David Greene, starts our story there. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  I am standing right now in downtown Washington, D. C. , at a street corner that really is a reflection of the changing face of the nation's capital. This is a place where power and poverty meet. And from right here, I can see the dome of the U. S. Capitol, and across the street from me, there's a complex of concrete public housing. There's kind of a sleek, new Peruvian chicken restaurant right there. And there is Wal-Mart. You can see skylights inside, and on the outside it's, you know, like, a four- or five-story building - very urban. This is defying all stereotypes of the big-box store we think about. The fact that Wal-Mart chose a place on the cusp of change really gives you an idea of where this company sees its future. And for the next two days, we're going to explore different facets of Wal-Mart. It's America's largest retailer, and it sets trends for the country's economy and its workforce. Now, before we talk about the future, we need to remember how Wal-Mart became the powerhouse it is today, and largely that was in rural communities. Wal-Mart is still arriving in rural places, and we want to turn to one of those places where my colleague Debbie Elliott is right now. It's Robertsdale, Ala. Debbie is on the line. Hey, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Hi, David. How are you? GREENE: I'm well, thank you. So paint me a picture of where you are exactly. ELLIOTT: So I'm in this small town. It's Robertsdale, Ala. , population about 6,000 people. And I am sitting out in the parking lot where the garden department has sort of spilled out. There are pink, potted azaleas for sale. This is your typical Wal-Mart big-box store. GREENE: Debbie, I mean, it was the sense that local mom-and-pop businesses would just go under whenever a Wal-Mart would come to town. Was that part of the debate in Robertsdale, that these low prices Wal-Mart charges would really drive local businesses out? ELLIOTT: You know, it was not. The mayor here, Charles Murphy, met me in front of the store to talk a little bit about the impact. He says while there wasn't a huge political outcry, there was a little bit of concern. MAYOR CHARLES MURPHY: Where we have seen the most competition that they have generated has been through the other two local grocery store chains. ELLIOTT: On the other hand, Mayor Murphy says since the Wal-Mart opened here, other local stores have actually seen a bit of a bump in walk-in traffic. MURPHY: Actually, what you're doing - you're just building a bigger pie. With the production of this store, probably on an average, they're pushing somewhere around 2,000 cars a day. So if you're a local business, then what you want to try to do is try to capture some of those customers that are coming to Wal-Mart to come to your business because now you've got something that stops them in Robertsdale. ELLIOTT: Already you can sort of see how Wal-Mart is beginning to shape the economy here. There's construction underway in the outparcels here. I talked with Mayor Murphy about that as well, and he thinks that Wal-Mart can be a catalyst for new business. And in fact, it brought some state investment - a million dollars the state of Alabama put into improving the roadways around here. And when the mayor looks out over the new corner that's been put in here, he sees potential for more commercial development on the south end of his town. And that's all because the Wal-Mart came. GREENE: Deb, you cover rural America often. I guess I just wonder, as you look back 10, 15 years, people were so concerned about losing the look of their towns when a Wal-Mart would come, small businesses would be driven out. The fact that it sounds like there are more people accepting of this, that you say large chains like Wal-Mart arrive and there's less opposition, what does that say about rural America today?

The U. S. economy gained 126,000 jobs last month. That's just about half of the job gains analysts had expected. On a better note, hourly wages actually went up a bit. Since the recession, the vast majority of workers haven't seen any real wage increases, so this starting to change, at least for low-income workers. McDonald's announced just this week it will pay workers a dollar more than the local minimum wage. NPR's Chris Arnold has more. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: All of a sudden, some of the biggest employers in the U. S. are giving their low-wage workers a raise. Wal-Mart, Target, the parent company of Marshalls and T. J. Maxx, they all now say they're boosting pay to at least $9 an hour this year. Some will go to $10 next year. For Wal-Mart alone, that's a pay raise for half a million Americans. U. S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez told NPR today he thinks all this is a good sign. TOM PEREZ: I applaud what Wal-Mart has done and TJX and most recently McDonald's, who also added five days of paid sick leave for full-time people and a pro-rata share for part-time people. That's a step in the right direction. ARNOLD: Still the McDonald's pay hike covers the company-owned stores, not the 90 percent of locations that are franchises. Perez says, of course, there is something that Congress could do to reach a lot more workers - raise the minimum wage. PEREZ: Because there are still too many people working a full-time job and living in poverty, and that's just not who we are as a nation. ARNOLD: And actually, even with the $1 an hour pay raise announcement by McDonald's, some workers are still less than enthusiastic. JAHMEER CALHOUN: For me, it's really - doesn't mean much, and it's not enough. ARNOLD: That's Jahmeer Calhoun, who works at a McDonalds in Los Angeles as a shift manager. He already makes $9. 35 an hour. Calhoun is married and has a young child, and he says he and his wife have to scrape money together any way they can. CALHOUN: That runs the gamut of family, friends, public assistance, temp jobs, helping people move; those types of things. ARNOLD: It's been hard to survive, though, on fast food wages for a long time, so why are these companies boosting pay right now? In McDonalds' case, the fast food industry's been under fire from worker protests. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Hold the burger. Hold the fries. Make our wages supersized. ARNOLD: Those were workers outside a McDonalds in Milwaukee yesterday. John Gordon is the founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group. He tracks chain restaurants, and he says in part McDonald's is worried about its image. He says it's not just the worker protests. There was a scandal over the meats being used at restaurants across China and Japan. JOHN GORDON: The problems have been horrendous. A longtime McDonalds provider was using bad beef, expired beef. ARNOLD: But image problems aside, Gordon says the biggest factor is probably just basic economics. GORDON: They are doing it because the economy has picked up and the restaurants that I cover, all of them, even Cheesecake Factory, you know, has noted increased labor costs because turnover has ratcheted up. And they are generally paying people more so they don't lose them. ARNOLD: That sounds like a good thing - more job options and better pay for workers. But actually, so far in this recession when you adjust for inflation, the only workers seeing any real wage gains are at the very bottom and the very top of the pay scale. Larry Katz is a labor economist at Harvard. We asked him does all this mean that we're going to start to see better pay for the middle class too? LARRY KATZ: Yes, I think we will, but it's going to be slow. ARNOLD: Katz says, though, one thing that could boost pay for some people more quickly - new overtime rules. Katz says the federal rules are outdated. If your company pays you just $25,000 a year but calls you a manager, it's not required to pay you overtime. A new federal rule to fix that will be announced this spring. Chris Arnold, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  Underwhelming news from the Labor Department today. The U.

The government says U. S. employers added far fewer jobs to their payrolls last month than expected. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, job creation was just half of what analysts had predicted. Among the reasons was bad weather. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The U. S. economy created just 126,000 jobs in March. That follows 12 straight months of increases over 200,000, the best showing in 20 years. Economist John Canally of LPL Financial in Boston says bad weather during the past couple of months contributed to the weak job growth. That caused weak hiring in construction and retail, hotels and restaurants. JOHN CANALLY: But you also have to say that the West Coast port strike had an impact because manufacturing is weak. But also the stronger dollar had an impact because we saw weakness in export-oriented jobs. YDSTIE: The big decline in oil prices also contributed to the weak showing. Oil-drillers have been shutting down rigs as the oil glut has cut prices in half over the past nine months. Last month, employment in the mining sector, which includes oil drilling, fell by 11,000. Layoffs reported by oil companies are even higher. Canally says he doesn't believe this clunker of a report reflects the new trend in job creation. He thinks the pace remains around 200,000 a month. But he says the weak number in today's report will give the Federal Reserve something to think about as it considers when to begin raising interest rates. CANALLY: You know, if the Federal Reserve was thinking about raising rates as soon as June, they're probably not going to because this report suggests that the labor market is not making as much progress as they would have thought. YDSTIE: Canally says there were a couple of bright spots in this report. The unemployment rate remained at 5. 5 percent, and the pace of wage increases accelerated a bit.

YDSTIE: Canally says there were a couple of bright spots in this report. The unemployment rate remained at 5. 5 percent, and the pace of wage increases accelerated a bit.

That's when police departments require officers to deliver a set number of tickets or arrests. Police routinely denied using quotas, but critics say that numbers-based policing is real and corrodes the community's relationship with law enforcement. NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: New York City police officers generally don't like to talk on the record, especially about a touchy subject like quotas. But Adhyl Polanco is an exception. OFFICER ADHYL POLANCO: The culture of the department, the way they see, is that you're not working unless you are writing summonses or arresting people. ROSE: Polanco joined the force in 2005. Pretty quickly, he says, it became clear that his supervisors only cared about two things - tickets and arrests. POLANCO: I can tell my supervisors that I took three people to the hospital and I saved their lives, that the child that I helped deliver, you know, he's healthy. I can tell them that, but that's not going to cut it. ROSE: Polanco says there was an unwritten rule that he was expected to get 20 and one - 20 tickets and one arrest, per month. But it was tough to get anyone outside the department to believe him because NYPD officials would always deny there were any quotas. They still do. Here's Commissioner William Bratton in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)COMMISSIONER WILLIAM BRATTON: There is no specific target number that we go for. There are no quotas, if you will. ROSE: Since taking over the department last year, Bratton has insisted he's more interested in the quality of arrests than the quality. The NYPD declined to comment for this story. Back in 2008, Officer Polanco was determined to expose the department's alleged quota system, so he secretly recorded conversations inside his precinct house in the Bronx. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Next week, it could be 25 and one. It could be 35 and one. ROSE: Polanco says the man you hear on the tape is a sergeant. He's pushing his officers to get their numbers up. If they don't, he threatens, it could be even worse. The quota could be 25 tickets a month, or 35. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: If any of you decide you're going to quit this job (unintelligible) Pizza Hut delivery man, this is what you're going to be doing until that. ROSE: In other words. . . POLANCO: We're going to fire you and you're going to become a Pizza Hut delivery man. You're going to get fired. ROSE: Now Polanco is suing the NYPD, one of several whistleblower lawsuits under alleged quotas at the department. Arrest and ticket quotas are illegal in several states, including New York, Illinois, California and Florida. But even former law enforcement officials will tell you they still exist. CHUCK WEXLER: Does it happen in some places? Yeah, I'm sure it does. ROSE: Chuck Wexler directs the Police Executive Research Forum. He says there are 18,000 police departments across the country and some of them probably do have quotas. WEXLER: On the one hand, there is an understandable desire to have productivity from your officers. But telling them that, you know, you have to arrest X number of people or you have to cite X number of people, it just encourages bad performance on the part of officers. ROSE: Wexler says the problem can get especially bad if officers start to view the community they're policing as a source of revenue. That, according to the Department of Justice, is exactly what happened in Ferguson, Mo. As NPR and others have reported, the largely white police there wrote huge numbers of tickets for the city's black residents, collecting millions of dollars in fines every year. LAURIE ROBINSON: Our view is that this is not solely a Ferguson problem. ROSE: Laurie Robinson co-chairs President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. She's also a former assistant attorney general. The task force concluded that numbers-based policing sends the wrong message to the public. ROBINSON: If citizens believe that tickets are being issued or arrests are being made for reasons other than the goal of law enforcement, which is about public safety, then their trust in the legitimacy of the system is really eroded. ROSE: So why does numbers-based policing seem to persist in some departments? Maybe because it's an easy way to track officer productivity. Tim Dees is a retired Reno, Nev. police officer who also taught criminal justice. Dees says it's the quality of police work that counts, not the quantity. TIM DEES: That's a much more difficult metric to gauge. The satisfaction of the citizen - it's very difficult to put a value on that. And it's much easier for, frankly, lazy administrators to make it into a numbers game. ROSE: But some rank and file cops say the numbers game can actually make their jobs harder. NYPD officer Adhyl Polanco says that in order to be effective, he needs the trust of the community. POLANCO: Nobody in the community want people selling drugs in their building. Nobody in the community wants shootings. You know, so if we work with the people that don't want that, together we can identify who the criminals are. But what happens when you start harassing innocent people because I have to come up with my 20?

Things aren't perfect by any stretch, but economies are growing again. Employment rates are up and consumers feel more optimistic, which is important. That is not the case in Greece. In the last 48 hours, this battered country appears to have once again averted bankruptcy. Somehow, Greece has found money to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars to the IMF by an April 9 deadline. But the Greek government says the coffers are now almost empty and Europe is seriously worried. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Why is Greece having such a hard time convincing international creditors, namely Germany, that it can get a deal done? MARTIN: Years of instability led to rioting in the streets in 2010. And ultimately, all that angst swept up in a new political party this past January, a party that promised to make everything better. Months after those elections, Greece is still on the edge of a potential disaster with global implications. For The Record today, escaping a Greek tragedy. In a moment, we'll speak with the American poet and MacArthur fellow A. E. Stallings, who's made her home in Greece. But first, we're going to introduce you to three Greeks living through the financial crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: First up, graduate student Konstantina Diamanti. KONSTANTINA DIAMANTI: I live in Athens. I'm 24 years old and I'm a student. I feel that my hopes are getting lesser and lesser. MARTIN: Diamanti's thinking about leaving Greece all together, maybe going to Germany where she feels she'll have more opportunities. DIAMANTI: It will be difficult. I don't believe in utopias and I don't believe it's going to be a paradise there. But, I certainly hope for something better. STATHIS KIRILLIDIS: My name is Stathis Kirillidis. I am a school teacher at an elementary school in Athens. MARTIN: Kirillidis went into teaching because it's a stable government job. Not anymore. A couple years ago, he saw his paycheck cut by 20 percent. At the same time, he finds himself shelling out more money to buy school supplies for his first grade students because the school is no longer reimbursing him for those basics. He sees his students suffering from this crisis, too. KIRILLIDIS: They don't wear proper clothes. They have old clothes, old shoes. You can see that. There is also more bullying in the classroom or outside the classroom - school violence, things like that, yeah. Luckily, we have support from hospitals that provide us with sandwiches and milk and yogurt every day. And we can give that to the children. MARTIN: I asked him if he is thinking about maybe moving out of the country, if that's even an option for him if things don't improve. KIRILLIDIS: Yes, it is. Yes. I feel really embarrassed to say that, but it's true. MARTIN: Where would you go? KIRILLIDIS: I would go to a normal country where I would like to have more political stability, social stability, things like that, you know? If you really ask me, it didn't hurt me so much, the financial problem of my personal situation, than the humiliation that my country is not able to deliver social things, political things that are for granted in other serious countries. MARTIN: So that's the view from a student, a government-employed teacher, and now, the entrepreneur. THANOS KOSMIDIS: I am Thanos Kosmidis. I live in Athens, Greece. MARTIN: That's where he's running a medical technology start-up. When the 35-year-old Kosmidis was growing up, Greece was on an upswing. The country had just joined the European Union. It was one of the weakest members, so it had a lot to gain and it was setting itself up to make the most of that partnership. KOSMIDIS: Today, things are much more worrying. MARTIN: And while Kosmidis is committed to growing his business in his home country, he is keeping his options open. KOSMIDIS: We really want to make it there in a way that there will be people that will be employed in Greece. At the same time - I will be honest with you - we will not sacrifice at all costs. If we see that Greece as a system, as a country, does not want us to grow, it's clearly not the place to be for us. MARTIN: That was Greek businessman Thanos Kosmidis, elementary school teacher Stathis Kirillidis and graduate student Konstantina Diamanti. Now to the American poet, Alicia Stallings. She lives in Athens with her Greek husband and their two kids. ALICIA STALLINGS: We live in a neighborhood called Neos Kosmos - the new world. It is a sort of working-class neighborhood but very close to the center. It's got everything you need. You can have your shoes mended, you know, there are schools there, tavernas. I think when we first moved in here, it was sort of starting to gentrify. And that has reversed - people going through the trash, you see homeless people. MARTIN: Do you hear people talking about how much responsibility that Greeks themselves bear for the current situation? STALLINGS: You do. A lot of the anger for things in Greece often would be sort of automatically put on the Americans or various other people. And I think now Greeks are very angry with their own politicians, with their own political system, with the fact that nobody seems to go to jail. The top one percent gets off scot-free. There's a lot of anger and discussion about this. MARTIN: You have turned to writing, this kind of social journalism, to record the Greek experience for an American audience. What have you found American readers to be most surprised by? STALLINGS: Sometimes there's an idea that if you are an expat living in Greece, you have this ideal life on an island and everything's like a vacation. And I think writing about the sort of nitty-gritty, you know, when there were a lot of riots dealing with tear gas and various dysfunctions, I think that has surprised people. I think I also write a lot about how poetry ends up in the political discourse and I think Americans are surprised by that. So there's, to me, a kind of interesting interaction with literature and what is happening all of the time that seems very alive, very present on the streets. MARTIN: You've got a unique viewpoint. You're an American living in Greece. You are used to observing humanity at its best and worst as a poet and through your writing. Can you help us understand your take on why Greeks are in this mess? STALLINGS: I've thought about what if something similar were happening in the States and how Greeks, I think, are taking these things sort of differently. One thing for instance, my mother-in-law - who's a very elegant, spry 83-year-old - she has, in her lifetime, she as a little girl saw the German tanks roll down Syngrou Avenue. She saw famine, people dying on the streets of hunger, civil war, the chunta (ph). So I think her perspective and a lot of older Greeks is, it could be worse, we've gone through worse. So I think there's a certain amount of resilience. MARTIN: Alicia Stallings, better known as the poet A. E. Stallings, joining us from Greece. Thanks so much for talking with us, Alicia. STALLINGS: Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: And this is For The Record.

There are 22 states where if someone falls behind on payments, they can have their professional licenses - the ones they need to do jobs like nursing or engineering - suspended or revoked. A couple of states can even take away driver's licenses. One state is rolling those sanctions back as Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports. ERIC WHITNEY, BYLINE: Clementine Lindley said she had a great college experience, but if she had it to do over again, she probably wouldn't pick an expensive private school. CLEMENTINE LINDLEY: I could actually buy a small home in Helena, Mont. , with the amount of debt that I graduated with. WHITNEY: Fresh out of school, Lindley says there were times when she had to decide whether to pay rent, buy food or make her student loan payments. LINDLEY: There was a time where I defaulted on my student loans enough that I never was sent to collections, but just long enough to, honestly, ruin my credit. WHITNEY: That was motivation enough for Lindley to figure out ways to make her payments. But had she defaulted longer, the state of Montana could've revoked her driver's license. When Democratic state Representative Moffie Funk learned that that was a potential consequence, she says she felt. . . REPRESENTATIVE MOFFIE FUNK: Embarrassment, I would say. I think it is demeaning. I think it is unnecessarily punitive. WHITNEY: Not to mention, she says, counterproductive. If the goal is to get people to make loan payments, taking away their ability to drive to work just makes it harder for them to make money, especially in rural states. FUNK: There isn't public transportation, or very little. You know, people need cars in Montana. WHITNEY: So Funk wrote a bill ending the state's right to revoke professional driver's licenses because of student loan defaults. Dustin Weeden, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says lots of states passed license revocation laws for student loan defaulters in the 1990s and early 2000s, back before the federal government started taking on a bigger role in lending to students. DUSTIN WEEDEN: Because states were essentially the direct lenders to students, many states had large loan portfolios. WHITNEY: Weeden says tying student loans to licenses, which often have to be renewed every couple of years, created a process to find people when they defaulted. WEEDEN: The state loan authorities would report anybody who had defaulted on loans to all the licensing entities around the state. Then it's a way for a state to identify that person and help them really get into repayment. WHITNEY: But some policymakers want to retain consequences for defaulting, like Montana Republican State Sen. Dee Brown. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SENATOR DEE BROWN: Because I think that this is one of the sticks that we can use over a kid who is not paying their student loans. It's a stick to get their attention. And what a better way than their driver's license? WHITNEY: There are plenty of sticks already, like having your wages garnished and your credit ruined, says Clementine Lindley, who's been in student loan default. LINDLEY: Removing my driver's license, you've just created one more barrier for me being a productive citizen in my community. WHITNEY: The Montana bill to take away license revocation as a consequence for student loan default passed with bipartisan support. That wasn't the case in Iowa. An attempt to repeal a similar law there failed earlier this year. For NPR News, I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula.

FUNK: There isn't public transportation, or very little. You know, people need cars in Montana. WHITNEY: So Funk wrote a bill ending the state's right to revoke professional driver's licenses because of student loan defaults. Dustin Weeden, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says lots of states passed license revocation laws for student loan defaulters in the 1990s and early 2000s, back before the federal government started taking on a bigger role in lending to students. DUSTIN WEEDEN: Because states were essentially the direct lenders to students, many states had large loan portfolios. WHITNEY: Weeden says tying student loans to licenses, which often have to be renewed every couple of years, created a process to find people when they defaulted. WEEDEN: The state loan authorities would report anybody who had defaulted on loans to all the licensing entities around the state. Then it's a way for a state to identify that person and help them really get into repayment. WHITNEY: But some policymakers want to retain consequences for defaulting, like Montana Republican State Sen. Dee Brown. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SENATOR DEE BROWN: Because I think that this is one of the sticks that we can use over a kid who is not paying their student loans. It's a stick to get their attention. And what a better way than their driver's license? WHITNEY: There are plenty of sticks already, like having your wages garnished and your credit ruined, says Clementine Lindley, who's been in student loan default. LINDLEY: Removing my driver's license, you've just created one more barrier for me being a productive citizen in my community. WHITNEY: The Montana bill to take away license revocation as a consequence for student loan default passed with bipartisan support. That wasn't the case in Iowa. An attempt to repeal a similar law there failed earlier this year. For NPR News, I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula.", "section": "Education", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

Part of that appears to be jeans losing a battle with gym clothes. And one item in particular caught the eye of NPR's Sam Sanders. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: My last three or four times out shopping in Los Angeles, I've noticed more men walking through malls not in blue jeans but in sweatpants - sometimes very fancy sweatpants like the ones Lee Davis is wearing. How would you describe these pants? LEE DAVIS: They're like a jogger. So they. . . SANDERS: So they've got, like, an elastic leg. DAVIS: Yeah, at the bottom - and they're kind of in between a sweatpant and a dress pant. SANDERS: The material is upscale, and the fit is tailored. He's wearing them with a white T-shirt and a professional black cardigan. DAVIS: Denim sometimes can be really looked at as just casual. This makes it a little more dressy because of the material. SANDERS: How much were those? DAVIS: About 195. SANDERS: 195? DAVIS: Yeah. SANDERS: Worth it? DAVIS: Yeah (laughter). SANDERS: So how did we get here? Well, it's part of a trend called athleisure - clothes that used to be gym-only replacing things like jeans and button-up shirts. Workout wear is now 17 percent of the entire closing market. H&M, Urban Outfitters, Aeropostale and Topshop have all launched athleisure lines. Will McKitterick is a retail analyst with IBISWorld. For him, two big factors explain the athleisure movement.  First. . . WILL MCKITTERICK: A change in what's appropriate to wear. SANDERS: Women led this charge. Over the last decade or so, they've made yoga pants and tights and leggings acceptable just about anywhere. McKitterick also thinks some of it's linked to the recent fall of the blue jean. MCKITTERICK: Men and people more generally have a lot of jeans. SANDERS: He thinks we're all a bit jeaned-out. MCKITTERICK: Jean sales have done really well over the past 10 years. But fashion denim is cyclical. We're in a downturn period right now. And that's not too surprising coming off the large amount of sales that we've seen over the past 10 years. SANDERS: McKitterick actually has his own pair of fancy sweats. MCKITTERICK: Wearing them outside will be the next step. But I don't know if I'm there yet. SANDERS: Hi, Tyler. I'm Sam. TYLER KANTOR: Sam. SANDERS: Good to meet you. KANTOR: Now, have you been in the shop before? SANDERS: I have not. KANTOR: OK. SANDERS: Tyler Kantor manages the Bonobo's menswear store in Los Angeles - a store that sells $100 sweatpants. Kantor says all kinds of guys buy them. KANTOR: You're going to have your fashion-forward guy who's going to come in here specifically looking for the jogger-type sweat. And then you've got your customers who - it catches their eyes. SANDERS: And then are guys who didn't even know they wanted sweatpants. KANTOR: Those of the fun one for us, where we get to kind of guide them towards the sweat, get them outside of their comfort zone. SANDERS: I tried on a pair myself. All right - putting them on (laughter). They're little snug. They felt good. But honestly, I had my doubts about wearing them in public. So I asked Washington Post fashion critic Robin Ghivann how to pull it off. Ghivann says blend the sweatpants casual with a bit of professional because that's how the whole trend started - urban men wearing half their closet out of necessity. ROBIN GHIVANN: The guy on his way to the office - but he's going to stop at the gym beforehand. He's got on a pair of sweatpants, but maybe he's got his blazer over the sweatpants because he doesn't want to put the blazer in a gym bag. SANDERS: For Ghivann, it's simple. GHIVANN: You don't dress down to the sweatpant. You dress the sweatpants up. SANDERS: As someone who's tried them on himself. . . They look plush. I want to just, like, put them on and go watch Netflix. Trust me - dressing these things up may be easier said than done. Sam Sanders, NPR News.

The $485 million payment came as a big relief to the financial markets, which have been worried that Athens might default on its debts. But Greece has more loans coming due later this month, and its funds are growing tight. NPR's Jim Zarroli has more. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Greece's left-wing government came to power in January promising to take a much tougher stance with the country's creditors, who've imposed punishing austerity measures on the country. The government's rhetoric set it up on a collision course with the major Eurozone powers, but today the Athens government blinked and a crisis was at least temporarily averted. MIT's Simon Johnson is the IMF's former chief economist. SIMON JOHNSON: The fact they made the payment means that the discussions continue with the European Union, and all the options are still on the table. But the situation is very delicate and quite difficult. ZARROLI: Over the next few weeks, Greece faces deadlines on bonds it issued and also is supposed to make another large payment to the IMF. But it's not clear Athens has the funds to do so. And to borrow in the private markets, Greece would have to pay exceptionally high interest rates. In recent weeks, Greek officials have been sitting down with European finance ministers in an effort to revise the payment terms. Today, IMF head Christine Lagarde said the talks should continue. CHRISTINE LAGARDE: It's a difficult path, but it's one that has to be walked and which will just improve the situation. ZARROLI: But Greece's creditors want tougher cuts in public sector wages and benefits, as well as tax increases. And Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the country has already suffered enough. This week, Tsipras raised eyebrows across Europe with a trip to Moscow. Saddled with its own economic problems, Russia probably can't help Greece much financially, but European Union officials are contemplating further sanctions against Moscow because of its annexation of Crimea. And Russia is eager to strengthen its friendship with Greece. Eswar Prasad is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ESWAR PRASAD: The Eurozone is required to act by consensus on such measures. And if Greece withheld support from those measures, it would give Russia a little more breathing room, a little more leverage in dealing with the Eurozone. ZARROLI: Still, Greece has a weak hand to play in Europe. Two years ago, European officials were terrified that a default by Greece could reverberate throughout the financial system. Today, Europe's economy is still anemic, but the banking system is stronger, and smaller countries like Ireland and Portugal are in better shape.

The movement was born at tiny Swarthmore College near Philadelphia. And the campaign has had some notable wins in the past year. But Swarthmore students have been staging a sit-in for almost a month at the school trying to make their voices heard. From member station WHYY, Carolyn Beeler reports. SARA BLAZEVIC: So together, they go like this - just listen. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) We will build power. . . CAROLYN BEELER, BYLINE: Dozens of students are crowded into a hallway outside the finance offices at Swarthmore College learning a new protest song. It's the first day of an extended sit-in at the elite Liberal Arts college. BLAZEVIC: We're asking for our school to sell its holdings in the top 200 coal, oil and gas companies. . . BEELER: That's senior Sara Blazevic. BLAZEVIC: . . . Because divestment is a way for our school as an institution with a lot of social standing and a lot of clout to stigmatize the fossil fuel industry. BEELER: That stigma is key. Climate change activist Bill McKibben, who visited Swarthmore on day eight of the sit-in, explained divestment isn't meant to stop the flow of cash to well-capitalized energy companies. BILL MCKIBBEN: No one's under the illusion that if Swarthmore or any other college sells its shares in Exxon, that will immediately bankrupt Exxon. What it will do is begin the process - further the process of politically bankrupting them. BEELER: By that, he means creating a world where campaign contributions from fossil fuel companies will carry the same stigma as cash from big tobacco. MCKIBBEN: Making it much harder for them to dominate our political life the way they have. Because this is the richest industry on Earth, it has way more political influence than it deserves. BEELER: Swarthmore's divestment movement began back in 2011, says Sara Blazevic. BLAZEVIC: When our campaign started, it was sort of scrappy, it didn't have a ton of support, we didn't have a network the way that the divestment movement has a network now. And then it grew really quickly. BEELER: Hundreds of schools now have divestment campaigns. They've been successful at about two dozen U. S. colleges and universities; most recently at Syracuse, the largest endowment to date to commit to fully divesting. Many other schools, though, have said no to divestment including Swarthmore in 2013. GIL KEMP: Primarily because we thought divestment would be too costly. BEELER: That's Gil Kemp, chair of the school's Board of Managers. He says it would cost the school's roughly $2 billion endowment $11 to $15 million a year in returns. What's more, he argues stigmatizing fossil fuels won't reduce the amount of carbon released into the environment. KEMP: Reducing our carbon footprint is a more effective way of dealing with this very real issue of climate change and global warming. BEELER: Divestment is a controversial tactic even among those working on climate change solutions. Andrew Holland is an energy and climate fellow at the nonpartisan American Security Project in Washington, D. C. , which researches the impact of climate change on national defense. ANDREW HOLLAND: There are effective ways to fight climate change, and there are ineffective ways to fight climate change. And I think that the divestment movement fundamentally is looking in the wrong direction. BEELER: Endowments at the 500 richest U. S. colleges and universities are worth nearly $500 billion. It's not known how much of that is invested in fossil fuel companies. But for some perspective, NYU, Bowdoin and Middlebury have all recently disclosed this information and fossil fuels make up between 1. 4 and 5 percent of their endowments. Financial experts say even full divestiture would have little impact on the energy industry. And the moral argument doesn't hold water with Holland. HOLLAND: Listen, I mean, stigma doesn't work for the fossil fuel companies. These companies are already stigmatized. You're not going to stop Jim Inhofe or other hard-right Republicans from taking money from fossil fuel companies because a bunch of professors at Stanford or Swarthmore determine they don't like Exxon Mobil. BEELER: Plenty of student movements have begun and ended without the targeted industries batting an eye. Today, though, anti-fossil fuel activists claim kinship to the anti-Apartheid divestment movement of the 1980s, which also started on college campuses amid choruses of criticism.

Singer Bing Crosby was the host. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"COMMAND PERFORMANCE\")BING CROSBY: Well, it looks like this is it. What can you say at a time like this? You can't throw your skimmer in the air. That's for run-of-the-mill holidays. I guess all that anybody can do is thank God it's over. CORNISH: When New York Times columnist David Brooks heard a rebroadcast of this program, it got him thinking about how Americans, at one time, could mark triumph without boasting. DAVID BROOKS: And I was really struck at this supreme moment of American triumph, that they weren't beating their chests. They weren't super proud of themselves. They were deeply humble. And I found that so beautiful and so moving. And I thought there's really something to admire in that public culture. CORNISH: A culture that, he says, is lost today. In his latest book, \"The Road To Character,\" David Brooks goes on a personal journey, trying to apply the lessons of history to himself. He said he's been measuring his success in life by career, which turns out to be ultimately unfulfilling. BROOKS: You know, I achieved way more career success than I'd ever imagined. And I rediscovered the elemental truth. It doesn't make you happy. And then I would come across people once a month who just - they just glowed. I remember I was up in Frederick, Md. , visiting some people who tutor immigrants. They teach them English and how to read. And I walk into room of 30 people, mostly women, probably 50 to 80 years old, and they just radiated a generosity of spirit. They radiated a patience. And most of all, they radiated gratitude for life. And I remember thinking, you know, I've achieved career success in life, but I haven't achieved that. What they have is that inner-light that I do not have. And I've only got one life. I'd like to at least figure out how to get there. And so I really wrote the book to save my soul, if you want to put it grandly - to figure out, how can I be more like that? And writing a book doesn't get you there, but at least gives you a roadmap. CORNISH: You're really hard on yourself in the opening pages. It makes me feel like maybe your Google Alerts are on. . . (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: . . . And you are listening to your critics. But here's your description of your job - that you're (reading) more or less paid to be a narcissistic blowhard, to volume my opinions to appear more confident about them than I really am, to appear smarter than I really am, to appear better and more authoritative than I really am. I have to work harder than most people to avoid a life of smug superficiality. BROOKS: I don't think that's hard on myself. I think that's just honest about myself. We're both in a weird job where we're in front of a microphone, and that presents character challenges where we can think we're right all the time or we get a lot of attention. But I do think the turning point in a life toward maturity is looking inside yourself and saying, what's the weakness that I have that leads to behavior that I'm not proud of? And I'd say, for me, it's evolved. It used to be I just lived life on the surface, thinking about politics only or thinking about sort of superficial success only. I think I'm a little better at that, but I still have the core sin of wanting everybody to love me and avoiding conflict. And so I have to look at that every day and figure out, how can I be a little better on that? And in the book, I have so many characters who have different core sins. For Bayard Rustin, a great civil rights leader, it was ego early in life - ego. For Dorothy Day, she was fragmented. Her life was all over the place, just scattered. For George Eliot, the novelist, desperate neediness for intimacy. For Dwight Eisenhower, it was his passion. He was an angry, angry man. And so each of the characters in the book confronts some core sin, and they figure out a way to beat it. And by the end of their lives, they've become strong in their weakest places, and they're meant to serve as models for the rest of us. CORNISH: They make some sort of shift, I guess? BROOKS: Yeah, all the characters in the book. And it's like an assembly of friends. They're, like, in my life now. And I greet them. I try to live up to their standards, and I try to follow their examples. CORNISH: Pundit and columnist - wrong business for character building? BROOKS: Every job has its challenges. Every job presents a character challenge. Sometimes, you know, we're branding ourselves all the time. If you're trying to get jobs, you're boasting about how great you are. Or if you're on social media, you're, you know, presenting the world with a highlight reel of your life that you put on Facebook. And so we live in a culture I call in the book the culture of the big me, where we're really praised and rewarded for celebrating ourselves all the time. My favorite statistic about this is that in 1950 the Gallup organization asked high school seniors, are you a very important person? And in 1950, 12 percent said yes. They asked again in 2005, and it was 80 percent who said they were a very important person. So we live in a culture that encourages us to be big about ourselves. And I think the starting point of trying to build inner-goodness is to be a little smaller about yourself. CORNISH: So what about people who hear this and think, actually, it seems like people in politics are constantly telling us their morals - right? - constantly finger-wagging and telling us about morality, in fact, that it's become so tied to that in terms of the language and public view of that concept. BROOKS: Well, two things. First, if you're finger-wagging, you're probably not doing it well because it starts with looking inside yourself, seeing your own weakness and then joining with others to combat your weaknesses together. You can't do it alone. Second, we do it in a very superficial, symbolic way. So we'll talk about issues that are important. We'll talk about issues of war and peace. We'll talk about issues like abortion and gay marriage. And those are moral issues, but you can talk about those issues and not really cultivate the virtues that really matter. You can do it without humility. You can do it without honesty. You can do it without courage. And so character is a way of living. It's not a series of positions you take. CORNISH: Now, you write that you lacked a concrete moral vocabulary. What did you mean by vocabulary? BROOKS: I think a lot of us have - and there have been - certainly been studies on that. There are certain words that have been passed down through the generations that we've sort of left behind. And some of them have quasi-religious connotations, but I don't think they need to. Those are words like grace, the idea that we're loved more than we deserve, redemption and sin. We now use the word sin in the context of fattening desserts. But it used to be central in the vocabulary, whether you're religious or not, an awareness that we all sin and we all have the same sins - selfishness, self-centeredness. And I think rediscovering that word is an important task because without that, you just are too egotistical. You don't realize how broken we all are at some level. CORNISH: Now, you've called yourself a recovering secularist in the past. Have you moved past recovering into something else? And, if so, what is that? BROOKS: Yeah. So I'm a believer. I don't talk about my religious life in public, in part because it's so shifting and green and vulnerable. And so I've spent a lot of time in this book - and if you care about morality and inner life and character, you spend your time reading a lot of theology because over the last hundreds of years, it was theologians who were writing about this. Whether you're a believer or not, I think these books are very helpful. It's amazing to read Augustine, the Confessions, and a guy who got successful as a rhetorician but felt hollow inside, a guy who had a mom, Monica, who was the helicopter mom to beat all helicopter moms and how he dealt with the conflict with such a demanding mother. And so I read a lot of theology, whether it's C. S. Lewis or Joseph Soloveitchik, a Rabbi. And it's produced a lot of religious upsurge in my heart, but it's also fragile and green that I don't really talk about it because I don't want to trample the fresh grass. CORNISH: David Brooks. His new book is called \"The Road To Character. \" Thank you so much for speaking with me. BROOKS: Thanks so much, Audie. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: During this conversation, David Brooks says that in 1950 the Gallup organization asked high school seniors the question \"are you a very important person? \" and \"12 percent said yes. \" Brooks also says \"[Gallup] asked again in 2005, and it was 80 percent who said they were a very important person. \" He mistakenly attributed the survey to Gallup. While the study of adolescent attitudes supports the sociological trend, the survey was done by other researchers and in different years than the ones he mentioned. Brooks was citing material in his book The Road to Character. Its eBook edition has now been updated to say: \"Between 1948 and 1954, psychologists asked more than 10,000 adolescents whether they considered themselves to be a very important person. At that point, 12 percent said yes. The same question was revisited in 1989, and this time it wasn't 12 percent who considered themselves very important, it was 80 percent of boys and 77 percent of girls. \"] AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   The day after Japan surrendered in August, 1945, and the end the Second World War ended, a radio program called \"Command Performance\" aired. Singer Bing Crosby was the host. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"COMMAND PERFORMANCE\") BING CROSBY: Well, it looks like this is it. What can you say at a time like this? You can't throw your skimmer in the air. That's for run-of-the-mill holidays. I guess all that anybody can do is thank God it's over. CORNISH: When New York Times columnist David Brooks heard a rebroadcast of this program, it got him thinking about how Americans, at one time, could mark triumph without boasting. DAVID BROOKS: And I was really struck at this supreme moment of American triumph, that they weren't beating their chests. They weren't super proud of themselves. They were deeply humble. And I found that so beautiful and so moving. And I thought there's really something to admire in that public culture. CORNISH: A culture that, he says, is lost today. In his latest book, \"The Road To Character,\" David Brooks goes on a personal journey, trying to apply the lessons of history to himself. He said he's been measuring his success in life by career, which turns out to be ultimately unfulfilling. BROOKS: You know, I achieved way more career success than I'd ever imagined. And I rediscovered the elemental truth. It doesn't make you happy. And then I would come across people once a month who just - they just glowed. I remember I was up in Frederick, Md. , visiting some people who tutor immigrants. They teach them English and how to read. And I walk into room of 30 people, mostly women, probably 50 to 80 years old, and they just radiated a generosity of spirit. They radiated a patience. And most of all, they radiated gratitude for life. And I remember thinking, you know, I've achieved career success in life, but I haven't achieved that. What they have is that inner-light that I do not have. And I've only got one life. I'd like to at least figure out how to get there. And so I really wrote the book to save my soul, if you want to put it grandly - to figure out, how can I be more like that? And writing a book doesn't get you there, but at least gives you a roadmap. CORNISH: You're really hard on yourself in the opening pages. It makes me feel like maybe your Google Alerts are on. . . (LAUGHTER) CORNISH: . . . And you are listening to your critics. But here's your description of your job - that you're (reading) more or less paid to be a narcissistic blowhard, to volume my opinions to appear more confident about them than I really am, to appear smarter than I really am, to appear better and more authoritative than I really am. I have to work harder than most people to avoid a life of smug superficiality. BROOKS: I don't think that's hard on myself. I think that's just honest about myself. We're both in a weird job where we're in front of a microphone, and that presents character challenges where we can think we're right all the time or we get a lot of attention. But I do think the turning point in a life toward maturity is looking inside yourself and saying, what's the weakness that I have that leads to behavior that I'm not proud of? And I'd say, for me, it's evolved. It used to be I just lived life on the surface, thinking about politics only or thinking about sort of superficial success only. I think I'm a little better at that, but I still have the core sin of wanting everybody to love me and avoiding conflict. And so I have to look at that every day and figure out, how can I be a little better on that? And in the book, I have so many characters who have different core sins. For Bayard Rustin, a great civil rights leader, it was ego early in life - ego. For Dorothy Day, she was fragmented. Her life was all over the place, just scattered. For George Eliot, the novelist, desperate neediness for intimacy. For Dwight Eisenhower, it was his passion. He was an angry, angry man. And so each of the characters in the book confronts some core sin, and they figure out a way to beat it. And by the end of their lives, they've become strong in their weakest places, and they're meant to serve as models for the rest of us. CORNISH: They make some sort of shift, I guess? BROOKS: Yeah, all the characters in the book. And it's like an assembly of friends. They're, like, in my life now. And I greet them.

S. oil business has ended. Lower oil and natural gas prices have drillers laying off tens of thousands of workers. But there are parts of the country where companies are still hiring. NPR's Jeff Brady reports from Pennsylvania, which is one of them. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: There are young people optimistic about the future of the oil and gas business, and they can be found at a training site outside Williamsport, Pa. (SOUNDBITE OF MOCK DRILLING RIG)BRADY: On this gravel lot, there's a mock drilling rig. It produces no oil or gas. It's used to train a new generation of entry-level workers called roustabouts. Three students guide heavy steel drill pipe down through the rig floor. They wear bright orange gloves so the instructor can see their hands. One wrong move can lead to injury. CLAIRE KERSTETTER: All the different rig hands are working together really well, actually. BRADY: Claire Kerstetter already finished this three-week program at the Pennsylvania College of Technology. Now she works on fracking jobs. KERSTETTER: I am a fluid technician. It's also known as quality control specialist. BRADY: You like it? KERSTETTER: I do. I love it. It's a lot of fun. BRADY: What do you like about it? KERSTETTER: I like the challenge, not only physically, but intellectually as well. BRADY: Students here learn other skills valuable to drilling companies, too. A big shop on campus is a classroom for aspiring diesel mechanics. So what are you doing here? WILLIAM MILLER: We're reassembling our engine. BRADY: Eighteen-year-old William Miller says this engine powers the kind of generators drillers use. MILLER: Seeing as how they're out basically in the middle of nowhere, they have to create their own power, so this creates their power for them. BRADY: Miller has heard about layoffs around the country. Most of those are in oilfields where drillers are adjusting to a sharp drop in crude prices. Here in Pennsylvania, companies are looking for natural gas, not oil. Those prices are low, too. Still, Miller is confident there'll be work when he graduates in a couple of years. MILLER: Yeah, there are tons of jobs, and especially upcoming. The whole workforce is kind of old, so they're getting ready to retire. BRADY: The industry calls this the great crew change. After the oil bust in the 1980s, a lot of companies stopped hiring new workers. That's left an aging workforce with not enough trained people to replace them. Tracy Brundage is vice president for Workforce Development at Pennsylvania College of Technology. TRACY BRUNDAGE: One of the ways to avoid a situation like that where you have significant generational gaps in the workforce is to continue to train people to move into those jobs. BRADY: She says that's happening here. Despite lower natural gas prices, the industry is still hiring. Brundage says more than 100 students have finished roustabout training and 98 percent got jobs. Average starting pay is more than $16 an hour. BRUNDAGE: It's not unheard of if they're working, you know, with a lot of overtime for a roustabout, you know, to get up into that 70,000-$80,000 range. BRADY: Good-paying jobs are exactly what many were hoping for when the drilling boom came to Pennsylvania, says Katie McGinty. She's chief of staff to Governor Tom Wolf. KATIE MCGINTY: Pennsylvania's gone from pretty much nowhere on the map in terms of natural gas production to now second in the country behind only Texas. BRADY: McGinty says when drilling rigs started showing up, residents worried all the good jobs would go to out-of-state workers, leaving locals with nothing but the environmental consequences of drilling. MCGINTY: In the early days of the industry, those concerns were exacerbated by too many people seeing nothing but Texas and Oklahoma license plates in and around the shale gas fields. BRADY: That's changing, she says, as more locals learn the skills necessary to work in the gas business. The latest figures show more than 31,000 people in the state have jobs related to extracting natural gas. That's about double what it was five years ago. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

That's what's happening in some European countries where interest rates have gone negative. To help us make sense of this, we're joined by our own John Ydstie, and, John, I don't really understand it (laughter). So help me understand what's going on here. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Well, it's true, Audie. Interest rates are being pushed so low in Europe - in fact, in the negative territory - so that some banks are paying borrowers to take loans. And while some mortgage holders from Denmark to Spain might be quite happy about it, for the most part, the banks are not happy and are losing money as a result. If these negative rates become too widespread, they could become a serious problem. CORNISH: Before we get deeper into those problems, first tell us how Europe even got to this point. YDSTIE: Well, you know, just like the U. S. , the financial crisis battered both banks and borrowers in Europe so that banks didn't want to lend and consumers didn't want to borrow. That caused the economy to stall, just like it did here. So it took a while, but earlier this year the European Central Bank finally launched a bond-buying program like the Federal Reserve's. The hope was to drive down interest rates and boost borrowing. But what happened is that the central banks across Europe started buying so many government bonds to push down rates that bonds got scarce and, in some cases, the rates were pushed below zero. Those government rates are often benchmarks for mortgages, as you know. So, for instance, let's say you had a variable rate mortgage in Spain. Maybe your interest rate started out at 2 percent. But now it's possible it's fallen to a negative 1 percent, meaning that the bank has to give you a rebate or maybe pay down a bit more of your principal each month. CORNISH: You know, John, I think some people out there who have a mortgage might actually like that deal. YDSTIE: True, but as we said, it doesn't make bankers happy. If they're going to make money in this situation, they're going to have to charge people to take their deposits - not a great way to attract depositors. Instead, people might just want to stick their money under the mattress. CORNISH: This sounds a little bit like Bizarro World. I mean, as much as I would like to have the banks, say, pay me interest on my mortgage, it sounds - based on what you're saying it doesn't sound healthy. YDSTIE: Well, as I said, there are risks posed by these ultralow and even negative rates. As we mentioned, banks have trouble making money in this kind of environment, and the health of eurozone banks is already a subject of debate, so that's not good. Another risk is that very low rates might reignite the European housing bubble, pushing real estate prices irrationally high because mortgage rates are so attractive. The third risk is that lower negative interest rates could cause underfunding of pension plans because many plans are required to invest in these government bonds, some of which are now yielding negative rates. That could hurt retirees in the long run. CORNISH: So are people starting to think that maybe the European Central Bank may have gone too far? YDSTIE: Well, yes. If these negative interest rates become entrenched, it may have gone too far. But I think supporters of the policy would actually say it's working better than expected. The cash-strapped governments in Europe are paying almost nothing to borrow money by selling their sovereign bonds. That's helping bolster their finances. Businesses are paying very little to borrow so they can invest and expand at little cost and hopefully hire people. And consumers are finding it doesn't pay much to save money by depositing it in the bank or putting it in a money fund, so they may be more inclined to spend it and help boost economic growth. In fact, today, the IMF upped its forecast for European growth this year to 1. 5 percent. That's not great, but a lot better than Europe has been doing recently. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie.

In fact, today, the IMF upped its forecast for European growth this year to 1. 5 percent. That's not great, but a lot better than Europe has been doing recently. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie.

WERTHEIMER: You've been to a few of these gatherings. What do the IMF and the World Bank do when they meet? ROTHKOPF: Well, I think two things happen at these meetings. One is a set of formal meetings, which are actually much less important than the informal conversations that occur in the corridors around the meetings because it's in meetings like this that the conventional wisdom of global markets gets formed. WERTHEIMER: Do you think they're feeling pretty good about what's happening or pretty bad? ROTHKOPF: Right now, virtually every country in the Middle East is at war, with the exception of Oman. Typically, what we would've thought a number of years ago is that this would make oil prices go up and that this would shock global stock markets. Neither of those things has happened. In fact, oil prices have largely gone down, and global stock markets have largely ignored this. And I think that means that some of the areas where the unrest is greatest are places that can now boil over without having great effect for developed markets and investors. And that's not such a good thing because it means that the leaders in those countries who depend on those investors can more easily ignore those crises. And we have a kind of two-speed world. WERTHEIMER: You know, we find in the United States that one of the most unsettling things for our stock market often is good news. So what about the possibly good news that Iran might give up its rush to nuclear weapons? ROTHKOPF: Well, it depends on your perspective. I think the prospect of Iran seeing sanctions lift could have the effect of putting a significant amount more oil into global oil markets. Another potential consequence of the Iran deal, of course, is that the neighbors of Iran are threatened by it. And if they start confronting the Iranians then you could see heightened risk of conflict. And at some point, the markets can't ignore that conflict. WERTHEIMER: Well, now, one of the most interesting areas of tension recently is between the U. S. and Russia. How do you think that plays into all of this? ROTHKOPF: Well, I've spoken to a lot of investors and investors' groups recently and if there's one area of risk that they have flagged it is the possibility that a miscalculation between Europe and Putin leads to a heightened conflict.

LAYDEN: Today, cranes dot the horizon as private development fuels a boom in construction. Huntington has experienced downtown Oklahoma City at its worst. He can see the silver lining in the tragedy. All this new construction has made the place a destination. HUNTINGTON: Not only had we let downtown slip away to the point where it was - where it didn't matter, where downtown was inconsequential in the overall picture of the city, I think that the bombing made a lot of people realize, you know, downtown is important.

So once you had the bombing, it sort of kicked people into a different thought process. LAYDEN: Before the bombing, residents had already voted to approve several new downtown projects. After the bombing, it sharpened the desire to improve the area. Federal money flowed in, too - more than $50 million in grants and a loan program that continues now. Today, Oklahoma City's downtown YMCA has a new campus not form far from where it once was, across the street from the Murrah building. The YMCA facility was already outdated when the bomb went off. President Mike Grady had been looking to sell just before the bombing damaged the structure, but the prospects weren't good.

Eleven workers were killed on the rig above called the Deepwater Horizon, and that was just the start. In the chaos that followed, coast guard helicopters plucked survivors from the water. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK, we're taking a load. Survivors clear. INSKEEP: And then it slowly became clear just how much oil was flowing into the water. It was the nation's worst offshore environmental catastrophe. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports on how the Gulf Coast is faring today. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: In the spring and summer of 2010, oil gushed from the Macondo well for nearly three months. More than 3 million barrels of Louisiana light crude fouled beaches and wetlands from Texas to Florida, affecting wildlife and livelihoods. Today, the impacts linger. These remote barrier islands off the Louisiana coast are only accessible by boat. BOB MARSHALL: You may have to get your feet a little wet here. That's it, far as I can go. ELLIOTT: Longtime outdoorsman and environmental writer Bob Marshall of The Lens is my boat captain. We've stopped at East Grand Terre. Marshall was here when the oil hit the shore in 2010. MARSHALL: I'll never forget the day it came in here. It was the peak nesting season in April for brown pelicans. ELLIOTT: He says the oil rolled in with the tide, waves of reddish-orange gunk. MARSHALL: And of course, it was hitting these islands, coating the roots of the mangroves, and also the birds were diving. The adults would come back after looking for food and sit down on their eggs, and there was oil on the eggs. ELLIOTT: This was one of the most heavily oiled areas during the BP oil spill five years ago and today, there's still evidence that oil was here. Hundreds of tar balls dot the beach, and there's even a BP crew cleaning a large tar mat from the surf. MARSHALL: And this will be going on, unfortunately, for years. ELLIOTT: Because some of the oil was buried beneath the sand just offshore, and it gets churned up when the surf is rough. Back out on Barataria Bay, Marshall points to where roots jut up in the open water. He says these used to be mangrove islands. MARSHALL: And the oil coated the roots of those mangrove trees and then they died. And without the mangroves to hold the island together, within three years, most of those islands were gone. ELLIOTT: Louisiana was already losing land at an alarming rate, but scientists confirm that the oil spill accelerated the pace. Barataria Bay has lost key bird nesting islands, and federal government studies indicate that dolphin here in the bay are sick and dying at a higher rate than normal and show signs of oil poisoning. On our afternoon boat tour, Marshall sees something that worries him. MARSHALL: There's another dead dolphin. That's the second one we've seen. Honestly, this is strictly anecdotal. You can't tie it to anything. But seriously, I've never seen a single dead dolphin out here. Now I'm seeing two. This is amazing. ELLIOTT: Five years later, there are more questions than answers about what the lingering impacts mean, says Cynthia Sarthou, executive director of the Gulf Restoration Network. CYNTHIA SARTHOU: Dolphin deaths continue, oil is still on the bottom of the ocean, tar balls keep coming up, and nobody really is able to say what we might find in five years, 10 years, you know, and it's really distressing to me. ELLIOTT: Sarthou says there's no certainty this spill won't be a problem for generations to come. SARTHOU: It's not publicly seen, but it is out there. It's in the marine environment. And so whether we see it or not, the potential impacts of its presence may plague us for decades. GEOFF MORRELL: There is nothing to suggest other than that the Gulf is a resilient body of water that has bounced back strongly. ELLIOTT: That's BP Senior Vice President Geoff Morrell. MORRELL: The Gulf has not been damaged anywhere near the degree that some people had feared it would have in the midst of this spill. ELLIOTT: Under federal law, BP will have to pay to restore the damage to natural resources caused by its spill, a scientific assessment that is ongoing and could take years to resolve. BP also faces a court judgment that could top $13 billion in an ongoing liability case. A New Orleans federal judge has ruled that BP's gross negligence and willful misconduct are to blame for the disaster. Morrell says BP has already spent $28 billion on response and cleanup and to pay economic claims to oil spill victims. He says the company has changed its safety procedures and pre-deployed capping stacks around the world that could more quickly shut down an out-of-control well. MORRELL: Obviously, the Deepwater Horizon accident was a tragedy, it was deeply regrettable, and we have done everything possible to learn from it. ELLIOTT: There's no sign of oil on the breezy public beach in Gulf Shores, Ala. , where kids are playing in the surf. Mayor Robert Craft says tourism here is on the rebound. MAYOR ROBERT CRAFT: There's no question that our economy has done really well. We've recovered people back. ELLIOTT: The line of colorful umbrellas today along the pristine white sand is a far cry from five years ago. CRAFT: Five years ago, you'd see oil all over our beach, and you'd see no people here. Our beaches were ruined. ELLIOTT: Craft says the disaster was a huge blow, both economically and environmentally, and he's not sure it's over. CRAFT: Economically, we're doing really well, but - and the environment seems to be short-term looking well, too. I mean, we don't have that many tar balls washing up on the shore unless we get really strong, heavy surf, and then we'll get some bust up in here. We know tar mats are out there. But what we don't know is the long-term environmental consequences. It just hasn't been long enough to know. ELLIOTT: Tourists have flocked back to the beaches of Alabama, Mississippi and the Florida panhandle, helped in part by an ad campaign paid for by BP. Other coastal industries are still trying to come back. In Bon Secour, Ala. , fourth-generation oysterman Chris Nelson shows off his family's seafood processing plant, Bon Secour Fisheries. CHRIS NELSON: We call this our opening house. A lot of people call this a shucking house. ELLIOTT: About a dozen shuckers are at work at stainless steel tables, slipping a knife into oyster shells to extract the meat. Half the tables here are idle. Sitting on a pier behind the plant, Nelson says there aren't enough oysters. NELSON: Our business is still struggling here at Bon Secour Fisheries because of the lack of oyster production, and I place the blame for that on the oil spill that's slowly climbing back. ELLIOTT: Nelson is on the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission. He says one of the most productive public oyster reefs in the country, east of the Mississippi River off the Louisiana coast, is not producing like it should. NELSON: That was maybe not coincidentally the closest place to where the spill was occurring, where the leak was. That area still has not produced an appreciable number of oysters and has not recruited any young oysters to speak of since the spill. ELLIOTT: Nelson says it's not clear whether the reef was harmed by exposure to oil or by the fresh water that was released in Louisiana in hopes of pushing it away. Either way, he says, it's a problem that needs resolving. NELSON: The economy of this region has been damaged tremendously, and BP has done a lot to try to bring us back. But again, the commitment by both the administration and by BP was to get us back better than we were before. I don't think we're better than we were before. ELLIOTT: Five years later, Nelson says, don't underestimate the lasting toll of the disaster. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Orange Beach, Ala.

MARSHALL: And the oil coated the roots of those mangrove trees and then they died. And without the mangroves to hold the island together, within three years, most of those islands were gone. ELLIOTT: Louisiana was already losing land at an alarming rate, but scientists confirm that the oil spill accelerated the pace. Barataria Bay has lost key bird nesting islands, and federal government studies indicate that dolphin here in the bay are sick and dying at a higher rate than normal and show signs of oil poisoning. On our afternoon boat tour, Marshall sees something that worries him. MARSHALL: There's another dead dolphin. That's the second one we've seen. Honestly, this is strictly anecdotal. You can't tie it to anything. But seriously, I've never seen a single dead dolphin out here. Now I'm seeing two. This is amazing. ELLIOTT: Five years later, there are more questions than answers about what the lingering impacts mean, says Cynthia Sarthou, executive director of the Gulf Restoration Network. CYNTHIA SARTHOU: Dolphin deaths continue, oil is still on the bottom of the ocean, tar balls keep coming up, and nobody really is able to say what we might find in five years, 10 years, you know, and it's really distressing to me. ELLIOTT: Sarthou says there's no certainty this spill won't be a problem for generations to come. SARTHOU: It's not publicly seen, but it is out there. It's in the marine environment. And so whether we see it or not, the potential impacts of its presence may plague us for decades. GEOFF MORRELL: There is nothing to suggest other than that the Gulf is a resilient body of water that has bounced back strongly. ELLIOTT: That's BP Senior Vice President Geoff Morrell. MORRELL: The Gulf has not been damaged anywhere near the degree that some people had feared it would have in the midst of this spill. ELLIOTT: Under federal law, BP will have to pay to restore the damage to natural resources caused by its spill, a scientific assessment that is ongoing and could take years to resolve. BP also faces a court judgment that could top $13 billion in an ongoing liability case. A New Orleans federal judge has ruled that BP's gross negligence and willful misconduct are to blame for the disaster. Morrell says BP has already spent $28 billion on response and cleanup and to pay economic claims to oil spill victims. He says the company has changed its safety procedures and pre-deployed capping stacks around the world that could more quickly shut down an out-of-control well. MORRELL: Obviously, the Deepwater Horizon accident was a tragedy, it was deeply regrettable, and we have done everything possible to learn from it. ELLIOTT: There's no sign of oil on the breezy public beach in Gulf Shores, Ala. , where kids are playing in the surf. Mayor Robert Craft says tourism here is on the rebound. MAYOR ROBERT CRAFT: There's no question that our economy has done really well. We've recovered people back. ELLIOTT: The line of colorful umbrellas today along the pristine white sand is a far cry from five years ago. CRAFT: Five years ago, you'd see oil all over our beach, and you'd see no people here. Our beaches were ruined. ELLIOTT: Craft says the disaster was a huge blow, both economically and environmentally, and he's not sure it's over. CRAFT: Economically, we're doing really well, but - and the environment seems to be short-term looking well, too. I mean, we don't have that many tar balls washing up on the shore unless we get really strong, heavy surf, and then we'll get some bust up in here. We know tar mats are out there. But what we don't know is the long-term environmental consequences. It just hasn't been long enough to know. ELLIOTT: Tourists have flocked back to the beaches of Alabama, Mississippi and the Florida panhandle, helped in part by an ad campaign paid for by BP. Other coastal industries are still trying to come back. In Bon Secour, Ala. , fourth-generation oysterman Chris Nelson shows off his family's seafood processing plant, Bon Secour Fisheries. CHRIS NELSON: We call this our opening house. A lot of people call this a shucking house. ELLIOTT: About a dozen shuckers are at work at stainless steel tables, slipping a knife into oyster shells to extract the meat. Half the tables here are idle. Sitting on a pier behind the plant, Nelson says there aren't enough oysters. NELSON: Our business is still struggling here at Bon Secour Fisheries because of the lack of oyster production, and I place the blame for that on the oil spill that's slowly climbing back. ELLIOTT: Nelson is on the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission. He says one of the most productive public oyster reefs in the country, east of the Mississippi River off the Louisiana coast, is not producing like it should. NELSON: That was maybe not coincidentally the closest place to where the spill was occurring, where the leak was. That area still has not produced an appreciable number of oysters and has not recruited any young oysters to speak of since the spill. ELLIOTT: Nelson says it's not clear whether the reef was harmed by exposure to oil or by the fresh water that was released in Louisiana in hopes of pushing it away. Either way, he says, it's a problem that needs resolving. NELSON: The economy of this region has been damaged tremendously, and BP has done a lot to try to bring us back. But again, the commitment by both the administration and by BP was to get us back better than we were before. I don't think we're better than we were before. ELLIOTT: Five years later, Nelson says, don't underestimate the lasting toll of the disaster.

The Obama administration is trying to fight this by proposing new protections for retirement accounts, which may or may not solve the problem. NPR's Chris Arnold has more. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Right now, millions of Americans are trying to save for retirement, but they've ended up in investments where high fees cripple their returns over time. The Obama administration is saying that a lot of that is due to bad advice. U. S. SECRETARY OF LABOR TOM PEREZ: I hear story after story of people who trusted their adviser. They thought that he or she was looking out for her, and they weren't. ARNOLD: That's the U. S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. He spoke to NPR and said that lots of financial advisers give conflicted advice and that that hurts American workers. For example, you might not realize it, but if you have an adviser, that adviser might get a much bigger commission if he gets you to invest in a mutual fund with fees that are very high. PEREZ: The corrosive power of fine print, hidden fees, backdoor fees - quite literally billions of dollars is being lost. ARNOLD: That is average Americans are losing billions of dollars out of their retirement accounts. So the Department of Labor has just released this new proposed set of rules. This the first week the public can submit comments on it. And the basic idea is simple; Perez says when you get advice for a retirement account, your adviser has to put your interests above his or her own. PEREZ: This is one of the most important pieces of consumer protection regulation that we can put in place for the American people. They should have a right when they go to get this financial advice that the person giving them that advice is looking out for their interests first. ARNOLD: OK, that sounds really good, but the text of the rule is more than a hundred pages long. So it's probably worth exploring whether some loopholes might find their way in there. DAVID SWENSEN: I think the biggest threat to this rule is Wall Street's reaction. ARNOLD: That's David Swensen. He's Yale University's chief investment officer, which means he's managing the school's $25 billion endowment. He's written a book about how everyday Americans can invest for retirement, and he's been following this new rule as it moves forward. SWENSEN: It will clearly cost Wall Street in terms of the bottom line, and they're going to fight it tooth and nail. ARNOLD: And at least some experts think that the financial industry's lobbying has already weakened the Department of Labor's new rules. KENT SMETTERS: It's obvious that industry basically got to them because they really do allow for another big loophole. ARNOLD: That's Kent Smetters, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He studies financial regulation, and he's zeroed in on one so-called exemption in the rule. SMETTERS: It essentially throws a big grenade into the room. It's not just a small, little hole. The industry can drive a Mack truck through it, and it really allows them to essentially continue business as usual. ARNOLD: Smetters says that's because the exemption allows financial advisers to opt out of much of the rule and, for example, still get commissions for getting clients to invest in overpriced mutual funds. We asked Labor Secretary Perez about this. What's your response to that criticism? PEREZ: Well, I disagree with him, and I look forward to speaking with the professor. I think we have put in place appropriate guardrails. ARNOLD: Still, this is what a comment period is all about, so experts can weigh in and offer advice. As for the industry, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association declined requests for an interview. The group had been warning that an overly burdensome rule could raise costs for average Americans. But since the proposed rule's been unveiled, the industry group says it's still reviewing the details. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

Soldiers in the guard live in two worlds. They can be sent to war in a crisis, but they also have to support themselves in civilian jobs. Alison St. John with member station KPBS in San Diego has the story of two National Guard soldiers who are trying to serve their country while, at the same time, building their careers. CHRISTOPHER AVILA: I mean, essentially, all I have in here is, like, my dress uniform. ALISON ST. JOHN, BYLINE: The closet in Christopher Avila's small bedroom pretty much reflects his life. AVILA: Uniforms, backpacks, rucksack. These duffel bags are full of uniforms, jackets, other things we wear when we go to the field. It's about half of my closet. ST. JOHN: His civilian clothes are squeezed in one side, his National Guard gear in the other. Avila is 23. He's been in the Guard for three years, and he loves it. The commitment is one weekend a month and two weeks training in the summer. But that's seldom how it works out. AVILA: On paper, they ask for one weekend a month, which is what you tell your employers. And sometimes, the employer will have trouble just even dealing with one weekend a month because it's, hey, we have to shift that entire week around just so you have the day off. ST. JOHN: Weekends often turn into four days, Avila says. And because he's an IT specialist, he frequently gets called up for extra training on new technology. He had a job with a civilian company where he was able to use his IT skills. But he got called to Guard trainings two weekends in a row. A few days later, another commitment. AVILA: And then I had to go for two weeks to Fort Hood to do some training for some new stuff that my unit was getting. And when I came back, they ultimately came down to the conclusion that they had let me go because I wasn't meeting their quota or I was - you know, misconduct or something like that. But, you know, companies have to find a way around letting people go sometimes. ST. JOHN: Companies that hire people in the National Guard cannot legally fire them for fulfilling their Guard commitment. But, Avila says, others in his unit have also found themselves out of a job after going on one too many military trainings. Avila has found another job at T-Shirt Mart using his graphic design skills. One of his managers, Arthur Nava, says they're willing to work around Avila's training schedule. ARTHUR NAVA: I'd say a good 30 to 40 percent of our customers are military-based families here in San Diego. We do have an understanding of what it means to be, you know, in the military, and we try to help those people out as much as we can. ST. JOHN: Finding a job is hard enough, but building a career is even more difficult for people serving in the Guard. Rida Sihab Mansor is 32. He's a staff sergeant who served eight years as a linguist and translator for the Army National Guard. He deployed for one year of combat duty in Iraq which earned him the decorations on his dress uniform. RIDA SIHAB MANSOR: I have 13 metals. Bronze Star is the top one, which is the highest one. This is my Army achievement, anti-terrorism. This is National Guard one. ST. JOHN: Because Mansor has served as a full-time recruiter for two years as well as being deployed, he qualified for the post-9/11 GI Bill and is finishing a degree in security management. But that has not been enough to get his foot on the career ladder. MANSOR: I've applied everywhere. I don't even get an email back. Well, I've got a pretty good resume. I've even applied to couple security companies, and I've seen them hire the guy next to me who didn't even know how to fill out an application. Didn't hire me (laughter), and I'm in the same field. I'm going for a bachelor's degree within that field. ST. JOHN: I asked Mansor if he thought his commitment to the Guard was what was making it so difficult to build a career. MANSOR: I didn't at first, but I'm positive it does right now. ST. JOHN: He earns a little money, about a $100 a day serving on the honor guard at military funerals. He says he enjoys the days when he can put on the uniform and serve. MANSOR: I love it. I'm very proud of being part of that team - really, really beautiful ceremony. We train a lot to be perfect at it. ST. JOHN: And, Mansor says, he'd do it for free, but the reality is he's got a mortgage to pay. And he's looking for a career. MONTAGNE: That's reporter Alison St. John. She's on the line with us now. And, Alison, your story raises questions, maybe the most obvious one being we hear a lot about companies wanting to hire veterans. But the situation the National Guard is in, that doesn't apply to them so much. ST. JOHN: Well, that's right. Even in companies that favor hiring military, national guardsmen find themselves competing for jobs with vets who don't have to ask their employers for time off every month for training. Employers do earn federal tax credits for hiring vets. But National Guards who have not been deployed on a federal mission wouldn't qualify as a vet for those credits. You know, their training - that's the one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer - falls under a different category of service. MONTAGNE: So these people have served, but the service doesn't qualify them as vets to get hiring preferences? ST. JOHN: That's right. If they're deployed on a federal mission for at least six months, that counts. But for a state emergency, for example, or two-week training, that doesn't count. And that means that employers have to choose between a vet who comes in with federal tax credits of anything up to a $1,000 and one who may come in with limited or no tax credits and has to be absent on a regular basis for training, plus, of course, might get called away unexpectedly for a statewide emergency, such as a wildfire. MONTAGNE: And for an employer, given the choice between a vet and a member of the Guard, it's easier to hire the vet. ST. JOHN: Well, that's right. Exactly. MONTAGNE: How long must a member of the Guard have been on active duty to qualify for VA benefits like the GI Bill? ST. JOHN: Three years, or 36 months, for full benefits for the post-9/11 GI Bill. Otherwise, they get a prorated portion, about 60 percent if they serve for one year. And again, remember, the training days or service to the state, that doesn't count, although some states like California do provide some extra education benefits. And the thing to remember is that as the wars wind down, chances to deploy are fewer, so it's less easy to qualify for those benefits. MONTAGNE: And from what you know of the two National Guard soldiers that you profiled here, how likely is it for them to be able to build the civilian careers that they really want? ST. JOHN: Well, Christopher Avila hopes to be deployed to Iraq in October, and that could help him get a better-paying job in IT, his field, because he'd qualify for GI Bill benefits. But he would still need to find an employer who would be willing to let him go on frequent trainings and be ready to serve at the drop of the hat if a state-level or federal crisis cropped up. Then, this Mansor - he's the one who's served on the honor guard - he's soon going to be qualified with that degree in security management. He did qualify for a VA loan for his house, so he's still looking for an employer, though, who's willing to be very flexible with his schedule. And he's devoted to the Guard. He's been in the Guard for eight years, and he plans to stay for a full 20 years. That way, he'll earn retirement benefits, he says, and that's at least something, even if the civilian world doesn't offer him much security. MONTAGNE: That's Alison St. John of member station KPBS in San Diego. Her report is a part of NPR's collaboration with stations called Back at Base, a look at the U. S. military on the homefront.

Women are consistently paid less than men. Research shows that women are less assertive in negotiating salaries. That means they start out making less and only see the gap widen over time. The solution for some companies is simply refusing to negotiate with anyone. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Carnegie Mellon economics professor Linda Babcock studies the gender pay gap and says men are four times more likely to negotiate their pay. That keeps women at a disadvantage, though they're not always aware of it. LINDA BABCOCK: The standard now is that people don't really know what each other earns, that some people negotiate it and some don't. And so there is tremendous inequities in salary. NOGUCHI: Depending which government statistics you use, women today are paid between 5 and 23 percent less than their male counterparts. Many people leapfrog into higher salaries when they switch jobs. But Babcock says the pay disadvantage follows women if their new employers use their old salaries as benchmarks, as is often done. Negotiating, she says, can even backfire. BABCOCK: When women do negotiate, people often have a negative reaction to them. NOGUCHI: At least one company recently decided to eliminate the negotiation. Information-sharing site Reddit no longer negotiates salary when it recruits. It's a policy instituted by interim CEO Ellen Pao, who last month lost a high-profile gender discrimination case against her former employer. ARIANE HEGEWISCH: I think it's an interesting experiment. NOGUCHI: Ariane Hegewisch is study director at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. She says Reddit's policy is a novel concept for the private sector. But, she notes, salaries for government workers are usually set in a similar way. HEGEWISCH: There is not a very large scope for negotiation. Whether it will work in the IT industry will be very interesting. NOGUCHI: Reddit's policy is unusual. Most companies still embrace the traditional salary negotiation. Kelly Hastings is senior government affairs adviser for the Society for Human Resource Management. She says policies that restrict a company's ability to adjust pay based on skill level or geographic location also limits the talent it can attract, one of the key, traditional mechanisms for recruitment. KELLY HASTINGS: We really want employers to have complete flexibility to be able to pay people differently as they deem necessary. NOGUCHI: Author and career counselor Robin Ryan says it's not that companies do not want to see women rise through their ranks. ROBIN RYAN: Wanting to have more women promoted - now, that they do care about. And that they have been showing a lot of interest in. That I'm seeing happening more and more and more. NOGUCHI: But Ryan says that tends not to bridge the pay gap. She says here again, women are less aggressive on compensation. And that means women stay behind their male peers throughout their careers. HR consultant Amy Hirsh Robinson says, however, that workers now have access to sites like Glassdoor that publish salary information. And, she says, greater transparency is forcing companies to change. AMY HIRSH ROBINSON: Some of my clients are now making all of their salaries transparent, up to the executive level. NOGUCHI: That includes Elevations, a credit union based in Boulder, Colo. , that sets salary level based on title, which it publishes online. So effectively, there is no salary negotiation during hiring or promotion. Annette Matthies heads human resources and says the company did this after hearing complaints from employees. She says it's also helped with recruitment and retention. ANNETTE MATTHIES: And that loyalty then increases profits for a company. The company's more profitable. They can then give back more to their employees. And so it's a symbiotic relationship. NOGUCHI: Interestingly, the company's last salary audit showed women at the company earning 2 percent more than men. And, Matthies says, no one misses the negotiation. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Some companies are taking a new approach to a long-standing trend. Women are consistently paid less than men. Research shows that women are less assertive in negotiating salaries. That means they start out making less and only see the gap widen over time. The solution for some companies is simply refusing to negotiate with anyone. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Carnegie Mellon economics professor Linda Babcock studies the gender pay gap and says men are four times more likely to negotiate their pay. That keeps women at a disadvantage, though they're not always aware of it. LINDA BABCOCK: The standard now is that people don't really know what each other earns, that some people negotiate it and some don't. And so there is tremendous inequities in salary.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, getting organized - stories and ideas about how and why we organize. So think about some of the most top-down organizations you know - the military, political parties, multinational corporations and maybe the place you work. RICARDO SEMLER: There are too many similarities between the way we run businesses and the way people run boarding schools. RAZ: This is Ricardo Semler, and Ricardo is a businessman. SEMLER: Here are all the rules. Here's how you follow them. This is what you can do. This is what you cannot do before you do this, do that. . . RAZ: Which, he says, is just what his father's company was like started when Ricardo first stated to work there. SEMLER: A pyramid hierarchy - president, vice president, directors and so forth. RAZ: The company made pumps and propellers for ships. This was in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in the late 1970s. SEMLER: The people who were there were very far from feeling free or looking happy about what they're doing. It's something where people end up bogged down very quickly by the organizational boxes they've been put in by the people they have to ask authorization from, the people they have to ship papers out to. RAZ: And this is more or less how the company operated until Ricardo took it over in his early 20s. SEMLER: And I said I don't want to spend 50 years of my life making people come on time and then giving them a gold watch for having done so for 30 years. There must be a better way of organizing. I started asking questions, basically asking, why do we want to know how many hours a week people work? Why can't people know what our profit and strategies are and so forth? And as we asked these questions, it became obvious that the answers were just old-fashioned and not current anymore. RAZ: So Ricardo Semler decided to radically reorganize the company. His first day on the job, he fired most of the managers. He ripped out the punch clocks for time cards and he started to create a system of self-organization. And over time, the company, which is called Semco, became hugely successful from 140 employees to thousands. They make rocket fuel; they build factories; they manage ATMs all across Brazil. And Ricardo Semler has turned his ideas on radical reorganization into a movement. Here he is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEMLER: This is a complicated company with thousands of employees, hundreds of millions of dollars of business. We looked at it, and we said, why do we want to know what time you come to work? Why are we building these headquarters? Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important? So first of all, we're dragging you two hours across town because of it. So we started asking questions one by one. How do we find people? We go out and try to recruit people. We'd say, look, when you come to us, we're not going to have two or three interviews and then you're going to be married to us for life. That's not how we do the rest of our lives. So have your interview and then come back. Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day, talk to anybody you want, make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the [expletive] we put into our own ads. (LAUGHTER)SEMLER: Slowly, we went to a process where we'd say things like, we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven't been interviewed and approved by their future subordinates. Every six months, everyone gets evaluated anonymously. And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position, which is many times situational, as you know. RAZ: All this sounds like a recipe for anarchy. SEMLER: Yeah, but when you think about it, Guy, the very sophisticated organizations are either self-managed or are managed by relatively chaotic outlooks. When you think about how geese fly north, how ants go from left to right, how traffic manages itself, how the world economy manages itself, there ain't no leader there. RAZ: OK, but how do - like, how do all the teams in the company, like, know what they're supposed to do and when it has to get done? SEMLER: It's - when you're imagining a business that you know very little about, let's say you're looking at a biscuit manufacturing business or running ATMs, it sounds very far-fetched. When you look at your own life, people know a heck of a lot more than people who've been in that business than they even care to reveal at the first moment. When you start putting people together and say, OK, guys, what are we supposed to do? Well, what are we trying to do? We're trying to deliver eight pumps with 300 kilowatt motors to a shipyard in Korea by next May. OK, so who's going to do what? And in two minutes it's all very clear. The only difference is that they all have a tremendous commitment to make that delivery, and they'll make it on time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEMLER: Over time, we started asking other questions. We'd say things like, why can't people set their own salaries? There's only three things you need to know - how much people make inside the company, how much people make in - somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it, so let's give people these three pieces of information. So we started having in the cafeteria a computer where you could go in and you could ask what someone spent, how much someone makes, what they make in benefits, what their company makes, what the margins are and so forth. As this information started coming to people, we said things like we don't want to know how much holidays you're taking. We don't want to know where you work. We had at one point 14 different offices around town, and we'd say go to the one that's closest to your house, to the customer you're going to visit today. Don't tell us where you are. RAZ: I mean, the thing is, is that when you organize something, it's like - it's a method to establish some kind of control. But it's almost like you organized your company to cede control. SEMLER: Yeah because the idea that having control generates security is a very silly idea, you know? You think about any kind of organization that's definitely in place - you know, think the U. S. government, you think Congress, you think an enormous company - do they really have any idea what's going to happen 90 days ahead of time? The amount of things that are completely out of control are enormous. And so a board meeting is very much in order, and people start at 2 p. m. and end at 6:30. And 6:30, all their cars are waiting. They go out with their little files and they say, guys, we did a great job. We're now going this direction. But deep down they know that there's an enormous amount of BS in that. They really have no idea of what their competitors are going to do, what the economies going to be. And so the idea that they are in control is a complete fraud, which everyone plays along with because it's in everyone's interest to pretend. RAZ: Ricardo Semler, he's the chairman of Semco Partners, but no longer CEO. Like all of his employees, he gets graded on his work. And about a decade ago, he was actually voted out of the top executive position, a decision he says he's totally fine with. Here's how he ended his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEMLER: I used to - I taught MBAs at MIT for a time. And I ended up one day for a time and end up one day at the Mount Auburn Cemetery. It was a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge. And I was walking around. It was my birthday, and I was thinking, what do I want to be remembered for? And I did another stroll around, and the second time, another question came to me, which did me better, which was, why do I want to be remembered at all? (LAUGHTER)SEMLER: I always come back to variations of the question that my son asked me when he was 3 - Dad, why do we exist? And so what we've done all of these years is very simple is use the little tool, which is ask three whys in a row because the first why you always have a good answer for. The second why starts getting difficult. By the third why, you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing. And so what I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this, you will come to the question, what for? And over time, you'll have a much wiser future. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: You can Ricardo Semler's entire talk at ted. com. On the show today, stories and ideas of how and why we organize.

Then around a quarter to 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 600 points within the space of just a few minutes before correcting itself. What caused the so-called flash crash has been debated ever since. This week, U. S. officials blame the episode on a little-known trader who worked from his parents' home in London using computer software that he'd modified himself. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The flash crash seemed to embody everyone's worst nightmare about the mysteries and risks of high-speed computer trading. Michael Greenberger is a former regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MICHAEL GREENBERGER: This was a worldwide threat to economic well-being, and it only lasted a matter of minutes. ZARROLI: The arrest this week of 36-year-old Navinder Singh Sarao has only underscored how opaque the market remains. Sarao was no Wall Street titan. He was a lone trader working out of the West London neighborhood of Hounslow. Milto Savvidis, a trader who worked with him, described him this way. MILTO SAVVIDIS: He's a legend in our firm, we'd say. And during the financial crisis, this guy, for the lack of a better word, had balls. He'd just used to get into big positions, and he saw the risk, he saw the reward, and he took on the trades. ZARROLI: U. S. officials say over the years Sarao used a technique known as spoofing to manipulate trading in the futures market. They say he was able to drive the price of futures contracts up or down by setting up a huge number of trades he never completed. Again, Michael Greenberger. GREENBERGER: I mean, that would look like Goldman Sachs was shorting the market. There were so many trades, but he didn't have to worry about putting any money up because he had orchestrated the software so when it ever came to the point that he actually had to buy the contract that would sell the market short, he disappeared. ZARROLI: Officials say once the price was where he wanted it, Sarao would trade, reaping big profits. He allegedly made $40 million over four years. Greenberger says Sarao was well-known to regulators. GREENBERGER: And the interesting thing is he was always in trouble with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In fact, the very day of the crash, he received a letter from the exchange complaining about his activities. ZARROLI: But it took U. S. officials five years to publicly tie Sarao to the crash, and they only did so after getting tipped off by a whistleblower. Eric Hunsader of Nanex has spent years studying the flash crash. ERIC HUNSADER: I'm just shocked that the CFTC, when they were analyzing this data, never saw this. We saw it within - I think it was one of the first things we noticed when we started analyzing it back in December of 2010. ZARROLI: Instead, a congressional report attributed the crash to computer trading by a large mutual fund company later identified as Waddell & Reed. But that claim was always controversial and questions remain about who was really to blame. Hunsader says it's unlikely that Sarao was responsible for the crash all by himself. For one thing, on the afternoon of May 6, he shut down his software program two-and-a-half minutes before the crash began - an eternity in high-speed trading. HUNSADER: I'll just use an analogy of a forest fire. He was the one who brought the kindling, the wood, if you will. We still need the gasoline and we still need the match. ZARROLI: U. S. officials want to extradite Sarao, which could take a long time. Even if he can block the request, his troubles aren't over. Sarao is also known to have traded on a German exchange, and European regulators are also said to be looking into his activities. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

HUNSADER: I'll just use an analogy of a forest fire. He was the one who brought the kindling, the wood, if you will. We still need the gasoline and we still need the match. ZARROLI: U. S. officials want to extradite Sarao, which could take a long time. Even if he can block the request, his troubles aren't over. Sarao is also known to have traded on a German exchange, and European regulators are also said to be looking into his activities.

Second - while the falling euro should have lowered prices for the domestic carriers, virtually all their costs are in dollars. CAPELOUTO: And European airlines can't offer much price competition.

Both Wal-Mart and McDonald's have announced pay hikes and one of the most significant increases came at Aetna, the big health insurance company. It boosted the pay of its low-wage workers to $16 an hour. Aetna's CEO says he believes the raise will largely pay for itself by making workers more productive. NPR's John Ydstie has this report. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Lots of energy buzzing through this room, as trainees for Aetna's call-center in Fresno, Calif. practice for calls they'll be taking soon. KALLY DUNN: Thank you for calling Aetna. My name is Kally. Can I get your name, please? YDSTIE: Kally Dunn is mentoring these newcomers on how to handle calls, sometimes from irate customers who can't make sense of what's covered and what's not. DUNN: When they call, they're just - they're angry. And so it's just a lot of de-escalating, calming them down, you know, reassuring them. YDSTIE: It can be stressful work, adding to already stressful lives for low-wage workers trying to make ends meet. So when all these workers got their pay raise last Friday, it was a big deal, says 33-year-old Fabian Arredondo (ph). FABIAN ARREDONDO: It couldn't have come at a better time 'cause, as I mentioned, I'm getting married and we're going on a honeymoon and everything, so it's going to be helping out a lot. YDSTIE: And it will ease some financial pressures. Arredondo's fiancee, with whom he already has a child, wants to add to the family and start saving for a house. ARREDONDO: Finance can be one of the main stresses in people's lives and when you can pull some relief away from that stress, I definitely think it makes for - you know, a happy employee is a productive employee. YDSTIE: Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini is convinced that's true. MARK BERTOLINI: We wanted people at the front lines, who took care of our customers, to not have the kind of stress associated with being able to provide health coverage for their families and food for their families worrying while they were on the job to make sure that they were bringing their best selves to work every. YDSTIE: As Bertolini and his executive team worked to understand what challenges their low-wage workers face, they discovered that to make ends meet, many were on public assistance like food stamps and Medicaid for their children. Bertolini was taken aback. BERTOLINI: That we as a thriving organization, as a successful company, a Fortune 100 company, should have people that were living like that among the ranks of our employees. YDSTIE: Bertolini was committed to changing that. But he discovered the cost of boosting compensation for his low-paid workers would be significant, about $27 million a year. But he also found that research shows there are costs associated with paying low wages. Low-paid workers quit more often and the turnover is expensive. There's also evidence higher-paid employees provide better customer service. Bertolini thought the potential benefits could offset the $27 million cost and improve his company's profits in the long run. BERTOLINI: I think it's a pretty good bet that we're going to find a way to cover those costs in the long run. YDSTIE: Your profits won't suffer it? BERTOLINI: No, we don't see it suffering at all. YDSTIE: Economist Alex Tabarrok is skeptical. ALEX TABARROK: Wouldn't it be a great world if we could raise wages, increase profits and increase productivity all at the same time? But I don't think that is actually the world that we live in. YDSTIE: Tabarrok, a professor at George Mason University, argues that most firms are already very engaged in calculating what wages are optimal for getting the highest productivity. TABARROK: They've already explored ways to increase profits as much as possible. There's no easy solution to raise wages and increase profits at the same time. It's just not going to happen. YDSTIE: Aetna's Bertolini says even if it doesn't boost profits and maybe even costs the company something, raising wages is still the right thing to do. BERTOLINI: There definitely is a moral component and, you know, I had plenty of arguments that the spreadsheet wouldn't pencil out. And my view was, in the end analysis, this is just not fair. YDSTIE: The Aetna plan also offsets the cost of any lost public aid a worker might have gotten to make sure employees end up with more disposable income than before the wage hike. Bertolini says Aetna's shareholders have gotten behind the idea. BERTOLINI: We positioned it with them on the economics first, but went to this very notion of, you know, this isn't fair, we need to invest in our employees, we need to help restore the middle class and that should be good for the economy as a whole. And so for us, it is as much probably, for me personally, more a moral argument than it is a financial one. YDSTIE: Bertolini has become an evangelist on this subject. He hands out a how-to packet to other CEOs at conferences to encourage them to look closely at boosting their low-income workers' compensation. He says he's getting very positive feedback from many.

S. territory and an economic mess. State-owned institutions there have run deficits for years. They now owe investors some $73 billion. That's four times the debt that forced Detroit into bankruptcy, and that's a crisis. NPR's Greg Allen reports on the scramble to find a way out. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: One indication of the crisis is the tent city on the plaza in front of Puerto Rico's historical capitol building in San Juan. For more than a month, a group of protesters have been camped-out with signs, rallies and music, protesting plans by Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla to raise taxes to help cover Puerto Rico's crippling debt. JAVIER LOPEZ: (Foreign language spoken). ALLEN: Labor organizer Javier Lopez says, \"we want fair reform. Those who have more should pay more - not the working poor. \" For months now, the financial crisis has been front-page news in Puerto Rico and people are getting angrier.

SERGIO MARXUACH: The pharmacist told me, do you think should I move to Miami, you know? I got this offer, you know, to work at a pharmacy in Miami. And I said well, (laughter) I have no idea what your financial situation is - I can tell you what's going on in Puerto Rico. But, people are very worried. ALLEN: For 25 years, Puerto Rico has been caught in a debilitating economic spiral. Decades of recession and slow economic growth forced a succession of government to take out loans to cover budget deficits. MARXUACH: What we have been doing is basically borrowing to survive today. Unfortunately, our debt levels have gotten to a point where the rating agencies have downgraded our credit to below investment grade. ALLEN: Junk status. Puerto Rico has tried to negotiate a new bond sale with Wall Street investors. At the same time, the island's troubled energy company is desperately trying to stave-off default. Melba Acosta-Febo is Puerto Rico's point person on its economic crisis. For months, she's shuttled between the island, Washington, D. C. and New York City. At the Government Development Bank in San Juan, nearly 20 Wall Street bankers filed out of her office just before her interview with NPR. They'd just finished grilling Acosta for more than an hour. MELBA ACOSTA-FEBO: In these meetings, I mean, most of the questions are very similar questions, I mean, about all the issues - liquidity, finances, I mean, you know. ALLEN: Acosta says the Padilla administration inherited the huge debt and the troubled economy. That's true, but after years of mismanagement and borrowing, there aren't any easy solutions. To deal with its debt, Puerto Rico passed a law that would allow troubled agencies like the state-owned power company to seek bankruptcy protection. A federal judge struck down the law though. The Commonwealth is appealing that decision. It's also pushing for a law in Washington to amend the bankruptcy code to include Puerto Rico. But in the meantime, the island needs to find money to pay its creditors, and that means raising taxes. But in Puerto Rico, raising taxes is one thing, collecting them is another. Tax evasion is rampant. Economist Sergio Marxuach says Puerto Rico collects just 56 percent of the sales tax that's due. MARXUACH: You could see doctors here who charge you on a cash basis only. We're talking people who went to Harvard Med, Johns Hopkins, you know, and would have this sign, you know, that said, no checks, no credit cards, no ATM cards, just cash. ALLEN: To combat tax evasion, Puerto Rico recently passed a law requiring merchants to take some other payment in addition to cash. The Padilla administration also wants to adopt a value-added tax - a consumption tax that would be more difficult to evade. Government Development Bank head Melba Acosta concedes that small businesses are likely to take the biggest hit from the new tax. ACOSTA-FEBO: Many of those people don't report the whole revenues or over-report expenses. So now suddenly because they're paying consumption, they're paying more. But that's part of what we're doing to curtail tax evasion and to bring more money to the system. ALLEN: The current tax reform proposal has united Puerto Ricans rarely seen at protests outside the capitol, where tourists, protesters and snack vendors selling ice cream and doughnuts mingle under palm trees within view of the Caribbean ocean. Even some within Governor Padilla's own party are skeptical about raising taxes to pay down the debt. Puerto Rico's House recently voted down his tax plan. Puerto Rican Senator Ramon Luis Nieves says he believes in the end the Commonwealth may simply be unable to pay its $73 billion debt in full. RAMON LUIS NIEVES: At some point, we will have to decide either to pay for the debt service or pay for our schools and hospitals, health care and social services for the poor. I don't want to reach that point. ALLEN: Without enough money to pay its debts and with bankruptcy currently not an option, ultimately it may not be Puerto Rico, but bondholders on Wall Street who will decide the island's future.

It's part of a month-long rally, but nobody's predicting that we're going back to the days of $4 a gallon gasoline anytime soon. And as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, some analysts expect oil prices to fall again. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: OK, oil prices are up, but that's after an historic drop in prices down to about $45 a barrel just less than two months ago. So to understand what's going on now, let's take a look at what sent prices tumbling in the first place. We called up an economist who's been watching the oil market for more than 40 years. PHILIP VERLEGER: I think prices were pushed down by a realization on the part of Saudi Arabia. ARNOLD: That's Philip Verleger, he's an economist and a consult, and he says his whole life, he's never seen what he's seeing now. And he says Saudi Arabia could see it, too, and decided to let oil prices crash. VERLEGER: And what the Saudis could see was new forms of renewable energy consumption - windmills, tidal power, solar power and the Tesla. ARNOLD: Verleger says in the longer term, electric cars and those other technologies could mean less demand for oil. Shorter-term, the global economy is slowed, and that means less thirst for oil right now. At the same time with fracking, the U. S. is now rivaling Saudi Arabia as an oil superpower. VERLEGER: This rapid technological change in oil supply that hadn't been predicted with fracking in the United States that was threatening to displace their production. ARNOLD: So Verleger says the Saudis now want cheaper oil in part to slow down the fracking revolution in the U. S. and to signal to the developing world - don't worry, you don't need to invest in alternative energy. You can buy cheap oil from us. VERLEGER: They want to be the Walmart of oil - the low-cost supplier. ARNOLD: All right then, so what's pushing prices higher now? For one thing, cheaper oil prices have stunted fracking or at least new drilling in the U. S. Hillary Stevenson is an oil analyst at Genscape, which tracks oil production. And she says since the price crash, there are a lot fewer drilling rigs punching holes in the ground. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY STEVENSON: Since then, 982 oil rigs have been cut for a 57 percent drop. ARNOLD: Still, most of the fracking wells that were already there are still pumping oil. So Stevenson says there's still a tremendous supply glutting the market. That's why she and many other analysts don't see how this latest price increase can last. STEVENSON: The fundamentals do not point to the level of price increase that we've seen recently in the market. ARNOLD: Verleger, for his part, expects to see prices back down around $50 a barrel by the end of the year. Of course, nobody really knows where the price of oil is headed, but if he's right, that probably means gasoline prices this summer will be about a dollar cheaper than last year.

After years of borrowing to cover budget deficits, the U. S. territory is more than $70 billion in debt. The biggest chunk of the debt, more than $9 billion, is owed by one of the island's most troubled public agencies - its power company. NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: With tropical weather and beautiful beaches, Puerto Rico has a lot going for it, but there are downsides to living on an island. A big one is the cost of energy produced by Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority, also known as PREPA. Power in the U. S. territory costs more than any U. S. state except Hawaii, and that's not the biggest problem. LISA DONAHUE: PREPA is very damaged. PREPA needs a lot of work. ALLEN: Lisa Donahue is an expert on fixing utility companies that are in trouble. Since last year, she's been the executive leading the effort to overhaul Puerto Rico's power company. She recently testified before skeptical members of the island's Senate. DONAHUE: But I maintain that it's critically important, and I think we have one chance to do this right and to set PREPA on the right path and to fix it for the future of Puerto Rico. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking Spanish). ALLEN: On talk radio in San Juan and throughout Puerto Rico, the high cost of electricity and the problems with the power company are a leading topic. Sonia Vazquez says the monthly power bills for her home make no sense. SONIA VAZQUEZ: Why am I paying so much of this? What the heck is this, you know? It's really difficult to understand it. ALLEN: Standing outside the power company offices in San Juan, Vazquez is carrying her big file of bills and correspondence in a shopping bag some eight inches thick. Nearly four years ago, she began contesting part of her bill each month. Vazquez, a fearless 60-year-old, now owes the power company nearly $10,000 and says she has no intention of paying. VAZQUEZ: They're supposed to detail to me everything that they're charging me. Why am I paying something that I don't know what is contained in it? ALLEN: Many in Puerto Rico share Sonia Vazquez's dissatisfaction with the island's state-owned power company, including, perhaps surprisingly, Jose Maeso. Maeso is Puerto Rico's top energy official. There are many problems with PREPA, he says. JOSE MAESO: We have about 50 percent more of the capacity that we need right now. Along with that, we have most of the plants are very old - 50, 60 years. The infrastructure is not prepared to be modern, you know, to be competitive. ALLEN: It's a grid and series of power plants built when Puerto Rico nurtured dreams of industrialization. Decades later, many power plants sit idle, but customers are still paying for them - but only some of the customers. Nearly a third of PREPA's accounts received subsidized rates that required them to pay little or nothing. That includes many large users - city governments and hotels are officially exempt from paying. Maeso says others, including the schools and the island's train system, simply don't pay. MAESO: All of us are subsidizing whatever somebody else doesn't pay, even the government itself. But that definitely needs to stop in order for us to fix the whole system. ALLEN: After decades of mismanagement, for Puerto Rico's power company, time has run out. It's $9 billion in debt and now unable to make scheduled payments to creditors. It's operating week-to-week under a series of temporary agreements with Wall Street firms. And some of those bondholders have said they want to raise rates. Maeso is concerned about the impact that would have on the island's economy and its ability to retain factories and other large employers who may consider moving elsewhere. As for residential customers, like Sonia Vazquez, Maeso says they'll adjust by turning off lights and not using their air conditioners. It's advice that makes Sonia Vazquez angry. VAZQUEZ: They don't really care about us, you know? They just tell me don't use the dryer. Why don't you put your clothes outside? That's what they think. They really think that the way we can do it is sacrificing and paying more, but, you know, they subsidize everyone except the people that work. ALLEN: Puerto Rico's energy problems may come to a head in July when the power authority is expected to default. If that happens, it will be another blow to the island's already staggering economy.

Just a few years ago in 2011, it was going for more than $190 a ton. Global demand for it, especially in China, is way down, and that's being felt in many places in the U. S. , including Minnesota. Minnesota Public Radio's Dan Kraker reports. DAN KRAKER: Miners have clawed iron ore out of northern Minnesota for more than a century. The Iron Range, as it's known, is pockmarked with deep, abandoned pits carved out of the red earth. Six mines still operate here, processing a lower-grade iron ore called taconite. They still employ about 4,500 people, with an average salary around $80,000. So when U. S. steel announced it will be laying off more than a thousand workers at its two mines, it was devastating. John Arbogast is with the United Steelworkers Union at Minntac, the area's largest mine. JOHN ARBOGAST: This isn't the Twin Cities. This is all we have, and they're good-paying jobs, and these are hard-working people, and they love living here. They love the fishing, the hunting, everything that comes with living on the Iron Range. KRAKER: And it's not just miners who get hurt. Doug Ellis owns a sporting goods store in Virginia, the largest of nearly 20 small towns that line the Iron Range. It's surrounded on three sides by giant mines. DOUG ELLIS: My business is built on mining money. It's what drives all these towns. So really what happens is, when the mines catch a cold, we all catch pneumonia. KRAKER: Every year, Ellis sells hundreds of pairs of expensive steel-toed boots to miners and a lot of hunting rifles. (SOUNDBITE OF GUN BEING LOADED)ELLIS: Those will be impacted because by the time November comes around, if they don't have the money, they won't be buying new rifles. KRAKER: Iron Rangers are hardened to this traditional boom-and-bust cycle. The last big round of layoffs occurred in 2009. The industry did come roaring back, but iron miner John Arbogast says this feels different. ARBOGAST: In '09, everything was done. It was a recession, and you kind of could feel it coming. Now, America's doing great. Unemployment's at record-low-type levels. Everyone's doing well. And then we're the ones getting hit on this. So that's what makes it tough. KRAKER: The difference this time is that the Chinese economic juggernaut has slowed, says Andrew Lane, an analyst for Morningstar. ANDREW LANE: The significant decline in iron ore spot prices since about 2011 is largely a function of fading Chinese demand. KRAKER: At the same time, says Lane, the world's three largest iron ore mining companies have all ramped up production over the past decade. Some analysts predict the price of iron ore could drop still further. But in the long-term, Tony Barrett, an economist at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, thinks Minnesota's taconite iron ore industry will stabilize. TONY BARRETT: The world needs steel. I see the demand for steel recovering, and with that the demand for taconite. KRAKER: The question everyone's asking here, says Keewatin Mayor Bill King, is when. Because, he says, with every layoff, every closure. . . BILL KING: . . . It just seems like a small part of the town dies away each time. You know, you lose this business, or maybe a couple citizens move away. So it's hard. It's hard to watch.

AMY MYERS JAFFE: We had these stories that would circulate about hunting trips or fish fries where the industry was in the practice of having prostitutes attend. BRADY: Jaffe, a global energy policy expert, often is invited to speak at conferences, like this one recently in San Antonio. One that stands out in Jaffe's memory included a hospitality suite with women at the front door wearing not much more than bathing suits. JAFFE: And I remember joking at the time maybe we should get a suite and hire the Chippendale men. That would make the industry understand, like, what it's like to be a woman executive and have to go to a hospitality suite, you know, with these women greeters. BRADY: It took a while, but the industry got the message, and Jaffe says conferences are more professional now. Economist Rayola Dougher started her career in 1985. RAYOLA DOUGHER: I'd look out, and there'd just be a sea of blue suits (laughter). And it was a little lonely for a while, but now I see more and more women, especially women very involved in energy in one facet or another. BRADY: Dougher works at the American Petroleum Institute. Last year, an API study showed women make up only 19 percent of the oil industry's workforce. That's compared to 47 percent in the overall U. S. workforce. RICHARD KEIL: It's certainly something we're very concerned about. BRADY: Dick Keil is a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, which hires a lot of engineers and scientists. In the future, the company wants a larger share of them to be women, so Keil says Exxon Mobil assigns female employees to mentor middle school girls. RICHARD KEIL: All aimed at getting them interested in the subject and preparing them for taking math and science courses in high school that will help them study engineering in college. BRADY: This may be working. That API report on women in the oil business projects the share of women in white-collar jobs will increase. But on the blue-collar side, the report's authors believe the percentage of women will decline even further, and it's not because women can't do the work. At the Pennsylvania College of Technology, students practice working on a mock drilling rig. Claire Kerstetter finished a three week class here in 2013 and now works on fracking jobs. Usually, she's the only woman on the drill site. CLAIRE KERSTETTER: Like, all the guys that I worked with offered a helping hand when I first started. But when I rejected it and told them that I just wanted to do it for myself, I got their respect really quickly. BRADY: At this school, students learn other skills too, like welding. Sophomore Stephanie Puckly had an internship offshore last summer, and she's considering a career in the oil business. STEPHANIE PUCKLY: I very much enjoy the structural engineering part of it - watching the rigs go from just metal all the way up to these beautiful structures that are sent out into the ocean. BRADY: The school's president, Davie Jane Gilmour, hopes more young women will get this excited about jobs in male-dominated fields. DAVIE JANE GILMOUR: Yes, you may be a pioneer in some senses, but I have a feeling by the time they graduate in four years, there'll be plenty more women in the workforce for them.

DAVIE JANE GILMOUR: Yes, you may be a pioneer in some senses, but I have a feeling by the time they graduate in four years, there'll be plenty more women in the workforce for them. BRADY: Gilmour says beyond an interesting career, the pay is good, and companies tell her they want to hire more women.

S. job market is still doing pretty well after all. Job numbers were lousy in March. Experts were hoping that was a weather-related aberration. And now we have the numbers for April - turns out that employers added 223,000 jobs to payrolls. NPR's John Ydstie has the details. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Economist Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics says the April numbers suggest the U. S. economy remains on track after a bit of a scare in March. JIM O'SULLIVAN: I would say it's telling us that certainly the weakness we saw in the March number was a false alarm and that the economy is still growing pretty healthily. YDSTIE: Over the past three months, job growth averaged close to 200,000. But the March numbers were even uglier than first thought. Today's report revised job growth during that month down to 85,000. O'Sullivan says the statistical volatility in the jobs report was probably a factor, along with some late winter storms. O'SULLIVAN: The weather may well have been part of the story for sure. And maybe there was some concentrated effects from the oil drilling and the manufacturing weakness as well. YDSTIE: The strong dollar has hurt manufacturing by making U. S. exports more expensive abroad. And the drop in oil prices has cut employment in the oil and gas industry. That weakness continued to be evident in today's report. O'SULLIVAN: Certainly when you look at the details, the mining category, which is where, say, the oil drillers are, has weakened fairly noticeably. It was down 15,000 this morning. And the manufacturing numbers, while they haven't collapsed, have pretty much flatlined in the last couple months. YDSTIE: But O'Sullivan thinks the underlying economy remains healthy, and the negative effects of the oil price drop should soon reverse. O'SULLIVAN: When you think about the effects of lower oil prices, for sure it's a negative for the oil drillers. But it's not clear if we've seen the full plus yet in the other parts of the economy, in terms of consumer spending. And maybe there's a little bit more of a lag there. So I suspect the trend is actually a bit better than this 194 per month, so-far-this-year average. YDSTIE: The job growth numbers for the first 4 months of the year, while weaker than 2014, are still strong enough to keep the unemployment rate falling, according to O'Sullivan. In fact, the unemployment rate notched down another tenth of a percent in April, to 5. 4 percent. O'Sullivan thinks that's likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to begin raising interest rates later this year, probably in September. Another weak wage growth number in today's report suggests the Fed can hold off raising rates in June. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   We now have indications that the U.

Economists were quite convinced late last year those low prices would boost growth because people might go out and spend that extra money. NPR's John Ydstie reports things have not unfolded exactly as forecast. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: There's no doubt the plunge in oil prices and the lower costs for gasoline, heating oil and natural gas gave consumers a big windfall. JOHN CANALLY: They saved about $116 billion. YDSTIE: That's John Canally, chief economist at LPL Financial. He figures that $116 billion is about $83 per month, per household on average, or about a thousand dollars a year. Lots of economists predicted Americans would go out and spend most of that, but Canally says, they didn't. CANALLY: Consumers, since oil prices peaked back in June, have done what they've been doing this entire recovery, which is essentially they've spent a little, they've saved a little and they've paid down some debt. YDSTIE: Canally says he thinks many Americans learned a lesson during the financial crisis and are now being more prudent with their money. But in the short run, that's meant less consumption and less economic growth. So the growth dividend from lower energy prices has been elusive. LAURA ROSNER: I don't think it's completely materialized. YDSTIE: That's Laura Rosner, U. S. economist at BNP Paribas. For one thing, Rosner says, the negative effects of the energy bust came faster than expected, with quick cutbacks in exploration and drilling and big job losses. That was a drag on the economy, and wicked winter weather from Virginia to Maine kept the energy windfall cash in people's pockets. ROSNER: Actually 20 percent of all U. S. households live in either the mid-Atlantic or the Northeast. YDSTIE: That meant tens-of-millions of shoppers stayed at home and contributed to a near stall- out of growth in the first quarter, far underperforming hopes that the oil price windfall would fuel faster growth. Rosner says she thinks there's another reason the benefits of the windfall have been muted - Americans have been skeptical that the low energy prices will be lasting. ROSNER: We're seeing evidence that consumers actually expect gasoline prices to rebound, you know, almost back to their prior levels within a year or two. So that's an important reason why they may not be spending more as a windfall today. YDSTIE: While Rosner believes consumers have reacted cautiously up to now, she's seeing signs that they are ready to start spending more of the windfall. ROSNER: You know, really, the consumer sentiment data show that consumers are feeling better about the outlook. They're feeling more secure in their jobs and they're relatively optimistic. YDSTIE: Their added spending will help lift the U. S. growth rate this year, she says. John Canally agrees and he believes with more prudent U.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THOMAS AND FRIENDS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As Sir Topham Hatt) You have caused confusion and delay. BLAIR: Turns out many grown-ups have stopped to think about Sir Topham Hatt and how he runs things on the island of Sodor. Take Duncan Weldon of London, who has a new baby and a toddler at home. DUNCAN WELDON: I became over-interested in \"Thomas The Tank Engine\" probably as a result of sleep deprivation. BLAIR: Weldon is an economics correspondent for the BBC. WELDON: You see a lot going on with that railway company, but what you don't see is much evidence of a focus on shareholder value. BLAIR: In Tuscaloosa, Ala. , Paul Horwitz was equally intrigued by the economics on Sodor. He started watching \"Thomas\" when his daughter was 2 and he was at home recovering from surgery. PAUL HORWITZ: It's possible the reason it was fascinating was the morphine. BLAIR: Horwitz teaches law at the University of Alabama. He wrote a blog post called \"The Law And Economics Of Thomas The Tank Engine. \" He questioned Sir Topham Hatt's ethics. HORWITZ: When the trains aren't serving to move his raw materials from one part of the island to the other, then they're showing up to help him with a surprise party or an anniversary or to get him a new hat, or something of the sort.

BLAIR: Another thing economists have noted - a lack of competition on the island of Sodor. Duncan Weldon says there is Bertie the Bus.

It is owned by the passengers and the railway staff and, very importantly, all the engines. BLAIR: Sir Topham Hatt, says Allcroft, is an official appointed by this cooperative. She says he has a contract that's renewed on performance, and that's why he can be so gruff. ALLCROFT: He needs to keep his job.

BLAIR: Now, all of this might seem really silly - and it is - but law professor Paul Horwitz says he's observed a cottage industry of Sodorian economic analysts. HORWITZ: If you're a libertarian, you can write about Sodor as a libertarian paradise and if you hate big industry then you can say down with the capitalist Sir Topham Hatt. And if you just want an economy that's a little more personal in scale then you can talk about that aspect of the show.

In this class, he says he's realized he learned to act tough to survive. COBB: So you have to put on this fake mask almost to try to hide who you really are inside. And it starts to change you.

When we first meet, Smith exudes confidence - black suit, hair wrapped up high. But as she talks about her life, it's clear she can't shake her inner turmoil. SMITH: I walked around all these years, lost. And being here is teaching me that I cannot do that anymore. I have to rise above that. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Excuses are tools of incompetence. LUDDEN: Excuses, the class chants, are tools of incompetence. Three-hundred people complete this program each year. The Center for Urban Families says just over 200 are placed in jobs, including with major employers like Johns Hopkins University. The average wage for grads - $13 an hour. PATTERSON: However, many of those, we place two and three and four times. LUDDEN: The Center's Tenille Patterson.

When we first meet, Smith exudes confidence - black suit, hair wrapped up high. But as she talks about her life, it's clear she can't shake her inner turmoil. SMITH: I walked around all these years, lost. And being here is teaching me that I cannot do that anymore. I have to rise above that. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Excuses are tools of incompetence. LUDDEN: Excuses, the class chants, are tools of incompetence. Three-hundred people complete this program each year. The Center for Urban Families says just over 200 are placed in jobs, including with major employers like Johns Hopkins University. The average wage for grads - $13 an hour. PATTERSON: However, many of those, we place two and three and four times. LUDDEN: The Center's Tenille Patterson. PATTERSON: When you have someone that hasn't been consistently employed for two or three years, that first employment opportunity often doesn't stick. LUDDEN: The poverty and violence laid bare by Freddie Gray's death, she says, is a long-standing problem, and addressing it, a long-term project.

Detroit knows it's the punch line of jokes and also that the city filed for bankruptcy. But Detroit has emerged from that, and a new generation of artists, craftspeople and manufacturers is stepping forward. NPR's Michel Martin is heading to Detroit next week to find out more about them. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: For decades, when most Americans thought about Detroit, they probably thought about the auto industry or maybe the music of Aretha or Smokey or Diana Ross and the Supremes. Ahead of my trip to the Motor City, I wanted to know what's next. So I'm joined now by someone whose life and work has been focused on moving the city forward. Sue Mosey, also known unofficially as the mayor of Midtown, is the executive director of the nonprofit Midtown Detroit Inc. That's a post she's held for 27 years. That organization has helped plan and motivate development in the Midtown neighborhood. She told me that she believes the worst is definitely over for Detroit. She started by giving some examples of how the city is turning around. SUE MOSEY: You know, there's a lot of interesting repurposing of land going on here. And one of the initiatives last year was a man's idea for, you know, taking a huge, massive vacant acreage within the city and actually creating a beautiful new tree farm. There's other parts of the city that have also experienced tremendous disinvestment where just by pure grit and passion, people have staked claim to these neighborhoods, have created all sorts of wonderful arts uses, done everything from little Airbnbs to small outdoor theater operations, just as a way to sort of take these available, interesting landscapes and creating something really of value for the community. MARTIN: What do you think is the critical factor for a lot of the artists and the craftspeople and the manufacturers who have been coming back or revitalizing their businesses? Is it the space? Is it the affordability of the space? MOSEY: I think that's definitely one of the factors. I mean, we're working with a local set of designers right now who are trying to put together a small garment district here for just the reasons you've mentioned - that there are seamstresses here, and they're - you know, people know how to produce things here. But, you know, they're struggling, too. It's still a challenge, I think, to find the right property in the right location that can work for setting up one of these new industries. So we're seeing many of them settle in, and I think the level of interest is high for this kind of activity here. MARTIN: What about the relationships between the people who stayed and the people who are just now coming? You know, are there feelings - even, you know, perhaps a little resentment? MOSEY: Yeah. I mean, I think that it's a very topical issue now in Detroit as to how you really can have people work together side by side, who are part of a rebuild of a new economy, along with people who've been here who really have never been an active part of the economy. And. . . MARTIN: Well, what's the divide, though? Is it between newcomers and old-timers, or is it between people with different levels of education? Is it the idea that the new folks perhaps have more education, or is it race? MOSEY: I think it's part of all of those dynamics that are at work in the city. Part of it is 'cause the city has been so challenged for so long, we've lost a lot of population. Some of that population now is actually returning to the city, so you have that dynamic. Then you have others that, like I said, really haven't had the opportunity to participate in sort of the rebirth. You know, jobs remain a really significant problem here - the lack of jobs for many Detroiters, although there's a lot more emphasis, I think, with this administration to look at every way to benefit the Detroiters that have been here or that have recently relocated here. MARTIN: As I said at the beginning of our conversation, when most people think of Detroit, they probably think of the automobile and everything that's meant to American life. You know, in the next century, what do you think Detroit's legacy will be? MOSEY: Well, I don't know about the whole century. Clearly, autos are a still a big player here and going to continue to be. But in the city itself, arts, craft production. And then I think just the retail and the restaurants, lots of those folks are returning. You know, all of that, I think, bodes well for the city over the longer term. MARTIN: Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it for myself. Sue Mosey is the executive director of Midtown Detroit Inc.

You have bad credit. That's the message that three major credit rating agencies sent to Chicago this past week. Moody's Investors Service dropped the city down two notches, to junk status. From member station WBEZ in Chicago, Susie An reports. SUSIE AN, BYLINE: Moody's is knocking Chicago down to junk status, mainly because it's having trouble properly funding its workers' retirement benefits. Mayor Rahm Emanuel says the downgrade is irresponsible and plays politics with the city's financial future. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL: I'm committed to making sure that people have a pension that they can retire on in a way that is - doesn't overly burden taxpayers and our ability to grow our economy as we do that. AN: To be sure, it's rare for a city to be demoted to junk bond status. YVETTE SHIELDS: With the exception of Detroit, Chicago is really alone now among major cities carrying the junk bond rating from at least Moody's. AN: Yvette Shields is the Midwest bureau chief editor for Bond Buyer Newspaper. SHIELDS: Pittsburgh, in 2004, was rated at the same level, Ba1. And other cities have fallen in the speculative grade, like Cleveland in 1978. And, of course, the big one was New York City in 1975. AN: Shields says it took New York City about six years to be able to borrow again on its own. Chicago's situation isn't that bad. SHIELDS: The city is nowhere near a place where it would be locked out of the market or anywhere near where it should be considered that it's close to default. Even the most distressed borrowers, they can find investors. The question is, at what cost? AN: That cost in the short term is fewer lenders. Shawn O'Leary is senior research analyst with Nuveen Asset Management. SHAWN O'LEARY: That also means higher yields, higher interest rates, higher taxes to service that debt. AN: Chicago's junk status could push lenders to demand up to $2. 2 billion in immediate principal and interest payments. And that'll fall on the backs of city residents. For example, a homeowner with a $400,000 house currently pays just under $7,000 in property taxes. O'Leary says if the city of Chicago wants to fully service its pension funds, property taxes will need a major bump. O'LEARY: It would go up by about almost $3,400 to just over $10,000, which is about a 49 percent increase. AN: A 49 percent increase. O'Leary says it's more likely that lawmakers would opt for a combination of tax hikes, increased fees and cuts in city services, which still won't be easy to stomach. O'LEARY: What does that do to the tax base of Chicago? What does that due to population and demographic shifts? What does that do to business investment? And that's certainly a risk because this level of tax increase is no minor deal. And it will have implications for the economy. AN: But O'Leary says Chicago is not the next Detroit, a comparison that's often made when any major city is in financial distress. For one, Detroit was largely a single industry town, car manufacturing. Chicago's economy is much more diverse. O'LEARY: You're hard-pressed to identify what the single industry is in Chicago. It's a very solid mix of commercial and industrial and finance and medical and education. AN: O'Leary says it won't be easy, but Chicago has options to climb back up.

Another city just joined that fight, Santa Monica, Calif. The city council recently passed laws that will greatly limit rentals through sites like Airbnb. NPR's Sam Sanders reports. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Eighty-year-old Arlene Rosenblatt and her husband rent out their quaint converted duplex in Santa Monica when they're traveling to visit their grandkids. ARLENE ROSENBLATT: Let's see, that's my mom. A lot of these people are no longer alive. This is me. SANDERS: Rosenblatt's giving me a tour of her house. And she's pointing out dozens of photographs, many of her seven grandchildren. ROSENBLATT: Jud, Tom, Rebeccah, Jake, Eli, Mira, and Bella. SANDERS: She says the money they make renting through Airbnb helps. ROSENBLATT: I'm a retired school teacher. We don't get a lot of retirement income. My husband, all he has is his Social Security. SANDERS: Rosenblatt says under new rules in Santa Monica, she could lose up to $20,000 a year. The new guidelines say any rentals 30 days or less can only happen if the owner or permanent tenet stays in the house with the guest. That rule alone would make Rosenblatt's rentals illegal. The rules also implement a 14 percent tax on those rentals and require business permits. ROSENBLATT: Of course, I would get a business license. I would pay my hotel tax. But it's not fair for us to have to follow the same regulations that big business does. SANDERS: Rosenblatt's talking about leasing companies and vacation rental agencies that use Airbnb to post multiple listings for places no one actually lives in. She says she's being punished for what they're doing. So just who is using Airbnb in a place like Santa Monica, grandmas or business? Roy Samaan thinks he knows. ROY SAMAAN: The public persona that the company portrays does not really connect with which users generate the revenue. SANDERS: Samaan is a policy analyst for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. He led a big study on Airbnb in LA. And he found that a third of Airbnb revenue in the city comes from leasing companies, companies with lots of listing, often apartments that are only used for vacation rentals - basically, de facto hotels. Samaan says those vacation rentals cut into the number of residential apartments to rent, not just in Santa Monica and LA, but all over the country. SAMAAN: Supply and demand exists. When you have a tight rental market, this really exacerbates those market forces by taking hundreds of additional units out of circulation. SANDERS: Airbnb disagrees. DAVID OWEN: It's absolutely false. SANDERS: David Owen is head of policy at Airbnb. His company says 8 out of 10 LA users only rent out the space they live in, so they aren't taking units out of the market. And, Owen says, you can't pin the entire rental crisis on Airbnb. OWEN: Cities like Los Angeles and Santa Monica are facing affordable housing issues that are decades old. Any straight line between those issues and home sharing or Airbnb is smokescreen for very real issues around housing affordability. SANDERS: But since Samaan's study was released, Airbnb's been quietly removing listings from some of the big vacation rental companies Samaan drew attention to. Arlene Rosenblatt says she wants the new rules in Santa Monica changed. But, she says, with or without Airbnb, she's staying in her home. ROSENBLATT: Obviously, I could sell it and move somewhere else. But I'm living my dream right now. I mean, we walk almost every morning on the beach path. It's - it's amazing.

A new survey of financial professionals was released today and it tends to confirm that widely held belief. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Here's a data point from the survey that may give you pause. About half the respondents - all financial professionals in the U. S. or Britain - believe their competitors in the industry have behaved unethically or illegally to gain an advantage in the market. One of the authors of this study, Professor Ann Tenbrunsel, says that perception, even if it's just a suspicion, does not bode well for the industry. ANN TENBRUNSEL: Our behavior is influenced by the norms that we believe exist in the industry, the norms that we believe exist in the organization. If there's an increased salience of the fact that everybody else is doing this, we also know from psychological research on peer pressure, that I will be more likely to do it myself. YDSTIE: Tenbrunsel, of the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, partnered with the law firm Labaton Sucharow to do this study. The law firm, which often represents whistleblowers in cases involving financial industry wrongdoing, did a previous study in 2012. Jordan Thomas, a partner in the firm, says he's disappointed that perceptions of behavior inside the industry have actually deteriorated in many cases, including among younger employees. JORDAN THOMAS: Young professionals, people with less than 10 years in the financial service industry, tended to be more open to engaging in illegal or unethical behavior. And that's our future - that is the future of the financial service industry. And right now, it looks bleak. YDSTIE: Here's another disappointing finding - more than a third of those earning more than half a million dollars annually say they've actually witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace, and nearly a third of those responding to this survey said they believe compensation structures and bonus plans could incentivize employees to compromise ethics or break the law. Professor Lynn Stout, an expert in corporate ethics at Cornell University, says that's just part of the problem. LYNN STOUT: A second really damaging element of incentive pay is that it's especially attractive to people who are willing to break ethical rules because they see opportunities to earn salaries and to make money that more ethical people would not want to take advantage of. YDSTIE: Stout says she thinks a federal tax law that rewards companies that use incentive pay is contributing to the problem. And Tenbrunsel says getting laws and regulations right is important, but not the whole answer. TENBRUNSEL: Just more regulation without addressing the individual organizational and industry level factors probably isn't going to have a very significant impact. YDSTIE: Tenbrunsel says the financial industry must create an environment where it's clear to all the employees that unethical and illegal behavior are not acceptable.

YDSTIE: Tenbrunsel, of the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, partnered with the law firm Labaton Sucharow to do this study. The law firm, which often represents whistleblowers in cases involving financial industry wrongdoing, did a previous study in 2012. Jordan Thomas, a partner in the firm, says he's disappointed that perceptions of behavior inside the industry have actually deteriorated in many cases, including among younger employees. JORDAN THOMAS: Young professionals, people with less than 10 years in the financial service industry, tended to be more open to engaging in illegal or unethical behavior. And that's our future - that is the future of the financial service industry. And right now, it looks bleak. YDSTIE: Here's another disappointing finding - more than a third of those earning more than half a million dollars annually say they've actually witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace, and nearly a third of those responding to this survey said they believe compensation structures and bonus plans could incentivize employees to compromise ethics or break the law. Professor Lynn Stout, an expert in corporate ethics at Cornell University, says that's just part of the problem. LYNN STOUT: A second really damaging element of incentive pay is that it's especially attractive to people who are willing to break ethical rules because they see opportunities to earn salaries and to make money that more ethical people would not want to take advantage of. YDSTIE: Stout says she thinks a federal tax law that rewards companies that use incentive pay is contributing to the problem. And Tenbrunsel says getting laws and regulations right is important, but not the whole answer. TENBRUNSEL: Just more regulation without addressing the individual organizational and industry level factors probably isn't going to have a very significant impact. YDSTIE: Tenbrunsel says the financial industry must create an environment where it's clear to all the employees that unethical and illegal behavior are not acceptable.

JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The scheme involved traders from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, RBS, Barclays and UBS. U. S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch says that over a five-year period, these traders found a way to manipulate currency rates. She says they did this to protect each other's trading positions despite the fact that they were ostensibly competitors. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH: Their actions inflated the bank's profits while harming countless consumers, investors and institutions around the globe. ZARROLI: U. S. officials say the traders acted by secretly withholding bids and offers at particular times of day when currency rates are set. Because the banks are so huge and typically held such large trading positions, these maneuvers could have a tangible effect on exchange rates. Andrew McCabe directs the FBI's Washington Field Office.

ZARROLI: Although U. S. officials say the investigation is continuing, Gurule notes that none of the traders involved face charges so far. GURULE: They knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was criminal, and no individual is being held accountable for that criminal wrongdoing. ZARROLI: The Justice Department also decided to tear up the non-prosecution agreement it had with UBS. In 2012, the U. S. agreed not to prosecute the Swiss bank in connection with its efforts to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, which is used to set interest rates around the world. In exchange, UBS agreed to a series of banking reforms. These non-prosecution agreements are widely used by regulators to allow defendants to avoid criminal charges, which can easily drive a company out of business. But Attorney General Lynch said UBS's participation in the currency scheme suggests the bank didn't live up to its side of the bargain. LYNCH: UBS promised in other resolutions not to commit additional crimes, but it did. ZARROLI: Now UBS and the other banks face criminal charges.

The city council vote wasn't even close - 14 to 1. The wage doesn't take effect for another five years, but LA's restaurant industry is already anxious. Ben Bergman from member station KPCC reports. BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: Very few businesses like higher minimum wages, but restaurants especially don't like them because of their incredibly slim profit margins. CAROLINE STYNE: The economics of restaurants are pretty ridiculous. BERGMAN: Caroline Styne owns more than half a dozen high-end LA eateries. She says of every dollar that comes in, 95 cents goes out. There's food, rent and paying waiters, sous chefs, dishwashers - the hundreds of people it takes to keep her restaurants running smoothly. STYNE: Labor can account for up to 40 or more percent of the overall expenses of a restaurant. Our expenses overall are so high that when you see the net profit at the end of the year you say why on earth are you in this business? BERGMAN: Styne says she does it because she loves the people and the food, but that love can only go so far. She says a $15 minimum wage may make it impossible to keep going. Styne says she will have to raise menu prices 40 percent, which she's afraid will turn away many customers. STYNE: I'm actually very frightened. I've been frightened since this whole thing began. BERGMAN: Despite the higher cost of labor, Styne and many restaurant owners say they would've been OK with a higher minimum wage had the city allowed tips to count towards the wage. But California is one of the few states where tipped workers can't make less than minimum wage, and the city feared a so-called total compensation model would be illegal. Jot Condie, president of the California Restaurant Association, says his lawyers disagree. JOT CONDIE: If a city decides to create their own super minimum wage - I guess for lack of a better term - that goes well above the state minimum wage that there appears to be some authority for a city to create that kind of a policy. BERGMAN: Without the tip credit, Condie says a $15 wage would be devastating since so many restaurants already struggle to survive. CONDIE: I think it will fundamentally change the business model for many restaurants, particularly table service restaurants. BERGMAN: Condie says you can expect many more mandatory service charges, as is popular in Europe. A study from the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes higher wages, bears that out. It found a third of LA restaurants will be very likely to eliminate tipping altogether in favor of much higher menu prices and a service charge. It also found a quarter of restaurants would be very  likely to just close altogether. But Paul Sonn, with the National Employment Law Project, doesn't buy such predictions of doom and gloom. PAUL SONN: The evidence from cities that have raised the minimum wage significantly is that it's been a manageable transition, and it hasn't resulted in a slowing down in restaurant or other low-wage job growth. BERGMAN: Sonn points to San Francisco, where the restaurant industry has added jobs in the last few years as the city has steadily raised its minimum wage. But San Francisco is both smaller and much more prosperous than LA, so even Sonn admits a $15 minimum wage puts the city in uncharted waters. For NPR News, I'm Ben Bergman in Los Angeles.

President Obama has called for raising that minimum across the country. He's been resisted by business groups among others who contend they would simply hire fewer people. Some evidence may now come from LA, one of the nation's largest cities, where the City Council approved a proposal yesterday that would increase the minimum to $15 per hour over the next five years. That is more than double the current national minimum. NPR's Sam Sanders has more. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Lekecia Dukes lives in South LA. She's a home health care worker, and she makes LA's current minimum wage, $9 an hour. Dukes says she's not making enough. LEKECIA DUKES: No, I don't. I don't make enough money at all. SANDERS: Dukes works about 25 hours a week because she's a single mother, and she has to take care of her 9-year-old son. She does odd jobs for extra cash. DUKES: Picking up bottles for my son's school, help out a friend who has a thrift store on the weekends - gives me maybe $40. I try to have yard sales. SANDERS: Duke says an increase in her wages might change all that. DUKES: I would have more time and do something that would help, you know, increase my future, like go to school. I want to take up a trade. SANDERS: The proposal that passed City Council is not expected to have trouble clearing the city attorney's office or getting signed by the mayor. Once it does, LA's minimum wage will jump to $10. 50 next year, then gradually increase to $15 dollars an hour by 2020. Some very small businesses and nonprofits can delay the increases by a year. The city estimates 800,000 LA workers would benefit. But critics say it won't help people like Dukes at all. RUBEN GONZALEZ: What I feel right now is sadness, thinking of all those folks who just lost their jobs and don't even know yet. SANDERS: Ruben Gonzalez is with LA Chamber of Commerce. He says a wage increase that big will have to be offset. GONZALEZ: These business, the only way to absorb the cost is they're going to outright have to cut jobs. They're going to have to automate, which will mean they won't hire as many people. Or they're going to cut the hours of the folks they have. Or they're going to have to cut things like benefits. MICHAEL REICH: I don't see that happening on a substantial scale. SANDERS: Michael Reich studies the labor market at the University California Berkeley. He authored one of the studies LA City Council used to make their proposal. Reich points to a lot of other places that have successfully raised their minimum wages. He says San Francisco is a good example. That city raised its minimum wage from $6. 75 to $8. 50 in 2003. Reich studied the data afterwards. And he says, compared to surrounding areas, jobs were fine. REICH: No employment loss in San Francisco compared to the East Bay, no loss at all. SANDERS: But LA is not San Francisco. And this jump to $15, that's a 66 percent increase. Nevertheless, Lekecia Dukes, that health care worker, she says 2020 is too long to wait. DUKES: I'd make it $15 right now - yes, absolutely. Why - why not? SANDERS: Well, the minimum wage could end up at even more than that. If this proposal passes, beginning in 2022, minimum wage hikes would be linked to the consumer price index.

And that's why Dean Hales, who's lived here 77 years, is so delighted now. DEAN HALES: I've lived here most all my life and I can't hardly believe what I'm seeing. When you got people coming from all over the world to a little town of 1,800 people, you've got something pretty special. MORRIS: They've got Missouri Star Quilt Company - fifteen freshly remodeled buildings in Hamilton full of fabric, sewing machines and customers. Della Badger drove in here from Victorville, Calif.

A QUILT TOP IN LESS THAN AN HOUR! \")JENNY DOAN: Hi, I'm Jenny from the Missouri Star Quilt Company, and I have such a fun project for you. This is easy and quick, but it looks like you've just worked so hard. So let's take a look. . . MORRIS: Doan's how-to quilting videos have drawn millions of views. J. DOAN: I know. It's some crazy thing like that. (Laughter). You know, so just so you know - I can't hardly even use the bathroom in a restaurant without somebody saying, I love your tutorials. (Laughter). MORRIS: Doan says it's because she takes an easygoing approach to what's traditionally been a daunting and tedious craft. J. DOAN: Quilting has always been something that's like, really for the elite. And I'm like, just whack it up, we're going to put it together, this is going to be awesome. MORRIS: She says women from around the world visit Hamilton or write to thank her for getting them into quilting. J. DOAN: This has absolutely been the sweetest, most serendipitous thing that has ever happened to me. MORRIS: And this business would not have happened if Jenny had been a better financial planner. ALAN DOAN: My parents have always been bad with money. MORRIS: Alan Doan, Jenny's son, says the recession cost his folks their savings and threatened to take their house. A. DOAN: And, so me and my sister were looking at it, we said, we got to put something together so that mom can make a little extra cash. MORRIS: So in the fall of 2008, Doan and his sister took out loans and set their mom up with a business sewing other people's quilts together. Customers kept asking for fabric, so Alan built a website to sell it. A. DOAN: World, we're open - and you expect somebody to care, right? And so we launched the website. And I still have my Facebook post. I went and looked at it the other day. It's like, hey I launched this quilt shop for Mom, you guys should check it out. It has like, two likes. MORRIS: Doan was selling - well, trying to sell - a relatively new product, pre-cut fabric. The pieces come bundled together from the factory in a pack with different complementary prints, making it much easier and faster to make good-looking quilts. But one year in, business was terrible. J. DOAN: Alan came to me and said, Mom, are you interested in doing tutorials? And I said, sure honey, what's a tutorial? I mean, I had no idea. I had never been on YouTube. MORRIS: Well, the videos featuring pre-cut fabrics eventually took off. Sales exploded. And now, Missouri Star Quilt employs more than 180 people sewing, staffing stores, and like Mindy Lloyd, shipping thousands of packages a day from the company's huge new warehouse. MINDY LLOYD: This one's going to Australia. (Laughter). Isn't that neat? A. DOAN: We had to learn how to do this from, like, watching YouTube videos on how Amazon does it or something, right? MORRIS: Success has pushed the company into publishing, even food service. They're renovating more buildings, and by mid-summer, plan to double the number of quilt shops in Hamilton, even to add a man's land to give their customers' husbands something to do. The Doans aren't the first people from Hamilton to make it big in retail. James Cash Penney, Jr. landed his first sales job here almost 120 years ago. Penney left Hamilton a teenager, came back years later and opened his 500th J. C. Penney store here. It's not likely the Missouri Star Quilt Company can match that, but it has transformed this once sleepy little town into a quilting mecca. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris.

And I still have my Facebook post. I went and looked at it the other day. It's like, hey I launched this quilt shop for Mom, you guys should check it out. It has like, two likes. MORRIS: Doan was selling - well, trying to sell - a relatively new product, pre-cut fabric. The pieces come bundled together from the factory in a pack with different complementary prints, making it much easier and faster to make good-looking quilts. But one year in, business was terrible. J. DOAN: Alan came to me and said, Mom, are you interested in doing tutorials? And I said, sure honey, what's a tutorial? I mean, I had no idea. I had never been on YouTube. MORRIS: Well, the videos featuring pre-cut fabrics eventually took off. Sales exploded. And now, Missouri Star Quilt employs more than 180 people sewing, staffing stores, and like Mindy Lloyd, shipping thousands of packages a day from the company's huge new warehouse. MINDY LLOYD: This one's going to Australia. (Laughter). Isn't that neat? A. DOAN: We had to learn how to do this from, like, watching YouTube videos on how Amazon does it or something, right? MORRIS: Success has pushed the company into publishing, even food service. They're renovating more buildings, and by mid-summer, plan to double the number of quilt shops in Hamilton, even to add a man's land to give their customers' husbands something to do. The Doans aren't the first people from Hamilton to make it big in retail. James Cash Penney, Jr. landed his first sales job here almost 120 years ago. Penney left Hamilton a teenager, came back years later and opened his 500th J. C. Penney store here. It's not likely the Missouri Star Quilt Company can match that, but it has transformed this once sleepy little town into a quilting mecca.

S. automotive recall ever. Now, Honda recalled some of its cars with Takata air bags back in 2008. In the ensuing years, other car companies gradually followed suit. Six deaths were linked to those air bags, but despite pressure from Congress, Takata refused to expand its recall until this week. Sonari Glinton from NPR's Planet Money team has been following Takata's troubles over the last several years. He joins us from NPR West now. Sonari, thanks for being with us. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: It's good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Concerns about Takata's air bags go back a number of years now. Did something change this week that got an executive somewhere in the company to say we'd better recall 34 million vehicles? GLINTON: One of the interesting things about Takata is that it's not a customer-facing company, so if this had been, say, a Honda or Toyota, we would've gotten to this point much quicker because the American people would have demanded it. A company like Takata doesn't have the same concerns as a company like Honda. But now there's been so much pressure. . . SIMON: I've got to - why? I don't understand that. GLINTON: Because Takata's customers are car companies, and car companies' customers are you and I. And so if you see enough headlines about Honda and a recall, that's going to be problematic for you as a consumer, you might think differently about a car. Well, most people haven't heard of Takata. You're not buying a Takata, you're buying a Toyota. And so they don't have the same sort of customer responsibility that a car company has to maintain - not only a brand, but a relationship with its customers. So recently, car companies have been recalling cars with an overabundance of caution. If there is even an appearance of a problem, they've been making a recall, which is a problem because the average consumer - you know, it becomes so much background noise that people don't understand. I cover the auto industry and I've realized that I had a recall on my car - not an air bag recall - and I had no idea. SIMON: This is the largest recall of cars in U. S. history. What change might this make in the road? GLINTON: An interesting thing that's happening is that the car companies, some of them are really attacking this recall, doing things that they've never done. You would never have heard a car company advertise about a recall, right? Because it's advertising about a defect. But this defect, where shrapnel can come out of the air bag and injure the occupants, it's so important to get it fixed, that Honda, for instance, has been going to Facebook and other car companies have been sending you multiple letters, automated phone calls. This is unprecedented that you would be saying, hey guys, there's something wrong with our cars - in advertising - come in and get them fixed. That's a real change. SIMON: So when executives are deciding what to do, does somebody in the room say, this is what's best for the consumer? GLINTON: Well, you know, the government is supposed to do that. That's what the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does. They're the ones who actually make the recalls, but almost all recalls are voluntary because no one wants the news to be said that the government forced you to recall a product. Do you think it has a problem? It maybe has a problem? Let's get it recalled - I don't want to be the executive who's sitting in the hot seat on Capitol Hill explaining why my car has killed this many people. SIMON: NPR's Sonari Glinton, thanks so much.

The agency says it determined late last week that unusual activity had taken place and that the affected taxpayers will be given free credit monitoring services. NPR's Brian Naylor joins us now with more of the details, and, Brian, just how was this data stolen? How can it be used? BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Audie, the IRS says this was a pretty sophisticated operation. It took place between February and March, and what the fraudsters were doing was trying to get tax information using a link on the IRS website called Get Transcript. That information, that transcript, includes back tax returns and other data. It's typically used by people applying for mortgages and that sort of thing. And the idea is that with this information a criminal could better file a fraudulent return down the road, say, next year because they'd have a more complete record of the taxpayer and could easier fool the IRS safeguards in place. And so to get this transcript, the criminals needed to know not just a taxpayer's, you know, information and name and Social Security number and that, but also they would have to answer an authenticator question, like where were you married or what was your high school mascot? CORNISH: And where would that information come from? NAYLOR: Well, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen says it probably came from social media - Facebook pages, that kind of thing. Koskinen spoke during a conference call with reporters this afternoon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN KOSKINEN: This is not a hack in the normal sense of people just running around looking for passwords and trying to hack into the system. These are a set of people who are, as to say, imposters of the taxpayer. They weren't getting any data from us. They showed up with all the information and then tried to use it as best they could. CORNISH: So now that the IRS knows about this operation, what are they doing about it? NAYLOR: Well, Koskinen says they took the link Get Transcript down, and, in addition, they're offering the free credit monitoring. And the inspector general and the IRS criminal investigation office is looking into it. They also say the breach did not affect the main computer system that handles tax filing submissions. That system remains secure. And they also sent out letters - the IRS did - to all 200,000 taxpayers whose accounts had attempted access. So it was only half of those that the access was actually given. CORNISH: Brian, does the IRS know how much it actually paid out in these fraudulent returns? NAYLOR: Well, Koskinen says it's hard to know for sure at this point because the information that was obtained may be, you know, intended for filing fraudulent returns next year. But so far, they think they've paid out under $50 million fraudulently. CORNISH: And yet, this is not the first time the IRS has had trouble with fraudulent returns this year, right? NAYLOR: No, right. You know, it's become an increasingly serious problem. You may recall TurboTax stopped handling state tax returns earlier this year when it appeared that people were using that service to file fraudulently. But this problem doesn't appear to be related to the TurboTax issue. CORNISH: And who does the IRS say is responsible for this latest breach?

LEIGH JERRARD: We are overwhelmed with inquiries right now, so it may be a while before we get back to you, but have faith. BERGMAN: Jerrard's company helps homeowners with the often complicated process of installing their own greywater systems, which take drainage from showers or washing machines to water lawns. Sounds like a great idea now, but six years ago when Jerrard started the company, few people were interested. JERRARD: Up until about a year ago, it's been pretty slow. Things started to pick up. Last year was the first year we were kind of solvent. And within the last month or two, the phone's been kind of ringing off the hook. BERGMAN: In between interviewing to add another employee and another site visit, Jerrard managed to squeeze in an initial consultation for Lisa Mann at her craftsman-style house in Pasadena.

JERRARD: Yeah, the powder has a lot of salt. BERGMAN: And part greywater evangelism. JERRARD: Water is unnaturally cheap. It's under a penny a gallon, and it allows people to really treat it with disrespect. BERGMAN: After an hour, Mann is converted. MANN: Sign me up. I'm serious. We got to do this. BERGMAN: Using greywater will be both more expensive and more complicated than Mann thought. But to her, it's worth it. MANN: It seems like the drought never ends. It's been here a while and it doesn't seem like it's going away, so we need to find ways to landscape and to be more efficient with our house. BERGMAN: That sentiment is also helping entrepreneurs like Gayle Butensky, who started a drought-tolerant landscaping business five years ago.

Sure, there are success stories and many pervasive problems, too. A new study came out this week, and it shows that commercial property taxes in the city are the highest of any in the nation. NPR's Jason Margolis reports. JASON MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Here's a great thing about Detroit; it's easy to become a real estate mogul. Sean Harrington picked up an eight-story building downtown a dozen years ago just two blocks from where the Tigers play. SEAN HARRINGTON: I got that property for 400,000 - yeah, pretty cheap. It was originally the Iodent Toothpaste factory where they mixed iodine and tooth powder and made a toothpaste. MARGOLIS: Think about that. Four-hundred-thousand dollars bought him enough space to build 14 apartments, now called the Iodent Lofts, and a two-story martini bar below. Now, before you think he got such a steal though, let Harrington finish describing the purchase. HARRINGTON: The windows were basically gone. The roof was basically completely worn away. Pigeons had gotten in. MARGOLIS: But he adds, the building had good bones. Harrington put $5 million into fixing it up. He said the city helped him get going with a tax abatement. HARRINGTON: It's great for a brief period of time, but when that ends, all of a sudden, your taxes go up too. So you wind up with 3,000 a month. MARGOLIS: Or $36,000 a year - that's nearly $4,000 more than he'd be paying in New York. That city has the second-highest commercial property taxes according to the new study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence. And Harrington is pretty sure he's not getting the same level of services he'd get in New York. Consider water. Harrington also runs The Town Pump Tavern where we met. A few months ago, a city pipe burst and water gushed through his basement wall. HARRINGTON: It wasn't like it was under light pressure. It was a fair amount of water. MARGOLIS: Now, that could have happened anywhere. But in Detroit, it didn't get fixed properly, and Harrington got stuck with a hefty bill for all that water he never used. HARRINGTON: We are sitting on - fighting over 81-plus thousand. MARGOLIS: Harrington's taxes also support things like underfunded and understaffed police and fire departments. His insurance agent said this substandard service is going to cost him. HARRINGTON: Everybody with a building downtown is going to be paying more in insurance because we don't have any trucks that have the ability to pump water without leaking. MARGOLIS: That last bit about all the trucks leaking might be hyperbole. But some do leak, and Detroiters pay more for insurance as a result. The new mayor is trying to tackle all of this. With regards to property taxes, the city is reassessing building values, lowering most in the city by 5 to 20 percent. Lower property values translate into lower taxes. Tax experts I spoke with say that's a good beginning, but tax rates also need to be lowered. I asked Harrington what he'd do with more money in his pocket. HARRINGTON: Growth is the next logical step in business. Build a better kitchen. Put a patio out. MARGOLIS: The projects would create short-term work for local contractors, and Harrington would likely need a couple extra permanent employees as well. Detroit could definitely use that kind of growth. The city's unemployment rate is more than 12 percent. At this point, you might be wondering, why do small business owners like Harrington bother to stay in Detroit? HARRINGTON: You know, I'm from here. This is my home, and this is where I like living. That's why I live here. Going to the suburbs is not even an option for me. MARGOLIS: So why are taxes in Detroit so high? Ren Farley, a demographer at the University of Michigan, says there are historical reasons. REN FARLEY: The story of Detroit after World War II is losing businesses, losing residents, and one way of adjusting was to add taxes. Detroit has the highest income tax in the state of Michigan, has a 2 percent tax on corporate profits, has a tax on utility bills. Those are unique to Detroit, and they were imposed because the tax base was disappearing. MARGOLIS: In 1950, Detroit had roughly 1. 9 million residents. Today, there are 680,000. That's a 65 percent decrease. HARRINGTON: Yeah, so we're two stories with a mezzanine. MARGOLIS: A few hours before opening, Sean Harrington shows me around his martini bar, the Centaur. It's polished and swanky. Just outside, the neighborhood is an odd mix of nice places and neglected buildings and parking lots surrounded by chain-link fences. Harrington firmly believes that Detroit is on the road to recovery but is also tired of people here sugarcoating things. He says Detroiters have become too defensive. HARRINGTON: There was an umpire that came in, and he said Detroit is a really crappy, you know, city. I come out of my hotel. I walk past crappy block after crappy block and - with the occasional nice thing. And he tweeted this out, and everyone was like, oh, my God, I can't believe he talked about the crappy blocks. Well, then we should fix the crappy blocks. MARGOLIS: You know, you're interesting because you're sort of a pragmatist, optimist and pessimist all at the same time. HARRINGTON: (Laughter). I'm a true Detroiter. MARGOLIS: Jason Margolis, NPR News, Detroit. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  We're going to peel back the headline, Detroit is making a comeback, now. Sure, there are success stories and many pervasive problems, too. A new study came out this week, and it shows that commercial property taxes in the city are the highest of any in the nation. NPR's Jason Margolis reports. JASON MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Here's a great thing about Detroit; it's easy to become a real estate mogul. Sean Harrington picked up an eight-story building downtown a dozen years ago just two blocks from where the Tigers play. SEAN HARRINGTON: I got that property for 400,000 - yeah, pretty cheap. It was originally the Iodent Toothpaste factory where they mixed iodine and tooth powder and made a toothpaste. MARGOLIS: Think about that. Four-hundred-thousand dollars bought him enough space to build 14 apartments, now called the Iodent Lofts, and a two-story martini bar below. Now, before you think he got such a steal though, let Harrington finish describing the purchase. HARRINGTON: The windows were basically gone. The roof was basically completely worn away. Pigeons had gotten in. MARGOLIS: But he adds, the building had good bones. Harrington put $5 million into fixing it up. He said the city helped him get going with a tax abatement. HARRINGTON: It's great for a brief period of time, but when that ends, all of a sudden, your taxes go up too. So you wind up with 3,000 a month. MARGOLIS: Or $36,000 a year - that's nearly $4,000 more than he'd be paying in New York. That city has the second-highest commercial property taxes according to the new study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence. And Harrington is pretty sure he's not getting the same level of services he'd get in New York. Consider water. Harrington also runs The Town Pump Tavern where we met. A few months ago, a city pipe burst and water gushed through his basement wall. HARRINGTON: It wasn't like it was under light pressure. It was a fair amount of water. MARGOLIS: Now, that could have happened anywhere. But in Detroit, it didn't get fixed properly, and Harrington got stuck with a hefty bill for all that water he never used. HARRINGTON: We are sitting on - fighting over 81-plus thousand. MARGOLIS: Harrington's taxes also support things like underfunded and understaffed police and fire departments. His insurance agent said this substandard service is going to cost him. HARRINGTON: Everybody with a building downtown is going to be paying more in insurance because we don't have any trucks that have the ability to pump water without leaking. MARGOLIS: That last bit about all the trucks leaking might be hyperbole. But some do leak, and Detroiters pay more for insurance as a result. The new mayor is trying to tackle all of this. With regards to property taxes, the city is reassessing building values, lowering most in the city by 5 to 20 percent. Lower property values translate into lower taxes. Tax experts I spoke with say that's a good beginning, but tax rates also need to be lowered. I asked Harrington what he'd do with more money in his pocket. HARRINGTON: Growth is the next logical step in business. Build a better kitchen. Put a patio out. MARGOLIS: The projects would create short-term work for local contractors, and Harrington would likely need a couple extra permanent employees as well. Detroit could definitely use that kind of growth. The city's unemployment rate is more than 12 percent. At this point, you might be wondering, why do small business owners like Harrington bother to stay in Detroit? HARRINGTON: You know, I'm from here. This is my home, and this is where I like living. That's why I live here. Going to the suburbs is not even an option for me. MARGOLIS: So why are taxes in Detroit so high? Ren Farley, a demographer at the University of Michigan, says there are historical reasons. REN FARLEY: The story of Detroit after World War II is losing businesses, losing residents, and one way of adjusting was to add taxes. Detroit has the highest income tax in the state of Michigan, has a 2 percent tax on corporate profits, has a tax on utility bills. Those are unique to Detroit, and they were imposed because the tax base was disappearing. MARGOLIS: In 1950, Detroit had roughly 1. 9 million residents. Today, there are 680,000. That's a 65 percent decrease. HARRINGTON: Yeah, so we're two stories with a mezzanine. MARGOLIS: A few hours before opening, Sean Harrington shows me around his martini bar, the Centaur.

WEINER: Not just any paper, a small black notebook with an elastic band and a storied past. Picasso and Hemingway used an early version of the Moleskine, and now for 11. 99 plus tax, you can, too. The Italian company that makes Moleskine's - all 500 versions - is red hot, consistently recording double-digit sales growth. Oddly enough, the analog company's success has grown in tandem with the digital revolution. In fact, the company noticed something even stranger - a direct correlation between sales of their little black notebooks and proximity to an Apple Store. Moleskine CEO Arrigo Berni says his customers are no Luddites.

I took out of a piece of paper and brain-vomited everything that was swirling around in my head, and I realized that. . . WEINER: Consider the case of Angelia Trinidad, a recent college graduate and self-proclaimed gadget freak. Not that long ago, she found herself adrift professionally and emotionally, so she sought out a planner, a paper planner. None felt quite right, so she designed her own. Smelling a business opportunity, she launched this Kickstarter campaign. She was aiming for $10,000. She raised more than half a million. TRINIDAD: We went viral for a whole week, and it was insane. WEINER: Friends urged her to launch a digital version of her planner, but she resisted. TRINIDAD: And I put my foot down, and I said no. I said no apps. WEINER: She has nothing against apps. Her smartphone is chockablock with them, but she finds paper more intimate. TRINIDAD: It's this thing that is so intuitive, and it's between you and paper and a pen, and its kind of meditative I think whenever I make a mind-map of what I'm thinking or whenever I'm drawing that I feel - like, when I'm on my phone, it's never meditative. It's always tasky. WEINER: As a writer, I'm looking at a screen and I'm typing the words. . . TRINIDAD: Yeah. WEINER: . . . And it doesn't feel finished until you hit the print button. TRINIDAD: And it's on paper. WEINER: And it's on paper. WEINER: Maybe Angelia and I are just a couple of sentimental paper lovers - maybe. But some recent research suggests otherwise. Pam Mueller was a teaching assistant for an introductory psychology class at UCLA. One day, she forgot to bring her laptop to class. PAM MUELLER: So I took notes, you know, the old-fashioned way, the way I did in college, pen and paper, and I thought I got so much more out of the lecture that day. WEINER: She mentioned this to her professor Daniel Oppenheimer. MUELLER: And then he had a sort of similar experience in a faculty meeting where he'd been typing and realized he'd been writing down everything that everyone said but actually had no idea what it was all about. So since we both had these intuitions that we should test them. WEINER: So they did. DANIEL OPPENHEIMER: This is also I think confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of woman in creating. . . WEINER: Students listened to this lecture. Half typed notes on laptops, and half wrote them by hand. Both groups were then given a comprehension test. It wasn't even close. The students who used paper scored significantly higher than those who used laptops. Mueller attributes this unexpected finding, published in the journal Psychological Science, to the fact that the analog note takers were forced to synthesize rather than merely transcribe, a phenomenon known as desirable difficulty. MUELLER: Desirable difficulty is, you know, some small roadblock that's in your path that actually, you know, improves your understanding of a topic. WEINER: Mueller has taken her research findings to heart. Whenever she needs to truly grasp a subject, she ditches the laptop and takes notes with old-fashioned pen and paper.

Just the interest on that could be a serious constraint for the next president. This week, we're looking at the challenges he or she will face on day one. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Danette Kenne is not your typical deficit scold. She's an Iowa college administrator, not some grim-faced killjoy who spends a lot of time muttering about red ink. DANETTE KENNE: I'm like a lot of people. I have a busy life. The federal budget is something that's out there, but in our day-to-day life doesn't necessarily take focus. HORSLEY: What brings the government's budget into focus for Kenne is her 9-year-old daughter. She wonders if the debt racked up by the government will leave her daughter with less opportunity than she's had. KENNE: I think about my parents who grew up during the Depression and what they've lived through in order to make my life better and what I should be doing in order to make my daughter's life better. HORSLEY: So, Kenne, who works at Drake University in Des Moines, has signed up with the deficit watchdog Concord Coalition in its effort to sound out presidential candidates about how they see the country's fiscal future. KENNE: Being in Iowa, one of the things we can do is ask questions. HORSLEY: Kenne and her neighbors will be quizzing presidential hopefuls about the first budget they plan on presenting to Congress. The next president's budget is likely to be a lot less frightening than President Obama's first spending plan. With the Great Recession behind us and the economy on the mend, the federal deficit in 2017 is projected to be only about a third as large as it was in 2009. Even though the tide of red ink is receding, though, the government is still adding to its overall debt. Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, says the bill for that will come due when interest rates begin to rise from their current, rock-bottom level. MAYA MACGUINEAS: It's kind of like a credit card teaser rate where when rates are really low, it seems really cheap to borrow, but when they shoot up, boy, are you in trouble then. And that's what could happen to this country. HORSLEY: MacGuineas warns a return to more normal interest rates would add tens of billions of dollars to the government's annual borrowing costs. That's money that wouldn't be available for anything else. MACGUINEAS: No matter if you're far on the left, if you're far on the right, if you're squarely in the center; there are things that you want the government to be able to do. And if there are no resources, there's really no room in the budget to meet your priorities. HORSLEY: Last week, the fiscally hawkish Peterson Foundation brought together budget experts from five different Washington think tanks and asked for their advice on how to get control over the government's debt. Michael Peterson, who heads the foundation, says all five managed to come up with an answer. MICHAEL PETERSON: Good news is that there are many solutions available. HORSLEY: The various solutions offered by the different think tanks reflect their varying ideologies - liberal, conservative, middle of the road. But there were some similarities. Four of the five think tanks suggested the government should spend more in the coming decades, as the share of the economy, than it does now. And, MacGuineas notes, all five suggested the government should tax more. MACGUINEAS: Certainly they had different balances between revenues and spending, but they were able to get there. It shows it's doable. The challenge is the political will and the leadership. HORSLEY: Or maybe there are too many leaders pointing in too many different directions. Because while each of the five think tanks has a road map to reduce the debt, each follows a different path with its own mix of domestic and defense spending and its own formula for raising government revenue. Political leaders are equally divided, and with both parties jockeying for political power, MacGuineas says they've been unwilling to compromise, convinced that if they just hang tough, they won't have to. MACGUINEAS: It seems like they keep telling themselves the story if only we can win in this next election and we can have the House and the Senate and the White House, all these excuses, then we'll do it. But the then never comes. HORSLEY: Danette Kenne found more consensus back in Iowa, where she and some of her fellow residents got together for their own exercise in fixing the federal budget. Over the course of a two-hour session, they didn't necessarily agree on a detailed spending and taxing plan, but Kenne says they did find some flexibility and a willingness to keep talking. KENNE: We tend to hear the lack of consensus and the argument more than we do the agreement. But at the end of that exercise, I heard people say we all agree that we need to figure out a way to make this work. HORSLEY: That willingness on all sides to give ground is likely to be critical if the next president hopes to make progress on the federal debt. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

It's the largest outbreak in U. S. history - most serious in the middle west but affecting 20 states and tens of millions of birds. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack spent last week meeting with farmers, producer groups and government officials in Iowa and Wisconsin. And he joins us now from the studios of Wisconsin Public Radio in Milwaukee. Secretary Vilsack, thank you very much for being with us. TOM VILSACK: Well, thank you. It's a good opportunity to be with you. WERTHEIMER: The size of this outbreak, Mr. Secretary, is unprecedented, I understand. What has the impact been so far on the U. S. poultry industry? VILSACK: Well, there are roughly 220 or so facilities that have been impacted and affected by this - most of them commercial operations. Roughly 47 million birds - turkeys, chickens, laying hens - have been impacted. It represents roughly about 10 percent of the laying hens in the country, roughly 70 percent of the turkey population. WERTHEIMER: Now, it sounds frightening. Should we be eating eggs? Should we worry about eating chicken? VILSACK: There's no health issue involved here. There's no capacity and no risk of transmission from birds to humans. The chickens that are impacted are essentially killed. The eggs that were laid by the chickens are being destroyed. So this is really about animal health. It's about the producers who are going to be devastated as a result of the loss of their livelihood for an extended period of time. WERTHEIMER: I assume that with all of these animals being destroyed and eggs being destroyed and whatnot there are going to be shortages. And where there are shortages, there are rising prices. How is it going to affect ordinary consumers? VILSACK: The reality is that there may be a surplus of certain parts of chicken because our export markets have been impacted and affected by this. Roughly 20 percent of chicken exports are now basically banned based on decisions made by countries either to ban all poultry exports from the U. S. or exports from specific states that have been impacted by all of this. But on the egg side, you are liable to see, over time, increased costs for a dozen eggs and increased costs for goods that basically use liquid eggs in the development or processing of foods. WERTHEIMER: I wonder if you think that ultimately the only thing that will stop this sort of disease sweeping across an entire industry is to change the nature of the industry - the, perhaps, smaller barns organizing the production of chickens and eggs in a different way? VILSACK: Well, I'm not certain about that because this has impacted and effected backyard operations as well because of the nature of the virus and how it's initially presented into an area through geese and ducks that are wild. There is not much you can do about that. So I don't think it's necessarily getting away from the way in which chickens or eggs are produced so much as it is making sure that whatever system you use, that you're very conscious about the bio-security aspects of it. What that means is taking a look at facilities and making sure that there's no way in which an isolated bird might be able to enter a facility and basically spread the virus, to make sure that employees that are working in these facilities understand the importance of showering, making sure that the water that is used to water the birds doesn't come from a contaminated pond, for example. All of these steps and more have to be taken very seriously. And we're also looking at a vaccine. But it isn't necessarily 100 percent effective. WERTHEIMER: Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, thank you very much for spending the time with us, sir. VILSACK: You bet. Thank you. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  Avian flu is raging through poultry farms across the United States. It's the largest outbreak in U. S. history - most serious in the middle west but affecting 20 states and tens of millions of birds. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack spent last week meeting with farmers, producer groups and government officials in Iowa and Wisconsin. And he joins us now from the studios of Wisconsin Public Radio in Milwaukee. Secretary Vilsack, thank you very much for being with us. TOM VILSACK: Well, thank you. It's a good opportunity to be with you. WERTHEIMER: The size of this outbreak, Mr. Secretary, is unprecedented, I understand. What has the impact been so far on the U. S. poultry industry? VILSACK: Well, there are roughly 220 or so facilities that have been impacted and affected by this - most of them commercial operations. Roughly 47 million birds - turkeys, chickens, laying hens - have been impacted. It represents roughly about 10 percent of the laying hens in the country, roughly 70 percent of the turkey population. WERTHEIMER: Now, it sounds frightening. Should we be eating eggs? Should we worry about eating chicken? VILSACK: There's no health issue involved here. There's no capacity and no risk of transmission from birds to humans. The chickens that are impacted are essentially killed. The eggs that were laid by the chickens are being destroyed. So this is really about animal health. It's about the producers who are going to be devastated as a result of the loss of their livelihood for an extended period of time. WERTHEIMER: I assume that with all of these animals being destroyed and eggs being destroyed and whatnot there are going to be shortages. And where there are shortages, there are rising prices. How is it going to affect ordinary consumers? VILSACK: The reality is that there may be a surplus of certain parts of chicken because our export markets have been impacted and affected by this. Roughly 20 percent of chicken exports are now basically banned based on decisions made by countries either to ban all poultry exports from the U. S. or exports from specific states that have been impacted by all of this. But on the egg side, you are liable to see, over time, increased costs for a dozen eggs and increased costs for goods that basically use liquid eggs in the development or processing of foods. WERTHEIMER: I wonder if you think that ultimately the only thing that will stop this sort of disease sweeping across an entire industry is to change the nature of the industry - the, perhaps, smaller barns organizing the production of chickens and eggs in a different way? VILSACK: Well, I'm not certain about that because this has impacted and effected backyard operations as well because of the nature of the virus and how it's initially presented into an area through geese and ducks that are wild. There is not much you can do about that. So I don't think it's necessarily getting away from the way in which chickens or eggs are produced so much as it is making sure that whatever system you use, that you're very conscious about the bio-security aspects of it. What that means is taking a look at facilities and making sure that there's no way in which an isolated bird might be able to enter a facility and basically spread the virus, to make sure that employees that are working in these facilities understand the importance of showering, making sure that the water that is used to water the birds doesn't come from a contaminated pond, for example.

KAOMI GOETZ, BYLINE: A dreary chill settled over New York City earlier this week, making it a little hard to think about summer. But the weather didn't dampen the enthusiasm of 16-year-old Jose Moncada. He came to Manhattan's Lower East Side to the Henry Street Settlement to register for a summer job. JOSE MONCADA: I'm in a program for GCB (ph), and they told us to - the told me to show you that. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: OK. GOETZ: Moncada is filling out paperwork in the agency's gym. He'll be one of the nearly 50,000 young people to get a six-week job through the city's summer youth employment program. He hopes to get the same job he had last summer cleaning streets at the state minimum wage of $8. 75 an hour. MONCADA: Having a job, it makes me feel, you know, exciting, you know, somewhat.

The U. S. territory is struggling to emerge from nine years of recession. In that time, hundreds of thousands of people have left. Puerto Rico has lots of debt. It's running low on cash. And it's on the verge of default. So the long-term picture remains bleak. But in the short term, NPR's Greg Allen reports on recent moves that may help buy time for Puerto Rico's economy. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Puerto Rico's problems are numerous, a declining population, high energy costs, a double-digit unemployment rate and rampant tax evasion. It's led many to call it the Greece of the Caribbean. Joseph Rosenblum, who directs municipal credit research at investment firm AllianceBernstein, laughs when asked about the comparison. It's not long ago, he says, that California and its debt problems were being compared to Greece. JOSEPH ROSENBLUM: I guess the comparison is similar in the sense that there is a large amount of debt, and there is no clear path to what the final resolution of the problems are. But there are some real differences between the two. ALLEN: Michael Lipsky of MatlinPatterson Global Advisers, a hedge fund, says the biggest difference is that Puerto Rico is part of the U. S. MICHAEL LIPSKY: It's pretty clear that the New York Federal Reserve is overseeing the liquidity situation for the island of Puerto Rico, the fact that it's American laws that we're sitting down at the table negotiating. ALLEN: There is one key difference between Puerto Rico and the rest of the U. S. The territory's prohibited from using bankruptcy to help it restructure debts. That means it has to negotiate with investors. Over the last few years, companies like AllianceBernstein that invest in municipal bonds have sold off their Puerto Rico holdings as the island's finances worsened and default appeared possible, even likely. Hedge funds, including MatlinPatterson, which like the higher returns associated with increased risk, have rushed in. Last month, they got some welcomed news. Puerto Rico's government passed a significant tax increase, one expected to generate $1. 2 billion in new revenue. Lipsky says it should help Puerto Rico get the money it needs to stave off default. LIPSKY: Any increase in revenue, anything that shows some accord between the two political parties in the commonwealth, I think will be welcomed by the markets. And I do believe that will start to pave the way towards ultimate access to the market. ALLEN: That's good news for Puerto Rico's investors and the administration of Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, which has been struggling to find money for big debt payments due next month. But island residents, led by student groups, staged big protests when a budget including the new taxes was announced last month. Sergio Marxuach, with the Center for a New Economy in San Juan, says there's little question the new taxes will cause real pain. SERGIO MARXUACH: There will be a significant drag on the economy in the short term. That will intensify or magnify the stagnation, maybe put us back into contraction. ALLEN: Over decades, as the economy slowed down, a succession of governments in Puerto Rico used loans from Wall Street to cover budget deficits. The result is a dizzying array of debts, from general obligation bonds to bonds backed by the island's utilities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, PREPA. An expert on restructuring utilities hired by PREPA proposed a turnaround plan to investors this week, one that would require an additional $2. 3 billion in loans. Bondholders in PREPA are continuing negotiations. A $400 million payment is due next month. Those negotiations may help provide a blueprint for Puerto Rico in restructuring the rest of its debt. While difficult, Puerto Rico's financial problems are hardly unprecedented. New York City and Cleveland in the '70s, Orange County, Calif. and Washington, D.

Unusual because the news is positive - profits are up. This is after one casino after another closed last year. Four out of a total of 12 shut their doors. Well, it turns out the reduced competition has benefited the casinos left standing. But as Emma Jacobs reports, there are still plenty of challenges ahead. EMMA JACOBS, BYLINE: Casino customers tend to be pretty loyal to one or two houses to accrue rewards or sometimes for other reasons. PATTY DAVIS: We like to bring the dog down once in a while 'cause he likes to, you know, walk the boardwalk, go in the ocean. JACOBS: Patty Davis and her husband used to go to the Showboat casino because its hotel allowed dogs. When it closed in September, the Davis's and their Pomeranian - who they call President Clinton -didn't know where they would go next. DAVIS: And so then we found out that Harrah's would allow dogs, so now we go to Harrah's. Here, Clinton. Here, Clinton. JACOBS: If they just wanted to gamble and not the boardwalk getaway, the Davis's could find a replacement that's not six hours from home. A big reason for the closures here is that new casinos have opened up and down the East Coast. But after the casinos closed, at least some of the patrons, like Davis and her husband, are checking out new ones in Atlantic City. Mark Giannantonio is president and CEO of Resorts, Atlantic City's oldest casino. Resorts still lost money in the first quarter of this yea, but a lot less than it did last year. MARK GIANNANTONIO: We're certainly seeing the benefit of a smaller, you know, competitor base, so our revenues and our profitability continue to improve steadily. JACOBS: In other words, Atlantic City went from having 25,000 slot machines at the start of last year to 17,000 now. It went from 12 underperforming casinos to eight fuller gambling houses. And that's helped the remaining casinos grow their profits by 26 percent. It certainly looked like the first good news for Atlantic City in a long time, but Moody's Investors Service analyst Keith Foley says it doesn't mean the rest of the casinos are in the clear. KEITH FOLEY: In addition to the fact that you've got larger and more competitors within that region, you've got a couple of trends going on in regional gaming that will affect Atlantic City and probably not positively. JACOBS: Casinos need to replace their aging customers, but Foley says younger people not only have less disposable income, they're also just less interested in playing the slot machines. Joe Lupo is senior vice president at the Borgata, where profits were up 82 percent for the first quarter of this year. He says the most important thing for Atlantic City's remaining casinos is to take their new profits and reinvest them in their properties. JOE LUPO: Product's extremely important, especially when you have a similar gaming product in your backyard in Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland. You know, what's the differentiator? JACOBS: While Lupo believes the casino industry in Atlantic City is stabilized, the region is still reeling from the closures. The county has an unemployment rate that is twice the national average and leads the state in foreclosures. Back at Resorts, a lounge beside the blackjack tables shows off one of the casino's biggest hopes for growth - its website for online gambling. However, customers who log in from home will be able to pour their own gin and tonics, so even great success on the Internet won't bring back many of the lost jobs. For NPR News, I'm Emma Jacobs in Atlantic City. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  The first quarter of this year brought some unusual news for Atlantic City's casinos. Unusual because the news is positive - profits are up. This is after one casino after another closed last year. Four out of a total of 12 shut their doors. Well, it turns out the reduced competition has benefited the casinos left standing. But as Emma Jacobs reports, there are still plenty of challenges ahead. EMMA JACOBS, BYLINE: Casino customers tend to be pretty loyal to one or two houses to accrue rewards or sometimes for other reasons. PATTY DAVIS: We like to bring the dog down once in a while 'cause he likes to, you know, walk the boardwalk, go in the ocean. JACOBS: Patty Davis and her husband used to go to the Showboat casino because its hotel allowed dogs. When it closed in September, the Davis's and their Pomeranian - who they call President Clinton -didn't know where they would go next. DAVIS: And so then we found out that Harrah's would allow dogs, so now we go to Harrah's. Here, Clinton. Here, Clinton. JACOBS: If they just wanted to gamble and not the boardwalk getaway, the Davis's could find a replacement that's not six hours from home. A big reason for the closures here is that new casinos have opened up and down the East Coast. But after the casinos closed, at least some of the patrons, like Davis and her husband, are checking out new ones in Atlantic City. Mark Giannantonio is president and CEO of Resorts, Atlantic City's oldest casino. Resorts still lost money in the first quarter of this yea, but a lot less than it did last year.

This year, flooding has brought a new set of problems. From Houston Public Media, Andrew Schneider reports. ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: The drought finally broke for Texas ranchers late last year. The range and pasturelands on which cattle graze began to recover, then came the spring. In Cameron, about 140 miles northwest of Houston, the rain began falling at the start of May and didn't stop all month. JAMES BURKS: People don't give water enough credit for how much damage it can do. SCHNEIDER: James Burks is general manager of 44 Farms, a cattle ranch bounded by a tributary of the Brazos called the Little River. On Memorial Day, the Little River crested nearly 40 feet above flood stage. BURKS: There was close to a thousand head in that bottom that we had to bring up 150 at a time. SCHNEIDER: The waters demolished fences and ruined crops planted as feed for the cattle. Still, Burks and his men had been watching the river closely. They were able to get their herd to higher ground before the worst of the flood hit. Other ranchers weren't as lucky. At the Liberty Bell Ranch, roughly 50 miles northeast of Houston, about 500 head of cattle were trapped by the rising waters of the Trinity River. BOBBY RADER: It was decided by the cattle owner that we would just try to drive them out. SCHNEIDER: Liberty County Sheriff Bobby Rader helped coordinate rescue efforts. RADER: Water was over the levee. It was washing out the levy. It was really, really swift waters. Water was deep in many places, up to 20-foot deep that the cows had to swim through in one of the routes that we took. SCHNEIDER: Most of the animals did reach safety, but several lost their footing and drowned. Flooding can have another nasty side effect for cattle - standing water is a perfect breeding ground for insects. Bob McClaren is the owner of 44 Farms in Cameron. I spoke with him as we drove around his property. BOB MCCLAREN: The flies become a real issue. And then with flies comes transmission of disease, primarily pinkeye. And if one gets pinkeye, flies get in their eyes and then they land on another one, and so it's easily transmitted. SCHNEIDER: McClaren has to keep a close watch on his cows and bulls. Untreated, pinkeye can destroy an animal's sight. Flooding has taken a toll on other parts of Texas agriculture, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Cotton farmers have seen their crops ruined. The rain has been so heavy this spring, many weren't able to plant at all. But for many ranchers, the wet weather ultimately works in their favor. John Robinson is an economist with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service. JOHN ROBINSON: I expect as soon as the waters drain off, we're going to have the greatest grass and forage and hay yield of all time. SCHNEIDER: Ordinarily, Texas is home to about 15 percent of the entire U. S. supply of beef cattle. The drought forced the Texas ranchers to sell off roughly a million animals they couldn't afford to feed. That sent beef prices soaring at grocery stores all over the country in recent years. If the deluge helps pastures recover this summer, ranchers will have an easier time rebuilding their herds. Eventually, that will bring beef prices back down. Again, 44 Farms owner Bob McClaren. MCCLAREN: We can manage through the mud and the rain. It's when you don't have any moisture at all that it gets to be real dire and a bigger concern. So we're blessed to have the moisture. We're not complaining about that. SCHNEIDER: That's not to say McClaren isn't concerned. The last time he saw severe flooding was in 2007. The drought began not long after the waters went down. The Cameron rancher is hoping history isn't about to repeat itself. For NPR News, I'm Andrew Schneider in Houston. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   Cattle ranchers in Texas struggled for years with drought.

PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: It took only minutes for stores in Baltimore to be destroyed on the night of April 27, but six weeks later, the repair process is still limping along and stores not directly affected by the violence say they've also seen a sharp decline in business. PEDRO SILVA: You look outside, there's nobody. We - before, we used to be no parking space. Now it's empty. It's empty - day, night. FESSLER: Pedro Silva runs Carolina's Tex-Mex Restaurant in Fells Point, usually a busy tourist spot. Silva says since the riots, business has been cut in half. And at lunchtime last week, the place was almost empty as Silva sat with a lending officer from the nonprofit Latino Economic Development Center to get a $5,000 loan to cover some bills. SILVA: We're good to go? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We're good to go. SILVA: All right, good. You know, like I said before, we need the money today, not tomorrow - tomorrow's too late. FESSLER: And there's a similar sense of desperation across the street at Express Prints. Owner Daniel Paredes says he lost $7,000 in printing business last month, enough to stop him from hiring a new employee. Paredes has been trying to get a $35,000 no-interest loan from either the city or state with no luck so far. DANIEL PAREDES: I apply already for the city, but I don't receive any answer. I call him like two, three times already, they don't answer the phone anymore. FESSLER: And in fact, to date, not one business has received one of the loans offered by the city, state and U. S. Small Business Administration in the aftermath of the violence, although state officials say 13 loans have been approved and are almost ready to go. The city has also offered $5,000 grants to help stores with emergency repairs. But as of Friday, only three checks had been written. Bill Cole is president and CEO of the Baltimore Development Corporation, which is overseeing the business recovery effort. BILL COLE: Unfortunately, we had no access to funds that we could just simply award right away. We've had to fundraise for ours. The state program, they modified in order to be more responsive to the incidents that happened in Baltimore. But it's still a loan program. FESSLER: Which means applicants have to provide financial information and go through other hoops that Cole admits some small businesses might find daunting. He says his agency is trying to help where it can. COLE: In a lot of cases, it's simply just answering questions and helping them understand what the process is to reopen. FESSLER: And Cole says the overwhelming majority of businesses have reopened to some extent. Others are still struggling with insurance companies, which is the case for Taylor Alexander, owner of Flawless Damsels, a women's dress shop that was cleaned out by looters. TAYLOR ALEXANDER: From the equipment to the decorations to the fixtures to the inventory, even small stuff like receipt paper and toilet paper - just everything. FESSLER: Including the computer where she kept her business records. Alexander has spent the last few weeks trying to re-create those records to make a claim. Still, she's optimistic she'll get help from the city and be able to reopen this summer. Not so optimistic is Matthew Chung whose parents' variety store, J-Mart Wigs, suffered extensive damage after almost 30 years in West Baltimore. His parents were not insured. MATTHEW CHUNG: They're not going to be able to open up anytime soon if ever. And as far as what the city has done to help, I'm saddened to say that there's been pretty much no - no help whatsoever.

S. companies that wanted to sell more products overseas. Today it underwrites many billions of dollars in loans to U. S. and foreign companies. Some members of Congress see it as a prime example of corporate welfare, and they want to see it expire later this month. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Republicans are often seen as of the party of business, so it's a little ironic that some of the most vocal opposition to the Export-Import Bank comes from conservative Republicans, such as Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. JIM JORDAN: If we're ever going to get rid of all the corporate connectedness and all the corporate welfare, you got to start with the most egregious one and the most obvious one, and that's the Export-Import Bank. ZARROLI: The Ex-Im Bank, as it's called, does several things. It provides insurance to U. S. companies to make sure they get paid when they sell products overseas. Richard Beranek is president of Miner Elastomer Products Corp. in Illinois, which makes manufacturing parts. He says without the Ex-Im Bank, he wouldn't be able to export as much as he does. RICHARD BERANEK: Would it put me out of business? It would not. Would it slow my business down? I think it would. ZARROLI: The Ex-Im Bank also guarantees loans to U. S. companies that sell products overseas. John Murphy of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce says, in many cases, U. S. companies have to have the backing of a big credit agency such as the Ex-Im Bank or they can't get foreign contracts. JOHN MURPHY: For instance, foreign infrastructure projects. If you want to bid, most of the time you need to have Ex-Im support. If it's a nuclear power plant project abroad, Ex-Im support is required and without it you can't even bid. ZARROLI: But the biggest thing the Ex-Im Bank does is guarantee loans to foreign companies so they can buy U. S. -made products. For instance, foreign airlines that want to buy Boeing jets often do so with loans underwritten by the Ex-Im Bank. Murphy says a lot of countries now offer similar loan guarantees to help their businesses export more. MURPHY: So if the United States and our exporters don't have something similar, that's one knock against us. ZARROLI: But to a lot of free market conservatives, what the Ex-Im Bank does amounts to crony capitalism and they want Congress to let the bank's charter expire on June 30. Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University says the Ex-Im Bank distorts the economy. For example, she says, loan guarantees for foreign airlines may be great for Boeing, but they're bad for U. S. airlines. VERONIQUE DE RUGY: Domestic airlines can't have access to subsidies to buy airplanes, but they have to compete with foreign companies like Air Emirate, Air India. ZARROLI: And those airlines are getting a subsidy thanks to the Ex-Im Bank. De Rugy says supporters of the bank are vastly exaggerating its importance. She says there are companies that reap benefits from it, but she says most U. S. companies will do just fine without it. DE RUGY: All of the company that exports, a vast majority do it without any help from the government, and yet there are those selected few who got cheaper financing. ZARROLI: Critics acknowledge that the Ex-Im Bank has a lot of support in Washington and that it may well survive if Congress ever gets to vote on it. But if Republicans who control Congress succeed in keeping it off the floor, its charter will expire at the end of the month. That means it would be unable to guarantee any more loans and its role in the economy would diminish over time. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

FAHLE: Let's take a look behind here. Yeah. See, the radiator's gone. MARGOLIS: Windows are missing, so are kitchen cupboards and the boiler. But the floors and the moldings look salvageable. It's one of his better properties. Fahle is hoping to get $25,000 for this place, but he'll take whatever he can to get it off the rolls. FAHLE: We have to cut the grass on the properties. We can't do it every week or anything. We'll do it a couple of times a summer because, you know, we own 88,000 parcels of land in the city as a land bank. We own one-quarter of all the property in the city of Detroit. MARGOLIS: Eighty-eight thousand properties? FAHLE: Eighty-eight thousand. MARGOLIS: Is that the largest of any city in the United States? FAHLE: It might be the largest in the world. MARGOLIS: Three-quarters of those lots are vacant. Those sell for 100 bucks. Neighbors are snatching them up to double their land. The Detroit Land Bank is now auctioning off three houses a day online, eBay-style. They've closed on just over 300 in a year since the auction site got going, 21,000 more to go. Mayor Mike Duggan says that's just not fast enough. He spoke last week at City Hall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE DUGGAN: So three months ago, we kicked-off a program where city employees or their families, if they bid on a house on the land bank, could get a 50 percent discount. MARGOLIS: That puts bidders who don't work for the city at a deep disadvantage. But the city says there's so much inventory, they have to do something to build demand. Besides, only 44 employees have a won those auctions. Duggan says the main problem is that whether you work for the city or not, it's hard to get a loan on a dilapidated property. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DUGGAN: It's a typical house on the auction that you'll buy it for $10,000, you have to put 20,000 in to fix up. It's almost impossible to get a mortgage in that circumstance. MARGOLIS: But now the city has a partner. Flagstar Bank is offering mortgages to city employees, loans that will cover the purchase price and necessary improvements. Flagstar is also offering $15,000 grants paid out over five years. Carolyn Abney was lured back to Detroit from the suburbs. I asked her about the home she's leaving. . . CAROLYN ABNEY: I have one bathroom, and I have to fight over the bathroom. MARGOLIS: . . . And her new one in Detroit. ABNEY: Twenty-two hundred square feet, there are three bathrooms, there's a circular staircase. It's just cute. MARGOLIS: She bid 56,000. She could end up getting it for less than a quarter of that, and she can get a loan to fix the place up. Still, Craig Fahle with Detroit's land bank wants people to know what they're getting into. We stopped by another home about to go up for auction. FAHLE: Gutters are missing. The neighbor's so generously parking his car on the lawn. MARGOLIS: And the garage door is detached from the hinges. Still, it's an attractive colonial brick house. If nobody fixes it up though, the neighbors' property values will likely keep declining and the spiral will continue. FAHLE: It's just a matter of time before somebody says enough, and they just do what a lot of other people have done and they leave. MARGOLIS: Fahle says he's thrilled to get a thousand dollars for his worst houses. If not, it costs him $15,000 to tear them down. Jason Margolis, NPR News, Detroit. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Detroit has a lot of abandoned homes - more than 20,000. The city government is trying to do something about that by offering new financing incentives. And as we're about to hear, there are deals to be had. But repairing the houses can add tens of thousands of dollars to the cost. NPR's Jason Margolis has our story. JASON MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Craig Fahle works for the Detroit Land Bank Authority, a quasi-governmental agency.

It's tough to get a raise, health care, and education costs are rising. Now a new study from an economist at Harvard says the help is already here. It's underground in the form of oil and natural gas. NPR's Chris Arnold explains. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: There's a serious problem in the American economy right now. Big corporations are doing well, but real household income for average Americans, it's been falling over the past decade. Harvard economist Michael Porter says that's not how it's supposed to work. MICHAEL PORTER: That's not good for America. That's not good for America's standard of living. That's not good for our ultimate vitality as a nation. ARNOLD: That's why Porter's excited about the country's deep reserves of natural gas and oil that we now have access to because of hydraulic fracturing technology, or fracking. PORTER: Out of nowhere came this kind of once-in-a-generation thing. It is a game changer. We have estimated that already this is generating a substantial part of our GDP in America. It's at least as big as the state of Ohio. I mean, we've added a whole new major state - top 10 state - to our economy. We've estimated that already about 2. 7 million jobs have been created. ARNOLD: To get to that number, Porter didn't just look at oil and gas drilling jobs but all the related jobs - truck drivers, the companies that build the trucks, petrochemical engineers. And overall, he says, these are better-paying jobs. Also, Porter says cheaper natural gas is helping businesses and people all around the country save money. PORTER: The average household is saving about $800 a year, sort of a bonus. We think that savings will actually go up a bit. ARNOLD: But what about the environment? On this score, Porter says energy companies made a mistake. He says they should have been working all along with environmentalists to reduce the environmental impacts. And, he says, since natural gas is cleaner than coal, it can be used as a bridge to the alternative energy future. RAHUL YARALA: So we're going to go 30 feet up. ARNOLD: Rahul Yarala is taking me up in a bucket lift at the Wind Technology Testing Center in Boston. There's a giant wind turbine propeller blade here suspended in midair. It's the same kind of blade you see spinning on hillsides to generate electricity. YARALA: It's 200 feet long. It's about 20,000 pounds in weight. ARNOLD: And what they do here is to test new designs that are cheaper, lighter and better. They're flapping and bending this one like a bird's wing. YARALA: So what we're testing is the minimal amount of structural elements to make sure it's also reliable and it won't break. ARNOLD: And that's a super important thing when it comes to having wind energy succeed. You have to bring the cost down. YARALA: So that's exactly the point. These are, per pound, way less expensive than an aircraft wing, even though they're much more complicated. ARNOLD: The center was built with government stimulus money, but it's now funded by the private sector. Michael Porter likes that it's spurring innovation. And he thinks with the right set of policies, cheap natural gas from fracking and alternative energy can work well together. PORTER: Many people believe that somehow, if we take advantage of these oil and gas resources, that will stop renewables in their tracks. And that turns out to be just wrong. ARNOLD: But not everyone is so excited about America's energy renaissance. PAUL ASHWORTH: I'm pretty much skeptical. I mean, I think he overstates it for a couple of reasons. ARNOLD: That's Paul Ashworth, the chief U. S. economist at Capital Economics. He doesn't think the country's going to keep gaining lots of jobs because of fracking. In fact, he says, we've recently lost tens of thousands of jobs after oil got so cheap that many companies stopped drilling. ASHWORTH: So the shale oil boom is actually already over. ARNOLD: But Michael Porter says skeptics just don't really appreciate yet how important cheap energy will be for the U. S. economy. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

It's a city that used to be rich with a big insurance industry, but now it has a poverty problem. Hartford hopes Minor League Baseball and a brand-new stadium will help undo years of neglect. It's hardly the first city to invest in professional sports. And as always, the question is will it work? Jeff Cohen of member station WNPR reports. JEFF COHEN: Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra is standing at a construction site next to one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. All around him is a sea of parking lots that's been here as long as he can remember. But give it time, he says. An excavator is digging out home plate, and the hope is that the grass they'll put down in the fall will be green by April's opening day. PEDRO SEGARRA: When all this is all built, you're really not going to know where you are, but you'll be in Hartford, and proudly so. COHEN: Hartford is spending $56 million on a ballpark for a team called the Hartford Yard Goats, a name that doesn't have much to do with Hartford and has everything to do with marketing a team to kids who want to come to the games and buy a hat with a goat on it. Meanwhile, the city has also spearheaded a $300 million, privately-financed housing, retail and supermarket project to surround the ballpark. Mayor Segarra says that's what happens when you leverage public money. SEGARRA: Once we had the stadium announcement, the development piece came together, and we had a lot more interest from developers to want to invest in this area. COHEN: But wherever wealthy sports franchise owners get cash-strapped cities to build them a new gem, there's always the question of whether all of the investment will pay off for the people paying the bills. In Hartford, that question's acute. On the one hand, this is the state capital, with statewide importance. The team is moving from New Britain, a city just a few miles away. Its leaders say Hartford poached their team. But club owner Josh Solomon says a city stadium will draw more fans than a suburban one. JOSH SOLOMON: The ability for folks to come from work, directly walk over, grab a beer or something on the way over, come into the ballpark, enjoy it while just walking here - it'll be a part of the fabric of downtown Hartford. COHEN: But Shawn Wooden is also counting on a local impact. He's Hartford's city council president. This is where he grew up. He says people in this neighborhood need a boost. SHAWN WOODEN: Just walk down North Main Street - 2, 3 o'clock on any weekday afternoon - and see the number of adults, when everybody should be working, with no economic activity being generated. COHEN: So he looks around and sees construction jobs, stadium jobs and investment that will bring jobs. But Andrew Zimbalist isn't so sure. ANDREW ZIMBALIST: The promoters always talk about it as the best thing since sliced bread for the local economy, and that's not true. COHEN: Zimbalist is a professor of economics at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. He says the research shows that public stadiums by themselves typically don't generate much economic growth, if any. One recent study from researchers at Lake Forest College in Illinois and Holy Cross in Massachusetts concludes this way - sports may make a city happy, but they're unlikely to make a city rich. And Zimbalist says that's how this should be sold. ZIMBALIST: Here's an activity, a wholesome, summertime activity that the community can enjoy, that can create a greater sense of community. This can be a plus. And I think that that's the most honest way to sell one of these ventures. COHEN: And even if the numbers don't pan out, boosters are saying it's the kind of plus that Hartford needs. For NPR News, I'm Jeff Cohen.

As NPR's Jason Margolis reports, it could be a rare chance to pick up a bargain on a national historic landmark. JASON MARGOLIS, BYLINE: The story of the Fisher Building begins in the late 19th century. The seven Fisher brothers built carriages for horses then bodies for cars. General Motors bought out the Fishers in 1919 for an unheard of $200 million. That'd be about $2. 7 billion today. The Fishers used some of that money for civic causes and some to build a palace to honor their legacy. Ryan Hooper, with the group Pure Detroit, gives tours of that palace designed by Detroit's most prolific architect, Albert Kahn. RYAN HOOPER: So the Fisher brothers reach out to him. They say, we're going to give you a blank check. In return, we want the most beautiful building in the world. MARGOLIS: The New York League of Architects said the goal was achieved. They declared it the most beautiful building of 1928, largely because of the three-story arcade. HOOPER: So we're talking about these art deco chandeliers hanging above us, this beautiful frescoed ceiling above us. On the exterior of the building, it's marble clad, making it the largest marble clad commercial building in the world. Inside, you have over 52 different types of marble. MARGOLIS: And 430 tons of bronze to really set things over the top. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEVATOR BELL RINGING)MARGOLIS: Some of that bronze is on display in the lobby elevators. HOOPER: I mean, it's a cast bronze door, marble frame. It's kind of mind blowing when you think about it. MARGOLIS: These were once the fastest elevators in the world. There's also a 2,000-seat theater inside the building. And all of this can be yours for the low, low price of. . . A. J. WEINER: Let's do this real quick. Six-hundred thousand feet. MARGOLIS: That's A. J. Weiner making a back-of-the-envelope calculation. He's managing director for the real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle's Detroit office. WEINER: OK. In my opinion, I think the property has the potential to trade in the $20 million to $30 million range. MARGOLIS: And bear in mind the Fisher brothers originally put 140 million - in today's dollars - into the property. Weiner says in Chicago or New York, a building like this could sell for perhaps $500 million today. Next week's auction also includes the neighboring 10-story art deco Albert Kahn Building and two parking garages, by the way. WEINER: I think it's throwing good money after great. MARGOLIS: That's contingent on a few things though. This neighborhood was once among the wealthiest commercial areas on Earth. General Motors has its world headquarters here. Detroit boosters say it's the next commercial part of Detroit that's ready to take off. Jim Bieri, with Stokas Bieri Real Estate in Detroit, says if that happens, the Fisher Building's price tag could be really low. JIM BIERI: Well, it's shocking because it is a magnificent architectural gem. MARGOLIS: He says beautiful historic buildings like the Fisher can attract more tenants and fetch higher rents. But he adds, people don't work in the marbled lobby. BIERI: I haven't ridden the elevators much lately, but I'm told they don't operate like they used to. I just know that when they get into a building like that, if you haven't been taking care of it, there's just issue after issue - from electric to HVAC. . . MARGOLIS: . . .

She was just like, who the hell would put drop ceiling in here? MARGOLIS: It could cost a new owner $60 million to fix up the Fisher Building - perhaps double the purchase price - and it will require an active faith that this neighborhood can indeed come back and new businesses will want to move in.

The federal government wants to prevent explosive oil train derailments. Neither the industry nor safety advocates like how this is going. Here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Since Valentine's Day, five trains carrying North Dakota Bakken crude oil have derailed and exploded into flames in the U. S. and Canada. No one was hurt in the incidents in Mount Carbon, W. Va. , and Northern Ontario in February, in Galena, Ill. , and Northern Ontario in March and in Heimdal, N. D. , last month. But each of those fiery train wrecks occurred in lightly populated areas. Scores of oil trains also travel through dense cities, particularly here, Chicago, the nation's railroad hub. (SOUNDBITE OF RAILCARS)SCHAPER: At least 40 trains carrying Bakken crude roll through the city each week on the BNSF railway's tracks alone, passing right by apartment buildings, homes, businesses and even schools. CHRISTINA MARTINEZ: Well, just imagine the carnage. SCHAPER: Christina Martinez is standing alongside the BNSF tracks in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood where a long train of black tank cars is slowly rolling by St. Procopius, the school her 6-year-old attends. MARTINEZ: Yeah, just the other the day, they were playing soccer at my son's school on Saturday. And I saw the train go by, and it had the 1267, you know, the red marking. SCHAPER: The railroad tag cars carrying hazardous materials have diamond-shaped red placards indicating their contents - 1267 signifies crude oil. MARTINEZ: And I was like, oh, my God, can you imagine if it would derail and explode right here while these kids are playing soccer and all the people around there? SCHAPER: New federal rules require stronger tank cars for crude oil and other flammable liquids, phasing out older models that more easily rupture. But Martinez and others wanted rules limiting the volatility of what's going into those tank cars, too. Oil from North Dakota has a combustible mix of natural gases, including butane, methane and propane. North Dakota requires the conditioning of the gas and oil at the wellhead so the vapor pressure is below 13. 7 pounds per square inch before it's shipped. But even at that level, oil from derailed tank cars has exploded into flames. Lora Chamberlain of the group Chicagoland Oil by Rail wanted federal regulators to require even lower pressure. LORA CHAMBERLAIN: We don't want these bomb trains going through our neighborhood. De-gasify this stuff and so we're really, really upset at the feds - the Department of Transportation - for not addressing this in these new rules. SCHAPER: Others criticize the rules for giving shippers three to five years to either strengthen or replace the weakest tank cars. Paul Berland lives near the busy railroad tracks in suburban Elgin. PAUL BERLAND: The rules won't take effect for many years. They're still playing Russian roulette with our communities. SCHAPER: A coalition of environmental groups sued, alleging that loopholes could allow some dangerous tank cars to remain on the tracks for up to a decade. At the same time, an oil industry group is challenging the new regulations in court, too, arguing that manufacturers won't be able to build and retrofit tank cars fast enough to meet the new requirements. And even the railroad industry is taking legal action against the new rules. ED HAMBERGER: The one that we have real problems with is requiring something called ECP brakes - they're electronically controlled pneumatic brakes. SCHAPER: Ed Hamberger heads the Association of American Railroads and says the new braking system the government is mandating is unproven. HAMBERGER: They do not claim that ECP brakes would prevent one accident. Their entire safety case is based on the fact that ECP brakes are applied a little bit more quickly than the current system. SARAH FEINBERG: It's not unproven at all. SCHAPER: Acting Federal Railroad administrator Sarah Feinberg. FEINBERG: I do understand that the railroad industry views it as costly. I don't think it's particularly costly, especially when you compare it to the cost of a really significant incident with the train carrying this product. SCHAPER: Feinberg says her agency is still studying whether to regulate the volatility of crude. But some in Congress don't think this safety matter can wait. They're sponsoring legislation to force producers to condition the oil further to make it less explosive before shipping it on the nation's rails. David Schaper, NPR News, Chicago.

Now, a plan to expand underground storage in the Finger Lakes region has run into stiff opposition. David Chanatry has our report. DAVID CHANATRY, BYLINE: New York's Seneca Lake is the heart of the Finger Lakes, a beautiful countryside of steep, glacier-carved hills and long, fjord-like slivers of water and deep beds of salt. It's been mined on Seneca's shore for more than a century. The Texas company Crestwood Midstream owns the mine now and stores natural gas in the emptied-out caverns. Crestwood has federal approval to increase the amount, and it's seeking New York's OK to store 88 million gallons of propane as well. That's definitely not OK for a growing movement opposed to the plan. (SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION)UNIDENTIFIED DEMONSTRATORS: (Singing) We shall not, we shall not be moved. Just like a tree. . . CHANATRY: Since October, nearly 300 people have been arrested for blocking entrances to the storage site. Regi Teasley recently joined the action. REGI TEASLEY: These fossil fuels will not leave us with a viable future, and certainly our lake is in immediate jeopardy. CHANATRY: Crestwood executive Bill Gautreaux says the project will relieve the propane shortages that in recent years have hit the Northeast hard. BILL GAUTREAUX: And every time that happens, it just, you know, dramatically drives the price up for consumers, so the demand for this facility is really, really high. CHANATRY: Crestwood says those price spikes cost New Yorkers $100 million in 2013. (SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION)UNIDENTIFIED DEMONSTRATORS: (Chanting) No LPG. No LPG. No LPG. CHANATRY: Opponents cite problems or accidents at other facilities. They fear gas could escape or the lake be ruined by leaking brine. A tanker truck or train might explode. They question whether the caverns could collapse. But even short of catastrophe, the project will industrialize the area, says Joseph Campbell. JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Because this isn't just a hole in the ground they're going to pump - pump gas into. You know, there's a whole lot that goes with it. CHANATRY: Things like a six-track rail siding, two large brine ponds and a 60-foot flare stack. Campbell and others say these will hurt a growing tourism-based economy. Nearly 130 wineries now dot the region, and Wine Enthusiast magazine recently named the Finger Lakes one of the world's top 10 travel destinations. WILL OUWELEEN: this one is a chardonnay grape. CHANATRY: Will Ouweleen is getting ready to expand his Eagle Crest Vineyard. He says the Finger Lakes' climate and soil allow fine European grapes to thrive. Ouweleen has joined with other wineries urging New York to reject the plan. OUWELEEN: Why mess with an economic engine that continues to grow at double-digit rates, creating local, sustainable jobs and giving everyone in the region something to be proud of? Why sacrifice all of that and even take the risk? CHANATRY: Natural gas and propane are already stored in the area. Still, more than 300 business owners have signed a petition opposing the project, but not Jim Franzese. He owns a bed and breakfast and a small motel right next to the site. JIM FRANZESE: They've been storing gas right up the street from me for years and years and years, since I was a kid. And we've never had any troubles, so I just don't think it's a major deal. CHANATRY: Crestwood admits it underestimated the reaction to the project, but Bill Gautreaux says many opponents are misinformed. GAUTREAUX: It's simple, you know, from a technical standpoint and, you know, very low risk on the spectrum of any risk. I mean, it'd be more dangerous to get in your car and drive to work. CHANATRY: Crestwood says the project will create 10 to 12 jobs and several hundred-thousand dollars in annual tax payments. It believes the fossil fuel industry can coexist with wineries and tourism.

Jacob Kirkegaard is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. JASON KIRKEGAARD: This is a real deadline unlike the other ones because we really now are at the end of the road. ZARROLI: Greece desperately needs Europe's help to roll over some big debt payments coming due, but the Athens government has strenuously rejected Europe's demands for further tax increases and pension cuts. Over the weekend, Athens made a last-ditch effort to resolve the dispute with what it called a mutually beneficial proposal to European officials. It provided no details. But relations between Greece's leftist government and its creditors are chilly at best right now, and neither side seems inclined or able to budge much. Meanwhile, time is quickly running out to find a solution. Economist Eswar Prasad of Cornell University. ESWAR PRASAD: There is now a dire risk of markets bringing forward the day of reckoning for Greece, you know, leaving little room for pushing off the endgame any further. ZARROLI: The concern in the markets is the recent surge of withdrawals from Greek banks. Many Greek citizens are worried that without the European central banks backing, Greek banks will no longer be liquid enough to keep operating, and the government might have to impose capital controls to prevent a run. The Peterson Institute's Jacob Kirkegaard says that if no agreement is reached at today's summit in Brussels, Greece may even have to shut down its banks altogether. KIRKEGAARD: It is quite likely that the Greek banks will not open up Tuesday morning or at least open up with some variation of restrictions on access to the bank deposits. ZARROLI: He says people and businesses would no longer be able to access their funds, and that would lead to a sharp deterioration in Greece's already weakened economy.

Many Greek citizens are worried that without the European central banks backing, Greek banks will no longer be liquid enough to keep operating, and the government might have to impose capital controls to prevent a run. The Peterson Institute's Jacob Kirkegaard says that if no agreement is reached at today's summit in Brussels, Greece may even have to shut down its banks altogether. KIRKEGAARD: It is quite likely that the Greek banks will not open up Tuesday morning or at least open up with some variation of restrictions on access to the bank deposits. ZARROLI: He says people and businesses would no longer be able to access their funds, and that would lead to a sharp deterioration in Greece's already weakened economy. Today's emergency summit in Brussels is an attempt to prevent that kind of disaster and pull Greece back from the brink yet again.

But as the fracking boom unlocks huge quantities of natural gas, the nation's electric grid is changing. Power plants are increasingly turning to natural gas, a low-cost, cleaner-burning fossil fuel. That shift is driven by economics and also regulations. Marie Cusick of member station WITF reports. MARIE CUSICK, BYLINE: Decked out in a hard hat and safety goggles, Bill Pentak stands in the middle of a construction site. He's looking up at his company's latest project towering overhead, a new natural gas power plant. BILL PENTAK: This plant was sited precisely where it is because of its access to the abundant, high-quality natural gas that's found a mile to two miles beneath our feet. CUSICK: He's referring to the Marcellus Shale underfoot. In recent years, this part of north-central Pennsylvania has become one of the most productive gas fields in the world. Pentak works for Panda Power Funds, a Dallas, Texas-based company that has two more gas plants planned for Pennsylvania. The projects are part of a bigger story. The electric grid is shifting away from coal toward gas. PENTAK: What's taking place here is taking place across the United States. CUSICK: It's a trend Gary Helm is watching. He studies emerging markets for the PJM Interconnection. That's the regional grid organization for the mid-Atlantic U. S. and Midwest. It's sort of like an air traffic controller for the power system, helping keep the lights on for 61 million people. GARY HELM: We see, down the road, definitely a lot of gas coming online. CUSICK: That's because the fracking boom freed up a lot more cheap gas. Up until the mid-2000s, about half the electricity in the U. S. was produced by burning coal, 20 percent or less came from gas. Tyler Hodge is an analyst with the U. S. Energy Information Administration. He says these days, coal has dropped to about 40 percent of the nation's power while gas now accounts for nearly a third. TYLER HODGE: Definitely the mid-Atlantic and Pennsylvania regions especially are showing some significant shifts towards natural gas. CUSICK: Coal plants are also retiring as the Obama administration pushes its climate change action plan, which would require the country to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2030. Back at the construction site, Bill Pentak stands next to the plant's generator and points out that gas has an advantage in all this. As more renewables come online, gas plants can ramp up and down quickly. So when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, he says gas can fill in the gaps. PENTAK: You have to have something that can be quickly dispatched to make up for that lost power, or it threatens the reliability of the grid. CUSICK: That's not to say using more gas doesn't pose some problems. Although gas produces about half the carbon emissions that coal does when you burn it, there's still uncertainty within the scientific community about its overall climate impact. Christina Simeone is with the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. She says drilling and transporting gas leads to the leakage of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. CHRISTINA SIMEONE: When you look at gas production, you look at coal production, you know, these are imperfect resources that do have impacts just like all of these resources are imperfect and they all have impacts. CUSICK: The U. S. Energy Information Administration is projecting that gas power generation will become increasingly common under the Obama administration's climate plan. The agency expects the regulations would cause more coal plants to shut down, and gas will begin to take its place, followed by more renewable energy. For NPR News, I'm Marie Cusick.

CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: At Pride events in New York City this weekend, the emotional excitement about marriage equality was evident. But many people were also thrilled about the practical considerations. COLLEEN MAHONEY: You know, like, we can travel to all 50 states (laughter). We can do anything we want, anywhere. (Laughter). LANE: Colleen Mahoney and her wife, Michelle Conklin, are New York residents who joined in the celebrations that marked the Supreme Court's ruling. They now have a marriage that is recognized in all 50 states, and they say that will make it easier to take job transfers or retire anywhere. They also feel more comfortable about traveling throughout the country knowing they will be treated as a married couple in any medical emergency. MICHELLE CONKLIN: We wouldn't be able to possibly even visit one another or be recognized. . . MAHONEY: To make decisions. . . CONKLIN: . . . To make the decisions that need to be made for one another. And so that has been on our mind for a long time, actually, since we were married. LANE: Taxes are another big change. Janis Cowhey is an accountant for Marcum LLP, a firm that specializes in advising wealthy LGBT clients. She says same-sex couples living in the 13 states that didn't recognize their marriage would have to file as many as six different returns that included dummy returns just to get the numbers for the real returns. JANIS COWHEY: And for those people who have income from those 13 states, it's a huge change. It means you just file a married tax return at the federal level and then you file your state returns. It's not this bifurcated system where you're filing - you've got one filing status for federal purposes and a totally different one for state purposes. LANE: Cowhey says now gay couples no longer have to wonder about who's their next of kin or in which state to file for Social Security benefits. Things also got easier for human resource departments. No longer do companies have to juggle the different and frequently-changing marriage laws around the country, but there's one new complication - what to do with domestic partnership benefits. About three-quarters of U. S. companies created benefit packages for unmarried committed couples, whether gay or straight. But now that all employees have the right to marry, will those benefits disappear? J. D. Piro is a vice president at Aon Hewitt, an HR consulting company. He says running those domestic-partnership programs isn't cheap. J. D. PIRO: It requires a separate administration, separate reporting system. And employers, you know, they can decide, you know, hey, that's still worth doing because the benefit is valued by our employees. But some employers might reach the opposite conclusion. LANE: Friday's Supreme Court decision also gave companies another dilemma - what to say about what's still a polarizing subject.

The first ripple - credit-rating agencies have already moved to downgrade Greece. Greece still plans to hold a referendum this weekend to give people a chance to decide if they want to accept their creditor's bailout terms. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, missing today's payment leaves Greece in a more tenuous position and might eventually force it out of the eurozone altogether. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Until this week, Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics thought Greece and its European creditors might still find a way to resolve their differences. Now he thinks the odds of Greece staying in the eurozone are a lot slimmer than they once were. GABRIEL STERNE: It's really, you know, a pretty desperate situation. Even if they get a yes vote from the referendum, then - you know, the analogy is Greece walking through a minefield now, and at any point, you can go to exit. ZARROLI: Sterne says the capital controls and bank shutdowns imposed by Greece this week greatly complicate its economic picture. He says once you bar people from getting access to their own money, it's much harder to restore credibility in the financial system. He notes that it took two years for Cyprus to lift the capital controls it imposed in 2013, so the challenges faces Greece have suddenly become that much bigger. Diego Ferro is co-chief investment officer at Greylock Capital Management which owns Greek bonds. DIEGO FERRO: Putting the economy through a week of capital controls and bank closures to get a better deal is insane because at the end of the process, even if you get a good deal, the economy's going to be worse off. ZARROLI: Ferro is more optimistic about Greece's plight. He says the two sides still have plenty of incentive to work out a deal. He says if Greece is forced out of the eurozone, it will raise questions about the viability of the currency union, and other countries could also flee. And he says the bank closures this week are bound to put political pressure on Greece's left-wing government to come up with some kind of deal. FERRO: What you see in these situations is that day after day, there are more stories of people not being able to pay for weddings or travel to see a sick relative, you know, just because you have your money trapped in the system. So these measures are very unpopular. ZARROLI: But there's not a lot of time to lose, Anna Gelpern of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ANNA GELPERN: At a time when there's no error margin, everybody's on tenterhooks, and there's an enormous amount of volatility. Something might happen that would set off a panic, and then, 24 hours later, you find yourself in an unexpected place. ZARROLI: Gelpern points to what happened in 2008 when the financial crisis spun out of control, and suddenly, big institutions like Lehman Brothers and AIG came under tremendous pressure. In this kind of environment, there can be wildcards, and, she says, that can quickly change the political dynamic in Greece and elsewhere. GELPERN: Ultimately, which way the crisis will break and at what point the political will to stay in the union will collapse is very hard to say. ZARROLI: Right now, both sides say they want Greece to stay in the eurozone, but now that Greece has missed its payment to the IMF, the crisis will very much enter uncharted waters.

Here is NPR's Peter Overby. PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: The job of the Export-Import Bank is to promote U. S. exports by financing deals with foreign buyers. But tea party groups and other conservatives have been targeting the bank for several years now. So this spring has been a costly, hard-fought battle, a showdown of top power players, from Capitol Hill lobbyists to campaign strategists. Backing the bank - some of Washington's most powerful corporate players; and in the other corner - conservative political groups better known for their campaign muscle in elections.

NAM senior vice president Ned Monroe says what counts here is old-fashioned, shoe leather lobbying on Capitol Hill.

ROTH: There are too many members within the Republican Party who either have a liberal ideology or they're beholden to special interests. And that needs to be fixed. OVERBY: Club for Growth is better known for its campaign work, enlisting hard-line conservatives to take out more moderate incumbents in Republican primaries.

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama support the crony capitalist Ex-Im Bank. OVERBY: Also opposing the bank are billionaires David and Charles Koch. Their company, Koch Industries, is lobbying against it. Their top lobbyists wrote lawmakers saying they oppose all subsidies, including, quote, \"programs that benefit us. \" And last week, the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity held a live-streamed forum that shot across social media, criticizing the Ex-Im Bank. The sole speaker was Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. He said Ex-Im is very good to his home state - Florida. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: I think we are the second-largest beneficiary of Ex-Im Bank loans in the country. OVERBY: But he continued.

Their top lobbyists wrote lawmakers saying they oppose all subsidies, including, quote, \"programs that benefit us. \" And last week, the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity held a live-streamed forum that shot across social media, criticizing the Ex-Im Bank. The sole speaker was Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. He said Ex-Im is very good to his home state - Florida. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARCO RUBIO: I think we are the second-largest beneficiary of Ex-Im Bank loans in the country. OVERBY: But he continued. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RUBIO: What you really have here is a government-funded program that allows not just money to flow to those who are politically connected, but in fact money to flow overseas. OVERBY: The conservatives may have won this round, but the fight's far from over. Some congressional leaders believe that when Congress comes back to Washington, the votes will be there to renew the bank. But even if that's true, the bank's opponents will carry the fight to the campaign trail. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.", "section": "Economy", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

Greece has also failed to make a payment on a separate IMF loan - the first European country to do that. The Greek prime minister is asking Europe for a new aid program and an extension of the current one. So let's go to Athens to talk to reporter Joanna Kakissis about all of this. Hello, Joanna. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Hello, Robert. SIEGEL: And first, how much aid is the prime minister asking for now? KAKISSIS: Well, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras wants about 29 billion euros - that's about $32 billion - and that's in emergency loans to help cover the country's debts over the next two years. He's also asked for the country's existing debts to be restructured. He's been arguing for a long time that Greece just cannot pay back its enormous debts as the economy is contracting. He says it needs some kind of debt relief in order to do so, so this was a surprise decision considering how poisonous his tone has become towards European leaders since Friday. And that's when he broke off negotiations with eurozone and IMF lenders. And it appeared to blindside European leaders by calling referendum on what is essentially a draft credit deal. SIEGEL: Yeah, and that referendum is coming up on Sunday. Is that a sign of desperation? KAKISSIS: Some analysts certainly think so. They think Prime Minister Tsipras has painted himself into a corner with this referendum. He's isolated himself from other eurozone leaders. And because the negotiations have broken down, the Greek central bank was forced to close banks and limit withdrawals, and that's caused a lot of anxiousness. SIEGEL: Well, is his proposal for the restructuring of the debt and the emergency aid, is that likely to go anywhere? KAKISSIS: You know, no. It really can't, at least for now. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, he's head of the eurozone finance ministers, he called an emergency teleconference to discuss the request. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel, she's really the dealmaker here. She said that any new bailout package cannot be considered before the Greek referendum is held on July 5. That's this coming Sunday. Chancellor Merkel and other eurozone leaders are hoping Greeks will vote yes on the referendum. To them that means that Greeks want to stay in the eurozone. SIEGEL: And what happens if most people vote no? KAKISSIS: Well, I fear that that means a Greek eurozone exit is all but certain. A no on the referendum is going to mean a no to the eurozone. That's what European leaders are going to hear. A yes vote would be problematic for the government because they have already rejected the reforms pushed by the eurozone in exchange for loans. Prime Minister Tsipras has even hinted he will resign if the yes votes win. SIEGEL: And how - Joanna, how would you describe the mood in Athens today? KAKISSIS: You know, there was this big pro-euro rally tonight and it got rained on. Even the weather doesn't seem to be agreeing with the pro-eurozone crowd here. And despite, you know, the banks being closed indefinitely, people seem remarkably calm. It's only once you start talking to them that you will see how really nervous they are. Shop owners are hoarding cash. People's credit cards, if they are tied to Greek banks, there are reports that some of those cards aren't working. You know, there are a few Greeks who talk really fondly about the country's previous currency, that's the drachma. They call it the drachmoula, like it's their loved one. It reminds them of a time when they had some control over their fate. But you know, many Greeks also equate the drachma with poverty and with isolation, and that's where they fear they're headed right now. SIEGEL: OK. That's Joanna Kakissis in Athens. Thanks Joanna.

He says the U. S. territory is unable to pay its debt. Puerto Rico owes more than $72 billion, and with deadlines looming, the governor asked Wall Street lenders to give the island more time. NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: For Puerto Rico, this is an important week. Lawmakers in the Commonwealth's House and Senate have to pass a budget due on Wednesday. On that same day, Puerto Rico has to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in debt payments. The problem is the island is desperately short of cash. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALEJANDRO GARCIA PADILLA: (Speaking Spanish). ALLEN: Last night, Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla warned island residents that more belt-tightening will be needed. The situation is extremely difficult, he said. They're problems that likely come as no surprise to most Puerto Ricans. For more than two decades, the island's economy has been caught in a downward spiral. A lack of economic growth has led a succession of administrations to pile up huge deficits. The result is a government with massive debt, four times what Detroit owed when it declared bankruptcy. Legally, bankruptcy isn't an option for Puerto Rico. But last night, Gov. Garcia said that doesn't mean the island should have to pay what it owes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PADILLA: (Speaking Spanish). ALLEN: Given the state of its economy, Puerto Rico's public debt, Garcia said, is unpayable. Garcia cited a report by a former chief economist of the World Bank that recommends lenders consider easier terms for the island. Garcia said he will go further and seek a multiyear moratorium on debt payments to allow the island time to rebuild its economy. Daniel Hanson, an analyst with Height Securities, is skeptical Garcia can pull it off. DANIEL HANSON: I think it's very difficult. There seems to be some strong legal protection that stands in the way of the governor's plans. ALLEN: Hanson says there is one key fact - Puerto Rico may just not have enough cash to make its debt payments. HANSON: Regardless of what the courts say, if the Commonwealth simply doesn't have any cash, it's going to be very difficult for them to pay bondholders. ALLEN: In his address last night, Garcia warned that all Puerto Ricans would share in the pain. But he saved his most impassioned words for the U. S. Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PADILLA: (Speaking Spanish). ALLEN: Garcia called on Congress to help Puerto Rico by making some legal changes, including amending the bankruptcy code to allow the island the same protections as the states. That's something that so far Congress has been reluctant to do. Some fiscal conservatives believe changing the U. S. bankruptcy code to benefit Puerto Rico after it's racked up $72 billion of debt amounts to a bailout. And as a White House spokesman said yesterday, there's no one in the administration or in D. C. that's contemplating a federal bailout of Puerto Rico. Greg Allen, NPR News. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:   The governor of Puerto Rico delivered some hard truths yesterday. He says the U.

Germany has the most powerful economy in Europe. It's home to the European Central Bank - the ECB - and it's the key political dealmaker. German public opinion has been stacked against Greece from the beginning of this crisis, and many Germans feel that the Greeks deserve the consequences of their actions. To hear more about the German view, I'm joined now by Roman Pletter. He is deputy head of the business and economics section of the newspaper Die Zeit, and he joins us from Hamburg. Welcome to the program. ROMAN PLETTER: Welcome. Hello. SIEGEL: As we hear news about the very real fears and crises on the streets of Greece, how would you describe the mood in Germany? PLETTER: Well, actually, it's a mixture of frustration and indifference. I think frustration with the Greek government because many Germans feel like the Greece government were just playing them for several weeks when there was just enough time to get a deal done. But the other side is that in Germany itself, economically speaking, actually, it's like living on an island at the moment. So unemployment is low. Growth is doing well. And I think we do not feel all the economic problems some other countries in the euro zone might face at the moment. SIEGEL: When you say you feel like you're living on an island, you feel like you're living on a very pleasant island is what you are saying. PLETTER: That's right. And so I think there is no huge outrage about Greece. That's not the case. Another side is that, of course, there are some politicians who think we have to rescue them because they fear that if the euro collapses, the whole euro zone and even Europe is an idea might be destroyed afterwards. SIEGEL: Well, does maintaining the euro zone and maintaining the euro as a currency - does that trump whatever sense of fairness Germans might have, thinking that it's only fair that Greece honor its obligations? PLETTER: Well, I think that's at the heart of the economic thinking of, for example, Chancellor Angela Merkel. She once said she wants to run the economy like a Swabian housewife, which refers to doing economic policy in a way like running your household. That means don't spend more money than you have, and that's what her conservative constituency expects from her. And given the fact that Germany had Social Security reforms 10 years ago, when former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder - he had to resign afterwards because people did not support these reforms. Now we are benefiting from these reforms. And many Germans think we had this hard time, and we expect the Greece people doing this themselves. SIEGEL: But what - how did Germans react to the argument that, yes, Germany said, we should run this like a sound German household. On the other hand, by including Greece in the euro zone, you more or less said to an improvident member of the family go run up a bill. You can now borrow money is if you were a German, at very low rates. PLETTER: I see your point, and I think that's an argument often made by other countries criticizing Germany. The answer you would get from many German politicians is that when Greece joined the euro, they actually betrayed the other countries in the euro zone with delivering wrong numbers about their growth rates, about their economic situation. And they basically lied their way into the euro zone. And that's something many people are still kind of struggling with. And that makes it so hard for many Germans to say, well, actually, we'll bail out Greece anyway, but that's a problem. In my personal opinion, that's a problem because it's very backwards-looking. It doesn't help us in the future. Now we have to deal with the situation. They're in the euro zone, and we have to deal with it. SIEGEL: Roman Pletter of the newspaper Die Zeit in Hamburg.

They're Greek voters who will participate next Sunday in an historic referendum to decide that country's future in the European economy. Greece has now essentially defaulted on its huge debt to the International Monetary Fund. In a new letter to its creditors, the Greek government says it will accept some of their austerity demands with conditions. NPR's Chris Arnold spoke to voters in Athens. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: At the end of World War II, Winston Churchill proclaimed, we must build a United States of Europe. And for 70 years, Europe's been engaged in a political and economic quest to make that happen. But many in Greece feel this historic reshaping of the Western world now has a stranglehold on their country. JORDAN REPANIDIS: If it is for me to get drowned, let me drown by myself. Don't choke me. ARNOLD: Jordan Repanidis is a cab driver in Athens. He says he's planning to vote no in the referendum. After the financial crisis, other European nations loaned Greece hundreds of billions of dollars. And in return, Greece agreed to tax hikes, steep budget cuts, many retirees' pensions have been cut by 45 percent, and it's had to keep paying back the bailout money. Repanidis says this squeezed Greece too hard and its economy can't recover. REPANIDIS: I don't want them to kill me. I don't want that European community to kill me. I will do it by myself, and I will be pleased. ARNOLD: But a nationwide economic suicide doesn't sound like the best idea to others here in Greece. George Deorgiadis is of the manager of the Balux Cafe in Athens. It's a restaurant and beach club popular with locals, but it's pretty empty today. GEORGE DEORGIADIS: People are very scared and they stay home. ARNOLD: In recent days, there have been runs on banks, causing the government to all but shut down the banking system. Deorgiadis says it looks to him like Europe is offering another bad deal, but he's worried that falling out of the eurozone would cause even worse upheaval. So he thinks he will vote yes in the upcoming referendum to take that deal to try to keep Greece in the eurozone. DEORGIADIS: You have to protect the business, so I think you have to say yes. If this closed, it's 140 families. ARNOLD: Deorgiadis says he's already telling many of his 140 workers to stay home. He's trying to give work to people with children to support. Yesterday, thousands of people rallied in Athens in favor of a yes vote. The day before, thousands rallied in favor of no. Deorgiadis himself seems deeply sad and unsure about what to do. DEORGIADIS: I really don't know. I really don't know. I'm very confused about this. Forty-two years old, I am. I studied economics. It's the first time in my life that I can't decide what's good and what's wrong for my country. ARNOLD: Of course, there's an argument that Greece has itself to blame. Many economists agree that Greece, for decades, squandered opportunities to stem corruption and pass needed economic reforms. Still, multiple Nobel Laureate economists have just written opinion pieces saying they would vote no in the upcoming referendum - dropping out of the eurozone would be tumultuous, could cause runaway inflation, but they say it would free the country from the manacles that it's in now, and they say Greece might someday find its economic footing and be better off.

But some business groups see negative, unintended consequences. NPR's Yuki Noguchi spoke with some workers about how they say the change could affect them. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: Barrett Zenger has managed a music store in Corpus Christi for the last seven years. He oversees two-dozen employees, stocks inventory and fills in for sales clerks who call in sick. Zenger averages 62 hours of work a week, but because he's a salaried manager, he isn't paid for any extra hours worked. BARRETT ZENGER: As of right now, there is a zero-tolerance for overtime. I've been written up for employees hitting overtime. NOGUCHI: Zenger earns more than $23,660 a year, so under existing law, his employer can exclude him from earning overtime pay. But the president's proposal would more than double the minimum salary level to 50,440, meaning Zenger's salary would either have to increase, or he would get paid for those extra hours. He isn't optimistic it will come to that. ZENGER: I would be fearful that I would be replaced by someone who could do the job at their expectation at a lower hourly rate or at a lower pay. NOGUCHI: Zenger says his employer has already cut higher-paid employees. If he gets replaced, he says he wants to find a job where he will be paid hourly and get overtime. Being salaried, he says, isn't worth it. ZENGER: You are signing off, to a certain degree, for indentured servitude. You're signing off on having to go above and beyond with no additional compensation. NOGUCHI: Advocates of the changes in overtime rules say they're long overdue. They say workers are often misclassified as managers in order to skirt paying overtime. Justin Swartz is an employment attorney representing workers. He says updating the Fair Labor Standards Act will help curb abuse of salaried workers. JUSTIN SWARTZ: One of the purposes of the FLSA is to encourage companies to hire more workers instead of squeezing work out of the workers that they have. NOGUCHI: Nor, he argues, do the changes mean businesses costs will skyrocket. SWARTZ: The only employers for whom it would make to raise somebody's salary a great deal in order to avoid paying them overtime are the ones who are exploiting the employees the worst to begin with. NOGUCHI: Dozens of categories of employees including teachers and seasonal workers will not see pay increases if the proposal is adopted because their positions are already specifically exempt from the law. But the business community says the proposal would still have the far-reaching effect of raising costs, especially for retail and restaurants. David French is chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation. He says employers will have to demote managers to hourly work, which will reduce paths to advancement. DAVID FRENCH: There are going to be fewer places for people with aspirations to go, and you know, eventually, that's not the pathway to the middle-class future that the president likes to talk about. NOGUCHI: Elizabeth Suffern says salaried work was not a career steppingstone for her. Four years ago, she managed a call center in Boston. She fell outside the bounds of overtime rules because her salary was $24,000. ELIZABETH SUFFERN: So it was just about what was required for me to allowed to be exempt. NOGUCHI: She says her employer made unreasonable claims on her time - early mornings, late nights and Sundays. Suffern says even lunch breaks were a challenge. SUFFERN: I never realized that I was actually, like, federally mandated to be allowed a 30-minute meal period until I actually read the wage and hours law poster that's required to be hung up on the wall. And then I brought it up with my supervisor, and he's like, well, where did you hear that (laughter)? I was like, well, I read it on the poster on the wall right there. NOGUCHI: Suffern eventually quit and took a customer service job, earning twice as much, with hourly pay plus overtime and bonuses. She says her old employer's policies hurt morale.

S. economy continued to add jobs at a pretty healthy pace last month. Employers added 223,000 jobs to their payrolls. But there's also a worry for the economy. The report says people continue to leave the labor force in large numbers. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The report says there was job growth in the retail, health care and leisure and hospitality sectors. Even manufacturing managed a slight increase despite the strong dollar. Stuart Hoffman is chief economist at PNC Financial Services. STUART HOFFMAN: It's a good report. It shows that the economy continued to create jobs and grow faster in the second quarter than in the weak start to the year. ZARROLI: The report says 60,000 fewer jobs were created in April and May than first thought. Still, the U. S. economy has been adding jobs this year at a rate of a little more than 200,000 a month. Seven years into the recovery, the job market continues to improve. The unemployment rate dipped from 5. 5 to 5. 3 percent. That's the lowest it's been since April, 2008, and it means that fewer people were looking for work. But the report also says the labor participation rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point between May and June. Bernard Baumohl is chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. BERNARD BAUMOHL: A growing number of people have retired, typically in their 50s and 60s. And then there are those that have simply entered the underground economy. And by the way, that is not an insignificant number. ZARROLI: Baumohl says the underground economy now represents as much as 10 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. The report also contains another potentially worrisome number. Wages were flat for the month and have grown just 2 percent over the past year. But Stuart Hoffman says there are better measures of wage growth that will be released this month, in particular the employment cost index. He says the Federal Reserve will look at those numbers when deciding whether to raise interest rates. BAUMOHL: If the data does come in, as I think, on the strong side, then September still sets up for me as the initial quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. ZARROLI: There's a pretty broad consensus now that the Fed will finally begin raising rates again soon. Hoffman says this morning's report is a bit weaker than expected, but it doesn't really change the likelihood of at least one rate hike this year. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

But on the streets of San Juan, NPR's Greg Allen reports, the signs of a crisis can be hard to see. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: At La Fortaleza, the historic governor's mansion in Old San Juan, officials shuttled in and out of meetings yesterday as they worked to stave off default.

NORMA PEREZ QUILES: Everything is like normal because we haven't had the impact in terms of the bank closing or supermarkets without food.

The governor also said each of the 3. 6 million Puerto Ricans would be called on to make sacrifices. Perez found that unsettling. QUILES: In my case, I'm just, like, worried, yes, because maybe my pension will be affected. Until now, my pension hasn't been affected. But I'm more cautious when I go to buy groceries now. ALLEN: Libros AC is a combined coffeehouse and bookstore in San Juan. Owner Samuel Medina says he didn't hear anything new in the governor's speech Monday. What surprised him most was how the governor looked. JEAN MEDINA: He looked really perturbed. He was about to basically, like, cry. You could see it in his eyes. ALLEN: Medina is something that's a little unusual right now in Puerto Rico. He's 29 years old, a young professional who decided to start a business on the island. Many of his friends, he says, have left Puerto Rico. MEDINA: Dentists, lawyers, friends who have studied real estate, they've gone - engineers. Basically half of them have gone state-side looking for better pay, a better style of life. ALLEN: Medina is concerned about a new 4 percent hike in the sales tax and possible future increases.

But she's disappointed in the island's leaders. She says for years, they hid from the public the shell game they were playing with Puerto Rico's debt. MIRANDA: We have been in this financial situation for almost 12 years. It's getting worse and worse and worse, and none of the past governors have done anything.

Yesterday the payroll processing company ADP said private employers added about 237,000 jobs in June, the biggest gain since December. Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group is expecting the jobs report put out by the Labor Department this morning to look even better.

The concern now is that the no vote could send Greece crashing out of the eurozone and into an even worse recession. NPR's Chris Arnold reports from Athens. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The Greek word for no is oxi, and across Athens and the Greek islands, it's on posters, spray-painted on walls, on old cars. It's a sign of the anger that many Greeks feel over the terms that Europe has insisted on in recent years in exchange for bailout money for the struggling economy. The no-voters say look, the unemployment rate here has doubled since 2010, 25 percent of Greeks looking for work can't find a job. So they say what kind of bailout is that - enough, no, oxi. Did you vote yes or no? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Greek). PANAGIOTIS PSARROS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was a no - a clear no. ARNOLD: Panagiotis Psarros voted in Athens earlier today. PSARROS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: He says that by saying no is just another way to put more pressure on the European Union to help us and be more moderate on the measures. ARNOLD: Many here say Greece had to pay bailout money back too quickly, agreed to cut pensions for retirees and to raise taxes. All this, they say, is crushing their economy. Others here warned that a no vote was dangerous. But Psarros doesn't believe that. He thinks that the media and European leaders were trying to scare the Greek people. PSARROS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: He says that people are controlled by three things - by sex, by money, and by fear. And they wanted to make us feel the fear. ARNOLD: But for others exiting the polls today, this was not just a symbolic vote to push Europe to cut Greece a better deal. MARIA SKOKOU: Sometimes I'm very sad. I'm very, very worried, and I am extremely angry - extremely angry. ARNOLD: Maria Skokou is a 41-year-old psychiatrist who voted with her mother. They both voted yes. And she's upset because she thinks that Greeks don't really understand what they might be putting into motion by voting no. SKOKOU: A vote for no will be a total disaster - a total disaster. ARNOLD: And why - what do you think could happen or will happen with a no vote? SKOKOU: That we will eventually be kicked out from the Euro and the eurozone, which I think is going to be a huge mistake (laughter) - one of those historic mistakes that the Greece has made. ARNOLD: Many of the yes voters agree and think that Greece could be pushed back to using its own currency - perhaps the old drachma - that might set off runaway inflation. Skokou's mother worries that she'll have to bring a suitcase full of drachmas to the grocery store. SKOKOU: She means that money will have no use, no value. ARNOLD: And clearly many people in Greece are very scared. A woman working a cash register at a little gift shop didn't want to be recorded, but she broke down crying saying that she's been wanting to have a baby, but she's too afraid. She can't find a good job, and there's just too much economic uncertainty. Maria Skokou says her brother, who's a chemical engineer, has started to actually look for another job overseas in case he loses his job here in Greece. SKOKOU: He's looking for a job in Australia. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Greek). ARNOLD: But, OK, where does Greece go from here? It's unclear exactly what the response from European leaders will be when people in Greece, especially business owners, are desperate to get the banks back open. People are having trouble paying their rents and buying merchandise to put on their store shelves. Kostantinos Poulakidas, who runs a small wristwatch stand, summed up Greece's situation this way. KONSTANTINOS POULAKIDAS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The future is invisible, and we cannot see it. POULAKIDAS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The future is invisible. ARNOLD: And so that continues to be true even after the votes are counted. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Athens. ARUN RATH, HOST:  Greek voters said no in a historic referendum on a bailout offer from European leaders. The concern now is that the no vote could send Greece crashing out of the eurozone and into an even worse recession. NPR's Chris Arnold reports from Athens. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The Greek word for no is oxi, and across Athens and the Greek islands, it's on posters, spray-painted on walls, on old cars. It's a sign of the anger that many Greeks feel over the terms that Europe has insisted on in recent years in exchange for bailout money for the struggling economy. The no-voters say look, the unemployment rate here has doubled since 2010, 25 percent of Greeks looking for work can't find a job. So they say what kind of bailout is that - enough, no, oxi. Did you vote yes or no? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Greek). PANAGIOTIS PSARROS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was a no - a clear no. ARNOLD: Panagiotis Psarros voted in Athens earlier today. PSARROS: (Speaking Greek). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: He says that by saying no is just another way to put more pressure on the European Union to help us and be more moderate on the measures.

SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: While French President Francois Hollande spoke of European solidarity, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear no new money is heading to Athens.

A million and a half people live there amid both dazzling wealth and stark poverty. Federal authorities say the Valley, as it's called, is steeped in corruption of every stripe - drug smuggling, boat stealing, courthouse bribery, under-the-table payoffs and health care fraud. Late last year, the feds launched an operation to clean up this part of Texas. NPR's John Burnett has the first in our series on corruption in the Rio Grande Valley. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: This is where the crusade starts inside the FBI building in McAllen, Texas. It's a two-tone, three-story, bunker-like edifice in a newish office park across the street from public housing. The supervisory special agent in charge of the new Rio Grande Valley Public Corruption Task Force is Rock Stone. Yes, that's his real name. ROCK STONE: The public's perception with which I now concur is that the problem is inordinately grave and that it is worse here than other places. We're being very vocal and very public about the fact that it is wrong, it is immoral, and you're betraying the public's trust. BURNETT: Rock Stone looks the part - 6-foot-3, buff, career FBI, son of a cop. He says the task force has five times more investigators than in years past, including Texas Rangers. He says since his office opened its doors last November, they've gotten a steady stream of tips from the public about corrupt officials. STONE: And we're going to pursue all of these people - school board, city, county, state, judicial, executive, legislative. We're going to pursue them, and we're going to lock them up. BURNETT: The Department of Justice created its newest anticorruption task force as a result of the continuing numbers of big and little fish getting nabbed down here on the border. In 2013, more public officials were convicted of federal crimes in South Texas - 83 of them - than in any other region of the country. In the last two decades, no fewer than five sheriffs have been busted for corruption. And from 2000 to 2013, 13 U. S. Customs and Border Protection Agents have gone to prison. JONATHAN TREVINO: I was a cop who went drug dealer. That's what it is. BURNETT: Jonathan Trevino, a former narcotics squad leader, is serving 17 years in the federal pen. Last year, his entire unit went to prison for seizing dope and selling it back to traffickers in Hidalgo County. TREVINO: No one forced us. No one held a gun to our head. No one threatened the families saying that you better participate in illegal activity. No, we all decided to abuse our position. BURNETT: The corruption even reaches into ballot boxes. Five campaign workers, known as politiqueras, pleaded guilty to election fraud in Hidalgo County in a case involving votes bought with cash, beer and cocaine. In a different case in neighboring Cameron County, nine politiqueras have been charged with manipulating mail-in ballots. Mary Helen Flores an activist trying to clean up Valley elections. MARY HELEN FLORES: A politiquera will get a person's vote by simply taking the ballot and filling it out themselves, or they will instruct the voter, just go ahead and mark your ballot right here. And they don't even know who they're voting for. BURNETT: We'll hear more from Jonathan Trevino and the politqueras later in this series. What is it about this torrid latitude that creates what's known in law enforcement circles as a high-temptation environment? Al Alvarez is sipping a beer after work at a tavern in the Hidalgo County seat of Edinburg. AL ALVAREZ: Salud. BURNETT: He figures he's represented more indicted politicians than any other lawyer in the Valley. ALVAREZ: Look, border cities are complex. The Valley is complex. BURNETT: Complex indeed. In the tip of Texas, you find a Maserati and a Jaguar dealership. Yet a third of the population lives below the poverty line and receives food stamps. For years, this tropical river delta was known mainly for grapefruits, snowbirds and immigrants. Today, the Rio Grande Valley is booming with new construction, bank branches, hospital complexes and luxury homes. Where does all the money come from? Alvarez lowers his voice. ALVAREZ: You know, there's an underground economy. Drugs fuel 20 percent of the economy here in the Valley. BURNETT: A fifth of the economy floating in drug money may be high. There's a lot of legitimate money in circulation from agribusiness, hospitals, rich Mexicans who've relocated here and the big state and federal border security payrolls. But there's no denying the local economy benefits from the existence of the Gulf Cartel headquartered just across the river from Brownsville. The Valley is a major trans-shipment zone for weed, coke and meth destined for northern cities. And there's a brisk local market here for cheap narcotics. CHAD RICHARDSON: There is a lot of dirty money in the Rio Grande Valley. BURNETT: Chad Richardson estimates five to 10 percent of the Valley economy is rooted in illegal activity, primarily drugs. He's an emeritus sociologist at the University of Texas Pan American. Richardson co-wrote a book about the underground economy of the South Texas borderlands that did not endear him to the chambers of commerce. RICHARDSON: And that money is available to corrupt public officials including officers at the border, including sheriffs, including judges. BURNETT: Some friends have gathered on the porch of a graceful old home in West Brownsville on a soft, muggy night. Ruth Wagner, a retired teacher, says that corruption and contraband have been a feature of the border going back to Civil War times when confederate cotton was smuggled through Mexican ports to avoid Union blockades. RUTH WAGNER: It was cotton, it's arms, it's people, it's drugs. It's something that's gone on forever because it's a part of a border culture. BURNETT: In the 27 years Wagner has been down here, she's noticed the frequent news stories about public servants being led away in handcuffs. WAGNER: I think the FBI is down here more. I think the bigger guys are just getting caught. I think there's more of a focus on what's going on on the border right now. CARLOS GOMEZ: They'll clean up for a while and then it'll just all fall back into order because that's just the way things are. Nobody's ever really done anything long-term about this. BURNETT: Carlos Gomez, a social worker and a Valley native, is not so sure the FBI's anticorruption dragnet can change entrenched behavior. GOMEZ: Corruption's always been of issue here in the Valley. It has always been the compadre system. You scratch my back; I'll scratch yours, so to speak. BURNETT: But maybe things are starting to change in small ways. Carlos Cisneros is a lawyer in Brownsville and an author who writes legal thrillers set in the Valley. Driving on a rainy day, he says his colleagues down at the courthouse have become wary. CARLOS CISNEROS: I'd remember, I mean, if you were engaged in some illegality, people wouldn't think twice about talking about it on their cell phones. Nowadays, people have taken notice that big brother is watching, and you cannot presume that it's just like the good old days. BURNETT: And Cisneros says he's glad because the Rio Grande Valley is at a crossroads. Space X is breaking ground on a commercial spaceport east of Brownsville, and the University of Texas is building a major new medical school in the Valley. It's high time to break bad habits. Again, FBI supervisory Special Agent Rock Stone. STONE: We're here to plant a flag and show that it all ends now because I don't want to hear anymore it's always been that way. Well, it's not going to be that way anymore on my watch. I plan to be an instrument of change. BURNETT: It's too early to say how much of a change the Rio Grande Valley Public Corruption Task Force has made. The FBI says it's working a large volume of cases covertly. You'll know we're coming after you, Stone says, when we show up with an arrest warrant. John Burnett, NPR News, Brownsville.

His assignment is administrative reform, and despite the hard line from Germany, he says he's hopeful a compromise can be reached. GEORGE KATROUGALOS: The (unintelligible) is is that we don't want the European taxpayers to pay additional money. We don't want new money from them. But we want a way to restructure the debt so as to be able to pay it back. SIEGEL: Why is Greece's position in these talks with Europe any stronger today after a referendum by Greeks than it was one week ago when Greece rejected what was on the table? KATROUGALOS: I can tell you that. Some political cells in Europe - of course not all our partners - did not want a solution of the problem. They wanted just get rid of the only left government of - in Europe because they were afraid of eventual political contagion. We're going to have elections in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland. So 10 days ago, they had presented us an ultimatum that we could not accept. And the dilemma they had in mind for us was either a political suicide - to accept something that was quite contrary to our positions - or the sudden death. That's why we had to go to the people and ask through the referendum if they can accept the proposal that we, the government, consider it to be not even a base for discussion. SIEGEL: Well, after Europe has - after all of Europe has seen the result of the referendum, do you see any differing attitude on the part of Greeks' creditors in response to that or do they say, look, we know you didn't like the plan, but we still need these terms from you? KATROUGALOS: It's more than that. It is not that we don't like the plan. Our proposal (unintelligible) also very hard for the Greek population. The difference is another. It's actually an issue of democracy. If there is only one economic policy possibly without any kind of alternatives, just one policy, why to have elections? We are just a different voice in Europe and we want to be heard. And the difference with a regard to what's happened before the referendum is that one can ignore a government. Governments pass go. One cannot elect a new Greek people and the Greek people has spoken. He must be heard. SIEGEL: How vital is it to you that Greece remain in the eurozone? Quite apart from the referendum - can you see just as easily Greece saying there are no terms that are acceptable. We would do better outside of this common currency? KATROUGALOS: No, no, our mandate when we have been elected in January - now our position to the referendum is that we want to keep Greece within the eurozone, within Europe, but within a social Europe. What we don't want is this Europe of rising inequalities. SIEGEL: But you know what a lot of West Europeans say. They say, look, there's nothing political, there's nothing socialist about not collecting taxes from people. Greece has been running a broken financial system and a broken fiscal system all these years. KATROUGALOS: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. We have inherited a system that was an alliance between oligarchs that did not pay taxes and a corrupt political elite. And therefore we want to reform the state, not because our lenders demand it but because our society needs it. And with regard to tax - these are basic effort. Now we are negotiating with Switzerland in order to have access into the accounts that these rich guys from Greece have managed to get out of the country this year. SIEGEL: Mr. Katrougalos, thank you very much for talking with us today. KATROUGALOS: It was a pleasure. Thank you, bye bye. SIEGEL: So George Katrougalos, who is a minister for administrative reform in the Greek government, he spoke to us from the parliament building in Athens. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And we turn now to George Katrougalos, a minister in the Greek government. His assignment is administrative reform, and despite the hard line from Germany, he says he's hopeful a compromise can be reached. GEORGE KATROUGALOS: The (unintelligible) is is that we don't want the European taxpayers to pay additional money. We don't want new money from them. But we want a way to restructure the debt so as to be able to pay it back. SIEGEL: Why is Greece's position in these talks with Europe any stronger today after a referendum by Greeks than it was one week ago when Greece rejected what was on the table? KATROUGALOS: I can tell you that. Some political cells in Europe - of course not all our partners - did not want a solution of the problem. They wanted just get rid of the only left government of - in Europe because they were afraid of eventual political contagion. We're going to have elections in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland. So 10 days ago, they had presented us an ultimatum that we could not accept. And the dilemma they had in mind for us was either a political suicide - to accept something that was quite contrary to our positions - or the sudden death. That's why we had to go to the people and ask through the referendum if they can accept the proposal that we, the government, consider it to be not even a base for discussion. SIEGEL: Well, after Europe has - after all of Europe has seen the result of the referendum, do you see any differing attitude on the part of Greeks' creditors in response to that or do they say, look, we know you didn't like the plan, but we still need these terms from you?

On Sunday, Greeks voted to reject a package of tax increases and spending cuts its creditors are demanding. Yesterday, European leaders said that without deep reforms, they will not provide more aid to Greece. Meanwhile, Greek banks remain closed because they don't have the cash they need to operate. And all of this when just a couple of weeks ago, it looked like a deal could be brokered. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports on why that fell apart. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The standoff between Greece and Europe is taking place after years of brinksmanship and miscalculations on both sides. In 2010, the global financial crisis had left Greece deep in debt. And in exchange for financial help from Europe, it agreed to a program of fiscal and economic reforms. Nicholas Economides is a professor at NYU Stern School of Business. NICHOLAS ECONOMIDES: In the beginning of the program, people thought, OK, we're going to get into this program. After a year, we'll be fine. We will have a one-year recession, and after a year, we will be growing. ZARROLI: Economides says in exchange for financial aid, Greece agreed to a series of market reforms, like changing its labor laws to make laying people off easier. But he says the International Monetary Fund badly misjudged how long it would take to repair Greece's economy. ECONOMIDES: According to the targets, Greece would recover almost immediately in 2011, and that didn't happen. Greece did not recover in 2011, did not recover in 2012, did not recover in 2013. GABRIEL STERN: They just have had the most horrendous recession that probably any country has had in the West outside of wartime and including most wartimes. ZARROLI: Gabriel Stern, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics, says that in 2015, Greece's economy was nearly a third smaller than the IMF had projected it would be. STERN: It's the equivalent, in European terms, of losing Germany in the Netherlands. It's equivalent, in American terms, of losing New York, California and Florida. It's just unspeakable. ZARROLI: Greece managed to balance its budget eventually, but the government never followed up on many of its reform promises. In fact, weary Greek voters elected a new leftist government in 2014 that promised to resist any more demands from Europe. Again, Nicholas Economides. ECONOMIDES: The government was elected in the platform that was a hundred percent against the program. That was their platform. We're going to be a hundred percent against the program. The people were angry enough to vote for that. ZARROLI: The new government returned to the negotiating table with Europe, making demands of its own. It wanted its creditors to write down its massive debt load. Here was then-finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in an interview on Britain's Channel 4. YANIS VAROUFAKIS: The two golden words that mark the chasm between the yes and the no - debt restructuring. ZARROLI: But the government's defiant rhetoric didn't win it any friends. Europe refused to consider restructuring for fear of the region's other debt-ridden countries would want debt relief, too. And it insisted that Greece raise its value-added tax and impose more budget cuts, including on government pensions. Hari Tsoukas is a professor at Britain's Warwick Business School who has run for the Greek Parliament. He says the government came to office vowing to resist austerity, and it ultimately had no choice but to walk away from the talks. HARI TSOUKAS: I think, realistically speaking, they would been having problems to convince their own party - the left league of the party - to accept the deal. ZARROLI: The government won a big political victory in this weekend's referendum when the Greek people rejected Europe's latest demands. But Greece's banks remain closed, and its economic problems appear almost insurmountable. And European leaders don't seem to be giving in. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

Even getting money out of ATMs is becoming near-impossible in some places with banks closed. And the big question looming over everything is whether Greece will be forced off the euro. That's something Greeks' prime minister says he does not want. NPR's Chris Arnold is in Athens, and he joins us on the line. Chris, good morning. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So it is appearing now, after this vote over the weekend when Greek voters rejected this latest bailout plan, that, I mean, this country is really teetering on the edge of an even worse financial disaster. What happens now? ARNOLD: A big part of it is what's Germany going to do next? Germany's the most powerful economy in Europe. It's been the driving force behind this austerity that many Greeks feel has been crushing their economy. And more and more economists are sort of agreeing with the Greeks lately and saying this approach of raising taxes a lot for Greek people and on the tourism industry, cutting pensions for a lot of Greeks across the country, at the same time insisting on these billion dollar debt repayments - that all this is making it very hard for the Greek economy to recover. And just one example of that - unemployment went from 12 percent or so in 2010 - it's now risen to above 25 percent. And this is people actively out there looking for work. Twenty-five percent of the country can't find a job. So people on the street here are asking what kind of bailout is that? This just isn't working. I spoke with Spirou Christos. He's a merchant at a local fish market in Athens. SPIROU CHRISTOS: (Through interpreter) He says that he's not against Europe overall. He's against Germans and against Schauble because he thinks that austerity measures were measures that made Greece an experiment for them. ARNOLD: Now, a couple things there that are interesting, I think - first, the average person on the street in Athens knows the German finance minister's name. GREENE: Yeah, he just brought up the name Wolfgang Schauble like, I mean, it was on the tip of his tongue. I mean, this is a German official who's really been tough on Greece. ARNOLD: Right, I mean, in Greece, he's become a kind of Darth Vader figure because he's been pushing for this austerity. There are evil looking posters of him on - at bus stops. And there's also this notion that Germany is experimenting on Greece, trying to figure out, OK, how much austerity can Greece survive? And some of that makes sense. I mean, look, there's other economies that are in trouble in Europe - Spain, for example - and Germany doesn't want to end up bankrolling half of Europe. But the no vote here was both a rebuke and a plea for help saying look, it's just too much austerity. We can't survive this. You need to let our economy recover. GREENE: OK, so what happens now, Chris? I mean, you've got Greek's prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who called for Greeks to go out on - in this vote and reject this latest bailout plan? What is his next move here? ARNOLD: Well, he's already made one move, which is to have his finance minister step down, and this was a kind of combative guy. There was a lot of bad blood, so that's an olive branch, if we can use that example with regard to Greece. In terms of specifics, it's unclear, but certainly, he's going to want more time to pay back the loans and the bailout money that Greece has gotten from Europe. The economy here is just too squeezed. He argues it's just very tough to do that right now. GREENE: But with the tough line that Germany has taken, I mean, how much patience is left when it comes to Germany and other European countries? ARNOLD: Well, the leaders of France and Germany both spoke about this yesterday. They said the door is open to negotiation. France's Francois Hollande seemed a little softer, talked about a long-term solution. Germany's Angela Merkel, who's a little more stern, said look, the previous offer was already generous so, you know, who knows? We'll just have to see what sort of deal they can work out. But this big public referendum from the people of Greece - you would think it would put some pressure for some more concessions.

Trades were routed to the many different electronic exchanges that now operate, so the business of buying and selling stocks went on. But the episode is a big embarrassment for the New York Stock Exchange, which, over the years, has seen a steady decline in its share of trading volume. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Even before the market opened, the New York Stock Exchange sent out a warning that it was having system issues, says Eric Hunsader of Nanex, which provides financial data to investors. As the morning dragged on, Hunsader says, there were more signs of trouble. The amount of stock trades handled by the New York Stock Exchange - usually about nine percent of the market, total - began to fall. ERIC HUNSADER: They were slowly dropping to eight percent, seven, six and then around 10:45, five, four, three, two, one, zero. ZARROLI: Hunsader says the problem appears to have been some sort of technical glitch. HUNSADER: I think something happened at 10:45. That was the beginning of some problem. It started - showed up and progressively got worse. ZARROLI: Whatever the cause, the NYSE was able to offload most of its trades to other electronic exchanges. And though there were isolated interruptions, investors, for the most part, were able to continue with their trading. But at the New York Stock Exchange, which in years past has been a hub of frenzied activity, trading ground to a halt at a little after 11:30, and the digital screens above the floor were suddenly blank. Chris (ph) is an options trader who didn't want his last name used because he isn't supposed to talk to the press. CHRIS: They just to give you a heads-up. Can't trade these products. (Unintelligible) are halted, and that's it. I called all my customers and said, I can still work for you. Just give me your orders, and I'll trade it on another floor. ZARROLI: The NYSE finally reopened a little after three. The major indexes finished down by less than two percent. The outage was a big black eye for the New York Stock Exchange. In an interview on CNBC, Exchange President Tom Farley tried to make the best of the incident, noting that investors had been spared any real inconvenience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM FARLEY: We need to make sure that stocks, including NYSE-listed stocks, can continue to be traded. Fortunately, in this instance, they can continue to be traded, although it's not - it's not a good day. I don't feel good for our customers who are having to deal with the fallout. ZARROLI: Farley said the incident wasn't due to hacking. Instead, it was an internal technical issue. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, says the stock market has simply become a lot more complex in recent years. There are more players doing a lot of different kinds of trading. BRAD MCMILLAN: You have more and more market actors trying to act more and more quickly. At some point, there's going to be a glitch, and occasionally, it's going to be bad enough to shut the whole thing down. ZARROLI: In August 2013, for example, a technical glitch actually shut down trading on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange altogether in what was later blamed on a software bug. For three hours, traders were unable to buy and sell shares of major companies such as Microsoft and Facebook. This time around, McMillan says, the market actually survived pretty well. MCMILLAN: You can look at this as kind of a live-action stress test of the overall financial system, which has actually done quite well.

Yesterday, a faulty software upgrade forced the nation's oldest stock exchange to suspend trading for nearly four hours. The explanation is that a technical glitch made it hard for the trading software to communicate with other systems, so orders couldn't be processed. The incident is a big embarrassment even though it didn't cause much of a problem for most investors. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In the eyes of most people, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is synonymous with the stock market, and so much about the exchange, from the busy trading pits to the closing bell, have become fixtures of American life. But the NYSE has changed dramatically in just the past 10 years, and it's likely to keep changing, says Robert Battalio, professor of finance at Notre Dame. ROBERT BATTALIO: At least for my generation, it symbolizes capitalism and all, right? But I think, you know, in 20, 30 years, it's not going to have the same meaning, is my guess. ZARROLI: The past few years have seen a proliferation of new electronic markets that compete with the NYSE, and federal regulations require each trade to be executed on the market that provides the best price. JJ Kinahan is chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. JJ KINAHAN: If you look at 20 years ago where the only place to really trade was the New York Stock Exchange, there are multiple venues now to go to with your orders. So there may be a better bid or a better offer at another venue. ZARROLI: The spread of these new trading venues has made the market a lot more complex, but Kinahan says it's also made stock trading less vulnerable to technical problems. KINAHAN: And I think people lose sight of this. If you think about 20 years ago, if the phone system went down, trading would have stopped 'cause there was only one venue. ZARROLI: Today, when one market experiences a glitch, trades can quickly be routed to competing exchanges, says Robert Battalio. BATTALIO: The idea was, if one goes down, that market just pulls away, and trading continues, which is kind of what you saw yesterday. ZARROLI: The NYSE's parent company has struggled to compete by opening new electronic exchanges of its own, but by some estimates, only about a fifth of stock trades now go through the NYSE. Again, Robert Battalio. BATTALIO: If you're a retail investor, that order gets routed to either Citadel or Susquehanna, and it trades instantaneously at the best quote. It doesn't even make it to the New York Stock Exchange. ZARROLI: But the New York Stock Exchange does play a unique role in some ways. For one thing, both the NYSE and NASDAQ have strict standards about what companies they'll list. They have to follow certain governance rules. A lot of big institutional investors like mutual funds won't buy shares that aren't listed. Chester Spatt is a former economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission who now teaches at Carnegie Mellon University. CHESTER SPATT: It's not so much, I think, that investors now care as much about what platform they do their execution on, but I still think having an NYSE listing is powerful branding. ZARROLI: The NYSE also is responsible for setting the opening and closing prices of stocks, and these prices are widely used throughout the financial markets. But much of what made the NYSE dominate stock trading for so long is gone. I asked Robert Battalio whether the NYSE is even necessary anymore. BATTALIO: That's a fantastic question, and I guess the answer would be, is, if they disappeared, I think somebody else would come in to fill the void, almost for sure. ZARROLI: The NYSE has history and tradition on its side, but as yesterday's outage showed, it's also having to compete in a world where the rules have very much changed.

Professor Jeffrey Sachs joins us from Columbia University where he is director of the Earth Institute. Welcome to the program. JEFFREY SACHS: Thank you. SIEGEL: And Carmen Reinhart joins us from Harvard University. She's a professor at the Kennedy School and co-author of the book \"This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries Of Financial Folly. \" Thanks for joining us, professor Reinhart. CARMEN REINHART: Thank you. SIEGEL: Today, word from Germany was that Greek will need some debt restructuring as part of any - a new loan program. Jeffrey Sachs, how significant is that admission by the German finance minister today? SACHS: In one sense, it's been obvious to almost everybody. All during the past six months, Greece has been saying, we need debt relief, and the German government has said no. And that is a core part of the impasse that has brought us to this catastrophic situation today and to the cliff that we're experiencing and witnessing with Greece. SIEGEL: Carmen Reinhart, do you put the German attitude toward restructuring in the same central place? REINHART: Absolutely. And the next, I think, impasse may come on the magnitudes of the debt relief and the modalities. SIEGEL: When you say magnitude and modalities, you mean how much of the debt would have to be forgiven and whether it would be stretched out over more time or interest rates changed. Those are still matter to be negotiated. REINHART: Indeed. There has been, in this discussion, a distaste for putting on the table the so-called haircuts on principle. The creditors have a preference for extending maturities - we're really talking about decades - and having windows of grace periods where there are no debt-servicing payments, whereas in many of the restructurings - and there are many, many restructurings in history - the ultimate endgame has often involved - usually involved a haircut. SIEGEL: Jeffrey Sachs, you were a signatory to an open letter to German chancellor Merkel which said, in part, now is the time for a humane rethink of the punitive and failed program of austerity. I assume, in your view, that goes beyond what the terms of a rescue are, to what conditions are required of Greek in terms of its own policies. Did you sense any movement in that direction? SACHS: Of course. Greece is not going to have an easy situation under any circumstances. But what is required is a compromise where Greece goes through difficult adjustment and also makes its economy more competitive but at the same time, there's relief on the debt. And that's why Schauble's statement is really important and shocking at the time that it has come because all during the actual negotiations up until last week when Europe gave what it called its final offer and its ultimatum which then provoked the referendum and also provoked the closure of the banks, Germany was denying exactly what minister Schauble said today. SIEGEL: This is finance minister Wolfgang Schauble who we're talking about, the German finance minister. SACHS: Exactly. I've been watching this quite closely in the room of some of these negotiations, and it has seemed to me and to many other people that actually, the finance minister, in a way, was goading Greece to get out of the eurozone. He wasn't really trying to find a solution. He was trying to provoke them to leave. And Greece kept saying, but we want to be in the eurozone. We just need relief on the debt in order to be able to do that. SIEGEL: I'd like to hear from both of you about the idea of Greece possibly leaving the eurozone. Some people, including economist Paul Krugman, have said that a Greek exit from using the euro is either inevitable or desirable or both. Carmen Reinhart, what do you think? Is it necessary that Greece remain within the eurozone? REINHART: I think the timing would be unfortunate. A departure at this time would be under the really worst possible conditions. And I think one should not take it lightly what the adverse consequences of such a departure will be on economic activity. SIEGEL: But you're saying this would be a bad time for it. I don't hear you saying the future of Europe hangs in the balance, and Greece has to continue using the Euro. REINHART: I do not think that a Greek departure has imminent consequences for the rest of the periphery largely because in the last five years, we've seen a complete re-profiling of Greek debt going from being in private hands to being almost exclusively in official hands. SACHS: But a forced exit would be tumultuous. It would wipe out middle-class savings. It would not reduce even one cent the external debt, which is all euro denominated, and it would lead to, I believe, chaotic and ultimately very, very harsh divisions within Europe itself. To cast one country out and have calamity economically, socially politically within Europe would be dumb. It's the only technical word I could come up with. . . (LAUGHTER)SACHS: . . . Because it is so easy to avoid this. It's so unnecessary. The collapse of the Greek banks last week when the referendum was called and the European Central Bank announced that it would no longer provide liquidity support and opened the way to a full-fledged bank panic, the likes of which have not been seen since the Great Depression, is, to use another technical term, a shame. SIEGEL: Just one other question, then. Are we in new territory here, given that Greece and Germany, as members of the European Union, aspire to a closer relationship than, say, the U. S. and Argentina when Argentina had its collapse or the U. S. and Russia when Russia had its collapse? REINHART: Unlike the complicated Argentine situation in which after we thought things had settled down in 2005, we get maverick holdout creditors complicating the scene again, this is a government to government situation, and hopefully, in the optimistic scenario, we could see closure. SIEGEL: Now, there. . . REINHART: But I'm not optimistic. Let's just say I'm not optimistic of something very immediate. SIEGEL: Professor Carmen Reinhart of Harvard and Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia, thanks to both of you for talking with us today. REINHART: Thank you. SACHS: A pleasure - thank you.

SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Earlier this week in Brussels, Merkel spoke of European solidarity as being the only way to end the impasse with Athens. While that may sound as if the chancellor is looking to compromise, it's very difficult for her to do so. It will be highly unpopular back home if she budges on cutting Greece's mountain of debt, even though the IMF and Greek officials say that must happen for a deal to work. In fact, recent polls show most Germans don't even want Greece to stay in the currency union. Germany's largest newspaper, Bild, recently published a front-page doctored photo of the chancellor wearing a Prussian spiked helmet. The headline read, \"No More Billions For Greece -- Today We Need The Iron Chancellor. \" Parliament member Wolfgang Bosbach is in Merkel's conservative Democratic Union party. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW)WOLFGANG BOSBACH: (Speaking German). NELSON: In an interview this week with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Bosbach questioned whether Athens asking for another bailout is even legal at this stage. He predicts that even if a deal is struck in Brussels, Merkel will have a hard time selling it to her political party. People here in Germany are fed up with Athens, which they perceive as unwilling or unable to tackle rampant tax evasion, government corruption and a bloated pension system. A poll last week by broadcaster N24 found half of the Germans surveyed also disapprove of their government's handling of the Greek debt crisis.

SCHWARZER: So there is a huge risk for her if there is a compromise that she takes this home and people think she hasn't been able to have it her way in Europe. NELSON: Not that shepherding a Greek exit from the currency union, like most Germans want, is going to help Merkel either, Schwarzer says. That and a Greek loan default would mean Germany, as Athens's largest creditor, would lose the tens of billions it paid for the Greek bailout in recent years. SCHWARZER: Then Merkel would have to come back home and explain to German taxpayers that this money is actually lost. And that would, of course, be a huge political hit for her. NELSON: Marcel Fratzscher, who heads the German Institute of Economic Research, agrees. In a recent Financial Times op-ed, he predicted the long-term political damage could be devastating for the German government.

Beyond that, Europe is mired in painfully slow growth, made worse by political infighting. Plus, China is suffering through a financial crisis as over the last few weeks, its stock market plunged, losing more than a quarter of its value. It did bounce back in the last couple of days, but still. Now, none of this is good for those countries, but what does it mean for the U. S. ? To talk about that, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Might as well just start with Greece. We've been talking about it all week - in fact, for weeks. As we heard from Eleanor just now, the latest deadline for a deal between Greece and its creditors is this coming Sunday. Now, if they don't cut a deal, you know, it may well be out of the eurozone, right? That's what's at stake here - pretty big thing. WESSEL: Right. Now, there is new optimism in Europe this morning that Greece and its creditors are going to cut a deal. And no matter what happens, the Greek people are really in for tough times. But if you look at this globally, Greece is a very small economy. It counts for less than 2 percent of the eurozone's economy and an even smaller of the world. And, you know, Europe is better prepared to cope with Greek defaulting than it was a few years ago. So the effects on the U. S. of Greece's problems are likely to be small, unless - and this is a big caveat - unless it triggers a tidal wave of financial distress that shakes European and U. S. financial markets and hurts our growth. Now, policymakers keep saying that's unlikely, but they really can't be certain. MONTAGNE: Of course, China is another thing altogether. I mean, what happens in Shanghai with the stock market is not likely to stay in Shanghai. WESSEL: Absolutely. The Chinese economy is much more important to the U. S. and to the whole global economy than Greece is. Chinese stocks have been on a roller coaster ride. They've wiped out $3. 5 trillion of wealth in a month. Now, intervention seems to have helped, but the crash has shaken unsophisticated investors in China, consumers who borrowed money to buy stock and didn't anticipate this. Now, I asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew about this earlier at Brookings, and here's what he had to say. JACK LEW: China's markets are still pretty much separated from world markets. They're obviously moving towards being more integrated. But right now, they're not. So you're not going to - I don't think you'll see the direct linkage there. I think the concern that is a real one is what does it mean about long-term growth in China? I think that that I would break into two pieces. One is how do China's policymakers respond to this, and what does it mean in terms of the core condition of the economy? MONTAGNE: And David, what do we know so far about those two concerns that Jack Lew cited? WESSEL: Well, the economy is slowing down. The Chinese said today that auto sales fell in June for the first time in two years. And I think that the problem is that people are afraid Chinese leaders will back away from economic reforms, slowing a transition to an economy less dependent on exports to the U. S. , more open to foreign investment and market forces. And that would hurt the U. S. and hurt U. S. companies, so that's the big risk here. MONTAGNE: Well, with all of this going on overseas and all of what's wrong overseas, can the U. S. economy really continue to improve steadily? WESSEL: Well, it is a bad global growth environment, and weak economies will affect the U. S. - that lower exports might affect the dollar, interest rates, oil prices and stuff like that. But I think the big unknown is this. The direct effects of Greece and China on our economic recovery, which has been getting better, may be small. But we've learned from the recent past that financial disturbances in one continent, China or Europe, can be very contagious and can move surprisingly quickly across continents. So with the world economy growing so slowly, we could have some kind of financial virus that can spread very quickly. And nobody who's sober can rule out that possibly right now. MONTAGNE: David, good talking to you. WESSEL: You're welcome. MONTAGNE: David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  The Greek economy is facing huge challenges. Beyond that, Europe is mired in painfully slow growth, made worse by political infighting. Plus, China is suffering through a financial crisis as over the last few weeks, its stock market plunged, losing more than a quarter of its value. It did bounce back in the last couple of days, but still. Now, none of this is good for those countries, but what does it mean for the U. S. ? To talk about that, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Might as well just start with Greece. We've been talking about it all week - in fact, for weeks. As we heard from Eleanor just now, the latest deadline for a deal between Greece and its creditors is this coming Sunday. Now, if they don't cut a deal, you know, it may well be out of the eurozone, right? That's what's at stake here - pretty big thing. WESSEL: Right. Now, there is new optimism in Europe this morning that Greece and its creditors are going to cut a deal. And no matter what happens, the Greek people are really in for tough times. But if you look at this globally, Greece is a very small economy. It counts for less than 2 percent of the eurozone's economy and an even smaller of the world. And, you know, Europe is better prepared to cope with Greek defaulting than it was a few years ago. So the effects on the U. S. of Greece's problems are likely to be small, unless - and this is a big caveat - unless it triggers a tidal wave of financial distress that shakes European and U. S. financial markets and hurts our growth. Now, policymakers keep saying that's unlikely, but they really can't be certain. MONTAGNE: Of course, China is another thing altogether. I mean, what happens in Shanghai with the stock market is not likely to stay in Shanghai. WESSEL: Absolutely. The Chinese economy is much more important to the U. S. and to the whole global economy than Greece is. Chinese stocks have been on a roller coaster ride. They've wiped out $3. 5 trillion of wealth in a month. Now, intervention seems to have helped, but the crash has shaken unsophisticated investors in China, consumers who borrowed money to buy stock and didn't anticipate this. Now, I asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew about this earlier at Brookings, and here's what he had to say. JACK LEW: China's markets are still pretty much separated from world markets. They're obviously moving towards being more integrated. But right now, they're not. So you're not going to - I don't think you'll see the direct linkage there. I think the concern that is a real one is what does it mean about long-term growth in China? I think that that I would break into two pieces. One is how do China's policymakers respond to this, and what does it mean in terms of the core condition of the economy? MONTAGNE: And David, what do we know so far about those two concerns that Jack Lew cited? WESSEL: Well, the economy is slowing down. The Chinese said today that auto sales fell in June for the first time in two years. And I think that the problem is that people are afraid Chinese leaders will back away from economic reforms, slowing a transition to an economy less dependent on exports to the U. S. , more open to foreign investment and market forces. And that would hurt the U. S. and hurt U. S. companies, so that's the big risk here. MONTAGNE: Well, with all of this going on overseas and all of what's wrong overseas, can the U. S. economy really continue to improve steadily? WESSEL: Well, it is a bad global growth environment, and weak economies will affect the U. S. - that lower exports might affect the dollar, interest rates, oil prices and stuff like that. But I think the big unknown is this. The direct effects of Greece and China on our economic recovery, which has been getting better, may be small. But we've learned from the recent past that financial disturbances in one continent, China or Europe, can be very contagious and can move surprisingly quickly across continents. So with the world economy growing so slowly, we could have some kind of financial virus that can spread very quickly. And nobody who's sober can rule out that possibly right now.

The Federal Reserve chair was at the House Financial Services Committee to give lawmakers an update on the economy and on Fed policy. But as NPR's John Ydstie reports, the toughest questions weren't about economic policy, they were about who is in control, Congress or the Fed? JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The Federal Reserve was created by Congress, but it was designed to be an independent agency that could make monetary policy without congressional interference. At times, that's produced some tension between the fed's congressional overseers and its chairman. And in recent months, the tensions have risen sharply. They were on full display today as Janet Yellen faced off with Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee. The lawmakers have expressed growing frustration over the Fed's failure to respond to a subpoena for documents related to a leak of confidential information from a Fed meeting in 2012. Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas raised the issue in his opening statement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEB HENSARLING: The Fed's refusal to cooperate in a congressional investigation threatens both its reputation and its credibility. The Fed is not above the law. This is a very serious matter and it must be resolved. YDSTIE: Hensarling's remarks turned out to be restrained compared to the questioning by Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SEAN DUFFY: Give me the legal authority that you have not to comply with the subpoena. JANET YELLEN: We have indicated that we fully intend to cooperate with you to provide the documents. This matter is the subject of an open criminal investigation by the board's inspector general and by the Department of Justice. It will compromise. . . DUFFY: No, no. YELLEN: . . . Likely compromise their investigation. DUFFY: You are the chair - we have the right to these documents. You have the duty to provide them to us. We are entitled to do oversight. You're required to give us the documents. I hope that you'll reconsider your denial. YDSTIE: Not surprisingly, the conflict was not resolved during this hearing. There were also some sparks as Republicans urged Yellen to tie rate hikes more directly to economic indicators like the level of inflation and GDP growth. Yellen said the economy was too complex and if Fed policy were constrained in that way, it could be damaging. Despite these fireworks, there was some time devoted to the economy's current health. Yellen said once again that sluggish growth in the first half of the year was due to temporary factors and that the Fed expects moderate growth and further improvement in the labor market in the second half of this year. And she said the Fed is likely to begin raising rates soon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target. YDSTIE: Democrat Carolyn Maloney of New York asked Yellen if it's possible further economic turmoil in Greece or other parts of the world might affect the Fed's rate hike schedule. Yellen said Fed policymakers are factoring-in the global situation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: As we've said all along, we have no judgment at this point about the appropriate date to raise the federal funds rate. Our judgment about that will depend on unfolding economic developments. YDSTIE: A number of Republicans suggested that after more than six years of holding short-term interest rates near zero, it was past time for the Fed to push them up. But Democrats argued that with inflation remaining low and millions still out of work, the Fed should remain patient. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

But just because a property is cheap doesn't make it a good investment. NPR's Jason Margolis reports on a University of Michigan professor who is teaching Detroit residents how to become shrewd real estate investors. JASON MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Peter Allen has been teaching a real estate investing course to students in Ann Arbor for more than three decades. This summer, he's doing it 45 miles east, Saturdays in Midtown Detroit. PETER ALLEN: I crammed this into four weeks for you all, and I was just a little sleepless last night. MARGOLIS: That's because he's throwing a lot of new terms and principles at his class pretty quickly. His 18 students are mostly middle-aged African-American community leaders. Allen requires them to target a home in Detroit, then work through the numbers. Lanita Carter stands in front of the classroom, showing repair projections for a 900-square-foot house. LANITA CARTER: It needs quite a bit of repairs. It needs new floors. It needs - the plumbing needs to be fixed, electricity. MARGOLIS: Her estimate - $21,000 in repairs. She actually bought it last fall for $3,900. Allen is helping her evaluate if it'd be worth taking out a mortgage for repair costs and eventually renting it out. ALLEN: So you've got a mortgage payment of $360. You've got a tax bill of maybe $50 a month. MARGOLIS: He adds up a few more numbers. ALLEN: So you've got a rent of $850, and you've got payments that are no more than $600. So you got a $200 dividend left in your checking account every month. MARGOLIS: Allen estimates that he's taught 3500 students over 34 years in Ann Arbor. He's now in Detroit because he says he wants locals to revitalize their own neighborhoods. ALLEN: This is the best way - individual, grass-roots, entrepreneurial, house-by-house, skin-in-the-game approach to neighbor revitalization than any government program or city-directed program could achieve. MARGOLIS: Allen is volunteering his time. ALLEN: I tell the students the only compensation for me is that when they're finished fixing up a house, they invite me over for dinner. MARGOLIS: Allen's students might be more cautious than the average homebuyer. After all, they are taking a class first. Consider Dana Hart, a woman in her early 40s. We walked around Detroit's North End, where she rents. DANA HART: My father raised me, and he said, Dana, you will never own a home. It can always be taken from you by the bank. It can be taken from you by the city. It's not yours. MARGOLIS: She's considering going against her dad's advice because she sees property values in Detroit coming back. HART: If you don't own property, you have a likelihood of being pushed out, and I don't want to be pushed out of this neighborhood. MARGOLIS: She has her eye on a place with boarded-up windows, graffiti and overgrown weeds. She doesn't think eyesore. HART: I think brick. I think look at the steps and the landings that you can put flowers on. I look at the balcony. MARGOLIS: And now she looks at property taxes and interest rates and the first three rules of real estate, which everyone knows have to do with location. HART: I know how to do, you know, walkability scores and such. MARGOLIS: There are some things that are hard to predict in Detroit, though. I went Lanita Carter's new home, the woman who spoke in class. It's a charming bungalow from the outside. CARTER: It was used as a doghouse, so that's why you don't want to go in right now. MARGOLIS: A dog house meaning there were literally dogs? CARTER: There were literally seven pit bulls behind inside of this home. MARGOLIS: You can still detect the faint odor of urine wafting out from inside. The dogs were protecting three squatters who were living there illegally. It took a long time for Carter to get them out. Back in the classroom, Peter Allen sees this as a teachable moment. ALLEN: As you look back on that process, could you have improved upon it? Do you have any advice for the audience? CARTER: I would've done it faster because I bought the house in October, and they just got evicted last month. MARGOLIS: The squatters did a lot of damage in that time. She eventually paid a bailiff $2000 to evict them. Allen asks if it might have been better to offer them a thousand dollars to get out. That might seem like a form of extortion, but ultimately, Allen says, it's really just about being a wise investor. Jason Margolis, NPR News, Detroit.

I'm Guy Raz. We're talking about how to use and preserve finite resources on the show today, which few people in all of human history did better than MacGyver from that '80s TV show. NAVI RADJOU: MacGyver was my and remains my favorite TV action hero. RAZ: This is Navi Radjou. He's an innovation consultant and MacGyver fan. RADJOU: He will find himself in all kinds of crazy places, you know, in a prison cell, in somewhere in, you know, South America or whatever it is. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")RICHARD DEAN ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) All right, MacGyver, think - rope. . . RADJOU: And he would just look around, and he will find some resources. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) . . . A smoke alarm, sheets of plywood. RADJOU: . . . That for us doesn't look like something to create a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\")ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) It just might work. RADJOU: But he can do it. RAZ: That dude made, like, jetpacks out of toilet rolls. RADJOU: Yes, yes. I mean, what I like about this guy is that, you know, unlike James Bond, he doesn't wear a fancy suit, he doesn't have a Rolex. RAZ: James Bond had Q. MacGyver had toilet rolls. RADJOU: (Laughter) Exactly. MacGyver is like - you know, he's a one-man show. RAZ: Navi is probably such a MacGyver enthusiast because he grew up in a place where he had to be resourceful - in the city of Pondicherry, India. RADJOU: It's a very dry climate, so you don't have, you know, much water. Electricity was in short supply. For me, it's like living with less is almost like the norm. RAZ: About 18 years ago, Navi moved to Silicon Valley, and he started consulting for tech companies. And instead of being wowed by their innovation, he was baffled by how casually they were wasting basic resources. RADJOU: The one thing that struck me all the time is to see in the evenings all these office buildings being lit up. That's something I never understood is, like, you know, there's nobody working there after 6-7 p. m. , but I just see, like, it's all lit up. RAZ: The other resource Navi noticed companies squandering? Money, specifically when it came to research and development. RADJOU: Just because you invest more in R and D doesn't make a company more innovative. Maybe we need to look at a different way of innovating. RAZ: Maybe innovation, he thought, would happen in a more constrained environment. RADJOU: Because when you put a limitation on resources, you remove the limitation - right? - on creativity because necessity is the mother of invention. RAZ: Navi calls this idea frugal innovation, and he believes big tech companies could learn from inventors in the developing world. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: For the past seven years, I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R and D labs. The street is the lab. Why they do that? Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted like capital energy, and basic services like healthcare, education are also scarce in those regions. Take Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. It can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. In Africa, if you run off of your cell phone battery, don't panic. You'll find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using their bicycles. Let's go to Lima in Peru, a region with high humidity and receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An intern in college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water generating over 90 liters of water every day. That can literally create water out of thin air. In India, we call it jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, in some ways, you're more liberated when you don't have as many resources. RADJOU: I think so because I always believe that when you have nothing to lose, the sky is the limit, right? RAZ: Yeah. RADJOU: So I think that a lot of big companies after a while stop innovating and die like Kodak - right? - who missed completely the digital revolution - is because they become so risk covers. So that means they have too much to lose. So when you have too much to lose, you only take baby steps, you know, in terms of discovering new things. But when you start from the bottom, you have nothing to lose. You are like an underdog. So when you are more on the offensive, you tend to innovate. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give an example. In China, the R and D engineers of Simmons Healthcare have designed a CT scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis and yet consumes less energy, which is great for hospitals but is also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market, but now it's selling like hotcakes in U. S. and Europe where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. Ultimately, you'd like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. RAZ: So it sounds like you're proposing that we completely reimagine the way we make things. RADJOU: I would say yes, absolutely. We have to fundamentally redesign products, rethink the whole supply chain. My feeling is that what you begin to see is that companies also are now recognizing and research shows more and more there is indeed, in a way, a growing awareness among consumers around issues related to the environment. So they also expect companies to behave, you know, more environmentally responsible way. So I think it's going to happen, you know, gradually in the U. S. But when I look at Europe or Asia, I actually see a lot more aggressive moves by the governments, by citizens and by companies to actually embrace new innovation techniques that are more resource-efficient. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)RADJOU: As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States, my hope is that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to co-create frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Navi Radjou - he is the co-author of the books \"Frugal Innovation\" and \"Jugaad Innovation. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FINITE=ALRIGHT\")DAVID BYRNE: (Singing) Three-hundred fifty cities in the world. Just 30 teeth inside of our heads. These are the limits to our experience. It's scary, but it's all right. And everything is finite. RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show this week on finite resources.

RADJOU: He will find himself in all kinds of crazy places, you know, in a prison cell, in somewhere in, you know, South America or whatever it is. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\") RICHARD DEAN ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) All right, MacGyver, think - rope. . . RADJOU: And he would just look around, and he will find some resources. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\") ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) . . . A smoke alarm, sheets of plywood. RADJOU: . . . That for us doesn't look like something to create a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MACGYVER\") ANDERSON: (As MacGyver) It just might work. RADJOU: But he can do it. RAZ: That dude made, like, jetpacks out of toilet rolls. RADJOU: Yes, yes. I mean, what I like about this guy is that, you know, unlike James Bond, he doesn't wear a fancy suit, he doesn't have a Rolex. RAZ: James Bond had Q. MacGyver had toilet rolls. RADJOU: (Laughter) Exactly. MacGyver is like - you know, he's a one-man show. RAZ: Navi is probably such a MacGyver enthusiast because he grew up in a place where he had to be resourceful - in the city of Pondicherry, India. RADJOU: It's a very dry climate, so you don't have, you know, much water. Electricity was in short supply. For me, it's like living with less is almost like the norm. RAZ: About 18 years ago, Navi moved to Silicon Valley, and he started consulting for tech companies. And instead of being wowed by their innovation, he was baffled by how casually they were wasting basic resources. RADJOU: The one thing that struck me all the time is to see in the evenings all these office buildings being lit up. That's something I never understood is, like, you know, there's nobody working there after 6-7 p. m. , but I just see, like, it's all lit up. RAZ: The other resource Navi noticed companies squandering? Money, specifically when it came to research and development. RADJOU: Just because you invest more in R and D doesn't make a company more innovative. Maybe we need to look at a different way of innovating. RAZ: Maybe innovation, he thought, would happen in a more constrained environment. RADJOU: Because when you put a limitation on resources, you remove the limitation - right? - on creativity because necessity is the mother of invention. RAZ: Navi calls this idea frugal innovation, and he believes big tech companies could learn from inventors in the developing world. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) RADJOU: For the past seven years, I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me. Many of them did not go to school. They don't invent stuff in big R and D labs. The street is the lab. Why they do that? Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted like capital energy, and basic services like healthcare, education are also scarce in those regions. Take Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India. He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity. It can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days. In Africa, if you run off of your cell phone battery, don't panic. You'll find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using their bicycles. Let's go to Lima in Peru, a region with high humidity and receives only one inch of rainfall each year. An intern in college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water generating over 90 liters of water every day. That can literally create water out of thin air. In India, we call it jugaad. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, in some ways, you're more liberated when you don't have as many resources. RADJOU: I think so because I always believe that when you have nothing to lose, the sky is the limit, right? RAZ: Yeah. RADJOU: So I think that a lot of big companies after a while stop innovating and die like Kodak - right? - who missed completely the digital revolution - is because they become so risk covers. So that means they have too much to lose. So when you have too much to lose, you only take baby steps, you know, in terms of discovering new things. But when you start from the bottom, you have nothing to lose. You are like an underdog. So when you are more on the offensive, you tend to innovate. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) RADJOU: I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less. The good news is that's starting to happen. Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers. Let me give an example. In China, the R and D engineers of Simmons Healthcare have designed a CT scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers like nurses and technicians. This device can scan more patients on a daily basis and yet consumes less energy, which is great for hospitals but is also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent. This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market, but now it's selling like hotcakes in U. S. and Europe where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost. Ultimately, you'd like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity. RAZ: So it sounds like you're proposing that we completely reimagine the way we make things. RADJOU: I would say yes, absolutely. We have to fundamentally redesign products, rethink the whole supply chain. My feeling is that what you begin to see is that companies also are now recognizing and research shows more and more there is indeed, in a way, a growing awareness among consumers around issues related to the environment. So they also expect companies to behave, you know, more environmentally responsible way. So I think it's going to happen, you know, gradually in the U. S. But when I look at Europe or Asia, I actually see a lot more aggressive moves by the governments, by citizens and by companies to actually embrace new innovation techniques that are more resource-efficient. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) RADJOU: As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States, my hope is that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to co-create frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Navi Radjou - he is the co-author of the books \"Frugal Innovation\" and \"Jugaad Innovation. \" You can see his entire talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FINITE=ALRIGHT\") DAVID BYRNE: (Singing) Three-hundred fifty cities in the world. Just 30 teeth inside of our heads. These are the limits to our experience. It's scary, but it's all right. And everything is finite. RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to our show this week on finite resources.

But as Eve Abrams explains, slavery's legacy sits just below the surface. EVE ABRAMS, BYLINE: Back when cotton was king, New Orleans was its queen city. ERIN GREENWALD: And slavery and cotton go hand-in-hand. So it is a place where cotton is bought and sold and shipped to and shipped from. And the same is true of the slave trade here. ABRAMS: Historian Erin Greenwald curated an exhibit at the Historic New Orleans Collection called Purchased Lives about the domestic slave trade. Greenwald says other southern cities confined the slave trade to a single building or street. Not New Orleans. GREENWALD: New Orleans was completely saturated. ABRAMS: Enslaved people were sold in the middle of the business district. They were sold on boats, in French Quarter courtyards and in the most sumptuous room of the most luxurious hotel in the South: the St. Louis Hotel. Today, there is no plaque on the facade of that building to announce an auction block once existed there. In fact, Greenwald says, New Orleans has very few physical markers commemorating this history. GREENWALD: People's tendency is to celebrate the past. And so it's harder to get, I think, a city to want to commemorate or recognize something negative from the past. ABRAMS: Not unlike the debate happening now, the flags and symbols of the Confederacy. Slavery broke up countless families. And after it was abolished, people wanted to reunite. But they often had no idea where to start looking. Some placed ads in church-affiliated and black newspapers. GREENWALD: Some others looking for children that they haven't seen in 30 years don't even know what they look like.

Today, the country paid off some of its debt, thanks to a large loan from European officials, and banks re-opened. But as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, Greeks still face strict limits on the money they can withdraw. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Mandrakos Nikolas (ph) showed up at his bank in Athens today almost as soon as the doors opened. He wanted to deposit a check so he could pay into a retirement fund. There were so many people snaking through the lobby that the bank's computers crashed. MANDRAKOS NIKOLAS: I wait about two hours. ZARROLI: Because there's - the line is so long. NIKOLAS: The line was very big, and also a problem was that the system breaks down. ZARROLI: Another customer, Dimitra Griti (ph), made clear she's deeply tired of the turmoil in Greece right now. DIMITRA GRITI: I'm not very optimistic because the Greek, they don't want to change the mentality. This is the problem. They don't want to make the reforms. This is a big problem for me. ZARROLI: Although the banks opened as scheduled, customers can still withdrawal only 60 euros a day, but they can take out all their money once a week, so they don't need to keep returning to the ATM every day. Greek officials are anxious to prevent a run on the banks, and they're pleading with people to deposit any stray cash they have lying around the house.

To get the loan, the Greek Parliament voted to back a new round of austerity measures that include an increase in the value added tax. Papoulis Panagiotis (ph) has been running a butcher shop in Athens since 1970. The increase in VAT taxes will raise the cost of the cheeses and meats he sells by 10 percent. But he says his customers are already hurting after five years of austerity, and rather than drive them away, he's decided to absorb the cost of the taxes himself. PAPOULIS PANAGIOTIS: (Through interpreter) The VAT tax increase is going to affect people's buying power, but what's really hurting the market is people's insecurities and psychology. In order to function properly, the market needs stability and tranquility. ZARROLI: But stability still seems a long way off. Palskivis Nikitis (ph), an eye doctor who came into the butcher shop, says ordinary Greeks are going to suffer as a result of the new austerity measures. PALSKIVIS NIKITIS: What can you do?

Now there are worries those gains may be at risk. The economy is shedding jobs and heading into recession. To explore this, NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro traveled to the economic hub of Brazil, the city of Sao Paulo. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: A TV is not just a TV, at least not for 31-year-old Daniele Dos Reis. Hers is a 32-inch plasma - nice, but nothing extraordinary - but for her. . . DANIELE DOS REIS: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"I cried with joy when I got it,\" she says, \"it was as if it was the first toy I'd ever gotten in my life. \" It made her feel like she'd finally made it. REIS: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"My happiness about the TV was about seeing my children smile,\" she tells me. \"It was new. They were so proud. They told everyone about it,\" she says. She's raising three children alone. Her salary was, until recently, around $350 a month, sometimes more. She was able to get a loan to buy the TV and a washing machine. She dreamt of owning her own home. REIS: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"I even bought the material to build it,\" she says proudly. REIS: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: As she tidies up her one-bedroom rental in a poor suburb of southern Sao Paulo, Daniele Dos Reis tells me she represents a lot of the poor people in Brazil. Under previous President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva - known simply in Brazil as Lula - a commodities boom of selling soybeans and iron ore to China financed an expansion of social programs, many of which Daniele benefited from. The minimum wage was raised, which put more money in people's pockets, including hers. Credit was made more widely available so the people from the lower social classes could afford TVs and refrigerators for the first time. That meant more jobs and a period of record employment. Daniele says she had work whenever she wanted it, until now. She just got fired. REIS: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"You become unemployed from one day to the next and then you're in debt. You owe on your rent. Our dreams are dead now,\" she tells me. \"We all still have dreams, but no one believes they will come true anymore,\" she says. Brazil's economy is grinding to a halt. Inflation is rising and President Dilma Rousseff - narrowly re-elected last year - has instituted harsh austerity measures that have left supporters like Dos Reis feeling betrayed. And according to new statistics here, one million people last year returned to extreme poverty. So this is the great debate in Brazil right now - was what was touted as the Brazilian miracle only a mirage? CLAUDIO FRISCHTAK: What the government did fail was to improve in a very significant manner education, health, public safety and infrastructure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Claudio Frischtak runs an economic consulting firm in Rio de Janeiro, and he is a former World Bank official. He says what was created was not a middle class, but a working-poor consumer class of people with cellphones and televisions, but with little to keep them from slipping down the economic ladder. FRISCHTAK: Populist policies at their core, which were not sustainable, and at the end of the day, the policies which were instituted led to what we have now, which is a major economic crisis. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's only one point of view of course. Alexandre de Freitas Barbosa is an economist at the University of Sao Paulo and a self-described progressive. Brazil was one of the most unequal countries in the world and it's much less so now, he says. ALEXANDRE DE FREITAS BARBOSA: I think it did change the fundamentals. We have a sort of basic safety net. We had lots of things we achieved in the last decade. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But where economists agree is on the gloomy outlook right now. I went to visit Dilma Rousseff\u2019s one-time economics professor who's a close friend and adviser of former President Lula. We had a long chat and in the end he said this. . . LUIS BELLUZZO: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"I'm going to be 73 years old, and I've been through many periods in Brazil's history, but I've never seen one so grave,\" Luis Belluzzo tells me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: A group of men on a recent sunny morning are being taught how to make crepes from a French volunteer working with NGO Projeto Arrastao. It's located in the neighborhood of Sao Paulo where Daniele Dos Reis lives. This area has the city's highest percentage of people in debt and in default, according to government statistics. This charity provides job training and classes on how to manage finances. SELMA BERTAGNOLI: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"The neighborhood was always poor,\" administrator Selma Bertagnoli tells me. \"So there were always people wanting help, but not so many as there are now,\" she says. In 2012, they worked with, on average, 750 people a month. Now it's 1,600 to 1,800. Mainly, she says, they're seeing people who have been laid off and have no savings. The project trains them to be able to work in the informal sector so that they can get income quickly - making food, doing hair, sewing. She's not an economist, but from her perch, dealing with people on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, the view is bleak. BERTAGNOLI: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"It was an illusion,\" she says. \"It was really the illusion of being able to access a better life. It was a pseudo-ascension. Today, we are seeing the sad reality,\" she says.

So this is the great debate in Brazil right now - was what was touted as the Brazilian miracle only a mirage? CLAUDIO FRISCHTAK: What the government did fail was to improve in a very significant manner education, health, public safety and infrastructure. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Claudio Frischtak runs an economic consulting firm in Rio de Janeiro, and he is a former World Bank official. He says what was created was not a middle class, but a working-poor consumer class of people with cellphones and televisions, but with little to keep them from slipping down the economic ladder. FRISCHTAK: Populist policies at their core, which were not sustainable, and at the end of the day, the policies which were instituted led to what we have now, which is a major economic crisis. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's only one point of view of course. Alexandre de Freitas Barbosa is an economist at the University of Sao Paulo and a self-described progressive. Brazil was one of the most unequal countries in the world and it's much less so now, he says. ALEXANDRE DE FREITAS BARBOSA: I think it did change the fundamentals. We have a sort of basic safety net. We had lots of things we achieved in the last decade. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But where economists agree is on the gloomy outlook right now. I went to visit Dilma Rousseff\u2019s one-time economics professor who's a close friend and adviser of former President Lula. We had a long chat and in the end he said this. . . LUIS BELLUZZO: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"I'm going to be 73 years old, and I've been through many periods in Brazil's history, but I've never seen one so grave,\" Luis Belluzzo tells me. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: A group of men on a recent sunny morning are being taught how to make crepes from a French volunteer working with NGO Projeto Arrastao. It's located in the neighborhood of Sao Paulo where Daniele Dos Reis lives. This area has the city's highest percentage of people in debt and in default, according to government statistics. This charity provides job training and classes on how to manage finances. SELMA BERTAGNOLI: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"The neighborhood was always poor,\" administrator Selma Bertagnoli tells me. \"So there were always people wanting help, but not so many as there are now,\" she says. In 2012, they worked with, on average, 750 people a month. Now it's 1,600 to 1,800. Mainly, she says, they're seeing people who have been laid off and have no savings. The project trains them to be able to work in the informal sector so that they can get income quickly - making food, doing hair, sewing. She's not an economist, but from her perch, dealing with people on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, the view is bleak. BERTAGNOLI: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: \"It was an illusion,\" she says. \"It was really the illusion of being able to access a better life. It was a pseudo-ascension. Today, we are seeing the sad reality,\" she says.

An improving economy may be playing a big role. Leoneda Inge, of member station WUNC, sent this report. LEONEDA INGE, BYLINE: The Ridge Road swimming pool in Raleigh is packed. There are easily 200 people here competing in a swim meet, some of them as young as 5 years old. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Timers ready - swimmers take your mark. INGE: The Raleigh-Cary area is one of the top competitive swimming regions in the country, according to USA Swimming and Speedo. But that fact hasn't seemed to help bring in the number of lifeguards needed to keep all the area's pools open full time. Terri Stroupe is Raleigh's aquatics director. She realized the problem early spring. TERRI STROUPE: I was very stressed. I was like, well, what kind of alternatives can we come up with if we don't find enough lifeguards? It looks like we have about 60 days to work a miracle. INGE: Stroupe took out ads online and in newspapers and boosted starting pay by 25 cents an hour, and she still couldn't get everyone she needed. She has 150 lifeguards - 20 less than she should. So as a result, all of Raleigh's public pools close an hour earlier this summer. She has a long list of reasons why teenagers aren't signing up. Half of her applicants actually fail the swimming test, which includes treading water for two minutes with your legs. And then there is the rebounding economy. STROUPE: That didn't help either. We basically - as the economy's turned back around, there are more lucrative jobs out there. INGE: Raleigh isn't alone. Aquatics officials in Cincinnati threatened to open pools later than scheduled this summer if they couldn't find enough lifeguards. And in Glendive, Mont. , they raised paid by a dollar, up to $9. 25 an hour to bring in more lifeguards. One way the aquatics department has kept Raleigh pools running smoothly is to rely on its tried and true lifeguards, like Reba Hodge. The 23-year-old has been a lifeguard for several years and recently graduated from college. Hodge says she tries to enlist anybody she can. REBA HODGE: I've recruited my best friend and to the point where I annoyed her. Like, I've called her and said, hey, have you applied yet? Have you applied yet? And she's like, Reba, I will apply. I promise. INGE: She got the job, but organizations like the YMCA say another way to address the shortage is to start having job fairs and getting applicants who are young. Most pools require lifeguards to be at least 15 years old. Keith Guynn is standing along the fence at the Raleigh swim meet, waiting his turn at the 100-freestyle. He's 15 and has two older brothers who swam competitively and were lifeguards, but he's not completely sold. KEITH GUYNN: I think that people my age would want to be lifeguards 'cause it's a good way to go ahead and make money over the summer. And they probably wouldn't because, like me, they're kind of lazy. INGE: And to fix that problem will likely take a parent's guidance. And by the way, Keith's dad says his son will be a lifeguard next year. For NPR News, I'm Leoneda Inge in Durham, N. C.

ERIC WHITNEY, BYLINE: David Blackburn works for a financial services firm in Jersey City, N. J. He and has his wife both have six-figure incomes, but real estate in the New York City area is so expensive that they have to live kind of far from their jobs. DAVID BLACKBURN: Every day I get up and put on a suit and get on a train, and it takes about an hour door to door, in the crush of people, in the hot, in the cold. It wears on you a little bit. WHITNEY: And once he gets to the office, it's not like he really even has to be there at all. BLACKBURN: Every day I'm working with people in multiple time zones, in multiple countries. So even though I'm physically in the office, I'm essentially telecommuting to where they are. WHITNEY: Blackburn has considered asking if he could do his job from someplace less urban, someplace like Montana. GREG GIANFORTE: Montana is perfect for telecommuting because of the quality of life, because our housing prices in most communities are below the national average. WHITNEY: That's Greg Gianforte, who started a software company in Montana that created hundreds of high-paying jobs. But now he's trying to entice thousands of people who already have good jobs to bring them here and telecommute. GIANFORTE: If a small, rural town in Montana had just five or 10 people move back home, that would be five or 10 homes that either had to be purchased or built. That creates construction jobs. WHITNEY: He's just sent 18,000 glossy brochures to the alums of two universities here, inviting them to, quote, \"come home to Montana. \"GIANFORTE: It's five or 10 additional families that would enroll in the local schools, making the schools more vibrant. It'd be five or 10 families that are buying downtown. WHITNEY: Gianforte's brochures are a naked come-on to overstressed urbanites. There are pictures of mountain lakes and wildlife and Gianforte holding a fat trout he just caught. It includes a guide to getting your boss to say yes to letting you work remotely. There's even a list of telecommuting-friendly employers. Yahoo may have famously cracked down on working from home recently, but health insurance giant Anthem has fully a third of its employees working remotely. The company says that helps them attract top talent, and productivity hasn't suffered. That kind of corporate attitude is getting people excited in towns like Conrad, Mont. , population 2,600. Gianforte came here as part of a tour to pitch his campaign to local chambers of commerce. Vanessa Bucklin, an insurance broker, left with a big stack of Gianforte's brochures. VANESSA BUCKLIN: I just had a 20-year class reunion, and I'm going to mail them out with a handwritten note that said, we'd love to have you back in Conrad. WHITNEY: The come home to Montana tour isn't being warmly received by everyone. Montana's Democratic Party says it's just a thinly veiled publicity stunt before Republican Gianforte announces his candidacy for the 2016 race for governor. Gianforte says it's not but says he is considering a run for governor. Regardless of the politics, stressed-out New Jersey commuter David Blackburn says there's more to pulling up stakes than just convincing his boss to let him do it. BLACKBURN: The other part of it is that my wife also works full time, and I think we have a hard time imagining running a two-career family fully telecommuting or fully remote.

A new study out today by the Pew Charitable Trust says 80 percent of Americans carry some form of debt, from student loans to credit card balances. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports that number shows this isn't just an issue for younger people starting out. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: There are many among the so-called silent generation - those born before World War II - who are still paying off mortgages and credit cards. DIANA ELLIOTT: Silent generation people, 90 percent of whom are retired, are carrying debt later into life, so over half of them still have debt. NOGUCHI: Diana Elliott is research manager for Pew, and says the study shows that subsequent generations carry even larger burdens. Not all debt is bad, she says, but too much might limit future options. Baby boomers, for example, on average, have far more debt than their parents did at the same age. Thirteen percent of boomers are still paying off student loans either for their children or because they went back to school later in life. ELLIOTT: This raises a fundamental question about - is it helpful that boomers are carrying this debt, possibly into retirement? NOGUCHI: If that seems bad, Generation X - those born between 1965 and 1980 - are on track to be even more indebted. As a group, they've reduced their mortgage debt in recent years, but the average Gen Xer still has $88,000 in debt. And now, Elliott says, they face their own kids' college costs, which raises another question. ELLIOTT: Will they be able to propel their children in the way that they would like to? NOGUCHI: So it may seem refreshing that the younger adults, known as millennials, are on track to have less debt because fewer of them are taking on mortgages. But, Elliott says, lower debt does not necessarily mean they're better off. ELLIOTT: Around half of them have less than a thousand dollars in liquid assets. So it really suggests that these low-debt millennials are not doing as well financially as their high-debt peers. NOGUCHI: Sarah Wolff, a researcher for the Center for Responsible Lending, says one key determinant of whether a loan is good or bad often comes down to affordability. SARAH WOLFF: The report puts a heavy emphasis on just looking at the raw amount of debt, and I think that it's important to also consider the terms and conditions.

Now, in any presidential election, the health of the U. S. economy can weigh on voters' minds. One important measure, of course, is unemployment and job creation. Today, the government released new job numbers for July. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, they showed solid job growth with 215,000 new jobs added to the economy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The job's number came in pretty much where analysts had predicted. And the unemployment rate remained steady at about 5. 3 percent. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, says it was a good though not spectacular report. He says the 215,000 new jobs in July and a small upward revision in May and June suggest the economy continues to move forward at a moderate rate. One positive detail, manufacturing added 15,000 new jobs after several weak months. NARIMAN BEHRAVESH: It might be that the manufacturing industries are beginning to adjust to a stronger dollar. And having tightened their belts, they're now competitive again and may be able to engineer better growth, even in a strong dollar environment. YDSTIE: Another positive is a return to growth in hourly wages. They were up two-tenths of a percent after no growth in June. Behravesh says today's report is strong enough to support an interest rate hike by the Fed in September. BEHRAVESH: I think if the Fed is looking for reason to begin the tightening cycle, our guess is that this report provides that rationale. YDSTIE: But, he says, Fed officials who want to hold off raising rates also still have an argument. Wage growth remains sluggish and isn't adding to inflation. And price inflation is well below the 2 percent level that the Fed believes provides the best environment for growth. BEHRAVESH: This is a huge debate that's going on within the Federal Reserve system and, of course, in academia and among analysts. And I think the consensus seems to be jelling around the fact that there's no wage inflation now. But the way things are going, we could start to see wage inflation. YDSTIE: And, Behravesh says, the consensus seems to be the Fed should be preemptive and start raising interest rates before rapid wage inflation takes hold. Another reason the Fed is likely to raise rates in September, he says, is that it's been talking about doing it for so long. In fact, he says, it's the longest drumroll in Fed history.

We began with why rents are increasing so dramatically. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Well, it's pretty simple. Supply isn't keeping up with demand. Over the past year, the number of renters rose by 2 million while the number of homeowning families in the U. S. fell by 400,000. So you got more people wanting to rent, and they're not building enough rental units to accommodate that, so the rents go up. GREENE: OK, so demand is really at play here. Let's figure out why demand is going up. Why are more people choosing to rent over, say, buying a house? WESSEL: I think there are a number of things at play here. One is a lot of people were burned in the housing market over the last few years. People now realize that housing prices can go down as well as up, and that's made some of them uneasy about buying. Some of the newly-formed households - young people graduating from college are finally moving out of their parents' basements - are finding that their jobs are too low to buy houses at today's prices, even though mortgage rates are low. And it's particularly hard for first- time homebuyers and anybody who has less than a stellar credit record to get a mortgage. It's getting a little easier, but that's still a big obstacle. GREENE: You know, we've done a lot of reporting on the program about how many college grads are just buried in student debt. Is that at play here? I mean, does that really cripple a lot of younger people in terms of their ability to buy a house? WESSEL: Well, there is some evidence that millennials who have more student debt are more likely to be living with their parents rather than out on their own, whether renting or owning. And certainly anybody who's behind on their student loan payments is going to have a lousy credit record, and that's going to make it hard to get a mortgage. But economists at the New York Fed looked at this pretty closely and they find that, in general, college grads are more likely to own homes than people who didn't go to college, whether or not they have student loans. If you have a student loan debt burden, it doesn't affect so much whether you buy a house, but it does mean that you buy a little later in life. GREENE: Let me ask you about another potential factor here. I mean, there are some scholars who have suggested that there's just a different mentality these days than in the past in this country that homeownership is just not necessarily part of the American dream for more and more people. Is that part of what's happening here? WESSEL: I think homeownership remains a big and surprisingly large part of the American dream for a lot of people. A lot of people think being middle class means owning your own house. But there is a growing minority of people who say why bother? So I think there is some subtle change in that dynamic. GREENE: Well, so, David, look forward to the next few years if you can. I mean, with the forces at work that you're talking about, are rents just going to keep climbing? Are they going to hit some kind of roof at some point? WESSEL: Well, look, already we see more construction of multifamily units this year than any year since 1989. Just not enough supply is coming on quickly enough to satisfy this demand. So some of this will sort this out over time, but the trend away from homeownership is likely to last for a while. Interestingly, the Urban Institute projects that over the next 20 years, there will be 22 million more U. S. families and two-thirds of them will rent rather than own, which is a big change. GREENE: David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and also a frequent guest on our program. David, thanks as always. WESSEL: You're welcome. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Rental markets are hot in so many places, and people just don't seem as eager to own a home.

That sounds like a lot of credit card spending, and it is an increase over recent months. But the big picture is more about less, not more credit card debt. From member station WABE in Atlanta, Susanna Capelouto reports. SUSANNA CAPELOUTO, BYLINE: The Great Recession has taught Americans a valuable lesson, according to the country's top consumer watchdog. RICHARD CORDRAY: Coming out of the financial crisis, consumers have been more responsible about thinking about how to approach their credit card debt. CAPELOUTO: Richard Cordray heads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He told the Senate Banking Committee recently that Americans aren't carrying as much credit card debt as they used to. And people are getting better at paying off their credit cards each month. According to the National Federation for Credit Counseling, only about 1 in 3 households now carries credit card debt over from month to month. That's a 23 percent improvement from 2009, the peak of the recession. TRICIA LAWRENCE: I'm seeing clients with fewer credit cards. CAPELOUTO: Tricia Lawrence is a foot soldier in the war on debt. She's a veteran counselor for Clear Point, a nonprofit counseling agency. From a cubicle in downtown Atlanta, she's helped thousands of people improve their credit scores. Today, she's on the phone with a young woman who wants to get married and buy a house, but her credit rating is shot. She also owes $5,000 on her credit card. LAWRENCE: So do you give your parents any money for rent? CAPELOUTO: Lawrence still sees lots of people who are living above their means, but she's also noticed a drop in the amount of debt since the recession. LAWRENCE: It wasn't too unreasonable to speak to a client who had on average $50,000 or more in debt whereas now maybe the client has about $15,000, maybe $30,000 worth of debt. CAPELOUTO: The recession has changed the mindset of many Americans, and we just don't shop like we used to, says Tom Smith, who teaches finance at Emory University. TOM SMITH: You know, there is sort of a new level of consumers that are rethinking the priority of purchases, and, I mean, the flipside of that would be that retail associations would see much smaller activity. CAPELOUTO: That could be one reason the National Retail Federation isn't seeing the growth it expected this far out from the recession. The group recently lowered its sales growth forecast for this year to just 3. 5 percent, down from an earlier projection of 4. 1 percent annual growth. ELIZA: I don't want these. I want the paint. CAPELOUTO: Back-to-school shopping has always been a good mid-year boost for retailers, but even there, a back-to-school survey by Deloitte finds that people still have supplies stocked away and plan to spend a little less than they did last year. One of those is Joanne Santivasci, who is shopping for her kids Eliza and Jack at a store in Atlanta. JOANNE SANTIVASCI: This year, you know, we're reusing some backpacks and lunch boxes and. . . ELIZA: Momma, I want to get a new lunch box. SANTIVASCI: I know you want new ones. Well, everything is so attractive because of all the characters. Everything looks like toys. CAPELOUTO: Credit counselors will tell you that keeping those impulse buys in check is key to financial health. With the recession still in America's collective memory, retailers may have to wait a few years for the rebirth of the big spenders. For NPR News, I'm Susanna Capelouto in Atlanta.

In the U. S. , the major stock indexes fell sharply early on but recovered later in the day. As NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, China's moves are fueling fears that the global economy is more fragile than it appears. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: For a long time, U. S. and European companies have looked at China as a vast opportunity waiting to be tapped. Auto companies, drug makers and purveyors of luxury goods have all made big strides in the Chinese market, and they have hoped to do even better as time goes on. Sara Johnson, senior research director for global economics at IHS, says now a lot of investors are wondering whether China still enjoys such high-growth, and they're beginning to reassess their hopes for the market. SARA JOHNSON: They're afraid that they underlying situation in China is worse than reported, and that certainly is a legitimate concern. ZARROLI: The yuan has fallen about 3-and-a-half percent over the last two days. China's devaluation means Chinese goods will be cheaper, which means more competition for U. S. manufacturers. It also suggests the Chinese market may not be as lucrative as they believed - again, Sara Johnson. JOHNSON: To the extent that China's demand is weaker than reported, it affects commodity markets. It affects trade or export growth for other key economies. ZARROLI: Companies that do a lot of business in China like Apple and Yum! Brands have been among the hardest hit in the markets. Dave Rousse heads INDA, a trade group representing the nonwoven fibers industry. He says the companies he represents are having to compete with Chinese producers for some low-cost items. DAVE ROUSSE: There's some international trade. We've had an increase in imports from China on some very low-costing commodity-type fabrics, but we export to China as well. ZARROLI: Rousse says his members export some high-value specialty fibers that China doesn't make. As the yuan drops in value, those products will bring in less revenue. ROUSSE: If there's no change in trade flows and in volumes, it will be an impact on financial statements when you translate the currency from China into U. S. dollars. ZARROLI: But the devaluation poses an even bigger risk to many Asian economies, such as South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand. When the yuan was strong, they were able to sell a lot of their products there. But just like U. S. companies, they now face much tougher competition. The difference is that China is a much bigger market for them than it is for U. S. companies. Forty percent of South Korea's exports go to China. Economist Sung Won Sohn teaches at California State University Channel Islands. SUNG WON SOHN: Asians are very, very worried because China, from economic point of view, is far more important to them than it is to the United States. ZARROLI: The question now is how far China will go. Devaluation means that China's goods are less costly around the world, and that will keep more of its factories running. But it could also accelerate the flight of money out of the country, something China is anxious to avoid. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

That's less than half last year's price. Consumers in much of the country are benefiting, but not all, and we'll get to that in a moment. The downside of low prices also means tough times for oil companies and their workers. Mose Buchele of member station KUT reports from a south Texas town where nearly everyone is feeling the pain of low oil prices. MOSE BUCHELE, BYLINE: Carlos Garcia grew up in the south Texas oils fields in a small town called Alice, Texas. He was raised with the ups and downs of the oil business. CARLOS GARCIA: My dad was a roughneck himself. He was a driller years back in the '80s. BUCHELE: That was during the last big Texas boom. The bus came to Alice around '83. The reasons were the same as today. Oil wasn't worth the cost of drilling for it. GARCIA: And when it did hit rock-bottom back then, we lost out. My dad lost his home he had just built, and I lived through it. BUCHELE: Eventually, things picked back up. Garcia followed in his dad's footsteps. He worked on oil derricks and did well. But that was up until last year when prices dropped. He lost his job. He lost his truck. He says he's going to lose his car next. GARCIA: I'm looking for a little work. My wife is working a part-time job. It ain't making the bill, you know? BUCHELE: So he's got to scrimp and save. GARCIA: Pinch every penny we've got, and we'll just eat here and eat at my mom's. BUCHELE: When he says eat here, he's talking about the Alice Food Pantry, a local charity. It's a busy operation off the old Main Street. Volunteers push creaky carts of canned goods, bread and tortillas from a small warehouse to cars waiting in the alley. Bonnie Whitley runs the place. She's seeing more people like Garcia here - first-time visitors. BONNIE WHITLEY: Men come in, which is very unusual. Usually the women come in. BUCHELE: She thinks they need more than free food. WHITLEY: A lot of people are in depression right now and in denial. They just - they can't come to grips with what's happened. TANYA HINOJOSA: My name is Tanya Hinojosa, and I'm a waitress. I've been serving tables for the past 15 years. BUCHELE: You remember Carlos Garcia said his family's been eating in? So have a lot of families. Hinojosa used to pull in $65 to $100 a day in tips. Now, she's sometimes clearing just 25 bucks, so she biked to the Pantry for some food. HINOJOSA: I have never, ever made $25 in a day. It's always been more than that. BUCHELE: She and her kids have moved in with her mom, and she's scrimping in other ways. HINOJOSA: We try to buy $5 shirts for school, pants, minimum shoes - $30. No more $80 shoes. No more excessive spending. BUCHELE: And that's hurting people like Lidia Escobar. I met her at her family-owned children's clothing store down the street. LIDIA ESCOBAR: It feels like a ghost town. You can tell people are just - don't have jobs right now and the extra money to spend on stuff. BUCHELE: It was the same at a paint store and a car dealership. Able Perez owns a frozen yogurt shop.

Yesterday, we saw what could be the beginning of the end for the Greek financial crisis. And in China, the government devalued its currency, the yuan, three days in a row. For help sorting out the econ hullabaloo, we called up global macroeconomist Dambisa Moyo. I asked her what the Chinese currency devaluation means. DAMBISA MOYO: So when the economy devalues its currency, it makes it much easier, much more affordable for people outside their economy to buy their goods. So in other words, it becomes cheaper to buy Chinese goods. Over the last 20 years, China's growth story has really been one of them exporting a lot of goods into the United States but also to the rest of the world. So with the slowdown of the economic growth and with the U. S. consumers but also many European households becoming more constrained economically because they don't have, you know, jobs and therefore their incomes are lower, the Chinese government is trying to encourage people to buy more Chinese goods. And therefore, that's why the devaluation has occurred. VIGELAND: Aside from Chinese goods becoming cheaper here in the U. S. , are there any other effects that everyday Americans might notice from the devaluation of the yuan? MOYO: Yes. I mean, I think that the most important thing is that these currencies are traded on a relative basis. So the fact that the Chinese currency becomes weaker necessarily means that the U. S. currency becomes stronger, which puts a lot of pressure on U. S. exporters because people around the world will look at the U. S. products and say, they're much more expensive; we might as well buy the same product or similar products from China. VIGELAND: Well, and also, hasn't there just been just a lot of Chinese money flooding into the U. S. ? I mean, even here, just in Southern California, that's where all the rise in property prices has come from, is just Chinese investors handing out cash for houses. MOYO: Yes. I mean, it's certainly the case that China has been a very influential player not just in property, but the United States government does rely on China as its second-largest lender. And I think that it's very important that we do understand that we are linked. And whether it's through trade or investment or even just pure borrowing, we're definitely interconnected. VIGELAND: Let's move on to Greece. Eurozone finance ministers agreed to a third bailout on Friday - \u20ac86 billion - Greece, of course, in the spotlight for several months now. Does this signal an end to the drama, or does it just postpone the inevitable, which would be potentially getting booted from the EU? MOYO: I don't think that Greece will get, quote, unquote, \"booted\" from the EU. I think that there's a fundamental shift in the way we should view the relationship between the troika, which is the European Union, the IMF and the ECB - the European Central Bank. Those three together are called the troika. In the past, Greece has been an equal peer in the European Union. What has emerged is that actually, the relationship between the troika and the Greek authorities is one in which - it's quite symbiotic. The Greeks need to stay in the European Union because they need to continue to receive money to support their economy. But at the same time, the troika need Greece to stay in as well because obviously, they don't want to encourage other countries in the European Union to think that it's OK to behave badly and to, you know, accrue enormous debts as Greece has. VIGELAND: So I guess the question is whether we'll be just back in this same spot, you know, three years from now or sooner. MOYO: Yes. I do believe we will. A lot of the risk is now with the European Central Bank. And they wanted to make sure that they would minimize the impact for the average citizen around the world. But it also, to me, suggests that we are going to be stuck in this rut for many years to come. VIGELAND: Economist Dambisa Moyo, thank you for joining us. MOYO: Thank you.

China's central bank surprisingly pushed down the value of Chinese currency last week. That came after China's stock market abruptly collapsed. David Wessel has been tracking all of this. He's director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal as well as a regular guest on this program. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What makes it such a big deal when China alters its currency exchange rate? WESSEL: Well, look, China is now a huge economy. By some measure that economists used to compare countries, it's now as big as the U. S. So basically, what happens in China doesn't stay in China. When its economy slows down, as it has, its thirst for commodities is reduced, and that's pulled down the prices of everything from copper to gasoline. It's good for American consumers, bad for Africans and Latins who export these stuff. And so when the value of any currency decline - and the Chinese currency has lost about 3 percent last week, which is a lot - its exports become cheaper and that gives their exporters an edge over competitors in other country. INSKEEP: OK, so Chinese-made toys or electronics or anything just got a little bit cheaper in the United States. Is China just trying to boost exports and prop up its economy? WESSEL: Maybe. I mean, depreciation in the currency certainly has that effect, and it comes at a time when we know Chinese leaders are alarmed that their economy may be slowing faster than they had anticipated. And if the central bank continues this way - and it hasn't today - that will lead people to believe that this is just an export-boosting maneuver. But there is an alternative explanation. The Chinese are very eager for their currency to be blessed by the International Monetary Fund as an international benchmark currency. And to that end, the IMF has actually been pressing China to loosen the government's control over the exchange rate, let market forces move it around a bit. So some analysts say that actually was the primary motive for last week's move, although it was very clumsy if that was the idea. But the IMF has called it, quote, \"a welcome step. \" And, of course, these two things could both be true. It does make the market a little more of a force in moving the currency, but it has the beneficial effect of boosting exports. INSKEEP: Well, it's interesting, our colleague Jim Zarroli's been reporting on this as well, this possibility that China is trying to improve the credibility of its currency. China's been accused of being a currency manipulator by any number of American politicians. What does it mean to the United States that they let the currency float a little bit here but what they're actually doing is cheapening their exports to the United States? WESSEL: Well, I mean, there will be some in Congress who say this is just another example of currency manipulation. But if you look around the world right now - China, the slow-down in other emerging markets, Japan and Europe - the U. S. economy is a standout. We finally have some home-grown momentum here; unemployment is down, hiring is up, consumer spending has picked up a bit. So that's why the Fed has said that the economy no longer needs short-term interest rates at zero - where they've been since 2008. And it plans to raise them before the end of this year, perhaps as soon as mid-September. But the Fed has also said that the timing of this move depends on what it calls international developments. So if China's currency and stock market moves are sent - and that the global economy is slowing down a lot, or if all this turmoil around the world sharply raises the value of the U. S. dollar against all other currencies, well, that could lead the Fed to hold off on that much-anticipated rate hike.

This points to big problems that remain in the housing market despite its recovery since the Great Recession. NPR's Joel Rose reports from New Jersey, which has the highest abandoned foreclosure rate of any state. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Michael McCabe knows what it's like to be surrounded by zombies - zombie houses, that is. MICHAEL MCCABE: This one up the road here, nobody has been in this house probably for about seven or eight years. ROSE: McCabe drives me around his neighborhood in Woodbury Heights, N. J. He points out which houses are in foreclosure and which ones are so-called zombies - homes that have been abandoned by their former owners, but are still stuck somewhere in the foreclosure process. That includes the house next door to his own in this middle-class suburb of Philadelphia and now the one behind it, too. MICHAEL MCCABE: We don't know what's going to happen. We're kind of prepping because a gentleman who was there who rented came and told us I'm just letting you know, I'm moving. That means the grass isn't going to get cut by me, and the house is in foreclosure. ROSE: It would join roughly 17,000 zombie foreclosures in the state. That's according to a report released in June by the company RealtyTrac. The same report says the number of zombie homes nationwide is actually declining as the housing market improves, but not in New Jersey. And New York is nearly as bad. DAREN BLOMQUIST: Those are the states with the two absolute longest foreclosure processes in the country. ROSE: Daren Blomquist at RealtyTrac says the average foreclosure in New York and New Jersey takes about three years to complete, partly, says Blomquist, because those states have been aggressive about trying to prevent improper foreclosures. BLOMQUIST: The unintended consequence is that we see an even longer protracted foreclosure process in those states. ROSE: That process can take so long that many homeowners just walk away. Chad Bruner is the administrator of Gloucester County, N. J. He says local officials have a tough time getting even the most basic information from banks about these abandoned houses. CHAD BRUNER: They call, and then, no, we don't own that property. And then they call someone else, and they get referred to someone else. ROSE: So this summer, Bruner commissioned an outside company to track all the abandoned foreclosures in the county. That's supposed to help local towns make sure these houses don't become an eyesore and a hassle for the neighbors. In Woodbury Heights, Michael and Maureen McCabe are skeptical. And you might be too if your neighbor's house had been sitting empty for seven years. MAUREEN MCCABE: It freaks me out. I don't know if there are animals running around in there - mice and rodents. I don't know. ROSE: McCabe walks through the yard of the house next door, a two-story Cape Cod that's gradually falling apart. McCabe says it's hard to look at a zombie house like this every day and think about what it means for the neighborhood. MAUREEN MCCABE: I love my home. I love this town. I wouldn't want to sell. And if I had to sell, I know I wouldn't get the value of what it's really worth. ROSE: McCabe says her neighbor's house used to be beautiful. Now it's hard to imagine anyone buying it at any price.

To put that in perspective, back in 2008, it was over $140 a barrel. Well, if oil is the lifeblood of the economy, then when, if ever, will the price decline flow down through the economy's capillaries into stores and supermarkets and household budgets? Well, Jason Bordoff, the director of Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy, has written about the causes and consequences of declines in the price of oil, and he joins us now. Professor Bordoff, welcome to the program. JASON BORDOFF: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: Gasoline prices are low, but should we also expect, say, airline tickets to get cheaper because the price of oil is so low? BORDOFF: Well, airline tickets in particular are notoriously sticky. They tend to go up much faster than they come down. Airlines also hedge their prices. They buy fuel in advance at a fixed-price. So the price decline has not been as steep for airlines as it has for consumers at the gasoline pump. But we will see the oil price decline translate into lots of other savings for consumers, not just obviously at the pump, which is the most obvious, but agriculture is quite energy intensive, so we should expect food prices to come down. And, you know, we should remember, for example, in the Northeast, a lot of people still use heating oil to heat their homes in the winter. As we head into the winter months, that's extra money in their pockets. SIEGEL: But so much in our country is transported by truck - you mentioned food. I mean, should we expect chickens and the refrigerators that we put the chickens in to all be cheaper sometime this year? BORDOFF: Yeah, as you said, I mean, so much of our economy depends on the price of energy, and as oil and gas prices decline, that's going to help manufacturing. That's going to help the petrochemical sector, and all those prices trickle down to consumers. There's some lag, it takes time, but this will mean lower prices for consumers for all sorts of goods and services. And then most especially just economic stimulus - a tax cut, money in their pockets in terms of reduced spending at the pump. SIEGEL: Could Saudi Arabia, if it chose to pump less oil, send the price right back up or is there something about the world market right now that would hold it down? BORDOFF: They certainly could. They'd have to cut production a lot, you know, somewhere around 2 million or more barrels per day. But to the extent you pull supply off the market, you'd certainly push prices back up - not back up over $100 where the prices were last year and for a few years before that, but it would go back up. The causes of the oil price decline so far have been partly driven by a weakness in demand. We saw very bad manufacturing numbers, for example, come out of China just today. And then on the supply side, the Saudis are pumping at a very high level. The United States continues to produce a lot of oil, even at a low price, more so than people thought we could in the shale space. And then we have a nuclear deal with Iran, so Iran will be pumping more oil soon. Russia, Iraq - all these countries have increased production, not reduced it, even with a lower price. SIEGEL: In terms of the U. S. economy and its growth and recovery, are low oil prices good or are oil prices that are too low bad? What would you say? BORDOFF: Well, on that, low oil prices are a boost to the U. S. economy. They're like economic stimulus, a tax cut that puts money in people's pocket. We haven't seen consumers spend the savings from gasoline as much as some people might have thought - maybe because they're nervous about the future of the economy. They're saving a lot more of that money, not spending it. And it's also less of a positive today than it would've been, say, five or six years ago because the U. S. is such a larger producer of oil that the low prices are good news for most people, but, you know, if you're in an oil-producing state like Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma - those states have gotten hit particularly hard by reduced spending in the oil sector. SIEGEL: As you say, some states in the U. S. are oil producers and therefore they are hurt by low oil prices. Globally, the Saudis seem to be able to afford to keep on pumping a lot of oil at a lower price per barrel. Which countries are likely to be most harmed by this? BORDOFF: Well, even the Saudis have been harmed in the sense that they've had to issue bonds, raise debt and dig deeply into their savings. They just have a lot of savings to draw on for several years. Countries - major oil exporters - have all been hurt, and the ones that were in precarious political and financial situations before - notably Venezuela or Nigeria - those countries have been hurt particularly hard. And the risk of, you know, real political instability or crises emerging there economically are - is very real. SIEGEL: Professor Bordoff, thanks for talking with us today.

BORDOFF: Well, airline tickets in particular are notoriously sticky. They tend to go up much faster than they come down. Airlines also hedge their prices. They buy fuel in advance at a fixed-price. So the price decline has not been as steep for airlines as it has for consumers at the gasoline pump. But we will see the oil price decline translate into lots of other savings for consumers, not just obviously at the pump, which is the most obvious, but agriculture is quite energy intensive, so we should expect food prices to come down. And, you know, we should remember, for example, in the Northeast, a lot of people still use heating oil to heat their homes in the winter. As we head into the winter months, that's extra money in their pockets. SIEGEL: But so much in our country is transported by truck - you mentioned food. I mean, should we expect chickens and the refrigerators that we put the chickens in to all be cheaper sometime this year? BORDOFF: Yeah, as you said, I mean, so much of our economy depends on the price of energy, and as oil and gas prices decline, that's going to help manufacturing. That's going to help the petrochemical sector, and all those prices trickle down to consumers. There's some lag, it takes time, but this will mean lower prices for consumers for all sorts of goods and services. And then most especially just economic stimulus - a tax cut, money in their pockets in terms of reduced spending at the pump. SIEGEL: Could Saudi Arabia, if it chose to pump less oil, send the price right back up or is there something about the world market right now that would hold it down? BORDOFF: They certainly could. They'd have to cut production a lot, you know, somewhere around 2 million or more barrels per day. But to the extent you pull supply off the market, you'd certainly push prices back up - not back up over $100 where the prices were last year and for a few years before that, but it would go back up. The causes of the oil price decline so far have been partly driven by a weakness in demand. We saw very bad manufacturing numbers, for example, come out of China just today. And then on the supply side, the Saudis are pumping at a very high level. The United States continues to produce a lot of oil, even at a low price, more so than people thought we could in the shale space. And then we have a nuclear deal with Iran, so Iran will be pumping more oil soon. Russia, Iraq - all these countries have increased production, not reduced it, even with a lower price. SIEGEL: In terms of the U. S. economy and its growth and recovery, are low oil prices good or are oil prices that are too low bad? What would you say? BORDOFF: Well, on that, low oil prices are a boost to the U. S. economy. They're like economic stimulus, a tax cut that puts money in people's pocket. We haven't seen consumers spend the savings from gasoline as much as some people might have thought - maybe because they're nervous about the future of the economy. They're saving a lot more of that money, not spending it. And it's also less of a positive today than it would've been, say, five or six years ago because the U. S. is such a larger producer of oil that the low prices are good news for most people, but, you know, if you're in an oil-producing state like Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma - those states have gotten hit particularly hard by reduced spending in the oil sector. SIEGEL: As you say, some states in the U. S. are oil producers and therefore they are hurt by low oil prices. Globally, the Saudis seem to be able to afford to keep on pumping a lot of oil at a lower price per barrel. Which countries are likely to be most harmed by this? BORDOFF: Well, even the Saudis have been harmed in the sense that they've had to issue bonds, raise debt and dig deeply into their savings. They just have a lot of savings to draw on for several years. Countries - major oil exporters - have all been hurt, and the ones that were in precarious political and financial situations before - notably Venezuela or Nigeria - those countries have been hurt particularly hard. And the risk of, you know, real political instability or crises emerging there economically are - is very real. SIEGEL: Professor Bordoff, thanks for talking with us today.

Today was anything but. It was brutal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 3 percent, finishing its worst week since 2011. Markets in Asia and Europe also plummeted this week. All of this follows China's decision to devalue its currency, which was taken as evidence that that country's economy is losing momentum. NPR's Jim Zarroli joins me now. And, Jim, stocks were down the entire week. Today, things got even worse. What happened? JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Yeah, it was bloody. I mean, it was - the day started out bad. It only got worse. This was actually the biggest one-day drop since November 2011. The market is now in what we call correction territory. The Dow has fallen more than 10 percent from its all-time high, which was just on May 19. And stocks were down everywhere - Japan, Hong Kong, London, Frankfurt. They were down everywhere. SIEGEL: How much of this is attributed to the decision by China's central bank that I mentioned - the decision to devalue? ZARROLI: You know, I think it's safe to say that there are a lot of doubts right now about how strong the Chinese economy really is. I mean, we are used to thinking of China as this big growth success story. And it still is that, but the growth has been slowing. And China's government doesn't really seem like it knows what to do about it. It goes from one policy to another and none of these seem to be really effective. And then meanwhile, there are all these disturbing signs that things might actually be worse than we thought they were. I mean, today for instance, there was another report that the manufacturing sector in China is weaker than expected. So it gets investors worried. SIEGEL: Well, how is the devaluation of the currency in China meant to address those concerns? ZARROLI: I - well, I think one of the things that China was looking for, I think it was hoping to make its products more competitive, which means more of its factories will operate, more people are employed. The problem is that this hurts manufacturers in other countries. It hurts the United States' manufacturers, but also those in a lot of Asian countries like South Korea and Thailand and Indonesia. China is a much bigger part of, you know, proportionately to their economy than it is to ours. And they're tempted to devalue their own currencies, too, so their products stay cheap. We saw this in Kazakhstan. We saw this in Vietnam over the past few days, and others are going to follow because the thing is it isn't just China that is seeing a slowdown. A lot of other big countries are worried about growth, including some really big ones, like Russia and Brazil. I mean, compared to the rest of the world, the United States is still actually doing OK. SIEGEL: Well - but if the slowdown that you describe is so widespread and happening in so many countries, how worried should investors be over a week like this one? ZARROLI: Well, you know, the market has fallen a lot right now. I think you would say it's been a rout. It's lost a lot of ground. But you have to say that that does happen sometimes. And it's important to remember that, you know, for the most part, the stock market has done really well in recent years. If you put money in it in, you know, five years ago, you would've made a lot of money over time. And the other thing is, you know, there are silver linings to this, and one of them has to do with oil prices, you know, because there's all this fear about where the global economy is going and what's going to happen with Russia and what's going to happen with China. We've see oil prices falling quite a bit. They've actually dipped below $40 a barrel today, which is a really sizable fall from where they were. You know, and if you're in the oil business, that's not good. You're going to lose money, but for the rest of us, it's very good.  It means lower gasoline prices. It means lower energy prices and lower, you know, could extend to things like airplane tickets. SIEGEL: OK, Jim, thank you. ZARROLI: You're welcome.

It was the largest point loss ever during a trading day. When the markets closed, things were at a slightly less scary point. The Dow ended the day down 588 points. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  No matter what, if you're lucky enough to have a retirement account, this was not a fun day to check the balance. The volatility comes after the Chinese government started taking some extreme steps to stabilize its markets - steps that haven't helped much. We're going to start this hour by asking what this means for you and your retirement. We'll put those questions to David Kotok. He's chairman and chief investment officer for Cumberland Advisors. Welcome to the program. DAVID KOTOK: Well, thank you very much. It's nice to be with you, although we certainly picked a volatile day to do it. CORNISH: What kind of phone calls are you getting? How worried are your clients? KOTOK: They're concerned. Why is this happening? Is this going to start a bear market? How serious is it? What's the Federal Reserve going to do? Could China be the reason behind this? Lots of questions. CORNISH: Did you have people calling you, saying sell? KOTOK: I had two clients today, early this morning, direct us to liquidate their accounts, and they were panicked. And they ended up selling early this morning when the stock market was off a thousand points on the Dow Jones. I think it was a mistake. I don't think it's wise to panic. But they were panicked, and they took over, decided to liquidate and exit the stock market. CORNISH: Even if you didn't panic today, should people feel reassured that things bounced back later in the afternoon, or is this market just a lot more risky than thought? KOTOK: The market is going through a corrective process. It's about time. No markets go straight up. So in this case, correction is warranted. Things have changed. There's a risk premium in the market, and it's returning to the market. It doesn't mean the bull market is over. I don't believe it is. I think we're in a long-term bull market that'll go on for several more years. CORNISH: So given what you've told us, what does this mean for retirement funds, for people who are looking at their retirement funds today? KOTOK: People looking at retirement funds have to realize, I think, the best result for them is full, worldwide diversification of their risk, not concentrate in emerging markets, but to be everywhere, own pieces of many things. It's a sound principle. It's been around a long time. Diversification of risk works best. CORNISH: And is that something that, you know, the typical person can kind of look at what their mutual fund is dipping into and make requests, make corrections? KOTOK: People can look at the asset holdings of a mutual fund. If they don't like what they see, they should sell it and switch. The fact is the mutual fund reflects only what's inside of it, and there's transparency if someone's willing to do the research. We strongly recommend that investing requires knowledge and understanding. And if you don't know it, don't see it, don't go there. CORNISH: That's David Kotok.

Erratic, unsettled and capricious all work to describe this day in the market. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Stock prices took a beating. For the first time ever during a single trading day, the Dow fell more than a thousand points - 1,089, to be exact. It rebounded to close down nearly 600 points. That's 3-and-a-half percent. Just ahead, economist Austan Goolsbee takes your questions about whether to be worried or whether to buy stocks. CORNISH: First, NPR's Jim Zarroli is on the line from New York to talk more. Welcome, Jim. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hi. CORNISH: So remind us exactly what happened when the market opened. ZARROLI: It was a very scary morning, I mean, because stocks were down all over the world. They were down in Europe, especially Germany. They were down a huge amount in China, which has been, as you know, the epicenter of all the concern about the economy right now. The main Shanghai stock index fell 8-and-a-half percent. Things looked so bad that the New York Stock Exchange invoked something called Rule 48, which basically allows it to take certain steps to reduce volatility - very rarely used. But even without, the market just plunged as soon as it opened. It was the largest intraday point drop ever. Then it recovered for a while, looked like it wouldn't be such a bad day. Then in the last couple of hours, the market lost more ground. And you ended up with losses that were still pretty sizable. CORNISH: Jim, so much of the anxiety about the economy has been tied to China, really, the last couple days, right? I mean, how are. . . ZARROLI: Right. CORNISH: . . . Chinese officials reacting to the plunge in stock prices happening? ZARROLI: Well, yeah. There's been just a lot of worry that China's economy is weaker than expected. That will hurt, for instance, companies that sell commodities and finished goods to China. China's a huge economy, so the potential for damages is huge too. And people have been waiting to see what the government would do. There was a story in The Wall Street Journal today saying China was going to flood the bank - its banking system with money, which makes it easier to borrow, which, you know, keeps Chinese companies hiring and buying and manufacturing and staying as active as possible. There are risks to doing that. It's not clear whether this will be enough to prevent what's going on. You know, the Chinese economy - Chinese government plays a big hand in managing its economy, much more so than governments in the West do. It's been trying to intervene to keep its stock market from falling. But the results, you know - they just haven't been very successful. CORNISH: But looking forward, how are the troubles in China likely to affect the economy here further in the United States? ZARROLI: Well, one of the things it will do is - could do is affect interest rates. The Fed has been hinting for a long time it was going to raise interest rates sometime this year. You know, now we have this kind of shadow falling over the world economy. And that's - that could have some - a real effect on the U. S. economy. So I think some Fed officials, at least, you know, have to be looking at this and wondering what - how - whether they should change their plans, whether this is really the right time to be thinking about raising interest rates. CORNISH: That's NPR's Jim Zarroli in New York. Jim, thank you. ZARROLI: You're welcome. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   This is the kind of day when a thesaurus is handy to look up other ways to say volatile.

There was a story in The Wall Street Journal today saying China was going to flood the bank - its banking system with money, which makes it easier to borrow, which, you know, keeps Chinese companies hiring and buying and manufacturing and staying as active as possible. There are risks to doing that. It's not clear whether this will be enough to prevent what's going on. You know, the Chinese economy - Chinese government plays a big hand in managing its economy, much more so than governments in the West do. It's been trying to intervene to keep its stock market from falling. But the results, you know - they just haven't been very successful. CORNISH: But looking forward, how are the troubles in China likely to affect the economy here further in the United States? ZARROLI: Well, one of the things it will do is - could do is affect interest rates. The Fed has been hinting for a long time it was going to raise interest rates sometime this year. You know, now we have this kind of shadow falling over the world economy. And that's - that could have some - a real effect on the U. S. economy. So I think some Fed officials, at least, you know, have to be looking at this and wondering what - how - whether they should change their plans, whether this is really the right time to be thinking about raising interest rates.

ARNOLD: That's Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ZANDI: They're now at this historic point in time, and now this happens. ARNOLD: Zandi explains that the Fed has had interest rates down near zero since 2008. ZANDI: Zero interest rates have never happened. The Fed's never had to push rates this low. ARNOLD: The Fed's been doing that, of course, to try to help boost the economy. Low interest rates make it easier to buy a house or a car or even build a factory or an office building. But the Fed doesn't want to stay in crisis mode forever if it doesn't have to.

ARNOLD: In other words, the Fed can't react to every correction in the stock market, but if there's some fundamental slowing of the world economy, then maybe the Fed should wait. Larry Summers definitely sees a fundamental change. He says we're in a new normal, where the Fed needs to keep interest rates near zero, perhaps for another decade, but Mark Zandi disagrees. ZANDI: No. I mean, look, we're creating 200,000-plus jobs per month, and we've been doing that for almost three years. The U. S. economy feels quite strong to me. You know, you don't want zero interest rates for too long. ARNOLD: Either way, in September, the Federal Reserve will decide whether it's time to reset the sales on the U.

We got a lot of great questions, and joining us to answer some of them is Austan Goolsbee. He chaired the Council of Economic Advisers earlier in the Obama administration, and he's now at the University of Chicago. Welcome to the program. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Hey. Thanks for having me back. SHAPIRO: Let's start really simple. We got a question from Michelle Tevelow Grybowski, who asks, should I panic? GOOLSBEE: Michelle, no. When's the right time to panic - never. You will regret the decisions you made in the panic when you come back and say, oh, man, I wish I hadn't sold when everything was at the bottom or even worse. So if it were up to me, I would tell you, do not, under any circumstances, go try to cash out your retirement account at a penalty because you're afraid the stock market's going to go down. That's the kind of panic-induced thinking that you will very likely regret. SHAPIRO: Well, here's a perhaps counterintuitive question from Ann Feigl Johnston. She asks, what should we be buying? GOOLSBEE: You got to like that there's people like Ann out in the world. That's what stabilizes the world and we think, over the longer term, can get it closer to fundamentals, is that if stuff goes down a lot, there are a bunch of people who are like, wait a minute; if things are down, it's probably cheap; I'm going to go in here and start buying. And that can break the back of a panic. You know, economists tend to not be stock pickers or asset. . . SHAPIRO: (Laughter). You're not going to tell her what to buy. GOOLSBEE: We just buy everything. I'm not going to tell - you know, they - we buy the market by - try to diversify as much as you can. I would be careful for Ann jumping too quickly back into buying up emerging-market stocks or any of the stuff that's really getting hit the hardest. In China, many people thought they were in a bubble. The prices start going down quite significantly. The government just starts intervening and buying up stocks and telling people, nothing to look at here; we're not slowing down faster than we said before; just pay no attention to what's happening. And as the government buys up the stocks, you just can't tell. The market's trying to tell them they don't think this stuff is worth what it was three months ago, but they don't want to take that pricing. So until you know, A, what is the real situation and let's get some information content back in these prices - and the other thing to think about is, in some of these situations, the government has, in the past, said they wouldn't have a problem - there wouldn't be a bubble, and now a lot of their credibility is kind of in jeopardy. SHAPIRO: Austan, we have a question here from Helen Bentz Ferguson, who asks, why should the average person even care about the stock market? I have no extra money to put in stocks. Neither do most of the people I know. We're just trying to pay our bills, she says. So Austan, why should somebody like Helen care? GOOLSBEE: Well, you know, maybe Helen shouldn't care. And even maybe people who are in the stock market should care less than they probably care as they look at the TV and that line is just going down and down, and they're like, oh, my goodness, this is 2008 all over again. I think not getting too worked up about gyrations in the stock market - not only is it not a bad idea. It's probably a good idea not to get worked up about that. And if you have less ownership of the stock market, like it sounds like Helen has, that's even more reason not to really get worked up. SHAPIRO: You said people might look at the television screen and see that line sinking and think this is 2008 all over again. Can you assure people that it's not 2008 all over again? GOOLSBEE: OK. I'm not in the assurance business. Economists can't even agree on predictions of things that already happened. So never make predictions of the future. But there are several things that at least make me feel better now than I felt in the fall of 2008. The first is, the root of this crisis is not events happening in the United States. Number two, there's, in the U. S. , way less borrowing involved in this. It's just an equity bubble. It's just things moving around with stock prices. And we have seen, really, over and over throughout the world, if it's just an equity bubble popping, it's bad for the people who own those shares that are going down. But the destroying of banks leading to credit crunch and the what the economists call systemic events largely don't happen just from equity bubbles. You've got to have a lot of borrowing for that to happen. Then I'd say the other thing is that the economy has been going modestly well for a long steady period of time. We haven't been in an environment of a whole lot of volatility on the real side, so hopefully that's a little better than it was in 2008.

The Dow has recovered a bit, but it's gyrating wildly. This after a drop of more than 500 points on Friday. All this happens amid concerns about China's economy and possibly, as we'll hear, something more. The market has rarely been so volatile in recent years, though there was a time during the financial crisis and after when this kind of movement was normal. David Wessel talked us through the crisis back then. He's with us now at an airport. Good morning, David. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How scared should we be? WESSEL: Well, this is a little scary. This is a pretty big blip. Last week was the worst week that Dow Jones industrial average has had since September 2011. Basically, all the run-up in stock prices over the last year has been undone. Asian and European markets were bad this morning, and now we see the U. S. off to a bad start. Now, this is obviously bad news for people who have a lot of money in the stock market and pretty unsettling for the rest of us. I think the most important question is whether this drop in the market will be reversed in the coming days or whether it's a symptom of a major downshift in the global economy. INSKEEP: Are we in a moment, David, where the Asian markets go down and that effectively talks the New York markets down, which then talk the Asian markets down? WESSEL: Yes, that's - you get these mood swings, and it kind of feeds on itself. I think the reason Asia is important here is - look, the U. S. economy has been doing pretty well lately, but the emerging markets, particularly China, appear to be slowing down. So I think for a long time, there was this sense that the Chinese government was capable of handling whatever came its way. But that confidence has abated in the last couple of days. It looks like their leadership is panicking - intervening in the stock market, devaluing their currency. So people are reading that as a sign that China - which is a big economy - is slowing a lot more than we thought previously. INSKEEP: Well, then there's this other factor, David Wessel, and that's the Federal Reserve. Wasn't the Fed finally getting to a point where they were beginning to seem to feel comfortable talking about raising interest rates, which of course have been so low for so many years because of the aftermath of the financial crisis. WESSEL: Absolutely. So the Fed has said that they think the economy is now healthy enough, so sometime soon, perhaps as early as the middle of September, they would begin to lift interest rates off the zero level, where they've been since 2008. So I think the big question now is, what do Fed officials think of this? Will this slow down, in China, the dark clouds on the world economy? Can this incredible turmoil in stock prices be so much of a damper on economic growth or raise so many questions that they'll just decide, maybe we should wait a while longer before pulling the lever on raising interest rates? INSKEEP: You know, speaking of pulling the lever, let me just ask about the average investor - the ordinary person out there. Are we still at a moment where the financial advice to the ordinary person would just be do nothing - just wait? WESSEL: I think so because in general, history tells us that people - small investors who sell when the market goes down - always pick the wrong moment. If you are about to retire, if your kids are about to go to college, you probably shouldn't have had so much money in the stock market in the first place. But if you're like me - I'm five or 10 years away from retirement - I certainly wouldn't panic to sell now. I think history tells us that's almost always a mistake.

S. stock market might finally break its losing streak, but it was not to be. Late in the afternoon came another major sell-off, both the Dow and the S&P 500 closed down more than 1 percent. Stocks have been falling all over the world because of fears that the global economy is slowing, especially in China. NPR's Jim Zarroli starts off our coverage. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Over the past few days as stock prices slid, investors have been waiting for Chinese government officials to take action. Today they finally did. The Chinese central bank announced it was cutting interest rates and lowering the reserve requirements for its banks. Officials hope these moves will encourage more lending which in turn will stimulate business activity and keep growth high. Jack Ablin is chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. JACK ABLIN: You know, it's back to their reliable strategy, and that's encouraged borrowing and encouraged expansion and kind of capital markets. ZARROLI: Chinese officials are under intense pressure to stop the slide in stocks. In recent months, the government has been encouraging Chinese citizens to put their savings in the stock market, and with few alternatives for investment, a lot of people did. As a result, stock prices soared. But Harvard economist Ken Rogoff says the surge has proven temporary and prices have come back down to earth. KEN ROGOFF: Let's remember that a lot of what's happened in the last couple weeks is an unwinding of this epic boom where the stock market was going up and up and up. ZARROLI: With its credibility at stake, the government has been desperately trying to pump money into the stock market in an effort to keep prices from falling even further, says Jack Ablin. ABLIN: Beijing believes that if they can keep the stock market stable then that will eventually maintain confidence and encourage spending. ZARROLI: But even if today's moves succeed in keeping stock prices from falling further, they're unlikely to address the longer-term problems faced by the economy as a whole. China has grown so much in large part because government policies have favored huge amounts of investment. The country has built vast infrastructure projects such as factories, apartment buildings and roads, and banks have been encouraged to lend money for them. Again, Jack Ablin. ABLIN: At some point, all of this borrowing ultimately comes back to haunt them. And so while, you know, encouraging borrowing and spending is great in the very short-term, these loans do eventually have to be paid back. ZARROLI: Now China is approaching the point where it has more infrastructure than it needs, and that's risky, especially at a time when growth is slowing, says Ken Rogoff. ROGOFF: There are something like, you know, a million empty apartment units. There are whole cities which are practically ghost towns. They're thinking it will all work, but if growth slows down, it won't. ZARROLI: Government officials acknowledged that they need to change course and switch to a different kind of economy, one driven by consumption instead of investment. That would mean taking steps such as raising wages and interest rates. But that would hurt many banks and businesses, and a lot of them might not survive. With the measures announced today, China has made clear it's not yet ready to switch gears, and for the time being, it will be business as usual. Jim Zarroli, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  For much of today, it looked like the U. S. stock market might finally break its losing streak, but it was not to be. Late in the afternoon came another major sell-off, both the Dow and the S&P 500 closed down more than 1 percent. Stocks have been falling all over the world because of fears that the global economy is slowing, especially in China. NPR's Jim Zarroli starts off our coverage. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Over the past few days as stock prices slid, investors have been waiting for Chinese government officials to take action. Today they finally did. The Chinese central bank announced it was cutting interest rates and lowering the reserve requirements for its banks. Officials hope these moves will encourage more lending which in turn will stimulate business activity and keep growth high. Jack Ablin is chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. JACK ABLIN: You know, it's back to their reliable strategy, and that's encouraged borrowing and encouraged expansion and kind of capital markets.

S. Federal Reserve would finally raise interest rates next month. Today the bets are all over the place. Some investors think it could still happen before the end of the year, others are banking on the spring. Either way, it's not too early to start thinking about what that will mean for you. To dig into this a bit, we're joined by Megan Greene. She is managing director and chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. She's joining us from Boston. Welcome to the program. MEGAN GREENE: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So first we want to remind people that we've been living through this extraordinary experiment, right? I mean, 0 percent interest rates. What should the average person be expecting when that experiment ends? GREENE: Well, when that experiment ends and rates start going up, people will have a harder time servicing their debts. So some borrowers will have an even harder time than others because some debt is pegged to short-term rates, which are very closely linked to the Fed's rates. Other debt is pegged to the long-term rate, which is less related. So I think that the biggest losers from a Fed hike are really credit card debt holders. Most credit cards are variable-rate cards, so those rates are pegged to the Fed's policy rates. And also, those who have stumped up their houses in exchange for a loan, they'll feel the impact of a Fed hike. They'll have a harder time servicing their debt as well. Things like fixed mortgages, car loans and federal student loans are pegged to a long-term rate, so the impact of a Fed hike won't feed through to them quite as immediately. CORNISH: You're talking about a lot of important loans in people's lives. So how should they be approaching financial decisions right now? GREENE: Well, I think that people holding - sitting on a lot of credit card debt should certainly look to start paying it down because credit card debt is the most expensive kind of debt, for the most part, and they'll feel the impact of the Fed hiking rates most immediately. So I think that they should be sort of the most on guard for what happens when a Fed rate hike comes. Also people who've stumped up their houses to get a loan should be ready to start trying to finance that loan or trying to pay it down so that they don't get caught out when the Fed starts hiking rates. I should mention that when the Fed does finally start hiking rates, I don't think it will do so very quickly. I think we'll see a, you know, a very slow and episodic rate hike in rates. So we'll see the Fed hike rates by 25 basis points then they'll sit there at that rate and wait a couple of months, see what the impact is on the real economy, maybe hike another 25 basis points. That's something we've never seen the past in the U. S. When the Fed hikes, normally it hikes, you know, every single month in a row for a long period of time, so it's very systematic. I don't think we'll have that this time around. The hike will be slower and it will be based on the impact on the real economy. So consumers should at least feel comfortable about that. They won't get a huge surprise immediately. CORNISH: And I want to take a step back here also because people may not remember how high interest rates were not too long ago, right? I mean, even when rates go up, it's still going to be worlds from where we were. GREENE: That's right. I think that when rates go up, they'll go up very slowly, as I said before. But I don't think that we can expect the normal rates that we've had before for a number of years. So in the past, 10-year yields in the U. S. have typically been around 4 percent. We're not going to be anywhere close to that over the next five years, so we can expect rates to remain really low for a long time. CORNISH: And, Megan Greene, before I let you go I want to ask your guess about when you think the Fed will act, when rates might go up? GREENE: Well, I think that the Fed will probably wait as long as possible to start hiking rates, but I think that they'll feel some compulsion to hike rates in December of this year. The Chairwoman, Janet Yellen, has said a number of times that the Fed would like to hike this year, and so if the Fed doesn't then that could really hurt the Fed's credibility. And if the central bank doesn't have any credibility, it cannot do its job. The risk to that, I think, is that the Fed will wait even longer and we won't see a hike until next year. If you ask me what I think the Fed should do, they should definitely wait until next year. There's only one economic indicator that suggests that the Fed should start hiking rates, and that's the unemployment rate. But every other indicator suggests that, actually, the Fed should hold off.

S. stocks started to make back some of Monday's big losses early, but that rally fizzled by the end of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down more than 200 points. That's on top of the 588 points it loss yesterday. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Big swings in the market can feel like a crisis, but economists say what we're experiencing is actually a correction. Gillian Tett is the U. S. managing editor for the Financial Times. I asked her to explain the distinction between a crisis and a correction. GILLIAN TETT: In this case, I think correction really means an adjustment, if you like, because the reality is stock prices have been very pumped up by superfluous monetary policy in the last couple of years. They've got way ahead of where the economic fundamentals are. And so, in a sense, what's happened the last week or two is that stock prices have really come back into line - back into gravity if you like - with where the real economy is. SHAPIRO: What would look different if it were in fact a crisis rather than a correction? TETT: Well, in a crisis, two things tend to happen. Firstly, you have a dramatic level of almost irrational panic where people try and sell everything they've got. And secondly, it tends to spread out and affect the real economy, and companies and consumers lose confidence and stop buying things or investing in things or creating jobs. And thankfully that hasn't happened yet. SHAPIRO: What we saw over the last couple of days in the stock market did not look like a gradual, orderly course correction. It was kind of all over the map. What's going on there? TETT: Well, there's certainly been some really wild, dramatic, gyrations in stock prices, and they're up and down. When you look at what's happened to the stock price of things like Apple, it's astonishing. Now, there seems to be about three things going on here. Firstly, the markets are very thin right now because it is August and you have a lot of the seasoned traders away on vacation. You've got less volume than anywhere in the markets. And so there's a long tradition of people overreacting during this vacation season. Secondly, you've got a lot of very confusing noise coming out about the real economy. I mean, the workings of the Chinese economy are about as mysterious as the workings of subprime mortgage CDOs back in 2007. People just don't know what to make of the news coming from the other side of the world. And thirdly, though, you've also got a change in the structure of markets because in recent years, we've seeing a big increase in the amount of computer-driven trading, high-frequency trading, algorithm trading, call it what you like. And that appears to be making stock prices a lot more volatile as well. SHAPIRO: I'm intrigued. You said this may be linked to the fact that it's August and people are on vacation. Do you mean that we are seeing, like, the junior varsity team executing trades and that's why there's been so much volatility? TETT: (Laughter) Well, I'm sure the junior varsity team feels like they've grown up 20 years in the last three or four days. But the reality is that, you know, many of the most seasoned and senior traders tend to go on vacation this time of year. And yes, we can all remain in contact with our iPhones and our iPads and whatever else while we're on the beaches. But traditionally, you have had a lot of pretty wild market movements in the month of August historically. SHAPIRO: If we look at the U. S. economy right now, apart from the stock market, unemployment is down, new home construction is up; things look relatively good. Do you expect the sort of frightening events of stocks in the last couple of days to spread to other parts of the economy? TETT: Well, the U. S. economy right now, if you were grading it at college or high school, is probably a B-plus in the sense that, yes, things are certainly recovering. But it's not dazzling. The one thing that's really clear, however, is that it's a lot better than the stock market crash over the last few days would actually indicate. Whether it spreads to the rest of the economy depends right now on what happens to that elusive issue of competence. Remember, the economy is not just about statistics. They're also about psychology. And if people start to feel so nervous about the future that consumers don't go out and buy that new washing machine or companies don't go out and create jobs then, yes, it certainly will start to spread to the real economy. And we have seen plenty of cases in history where that's happened before. But if investors simply shrug their shoulders and say, well, you know what? The stock markets are crazy. You know, we don't really trust the way they're operating, but, hey, it doesn't affect us, then actually this week's squall will end up seeming like a huge summer thunderstorm rather than a significant change in the season. We just don't know as of yet. But an awful lot depends as well on what happens next with the Federal Reserve and whether they raise rates or not. SHAPIRO: That's Gillian Tett, U.

It is on this morning that we're going to hear a warning to the Federal Reserve. The Fed has signaled it wants to raise short-term interest rates soon. That's a big deal, since rates have been held near zero for years, driving the recovery from the great recession. The Fed has been looking for the right moment to raise interest rates and avoid overheating the economy. Lawrence Summers contends that this is absolutely the wrong moment. The former treasury secretary and adviser to President Obama is campaigning for the Fed to hold off, and he's on the line. Secretary Summers, good to talk with you again. LAWRENCE SUMMERS: Good to be with you. INSKEEP: Now, people may hear you saying this and assume that you're just reacting to a few bad days on the stock market here. Do you see bigger problems here though? SUMMERS: My issue is not the turmoil of the last few days. My issue is looking at the broad economy. The Fed's got three primary objectives - price stability, full employment and financial stability. Right now inflation is running below its 2 percent target and is expected - according to markets - to run below that target for nearly 10 years or more. Right now we've still got large numbers of people looking for work. And we have no evidence of the kind of rapid wage inflation that we'd have if there were labor shortages, outside of a few uncertain sectors. Right now it's obvious from your headlines this morning that our problem is not overconfidence and obliviousness to risks in financial markets. So there's no need for the Fed to send a shot across investors' bow. The base of those three things, the - I don't see the case for a rate increase. Seems to me that there's as much or more argument for the accelerator as there is for the brake. INSKEEP: But let me ask about that because there was 10 percent unemployment a few years ago when interest rates were pushed down near zero. If near-zero interest rates are right for 10 percent unemployment, how can they also be right when there's 5. 3 percent unemployment? There has been a lot of change in the last few years. SUMMERS: There certainly has, but I'd beg these points - first, if it had been possible to do more with expansionary policy, it would have been desirable. Certainly in 2009, if the interest rate had been 3 percent, it would've been a good idea to bring it way down below 3 percent. Unfortunately there's what economists refer to as the zero lower bound. People will just store currency. You can't lower interest rates much below 0 percent. INSKEEP: Zero is 0, right. SUMMERS: Second, there's just the reality of, why do you want to hit the brakes? You hit the brakes if you think that you're in danger of having excessive inflation or you think you're in danger of having bubbles. And we may have been reasonable to worry about bubbles six months ago, but surely, with the highest five-day increase in market volatility ever, that's not the moment that we need to kind of get people more alarmed about bubbles. And you don't see it in the inflation statistics. I said this months ago. I said the Fed should not raise rates until it sees the whites of the eyes of inflation, and I don't think they're there yet. INSKEEP: OK. You've said it's unwise to raise rates now, or unnecessary to raise rates now, but you've written something more in a couple of op-eds in The Washington Post and Financial Times. You've said that raising rates now could tip some part of the financial system into crisis. That sounds scary. What would the crisis be? SUMMERS: We got - I think we got a taste of the kind of thing that crisis represents in markets yesterday. It's marked by extraordinary volatility. It's marked by investors rushing to get into cash, forcing the sale of assets. And then when there's forced sales, that leads to declines in prices which leads to more alarm, which leads to more selling, which leads to more decline in prices. And what we know is that there's extensive and complicated interconnection of a kind - that for all their best efforts, regulators don't completely understand. No one expected that a relatively small $4. 5 billion hedge fund, LTCM - long-term capital management - that failed in 1998, would have cascading consequences in the way that it did. No one expected that - very few people expected that subprime, a limited sector of the mortgage market, even if it got into trouble would have the kind of catastrophic consequences that it did. INSKEEP: Secretary Summers, we've just got a few seconds left here. I want to ask if you think we're riding a tiger here. Interest rates have been near zero, people can't save money so they've had to invest in the stock market. And now it's going to be hard to get out of that pattern. It's almost like a stock bubble here. SUMMERS: Yeah, but this is not the moment to be making that kind of adjustment. INSKEEP: OK. SUMMERS: And whenever you make that kind of adjustment, you've got to think about what's happening with the real economy and take other steps to assure there's enough demand to create full employment. That's why I've been an advocate for so long of a major increase in infrastructure investments and major measures to promote private investment through regulatory tax policy. INSKEEP: All right. Secretary Summers thanks very much for your insights this morning. SUMMERS: Thank you. INSKEEP: Lawrence Summers, former treasury-secretary economic adviser to President Obama. Let's get in a better mood here with music from Yo La Tengo. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  I'm Steve Inskeep on an unsettled and unsettling morning for world stock markets. It is on this morning that we're going to hear a warning to the Federal Reserve. The Fed has signaled it wants to raise short-term interest rates soon. That's a big deal, since rates have been held near zero for years, driving the recovery from the great recession. The Fed has been looking for the right moment to raise interest rates and avoid overheating the economy. Lawrence Summers contends that this is absolutely the wrong moment. The former treasury secretary and adviser to President Obama is campaigning for the Fed to hold off, and he's on the line. Secretary Summers, good to talk with you again. LAWRENCE SUMMERS: Good to be with you. INSKEEP: Now, people may hear you saying this and assume that you're just reacting to a few bad days on the stock market here. Do you see bigger problems here though? SUMMERS: My issue is not the turmoil of the last few days. My issue is looking at the broad economy. The Fed's got three primary objectives - price stability, full employment and financial stability. Right now inflation is running below its 2 percent target and is expected - according to markets - to run below that target for nearly 10 years or more. Right now we've still got large numbers of people looking for work. And we have no evidence of the kind of rapid wage inflation that we'd have if there were labor shortages, outside of a few uncertain sectors. Right now it's obvious from your headlines this morning that our problem is not overconfidence and obliviousness to risks in financial markets. So there's no need for the Fed to send a shot across investors' bow. The base of those three things, the - I don't see the case for a rate increase. Seems to me that there's as much or more argument for the accelerator as there is for the brake. INSKEEP: But let me ask about that because there was 10 percent unemployment a few years ago when interest rates were pushed down near zero. If near-zero interest rates are right for 10 percent unemployment, how can they also be right when there's 5. 3 percent unemployment? There has been a lot of change in the last few years. SUMMERS: There certainly has, but I'd beg these points - first, if it had been possible to do more with expansionary policy, it would have been desirable. Certainly in 2009, if the interest rate had been 3 percent, it would've been a good idea to bring it way down below 3 percent. Unfortunately there's what economists refer to as the zero lower bound. People will just store currency. You can't lower interest rates much below 0 percent. INSKEEP: Zero is 0, right. SUMMERS: Second, there's just the reality of, why do you want to hit the brakes? You hit the brakes if you think that you're in danger of having excessive inflation or you think you're in danger of having bubbles. And we may have been reasonable to worry about bubbles six months ago, but surely, with the highest five-day increase in market volatility ever, that's not the moment that we need to kind of get people more alarmed about bubbles. And you don't see it in the inflation statistics. I said this months ago. I said the Fed should not raise rates until it sees the whites of the eyes of inflation, and I don't think they're there yet. INSKEEP: OK. You've said it's unwise to raise rates now, or unnecessary to raise rates now, but you've written something more in a couple of op-eds in The Washington Post and Financial Times. You've said that raising rates now could tip some part of the financial system into crisis. That sounds scary. What would the crisis be? SUMMERS: We got - I think we got a taste of the kind of thing that crisis represents in markets yesterday. It's marked by extraordinary volatility. It's marked by investors rushing to get into cash, forcing the sale of assets. And then when there's forced sales, that leads to declines in prices which leads to more alarm, which leads to more selling, which leads to more decline in prices. And what we know is that there's extensive and complicated interconnection of a kind - that for all their best efforts, regulators don't completely understand. No one expected that a relatively small $4. 5 billion hedge fund, LTCM - long-term capital management - that failed in 1998, would have cascading consequences in the way that it did. No one expected that - very few people expected that subprime, a limited sector of the mortgage market, even if it got into trouble would have the kind of catastrophic consequences that it did. INSKEEP: Secretary Summers, we've just got a few seconds left here. I want to ask if you think we're riding a tiger here. Interest rates have been near zero, people can't save money so they've had to invest in the stock market. And now it's going to be hard to get out of that pattern. It's almost like a stock bubble here. SUMMERS: Yeah, but this is not the moment to be making that kind of adjustment. INSKEEP: OK.

The selling of stocks in China continue today, although other markets recovered. GREENE: All this can be hard for an ordinary investor to take. That's your savings or your pension fund getting pounded out there. Most financial experts say your best course is to do nothing. And that is very hard advice to heed as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: When pushed off a cliff, one's natural instinct is to grab for anything to stop the fall. Within the last week, the Dow has fallen nearly 10 percent. And Morgan Housel says investors feel a similar impulse to stop the fall by selling off their stocks. MORGAN HOUSEL: I think these are really ingrained, fundamental, behavioral characteristics of human beings. NOGUCHI: Housel studies and writes about the behavioral psychology of markets as a senior analyst with The Motley Fool. And yet, he says, even for him, it's hard to heed his own advice, which is to keep calm and accept, even embrace, the inevitable ups and downs of the market. HOUSEL: If we never had crashes in the stock market, if there was no big volatility, there would be no risk. And if there was no risk, then everybody would pile in at the same time and get a high return on your money. And if everyone did that at the same time, stocks would get really expensive. We'd have a bubble, and then they would crash. NOGUCHI: Hang on, stay the course is a message most investment advisors repeat to their clients every time their portfolio takes a beating. And yet, Housel says, it's a lesson that does not seem to stick at all. HOUSEL: With 24/7 cable news and Twitter and stock updates on your iPhone, I think if anything that probably makes it a little bit worse. It increases the idea that we need to act now. NOGUCHI: Morgan, are you blaming me? HOUSEL: Or myself because I'm in this business, too. NOGUCHI: Investors sought comfort and moral support on Twitter yesterday, using the hashtag #BlackMonday. Many others turned to their brokerage firms, some of which reported technical problems because of very high volumes of customers trying to execute trades on their sites early in the day. But, Ric Edelman thinks the investing public is much calmer this time around. He's chairman and CEO of Edelman Financial Services. RIC EDELMAN: What we have to recognize is that our emotions are our enemies when it comes to personal finance. NOGUCHI: He says clients these days are better able to distinguish between losses and volatility. EDELMAN: Losses are bad, but volatility doesn't mean loss unless you sell while it's down. NOGUCHI: And in fact, he says many clients see this as a buying opportunity. EDELMAN: Wall Street's on sale and smart shoppers know the time to buy is when prices are low. NOGUCHI: Edelman says investors have lived through several crashes, including the financial crisis, only to see the market nearly triple in value from its lowest point. EDELMAN: And people now have developed a lot of experience, and they've realized that during very scary moments, you can be compelled to sell out of fear. But that always proves to be the wrong thing to do at the wrong time. NOGUCHI: Brennan Miller is vice president and branch manager of Charles Schwab's Chicago offices. He says traffic and call volume are up over the last week. Some of those calls are coming from investors who want to put more money in the stock market because they see bargains.

BRENNAN MILLER: If you're not really going through a market decline, you might say on paper, oh, yeah, no problem. That's not a problem at all. But then you actually go through a period like this and you realize, oh, my goodness, I can't sleep at night. I can't make it through. I think I want to sell out.

That's a factor in Brazil's economic crisis. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And the bigger truth is that any country that prospered selling raw materials or commodities to China is facing trouble now. NPR's Jackie Northam reports. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: For years, China has had an enormous appetite for commodities, everything from coal and iron ore to copper and nickel, to help construct its bridges and ports, feed its voracious steel mills to build plants and apartment buildings, even entire cities. China tapped into countries around the world to help feed that appetite. It became the largest consumer of raw materials, says Andrew Hecht, chief analyst with commodix. com, a commodity research website. ANDREW HECHT: China built a lot of infrastructure over recent years, and China spent a lot of time stockpiling commodities. Now that they are slowing down a little bit, that is hampering demand on a global basis in a big way. NORTHAM: Hecht says many commodities such as copper, lumber and oil are now at multiyear lows, affecting those countries producing them. HECHT: In a place like South Africa, which, you know, has been the largest producer of gold, largest producer of platinum, many other minerals, Indonesia certainly lowered nickel prices. Because they're a very big producer of nickel, it's hurting their economy. The lower oil price for Russia is a nightmare, especially on top of sanctions. NORTHAM: Countries whose budgets depend on exporting raw materials to China in particular are getting hit hard, says Edwin Truman, an economist with the Peterson Institute of International Economics. EDWIN TRUMAN: You have a country, for example, like Australia, which has been producing a lot of coal and iron ore and shipping it to China, and its become very dependent on the Chinese market. NORTHAM: Canada's economy, like Australia's, is suffering from the slowdown. Its dollar is at a decades low. Ian Nakamoto, the director of research at MacDougall, MacDougall, MacTier, a Montreal-based investment firm, says an overreliance on oil and gas and natural resources has stunted the economy. IAN NAKAMOTO: For Canada, you know, I guess one of our competitive strengths has been, and will continue to be, is our ability to produce commodities. And we were doing fine until China started to slow down. And all of a sudden, we realize that we relied too much on that one growth engine, that growth engine being commodities. And it's come home to roost. NORTHAM: Nakamoto says low interest rates helped fuel development of those industries. NAKAMOTO: The commodity producers were building mines, building oil facilities. There's been an oversupply of commodities, and that was premised on the fact that China would continue to consume and grow something in the order of 9 percent GDP, and that obviously hasn't happened. NORTHAM: Nakamoto says there are other factors at play, including a stronger U. S. dollar, which tends to push down the price of raw materials. Prices may have been pummeled this week, but commodities by nature are volatile and regularly go through boom and bust cycles. Hecht with commodix. com says there's actually been a slow downturn in commodities for a few years. And while China's economy may not be as robust as once thought, it's still pretty good. HECHT: I wouldn't count China out. Quite frankly, they're still growing. It's just that that growth is slower.

S. markets this week. Wall Street started the week in free fall. The Dow plunged a thousand points when it first opened on Monday. Something known as the fear index captured the shockwaves rippling across the market. Robert Whaley is a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University. He created the VIX, or vix. That's the volatility index for the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Welcome to the program. ROBERT WHALEY: I'm glad to be here. CORNISH: So what exactly does the VIX measure? How do you measure fear? WHALEY: Through the price of insurance. The analogy that I often use with respect to the VIX is suppose you owned a vacation home on the coast, and you're worried about storms over the next, say, month. You look around at available information, weather forecasts, and suppose you decide that it's not very likely. You won't pay very much for insurance in that particular instance. On the other hand, if you find information that indicates it's going to be very stormy, you'll pay a lot more for insurance during that same interval of time. VIX is the same thing. Rather than protecting your house, however, what you're doing is protecting your stock portfolio. If VIX goes up, that means people are nervous about what's going to happen to the value of their stocks. If VIX is at a low level, they're not concerned. And so what you saw is that people panicked over the weekend probably based on the Chinese news. There wasn't much else happening. They overreacted, and to protect the value of their pension funds or whatever, they went out and bought insurance. CORNISH: The VIX is a favorite financial indicator for people who want to read the market and market anxiety. But is it a forecast of kind of where investors are headed, or is it a mirror of what they're already feeling? WHALEY: It's a forecast. It's not simply a mirror. It's your prediction of over the next month of how much noise there'll be, variability in the stock market. CORNISH: Has it been wrong? WHALEY: Oh, of course it's been wrong - going back to the weather forecasts, they're usually wrong. But based upon all the information they have, they make a prediction of what's going to happen. That doesn't mean it's going to come true, and the VIX is completely analogous to that. CORNISH: So what does the current level of the VIX tell us about the future outlook of the stock market now? WHALEY: A good way to think about it is using a benchmark of about 20. Twenty is the historical level of the VIX. So what you're seeing now at a level of like, 27, it indicates that investors are a little nervous, more so than they were a week or two ago. But I would look to that level to come down even more, back down towards 20. CORNISH: In what ways do people misuse or misread the volatility index? WHALEY: They don't understand it fully and they think it is a predictor and if it gets too high a level, the stock market crash is going to happen. Dispelling them of that notion is a little difficult sometimes. CORNISH: I ask 'cause over the years, you know, it comes to be something that's quoted in news stories, right? And in a way, it ends up contributing to the ongoing story of the market of that week. . . WHALEY: Right. CORNISH: . . . And I didn't know if there were times when you thought, jeez, this is not what I intended. WHALEY: (Laughter). Yeah, it's a little problematic in some sense. But if it goes to a high level, there are a lot of people out there that are fundamentally concerned of a large stock price drop. CORNISH: For you, you know, what scares the father of the fear index? WHALEY: Not having a pension (laughter). I monitor VIX very closely, and right now I'm really not that concerned. I'm more in equities than I am in bonds. But if it gets to a high enough level, I'm going to have to realign that. CORNISH: Robert Whaley is a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University. He created the volatility index known as VIX. Thank you so much for speaking with us. WHALEY: Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The trouble in China was part of what shook U. S. markets this week. Wall Street started the week in free fall. The Dow plunged a thousand points when it first opened on Monday. Something known as the fear index captured the shockwaves rippling across the market. Robert Whaley is a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University. He created the VIX, or vix. That's the volatility index for the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Welcome to the program. ROBERT WHALEY: I'm glad to be here. CORNISH: So what exactly does the VIX measure? How do you measure fear? WHALEY: Through the price of insurance. The analogy that I often use with respect to the VIX is suppose you owned a vacation home on the coast, and you're worried about storms over the next, say, month. You look around at available information, weather forecasts, and suppose you decide that it's not very likely. You won't pay very much for insurance in that particular instance. On the other hand, if you find information that indicates it's going to be very stormy, you'll pay a lot more for insurance during that same interval of time. VIX is the same thing. Rather than protecting your house, however, what you're doing is protecting your stock portfolio. If VIX goes up, that means people are nervous about what's going to happen to the value of their stocks. If VIX is at a low level, they're not concerned. And so what you saw is that people panicked over the weekend probably based on the Chinese news. There wasn't much else happening. They overreacted, and to protect the value of their pension funds or whatever, they went out and bought insurance. CORNISH: The VIX is a favorite financial indicator for people who want to read the market and market anxiety. But is it a forecast of kind of where investors are headed, or is it a mirror of what they're already feeling? WHALEY: It's a forecast. It's not simply a mirror. It's your prediction of over the next month of how much noise there'll be, variability in the stock market. CORNISH: Has it been wrong? WHALEY: Oh, of course it's been wrong - going back to the weather forecasts, they're usually wrong. But based upon all the information they have, they make a prediction of what's going to happen. That doesn't mean it's going to come true, and the VIX is completely analogous to that. CORNISH: So what does the current level of the VIX tell us about the future outlook of the stock market now?

The repo business, though, is on fire. We're going to go to Texas now where people who've been working during the drilling boom are now unable to hold onto their expensive, heavy-duty pickup trucks. Mose Buchele sent this report from member station KUT in Austin. MOSE BUCHELE, BYLINE: Walk around Ryan Peck's impound lot on the south side of Corpus Christi, and it's easy to see he's busy. RYAN PECK: We just got a few pickup trucks, a couple of brand-new trucks - 2015s, a couple work trucks. These are all vehicles that are not getting redeemed, that are fixing to go to the auction. BUCHELE: Peck is not a car salesman. He's a repo man, and he's been repossessing a lot of trucks lately, so many that it's even caught his attention. PECK: In our business, there's trucks that we normally don't pick up - you know, those three-quarter-ton diesel trucks, one-ton trucks. BUCHELE: So where are they coming from? PECK: Actually, this truck right here, if you want to look at the back of it, it's got tons of oilfield equipment - you know, tools and wrenches and things like that that they would use in the oilfield. BUCHELE: Peck says during the drilling boom that started around 2009, oil workers bought a lot of these expense of trucks. Now the boom's over, and they can't make payments. So he's doing plenty of work in a nearby oil town of Alice. PECK: Alice would be probably my first stop to find out what's going on, what's about to happen. How do you all do that? BUCHELE: There are streets in Alice with names like Energy Avenue and Industrial Boulevard. These are where big oilfield service companies brought jobs during the boom. When the bus came, the ones hit hardest were the workers. JAVIER GAMEZ: Basically they'll tell you there's no work right now, and we'll call you when we need you. BUCHELE: It's been over three months since Alice resident Javier Gamez heard those words. He says he used to make up to $6,000 a month in the oil fields. Now he's lucky to pull in $600 doing construction work. GAMEZ: That's how it goes. You're accustomed to getting pretty good money. And you have a nice truck, and you have a nice home. And you have to start downgrading, letting things go. BUCHELE: Yeah, he bought a truck. He doesn't have it anymore. He says a lot of his buddies lost their trucks too. They ignored the warnings of old-timers who lived through booms and busts before. GAMEZ: They tell us you know, you need to prepare. You need to save. You need to save. And us being young, we're like, aw, heck, I'm buying a new truck; you know, I can afford it. And they're like, don't do it. And us being young and not dumb, but unprepared, we do it. BUCHELE: It might sound shortsighted, but a lot of people thought the good times would last. So did the local governments who are grappling with a big drop in tax revenue. GAMEZ: That snowball effect happens where we don't have any money because we're not working, so we don't go spend at the restaurants. So now the poor lady at the restaurant loses hours, so it just goes down the line. BUCHELE: All the way back to the car dealership. JACOB LOPEZ: My name is Jacob Lopez. I'm the owner of Coyote Auto Sales in Alice, Texas. BUCHELE: Sitting at his desk beneath a rumbling AC window unit, Lopez remembers when the trucks used to fly off the lot. LOPEZ: Seventy percent of our business was heavy-duty trucks, lifted, diesel 4x4. And now I just don't have the demand anymore. BUCHELE: Now he sells more affordable, fuel-efficient cars, but really, most people aren't buying any cars at all. LOPEZ: I saw the business drop off after the spring when you started seeing the rigs being shut down. BUCHELE: That reminded me of something Ryan Peck, the repo man, told me back in Corpus Christi. He says if the downturn continues, car loans will be harder to get. Fewer people will buy cars, and so fewer people will default on their loans. That means eventually, his business will take a hit. PECK: If nobody's paying for cars, then nobody is buying cars as well. BUCHELE: So in a way, you got to watch out for that same cycle. PECK: Yeah. I mean, it comes back to get everybody. Nobody's safe from it. BUCHELE: But don't worry about Peck. He says he's saving his money in case the repo bubble becomes a repo bust. For NPR News, I'm Mose Buchele in Austin, Texas.

The ridesharing service has been fighting challenges to its business model, but a federal judge here in California has allowed some drivers to proceed with a class action suit against the company. The case could affect other big companies in what's called the sharing economy. NPR's Laura Sydell has more. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE: Uber holds itself out as a leader in what has been dubbed the sharing economy. It challenged the traditional taxi business with an app that brought together people who need a ride with people who have cars. The drivers get paid a rate set by Uber. But Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for the drivers, says Uber passes on a lot of costs. SHANNON LISS-RIORDAN: They have to pay for their own cars. They have to pay for the gas. They have to pay for the wear and tear on their vehicles. And basically, Uber is able to shift all those expenses to its drivers and not have to pay it themselves. SYDELL: Liss-Riordan says the drivers are arguing that they should be classified as employees, not contractors. And she claims that labor law is on their side, especially in California where the company is headquartered. LISS-RIORDAN: In California, those laws are particularly strict and say that employers have to reimburse their employees for expenses that are required to do the job. SYDELL: One of the first steps in the case against Uber was getting the federal judge to certify the drivers as a class. Uber fought that classification, but it lost. Uber did not respond to requests from NPR for comment on the ruling, but it did bring in testimony of drivers who are happy being independent contractors and didn't want to be part of the class. However, the judge determined that was a small group compared with the tens of thousands of drivers that work for Uber, a company that some value at $50 billion. Any ruling in this case could affect other companies in the sharing economy, like Airbnb, TaskRabbit and Lyft, another ridesharing service, says Stanford law professor Bill Gould. BILL GOULD: This question of misclassification of employees into independent contractor status is arising with increasing frequency. SYDELL: The case is still many months from trial.

S. jobs report. Today, the world was definitely watching. Maybe it could help answer a big question - is the Federal Reserve about to raise interest rates? The U. S. gained 173,000 jobs in August - fewer than expected. But the unemployment rate fell to 5. 1 percent - a mixed report. So, as NPR's Chris Arnold explains, that big question - it's still looming out there. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The U. S. economy is at a historic crossroads. Never before has the Federal Reserve set interest rates this low and certainly not for this long. It did that to boost the badly damaged economy. And, now we've seen the longest stretch of job growth ever - 13 million jobs over 66 straight months. So that sounds great, but wages are still stagnant and several million people of working age still don't have jobs. So the question now is, is the economy strong enough to walk on its own two feet? LISA LYNCH: The Federal Reserve would like to get to a place where it feels more normal. To have rates this low for so long doesn't feel normal. ARNOLD: That's Lisa Lynch, interim president of Brandeis University and a former Labor Department economist. She knows that keeping rates too low for too long can cause problems - bubbles in the housing market or the stock market. Still, for her part, Lynch thinks that the Fed should wait a little longer before scaling back the life support. So she says when the Fed meets later in September. . . LYNCH: If I was sitting in that room, it would be a tough call, but I would err on the side of delaying until later in the year to ensure that there's nothing that the Federal Reserve does that scuppers the current recovery.

RANDALL KROSZNER: One of the key debates at the Fed meeting coming up is going to be the impact of China. Is this something that is really just within China and will not have dramatic spillover effects or is this something that's going to set and train much bigger issues where they're going to have to make a decision and unlimited data in less than a couple of weeks. ARNOLD: For his part, Kroszner thinks the U. S. economy is looking strong enough and unemployment low enough that the Fed will start to remove the life support and raise interest rates at its next meeting. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

The Federal Reserve will take all of this into account in two weeks, when it decides whether to raise rates from the lowest level on record. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: After the financial crisis hit, the Fed did something remarkable. It pushed its benchmark interest rate down to zero, where it'd never been before, and it stayed there for years. Now, the Fed's poised to start removing that life support for the economy by raising rates. That has some analysts nervous. After all, if you take life support off too soon, the patient might crash again. But economist Diane Swonk says that people shouldn't be too worried. DIANE SWONK: The real message for everyone is, no matter what the Fed does, the first move is going to be small, and thereafter it's going to be a crawl - up on rates. There is no surge in rates out there, and that's because the economy's just not hot enough. ARNOLD: Swonk is with Mesirow Financial in Chicago, and she says the Fed is very aware that the economy still isn't that great. There are several million working-age Americans without jobs. Wages are stagnant. So until things improve more. . . SWONK: The Fed doesn't want to snuff out what little party we might have going. ARNOLD: Still, leaving interest rates so low for too long could spark bubbles in the housing market or the stock market, so the Fed is trying to steer a tricky course to keep the economy sailing into a better recovery. And there's another reason to raise rates. Lisa Lynch is interim president of Brandeis University and a former Labor Department economist. LISA LYNCH: Right now, the Fed has used pretty much all of its arsenal. And if you do have another negative shock, what do they do? ARNOLD: In other words, with interest rates at zero, the Fed wants to get back to a place where it could drop interest rates again if it had to. Still, Lynch actually sees enough slack in the labor market and the economy that if she were at the Fed, she would wait a little longer before raising rates. LYNCH: I don't think there's any harm done in doing that. And if you move prematurely and trigger uncertainty and concern and slow down the economy, we certainly don't want to do that at this stage. ARNOLD: One cause for uncertainty right now is China. Its economy is slowing down. Analysts say the Fed will be trying to figure out just how big a problem that might be for the global economy.

Wages are stagnant. So until things improve more. . . SWONK: The Fed doesn't want to snuff out what little party we might have going. ARNOLD: Still, leaving interest rates so low for too long could spark bubbles in the housing market or the stock market, so the Fed is trying to steer a tricky course to keep the economy sailing into a better recovery. And there's another reason to raise rates. Lisa Lynch is interim president of Brandeis University and a former Labor Department economist. LISA LYNCH: Right now, the Fed has used pretty much all of its arsenal. And if you do have another negative shock, what do they do? ARNOLD: In other words, with interest rates at zero, the Fed wants to get back to a place where it could drop interest rates again if it had to. Still, Lynch actually sees enough slack in the labor market and the economy that if she were at the Fed, she would wait a little longer before raising rates. LYNCH: I don't think there's any harm done in doing that. And if you move prematurely and trigger uncertainty and concern and slow down the economy, we certainly don't want to do that at this stage. ARNOLD: One cause for uncertainty right now is China. Its economy is slowing down. Analysts say the Fed will be trying to figure out just how big a problem that might be for the global economy.

S. unemployment rate slipped down to just over 5 percent. But recent studies show most jobs are going to workers either in the top third or bottom third of income. From member station WSHU, Charles Lane looks at those in the middle who are getting squeezed in the job market, especially men. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Economists call them middle-skilled workers. They have good jobs that don't necessarily require specialized training or a college education. Think file clerk, legal assistant or production baker. ELLESWORTH ASHMAN: You mix the dough. You mix the topping that goes on the cake. LANE: Ellesworth Ashman is one of those middle-skilled workers. He's put in 23 years at Entenmann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a company that has been baking sweets here on Long Island for more than 90 years. ASHMAN: This place, during my time, we were making over a million cake a week. LANE: Ashman's job required some skill, but it was routine. And those are the jobs that are disappearing. Entenmann's eliminated Ashman's job last year, leaving him with a tough choice - go back to school and get a higher-skill job or get a low-skill job to pay the bills. ASHMAN: Just recently, I start working with assisted living place. I keep everything up to par in terms of cleaning and dusting. LANE: This job pays half his Entenmann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job. ASHMAN: But I'm a man, and you got to do what you got to do. LANE: Ashman's word choice nails it. As middle-skill jobs disappear, researchers say men and women go in two different directions - men down, women up. For example, Maribel Moran used to be a receptionist at several law firms. MARIBEL MORAN: After a while, it just got very boring and, like, routine. And I just felt stuck, and I felt like I plateaued there, so. . . LANE: She decided to go back to school for a bachelor's degree, and at a job fair in New York City, she was looking for something better. MORAN: Most men, I think, are used to their routine and what they know already, so to go into something new is a little tougher with most men. LANE: Labor economists can't exactly explain this gender divide. What they do know is women are better educated than men. David Autor is an economist at MIT. He says this baseline education prepares women to survive the disappearing middle, but. . . DAVID AUTOR: Even holding education constant, we see less-educated men faring worse than less-educated women. They're moving more into low-skill occupations, and they just check out. LANE: Statistics show labor participation for prime-age males has been falling for a long time, and it drops faster with each recession. Autor says the ramifications are profound - greater income inequality, for one - also lower marriage rates, which creates what Autor calls an intergenerational feedback loop. AUTOR: Boys do worse than girls in that setting, and so that sets them up again to be less likely to complete high school, to attend college, more likely to be incarcerated and, in general, have lower earnings. LANE: The long-term solution is, of course, education, but the short-term is tougher. Lawrence Katz is a professor of economics at Harvard. He says one solution is to subsidize low-skill wages, but Congress has been reluctant to do that. LAWRENCE KATZ: The earned income tax credit has been very effective at that, but its real value hasn't really increased in 20 years. LANE: But Katz cautions economies have always lost jobs, and workers have always adapted. To survive the disappearing middle, he says, workers need to customize current services or invent jobs that computers can't do. Though, some researchers see computers getting better and soon replacing what we now consider high-skill jobs. For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane.

Today, there are about 40 percent fewer welders. JEREMY WORLEY: I think there's right at 300,000 jobs right now in the U. S. that needs welders right now.

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: At a corner convenience store on Chicago's North Side, people are coming in to purchase a few groceries, and some are buying those scratch-off lottery cards where you can find out right away if you're a winner.

COOK: I mean, come on. You make millions off the lottery, and you can't cut a check? That's unacceptable. CORLEY: Illinois does have the money to pay, but big winners are out of luck.

MUNGER: Rather than filing a court order, perhaps they should call their legislature and ask them to work on getting a budget in place. TOM ZIMMERMAN: We want to stop the fraud. CORLEY: Attorney Tom Zimmerman says that Illinois law requires the lottery to pay prizes first instead of using money to pay for operating the lottery. ZIMMERMAN: And so if the state is not willing to pay out the prize money, then they should not be selling tickets that have a potential value in excess of $25,000 knowing full well that when somebody comes to collect, they're not going to pay.

S. economy tomorrow when it begins meetings. Should it raise interest rates? The Fed is getting a lot of advice. The World Bank warns against it, and some prominent economists say a rate increase now would be catastrophic. Another camp of experts and central bankers is telling the Fed exactly the opposite. Here's NPR's Chris Arnold. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The last time the Fed started raising interest rates, it was 11 years ago. Back then, Lehman Brothers was doing great. Lance Armstrong was a hero, and Donald Trump, well, he was just starting to fire people on his new reality TV show. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE APPRENTICE\")DONALD TRUMP: Guys, they killed you. They really gave you a good beating. You're going to be seeing the boardroom where somebody has to get fired. ARNOLD: Then, of course, the real financial crisis hit, and in response, the Fed dropped interest rates lower than it ever has in history. And they've stayed there for years. So what exactly did that do for us? It did a lot, says former U. S. treasury secretary Larry Summers. LARRY SUMMERS: Without low rates, more companies would have failed 'cause they couldn't service their debts. More households would've gone bankrupt, and large financial institutions would have been at greater risk of failure. ARNOLD: In other words. . . SUMMERS: Likely, we would've had a depression. ARNOLD: But the question now is, has the time come to start raising rates again? If you wait too long to raise rates, you risk inflation, asset bubbles and other problems. The U. S. economy has been recovering. We've gained back 13 million jobs. But Summers says no, not yet. Wages are still stagnant. The global economy appears to be in more trouble than we thought just a few months ago. SUMMERS: Raising rates is hitting the brakes on the American economy. It's not the moment to raise rates. ARNOLD: So Summers says the Fed faces a fork in the road, but he says one path is a lot more perilous than the other. He says there's more room to maneuver if the Fed chooses the path of not raising rates yet. SUMMERS: If the economy were to overheat, we have plenty of room to raise interest rates and slow it down. ARNOLD: But we don't have room in the other direction - that is, to drop rates lower 'cause they're already at rock-bottom. So the other path - if we start raising rates a bit and hit the brakes on the economy - Summers says that could be inviting big trouble. SUMMERS: Because there's very little in the fuel tank to use as stimulus. And so if we slow the economy down, we could have tipped off a dynamic that takes us towards recession and lower incomes. ARNOLD: OK, all that sounds really bad. So why would the Fed even consider raising rates now? William Dunkelberg is the chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. He says, sure, there's a camp of economists, including Summers, who want to keep rates low just in case. But. . . WILLIAM DUNKELBERG: Then you've got another set of people who say this is insane; none of this is real. ARNOLD: Dunkelberg is in that camp. He says this years-long intervention to keep rates low is unnatural and it's already causing problems. He says millions of retirees can't make any money on super-safe investments like treasuries and bank CDs, and he thinks that the Fed moving to raise rates now would be a show of confidence for the U. S. economy. He thinks that would encourage the business owners that he represents. DUNKELBERG: If we actually saw them move ahead, we would say, OK, finally, we have the green light from the Fed; they know everything, and we can go ahead and risk more and spend more. And that would help the economy, not hurt it. ARNOLD: We'll find out what the Fed will do after its meeting wraps up on Thursday. Chris Arnold, NPR News.

Short-term interest rates are going to stay right where they are near zero at least until the Fed meets again next month. Part of the reason for staying put - questions facing the global economy, especially China's slowdown. For reaction to the Fed's inaction, we turn to Megan Greene. She's managing director and chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, and she joins us from Boston. Welcome to the program once again. MEGAN GREENE: Thanks. SIEGEL: First, what do you think about the Fed leaving the rates untouched? GREENE: I think it was absolutely the right call and for two of the reasons that Yellen actually cited. One was that there seems to be a lot of slack lesson left in the labor market. And secondly, she's concerned about events happening outside the U. S. , and I think that's the right way to look at things. SIEGEL: You mentioned the labor market. Three years ago, the Fed said it would hold rates near zero until unemployment fell below 6-and-a-half percent. It's now 5. 1 percent. What makes the Fed so much more cautious than they thought they would be by this time? GREENE: Well, technically, the Fed has ticked off one of its two mandates, which is the unemployment side of things. But it hasn't come anywhere close to achieving its target on the inflation side of its mandate. That's its second mandate. Inflation is around 0. 2 percent. That's well below the Fed's target of 2 percent. And even if you strip out lower oil prices, it's still not quite at 2 percent. And I think that Yellen is afraid that as the U. S. dollar continues to get stronger, actually, the U. S. 's biggest import will be deflationary pressures. And also, you know, Yellen has said that she thinks that oil prices are transitory, but oil prices have been low for quite a while now. So at what point does transitory become actually the new normal? SIEGEL: Megan, you have to explain that a bit more. The Federal Reserve actually wants there to be more inflation than there is right now. Why? GREENE: That's right. There's sort of a sweet spot for central banks on inflation. If inflation is too high and prices are rising too quickly, people can't afford to buy things. But if it's too low, then, actually, people will wait to buy things because they can put it off, especially if there's deflation. It will get cheaper in the future, so they might as well wait. And both are bad for the economy. So the Fed would like to see prices rising at about 2 percent year on year. SIEGEL: They decided at their September meeting to keep things as they are. What's likely to change so much next month that they wouldn't make the same decision obviously? GREENE: Well, I don't think anything will change in the next month. In fact, I don't think anything will change in the next few months. I think that probably, we'll continue to see slack in the labor market, and we'll continue to see inflation stubbornly stuck on the floor well into next year. And I think that, you know, people are looking towards the Feds' next meeting - October, now - for the next hike. I don't think it will happen in October, least of all because there's no press conference scheduled to explain it. And the Fed needs to manage the message really carefully. But I don't think it will happen at the next meeting in December, either. I think the Fed may well have to wait until next year to start hiking. And then you look at the fact that, you know, GDP data's always really bad in the U. S. in the first quarter, so the Fed might have to wait through that. And eventually, there's an election coming, so there are a lot of considerations. SIEGEL: So for people in the financial sector, today was like NFL draft day for football fans - something like that - big deal. Who was really thrilled with this, and who's upset about it today? GREENE: Well, I think that, you know, borrowers are thrilled with this. Anybody with a mortgage, anybody, you know, having stumped up their house as collateral for a loan is excited about this because they're borrowing costs will continue to be lower. Savers and investors, on the other hand, won't be thrilled about it. The reality is, though, that most of us are both borrowers and savers, actually. So in net, it's hard to say exactly how we all come out. SIEGEL: Megan Greene, managing director and chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, spoke to us from Boston. Thanks for talking with us.

The Fed has kept short-term rates near zero for more than six years. Many people in the markets thought that era might end today. But as NPR's John Ydstie reports, developments in the global economy convinced Fed policymakers to hold off. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Many forecasters had pointed to U. S. job growth that's averaged over 200,000-a-month for years and an unemployment rate close to 5 percent to make the case that the Fed should begin raising interest rates. But in the end, Fed officials looked beyond U. S. borders to make their decision. In a news conference, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said a continued slowdown in growth in China and other developing countries convinced Fed officials they should wait. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: In light of the developments that we have seen and the impacts on financial markets, we want to take a little bit more time to evaluate the likely impacts on the United States. YDSTIE: One of the biggest concerns for Fed officials is that those developments in foreign economies are pushing down inflation, which is already lower than the Fed believes is good for economic growth. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: We're, after all, way below our inflation target. But an important reason for that is that declines in import prices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and declines in energy prices are holding down inflation well below our target and well below core inflation. YDSTIE: Yellen said one important remedy for lower inflation is a tighter labor market with more people working and employers pushing up wages as they compete for workers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: A tighter labor market, a labor market moving toward full unemployment, is one that historically has generated upward pressure on inflation. YDSTIE: Yellen said the current low labor force participation rate means there are still lots of people on the sideline who would like to work. She said that probably means the current unemployment rate of 5. 1 percent understates the real level of unemployment. Yellen was also asked about one criticism from those who believe the Fed should be raising rates now. The critics argue low rates have benefited the wealthy by pushing stock prices higher and increased income inequality. She said she disagrees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: To me, the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work. YDSTIE: And she said since unemployment is concentrated among the lowest-earning workers, putting people back to work is a force for reducing inequality. Yellen was also asked whether a looming government shutdown that could come if Congress doesn't pass a budget by the end of the month had anything to do with the decision by Fed officials to hold off on a rate hike. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: It played absolutely no role in our decision. I believe it's the responsibility of Congress to pass a budget, to fund the government, to deal with the debt ceiling so that America pays its bills. We have a good recovery in place that's really making progress, and to see Congress take actions that would endanger that progress, I think that would be more than unfortunate. YDSTIE: The stock market reacted positively immediately after the Fed said it would not raise rates but lost ground later in the day. The major index has ended mixed. Interest rates fell.

Every year, German car enthusiasts flock to the Frankfurt Auto Show. But this year, the world's largest such event is taking place amid the Volkswagen emissions scandal. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley is in Frankfurt and has the story. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking German). ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: The Frankfurt Auto Show is a car lover's paradise. Plunged into a world of gleaming new cars and cutting edge technology, you'd think it would be the perfect place to get the scoop on the Volkswagen scandal. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We don't give any statements. If you would like to get information about news, I'd like to ask you to contact our press department. BEARDSLEY: But no one working for Volkswagen, Porsche or Audi will talk about it at all, and other carmakers seem guarded. Still, regular Germans are ready to open up. Michael Kornath says his VW car happens to be one of eight million vehicles with the emissions-evading devices attached to its diesel motor. MICHAEL KORNATH: And I talked with them, what I shall do now. BEARDSLEY: What'd they say? KORNATH: And they say wait. BEARDSLEY: Kornath doesn't believe this is only a German scandal. So far there's no evidence that any other carmaker attached these devices to its motors, but Kornath thinks other country's carmakers have been evading emissions tests, too. He says it's just a matter of time before they're discovered. KORNATH: It's normal in our time, I think. It's not a good thing, and it's good that it is found. But in 20-30 years, we do not speak about cars with fuel, only with electricity. And that's a good thing, I think, for the next generation. BEARDSLEY: When the doors close tonight on the 10-day auto show, some one million people will have visited. Despite the scandal, the crowds are wowed by the show's massive display of lights, technology and speed. JIMMY DAY: Hold on tight and here we go. BEARDSLEY: You can take a ride in a simulator to see what it feels like to be a Formula 1 racecar driver. Simulator operator Jimmy Day describes the experience. DAY: Simulating two laps around the Barcelona circuit with Jenson Button. It's the real car data and the real footage. It's a pure adrenaline simulator. BEARDSLEY: And you know those pretty young women who are always standing beside the cars in magazines and at car shows? Hello. MANUELA CANOSA: Hello. BEARDSLEY: (Speaking German). I decide to go talk to one - model Manuela Canosa. She says the VW scandal hasn't affected her 'cause the job and the money are still good. CANOSA: Yes, I like it. It's so easy because you only have to stay here and smiling and, oh, it's kind of good feeling. BEARDSLEY: But many people do not have a good feeling this year at the Frankfurt car show. The scandal has cast a pall over Volkswagen and called into question the excellence of German manufacturing. Volkswagen's new CEO, Mathias Muller, has promised to get to the bottom of the affair and restore trust in the company. But VW's stock has plummeted and dealerships are reporting a drop in sales. PR consultant Hasso Manfeld says in the past, other German companies have been caught up in scandals - take Deutschebank and Siemens - but he says damage to the country's automobile sector is something else. HASSO MANFELD: That is part of our self-identity, the art of German engineering, that is which hits us into the core. BEARDSLEY: The U. S. and Switzerland have temporarily halted the import of new VW diesel vehicles, and Spain has asked Volkswagen to return government subsidies for producing clean cars. Speaking of former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, Sunday's edition of newspaper Frankfurter Algemeine asks, how much did he know? And at the Frankfurt car show, German pride has given way to angst.

It's so easy because you only have to stay here and smiling and, oh, it's kind of good feeling. BEARDSLEY: But many people do not have a good feeling this year at the Frankfurt car show. The scandal has cast a pall over Volkswagen and called into question the excellence of German manufacturing. Volkswagen's new CEO, Mathias Muller, has promised to get to the bottom of the affair and restore trust in the company. But VW's stock has plummeted and dealerships are reporting a drop in sales. PR consultant Hasso Manfeld says in the past, other German companies have been caught up in scandals - take Deutschebank and Siemens - but he says damage to the country's automobile sector is something else. HASSO MANFELD: That is part of our self-identity, the art of German engineering, that is which hits us into the core. BEARDSLEY: The U. S. and Switzerland have temporarily halted the import of new VW diesel vehicles, and Spain has asked Volkswagen to return government subsidies for producing clean cars. Speaking of former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, Sunday's edition of newspaper Frankfurter Algemeine asks, how much did he know? And at the Frankfurt car show, German pride has given way to angst.

Millions of Americans have recently gotten new credit or debit cards with a chip on the front. So instead of swiping, you'll insert the card chip-first into the card reader. By this Thursday, stores are supposed have the equipment in place to handle the new cards. Otherwise, they could be liable for fraudulent transactions. We wanted to catch up with Brian Krebs before this deadline. He's author of the blog Krebs on Security. BRIAN KREBS: The chip is a long-overdue piece of technology that most of the rest of the world has already adopted. But it's basically designed to keep fraudsters from easily and cheaply being able to counterfeit your card in the event that they're somehow able to steal that information. SHAPIRO: Now, these chip cards are often called chip-and-PIN cards because they come with a PIN code just like an ATM card has a PIN code. KREBS: Correct. SHAPIRO: Should retailers be asking you to punch in that four-digit PIN every time you use a chip card? KREBS: Well, it depends on who you ask. The main benefit of having a PIN code is that it protects against lost and stolen fraud. But according to the banks, this is the smallest portion of all the types of different card fraud. It's not really worth it, the aggravation for them, but more importantly to consumers who, you know, have a tendency to forget their PIN or they have to reset it and all these kinds of things. Their perspective - it doesn't really add that much more security. SHAPIRO: Interesting. So you're saying that if I drop my credit card on the sidewalk, the PIN code would prevent somebody picking up the card from using it. But that kind of fraud is actually much more rare than someone just hacking into a computer system and stealing all of the info. And the PIN won't help with that. KREBS: Exactly. SHAPIRO: You know, I just moved to the U. S. a couple of weeks ago from London, and I'm not sure that Americans appreciate what a huge difference there is in the way people use their credit cards in Europe compared to the way people use their credit cards in the U. S. In Europe, it is just standard. You stick your chip card in the machine. You punch in four digits, and you never sign a thing. If you try to swipe your card, people look at you like you're living in the 19th century. KREBS: (Laughter). Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I mean, if you talk to the card associations with Visa and MasterCard, they'll tell you privately that, look; none of the banks want to be the hardest card to use in the wallet, right? So the average consumer has two or three credit cards in their wallet, and one of them always requires them to put their PIN in. Well, they just won't use that. And so the banks have just kind of fallen back and said, by and large, we're going to continue to allow people to use these chip cards without actually entering a PIN. SHAPIRO: Is this shift clearly an improvement? KREBS: It is an improvement. Although, you know, it's not something that's going to fix the situation overnight. I mean, if you listen to Visa and MasterCard and you listen to the proponents of chip card technology, you might think that all of this fraud is going to evaporate overnight. It's not. When you make it harder for fraudsters to commit a certain type of crime, they don't just go away, you know? They go somewhere else. In every country that's moved to chip cards, what we've seen is an explosion in what they call card-not-present fraud. It's basically e-commerce fraud. SHAPIRO: Online retailers instead of big box stores - yeah? KREBS: That's correct. And I think we're also going to see an increase in account takeovers and new account fraud, where people use your personal information to open new accounts in your name.

DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Stepping off his recent flight from Boston at Chicago's O'Hare airport, education consultant Debashis Sengupta looked a little surprised. DEBASHIS SENGUPTA: The flight today was actually quite nice, no problems at all - in fact, not something I was expecting from United. SCHAPER: This frequent flier says an uneventful on-time flight from United is the exception, not the rule. SENGUPTA: Right off the bat, disclosure that I'm not a fond customer of United at all. SCHAPER: Why is that? Is that based on experience? SENGUPTA: Yes, yeah, I've never had a good flight experience. SCHAPER: The 53-year-old Sengupta says he feels packed in like sardines on United's planes. And the flights, he says, are very often delayed. Another frequent flier, 49-year-old Kathy Karlesses of Philadelphia, says she finds flying United. . . KATHY KARLESSES: Not that great. Yeah, they're on-time performance is pretty dismal, and service in the air is nothing special. SCHAPER: Karlesses says she, too, was shocked when her United flights are not delayed. Government figures show the nation's second-largest airline consistently lags behind its competitors in on-time performance. In July, more than a quarter of United's flights arrived late. Only Frontier and Spirit Airlines were worse. In the latest J. D. Power Airline Quality Survey, United ranks dead last among major carriers in customer satisfaction. Karlesses says she's considering taking her business elsewhere. KARLESSES: I'd think they would make it easier for me to stay loyal, but they're making it, like, painfully hard to stay. VICKI BRYAN: Every way that you can measure an airline's performance, they fail. SCHAPER: Vicki Bryan is an airline industry analyst for Gimme Credit. She says United's troubles extend beyond flight operations to its website, its reservation and check-in systems and employee relations. And she says that's costing the airline. BRYAN: They have ceded market share in the most lucrative kinds of passenger segments - you know, the business class customer. SCHAPER: In a recent email to frequent fliers, United's new CEO, Oscar Munoz, acknowledged customer service and reliability troubles, saying, we can do better. And in a conference call the day he took over the beleaguered airline, Munoz told analysts the company needs to improve service. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OSCAR MUNOZ: At the front of everything we do is, we have to realize that we have millions of human beings traveling on our equipment, and they're trying to get someplace, either a business or a family event. And we just got to think of a service excellence model that all of us can work together. SCHAPER: Already, United is simplifying some of its domestic routes to help minimize delays that tend to ripple across the country when bad weather hits. A United spokeswoman says the airline has also made recent investments in improving food, frequent flier clubs, facilities and operations. But in addition to winning back customers, United must also find a way to boost the morale of its workers. SARA NELSON: Employees are incredibly upset.

He wants to sharply cut taxes on individuals and businesses, but he also wants to cap the number of deductions and loopholes that taxpayers can take. Trump says this would give the U. S. economy a much-needed jolt. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The Trump plan incorporates a lot of ideas that Congress has been batting around for years although they've never gone anywhere. First, Trump wants to address the U. S. corporate tax rate. On paper, it's now the highest in the developed world. Although, many companies are able to lower it through tax credits and deductions. Trump wants to sharply cut the corporate tax rate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 company to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig, will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. ZARROLI: Trump notes that U. S. corporations don't pay taxes on the money they make in foreign countries until they bring it back into the United States, so they tend to keep it overseas a long time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can't bring it back into this country. We file papers. We've been doing this for a year and a half. You can't get it back in. ZARROLI: Even worse, Trump says, the high effective tax rate encourages companies to relocate overseas. If the corporate tax rate is lowered, Trump says, companies will be willing to bring money back home where they can use it to invest and create jobs. Trump would also make large cuts in personal income taxes. There would be four tax brackets instead of seven. Trump says no individual making less than $25,000 a year would pay income tax. Tax Analyst's Lee Sheppard says that's not as big a deal as it sounds since people in that bracket tend not to pay much in income tax anyway. LEE SHEPPARD: Ever since George W. Bush did the big tax cut, people in the lower brackets have paid very, very little income tax. They've been almost taken out of the income tax entirely. ZARROLI: Trump maintains that higher income taxpayers would end up paying more money under his plan because he would cap the number of deductions people can take. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: In other words, it's going to cost me a fortune. ZARROLI: But Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation is skeptical about that claim. He says limiting deductions would hurt some rich people, but he says that would be more than offset by the huge cut in top tax rates that Trump is proposing from nearly 40 percent to 25 percent. KYLE POMERLEAU: Unless there is something he is not telling us, very high-income individuals are going to see a lower tax bill, not a higher tax bill. ZARROLI: Pomerleau also questions another claim made by Trump. Trump says that by cutting and capping deductions, more and more people would end up having to pay taxes even though their rates would be lower. And as a result, he says, the plan would be revenue neutral. But Pomerleau doesn't buy that. POMERLEAU: Even though he has some of these base-broadening provisions, his plan is going to substantially increase the deficit. ZARROLI: And if Trump's plan ever gets that far, it's likely to face concern in Congress about its potential impact on the budget. Likewise, many of the deductions in the tax code are politically very popular, and Trump is likely to find that cutting them is a lot harder than it looks. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

S. roads. The Volkswagen recall involves about half a million of them. There have been much larger auto recalls, but this one is getting so much attention in part because of the brazen way in which Volkswagen disregarded the rules. NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports that VW customers are weighing what it'll take to make them feel whole again. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: David Chien of Williston, Vt. , was looking for a bigger fuel-efficient car that could power its way through Northeastern snow, so he purchased a 2013 Jetta Sportwagen. DAVID CHIEN: This car seemed to check all the boxes. NOGUCHI: Chien likes the car. It drives well, and the mileage is even better than he expected. But he wonders whether the scandal has affected its value. What would insurance pay, for example, in the event of an accident? And then there's the prospect of a fix, which he hopes won't affect all the things he likes about his car. CHIEN: I'd be willing to consider, I think, a minimal impact on performance and fuel economy, you know, less than 10 percent. But if it's a significant impact, then I won't be happy with that, no. NOGUCHI: In a video message to owners posted over the weekend, Volkswagen America president Michael Horn apologized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL HORN: We are cooperating closely regulatory authorities to develop a remedy. NOGUCHI: A remedy that will involve software and, depending on the vehicle, hardware as well. Auto experts say it's unclear how much all this will cost and how it will affect how the car runs. Arvind Thiruvengadam says much depends on the reason the carmaker implemented the cheat in the first place. He's an engineering professor at West Virginia University and part of the team that discovered Volkswagen's cheating mechanism. He says it may be possible to find a fix that cures the problems without affecting performance or gas mileage. ARVIND THIRUVENGADAM: It's not unheard of to produce both low emissions and high fuel economy. Of course, there will be costs associated with it, and that could be one of the reasoning, too, for why it wasn't done in the first place. NOGUCHI: Thiruvengadam says there are many different types of models, so in each instance, the question is the complexity of the engineering involved and then the cost. But others say they expect many consumers will remain unsatisfied. Steve Berman is one of the first lawyers to file a class-action lawsuit the day Volkswagen announced the problem. STEVE BERMAN: It seems unlikely to me, based on what I know, that the fix will properly control emissions as advertised and not affect performance because if that was the case, they wouldn't have cheated to begin with. NOGUCHI: Berman says he's gotten 8,000 inquiries from car owners in the last two weeks, far more than any other car recall case he's handled. He himself owns three Volkswagen diesel cars. BERMAN: Well, that's why I jumped on the case so fast. I was completely flabbergasted. I mean, I really bought into this concept that clean diesel, you know, is the best gas mileage and the best air emission byproduct that you can do as a consumer. NOGUCHI: Just over three months ago, David Whitcomb purchased his 2015 VW Passat TDI. DAVID WHITCOMB: I wanted something that was clean because I consider myself to be an environmentalist. NOGUCHI: Whitcomb, who lives in Waynesboro, Va. , says he paid a premium for the diesel engine because he thought it meant fewer emissions. It seems unlikely, Whitcomb says, that a fix won't affect the car's value or performance. WHITCOMB: There's got to be some kind of compensation to offset that because what - if what you're sold is not what you actually have because they broke the law and lied, then there's something wrong there. NOGUCHI: Beyond that, he says, the wind's out of his sails. WHITCOMB: I have owned four Volkswagens. I still currently own three. And so I was a promoter of Volkswagen. It's hard to - I can't speak like that anymore. NOGUCHI: Much depends, he says, on how well Volkswagen engineers its fix. Yuki Noguchi, NPR News, Washington.

DAVID CHIEN: This car seemed to check all the boxes. NOGUCHI: Chien likes the car. It drives well, and the mileage is even better than he expected. But he wonders whether the scandal has affected its value. What would insurance pay, for example, in the event of an accident? And then there's the prospect of a fix, which he hopes won't affect all the things he likes about his car. CHIEN: I'd be willing to consider, I think, a minimal impact on performance and fuel economy, you know, less than 10 percent. But if it's a significant impact, then I won't be happy with that, no. NOGUCHI: In a video message to owners posted over the weekend, Volkswagen America president Michael Horn apologized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL HORN: We are cooperating closely regulatory authorities to develop a remedy. NOGUCHI: A remedy that will involve software and, depending on the vehicle, hardware as well. Auto experts say it's unclear how much all this will cost and how it will affect how the car runs. Arvind Thiruvengadam says much depends on the reason the carmaker implemented the cheat in the first place. He's an engineering professor at West Virginia University and part of the team that discovered Volkswagen's cheating mechanism. He says it may be possible to find a fix that cures the problems without affecting performance or gas mileage. ARVIND THIRUVENGADAM: It's not unheard of to produce both low emissions and high fuel economy. Of course, there will be costs associated with it, and that could be one of the reasoning, too, for why it wasn't done in the first place. NOGUCHI: Thiruvengadam says there are many different types of models, so in each instance, the question is the complexity of the engineering involved and then the cost. But others say they expect many consumers will remain unsatisfied. Steve Berman is one of the first lawyers to file a class-action lawsuit the day Volkswagen announced the problem. STEVE BERMAN: It seems unlikely to me, based on what I know, that the fix will properly control emissions as advertised and not affect performance because if that was the case, they wouldn't have cheated to begin with. NOGUCHI: Berman says he's gotten 8,000 inquiries from car owners in the last two weeks, far more than any other car recall case he's handled. He himself owns three Volkswagen diesel cars. BERMAN: Well, that's why I jumped on the case so fast. I was completely flabbergasted. I mean, I really bought into this concept that clean diesel, you know, is the best gas mileage and the best air emission byproduct that you can do as a consumer. NOGUCHI: Just over three months ago, David Whitcomb purchased his 2015 VW Passat TDI. DAVID WHITCOMB: I wanted something that was clean because I consider myself to be an environmentalist. NOGUCHI: Whitcomb, who lives in Waynesboro, Va. , says he paid a premium for the diesel engine because he thought it meant fewer emissions. It seems unlikely, Whitcomb says, that a fix won't affect the car's value or performance. WHITCOMB: There's got to be some kind of compensation to offset that because what - if what you're sold is not what you actually have because they broke the law and lied, then there's something wrong there. NOGUCHI: Beyond that, he says, the wind's out of his sails. WHITCOMB: I have owned four Volkswagens. I still currently own three. And so I was a promoter of Volkswagen. It's hard to - I can't speak like that anymore. NOGUCHI: Much depends, he says, on how well Volkswagen engineers its fix.

That's a problem Europe is facing now with Syrian refugees, and it's something the U. S. faced 35 years ago. Planet Money's Stacey Vanek Smith has the story. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: In 1980, Fidel Castro did something very unexpected. He said people who wanted to leave Cuba could go. Before that, almost no one had been allowed to leave. And over the next few months, thousands of Cubans left in sailboats, fishing boats, little makeshift rafts. Mirta Ojito was one of them. She was 16 at the time. MIRTA OJITO: I had just sat down to have lunch, egg sandwich with ketchup, which is when the police came to our house, knocked on the door and said there was a boat waiting for you at the port. SMITH: Ojito and her family crowded onto a little tugboat called the Manana and set sail for the U. S. Ojito fell asleep on the deck of the boat with her mother holding on to her ankle. OJITO: I woke up in the morning. The sun woke me up. And by then, we could already tell that we were already near the United States because there were lots and lots of boats around. And we docked in Key West around noon. SMITH: One-hundred-twenty-five thousand Cubans arrived in Florida over the next few months. Most stayed in Miami, which was a perfect opportunity for economist David Card to answer a big economic question. What happens to an economy when there is a large influx of people? DAVID CARD: The prevailing view was that we would expect at least a short-run effect. SMITH: So what did you find? CARD: Well, I didn't find any evidence of that. SMITH: So 80,000 refugees came to Miami, and there was no effect on the economy? CARD: You couldn't detect any strong evidence of an effect one way or the other. SMITH: No effect, not on wages, not on unemployment rates. Card says this is because there is not a fixed number of jobs in an economy. When a bunch of new people come, yes, they get jobs. But they also start buying stuff, getting haircuts, going to the grocery store, which means you need more barbers and more grocers. That creates more jobs. CARD: So if we have more people, we get more jobs. If we have fewer people, we're going to have fewer jobs. SMITH: There is some debate about the short-term effect on the wages of low-skilled workers. But overall, economists pretty much agree immigrants don't drive down wages, don't take jobs, even when they arrive by the boatload. Mirta Ojito says getting work was surprisingly easy for her parents. OJITO: We arrived Monday. By Thursday, my parents were working. And the following Monday, I started summer school. SMITH: Ojito's father drove a truck, eventually started his own company. Ojito went to college, became a reporter, and eventually went to work for The New York Times, covering immigration.

ARNOLD: No, we were thinking this might just be a kind of regular old, boring, much-of-the-same jobs report. But it really was disappointing and in a few different ways. I mean, first of all, the headline number, we gained 148,000 jobs, average for the year has been 200,000. So that was disappointing. We were also hoping that the previous month's numbers for the last couple of months would be revised higher. That didn't happen. In fact, they were revised lower.

But now we've had two jobs reports in a row that are worse than expected. There were those revisions. Also, wages have remained flat. Labor force participation actually went down in this last month.

The agreement is a big win for President Obama, but he still faces a tough time getting it approved by Congress. For more, we turn now to NPR's Jim Zarroli. Good morning. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Tell us exactly what this agreement is meant to do and what it means for trade along the coasts of the Pacific and in the Pacific, the Pacific Rim. ZARROLI: Yeah, it has the potential to be real milestone in trade. It involves the United States and some of its biggest and most important trading partners, Canada, Japan, Mexico. It also includes a lot of smaller economies, Malaysia, Singapore, Chile, Peru, Australia, New Zealand. One big, big exception is China which was not part of the talks. And basically, these countries that are a part of the agreement amount to 40 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economies. So the agreement - it lowers many but not all of tariffs and trade barriers. It comes up with a consistent set of rules that will apply to businesses that want to trade with each other. It sort of requires everyone to play by the same rules, and the goal, as the Obama administration has said, is to facilitate trade in the Pacific Rim. MONTAGNE: And this agreement has, essentially, been in the works since 2008. Why so long to come up with an accord? ZARROLI: You know, there were big disagreements among the countries, as you might expect, over, you know, for instance, New Zealand's access to dairy markets. You know, the United States and other countries disagreed about the length of copyrights for biologic drugs, disagreements about auto production. You know, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of in the nature of these things. Lots of different countries - they have competing interests. Businesses want to protect their turf.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)ED FAST: Each one of us comes to the table with a clear goal of promoting and defending the interests of our own country, of our own economies. And that often means that there are very - some very tough discussions that take place. And at the end of the day, here we are as 12 TPP partners having achieved something that some time ago people didn't think was achievable. MONTAGNE: Canada's minister of international trade, although - not so fast - it has not quite been achieved in the U. S. It's got to clear some political hurdles. Tell us about that. ZARROLI: Yeah, all of these trade ministers have to go back home and sell the agreement, basically, to their legislatures, and that's going to be a challenge. You know, President Obama has spent a lot of political capital on the agreement. He says it will be good for businesses, good for farmers, and, as you might expect, he has a lot of support in the business world. But in Congress the reception is less clear. There's a lot of suspicion of trade pacts right now, especially among Democrats. And Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is, of course, running for president, issued a statement right away saying he was very disappointed, Wall Street and big corporations have won again. Among Republicans, I think the administration has a lot more support, but this will be voted on early next year, and that is right in the middle of the presidential election campaign, and that really complicates the politics of this a lot.

That's where we try to understand the stories we'll be hearing more about in the coming days by parsing some of the words associated with them. Today, our word, or in this case phrase, is legal scrub. Yes, it sounds like a new skincare product, but it's actually a phrase we'll be hearing in connection with a massive new trade deal. Here to tell us more is Marilyn Geewax. She is a senior business editor for NPR. Marilyn, thanks for joining us. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: So what's a legal scrub, and what does it have to do with trade? GEEWAX: (Laughter) It's not for acne. This is - the U. S. trade representative uses this phrase to try to describe what's going to be happening in the coming days with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's that huge agreement that brings together the United States, Japan, 10 other countries around the Pacific Ocean. But now, they actually need to turn all of those agreements - everything they think they agreed to has to be turned into very legal language. So you need translators, lawyers, all kind of staffers to go through all these mountains of documents and make sure that they actually say what you intended to say. And that's trickier than you might think, you know, because you're talking about 12 different countries. There are a lot of languages involved. In a little tiny place like Singapore, they have four official languages. So all of this has to be scrubbed, make it shiny and nice and exact, and then they have something that they can actually take to their legislatures for passage. MARTIN: So is this just a formality, or is it actually more important than that? GEEWAX: Well, it's sort of turning out to be politically important, in the United States especially. You know, we've got a lot of turmoil going on in Congress. Congress will have to sign off on this deal. So by having this legal scrub not yet completed, it allows everyone involved to say you know what? - I really need to see what the language says. And it's true. I mean, you really do want to see the details. Some of these things can be very tricky, you know, complex legal issues. The members of Congress want their staffers to really go over it and make sure that, you know, if you have a dairy farmer in your district that it's really going to help that person. So they want this scrubbed. They want the perfect translation. They want to see the final deal. But it also gives them a legitimate way to say hold on, I've got to take another look. MARTIN: Is this a public process? For example, do the lawyers involved have to allow the public to review their work? I mean, who gets the final say if people disagree over what the meaning of a phrase is? GEEWAX: Yeah. They really do - they literally work that out privately. They have to sit there and argue back and forth - what does this word mean in Japanese, what does it mean in English - you know, and come up with exact mirror language so that it's all the same. But when it's done, it will have to be released to the public. And then everyone can see it for a minimum of 60 days that it's required for the public to be able to see it. And Congress will have even longer than that to study these details. So this scrubbed version will be available to us. MARTIN: And so the scrub is supposed to take about a month as I understand it. GEEWAX: Yes. MARTIN: Just very briefly if you would - who's for it and who's against it? I understand that this isn't really a neat, right-left divide on this. GEEWAX: Boy, it's really a complicated situation. Most Democrats are against it, although those who tend to face the Pacific. . . MARTIN: Except for the president. He's kind of a Democrat - big Democrat, important. GEEWAX: Well, the president is an important Democrat who says we need to pivot to Asia. And all the Democrats that are sort of living on the nation's left coast, all of the folks who face the Pacific in California, Oregon, Washington, they tend to be for it, those Democrats. Most Republicans favor a trade deal, but some are very skeptical about this president. And they literally have said - some have said if he negotiated it, then I can't trust it. So there are some Republicans who are opposing this as well. MARTIN: NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax telling us about the legal scrub. Marilyn, thanks so much for joining us.

They have to sit there and argue back and forth - what does this word mean in Japanese, what does it mean in English - you know, and come up with exact mirror language so that it's all the same. But when it's done, it will have to be released to the public. And then everyone can see it for a minimum of 60 days that it's required for the public to be able to see it. And Congress will have even longer than that to study these details. So this scrubbed version will be available to us. MARTIN: And so the scrub is supposed to take about a month as I understand it. GEEWAX: Yes. MARTIN: Just very briefly if you would - who's for it and who's against it? I understand that this isn't really a neat, right-left divide on this. GEEWAX: Boy, it's really a complicated situation. Most Democrats are against it, although those who tend to face the Pacific. . . MARTIN: Except for the president. He's kind of a Democrat - big Democrat, important. GEEWAX: Well, the president is an important Democrat who says we need to pivot to Asia. And all the Democrats that are sort of living on the nation's left coast, all of the folks who face the Pacific in California, Oregon, Washington, they tend to be for it, those Democrats. Most Republicans favor a trade deal, but some are very skeptical about this president. And they literally have said - some have said if he negotiated it, then I can't trust it. So there are some Republicans who are opposing this as well. MARTIN: NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax telling us about the legal scrub. Marilyn, thanks so much for joining us.

It's had a big impact on policymakers around the world. And today, it also won the 69-year-old Princeton University professor the Nobel Prize for Economics. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Angus Deaton has spent much of his career studying the way economic statistics are compiled and how they're used and misused around the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANGUS DEATON: I feel passionately about measurement - about how difficult it is, about how much theory and conceptualization is involved in measurement and indeed how much politics is involved. ZARROLI: Deaton says traditional attempts to measure things like poverty have been deeply problematic. It's not just a matter of measuring income levels because living conditions vary so much from country to country and within countries themselves. Christina Paxson is the president of Brown University and a former colleague of Deaton's. CHRISTINA PAXSON: I think Angus has always been very interested in living standards - what makes people as well-off as they are, and what does well-off even mean? How do we think about that? ZARROLI: So Deaton has taken a much more nuanced approach to economic statistics, probing deep into the numbers in a way that differs from traditional measurements. PAXSON: He's somebody who, you know, sort of is fearless about asking questions and pushing data and trying to understand the roots of some very basic questions in economics. ZARROLI: Deaton does this by looking not at people's income levels, but at what they consume - what they wear, their life expectancy and education levels. His work has illuminated some of the complexities of poverty, and it has been enormously influential among policymakers, NGOs and international institutions such as the World Bank. Abhijit Banerjee is a professor of economics at MIT. ABHIJIT BANERJEE: There's a kind of a policy world, which is often mechanistic about the interpretation of poverty. And one of the things he has done is challenge that. ZARROLI: Deaton was born in Scotland and is a dual citizen of the U. S. and the U. K. He writes A Letter From America for the Royal Economic Society newsletter that is wry, learned and very accessible. He once used \"Downton Abbey\" to make a broader point about Obamacare. In his writings, Deaton has been skeptical about foreign aid and attempts by rich countries to improve the lives of poor ones, and for that he was criticized by Bill Gates. Deaton also expresses great concern about income inequality and the lives of those left behind by globalization. At a press conference at Princeton today, he sounded an alarm about the long-term slowdown in growth in rich countries. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DEATON: That slowing growth poisons everything. It makes politics much harder. It makes people's lives noticeably worse, especially the people on the bottom. And if you put that together with the rising inequality, there's many people in the rich world who are really suffering. ZARROLI: Deaton says there are still some 700 million poor people in the world. But in his 2013 book \"The Great Escape,\" Deaton also wrote that living standards have risen enormously over the last 250 years. People are living longer and becoming much better educated and healthier. They no longer have to watch one-quarter of their children die.

MICHAEL FINNEGAN: It's got an economy that's really narrowly dependent on tourism. And when the economy crashed in 2008, the tourism stopped, and it had kind of a domino effect where then, you know, construction stopped. And jobs dried up, and people started going into foreclosure. So it was a very kind of intense experience of the recession in Nevada. MCEVERS: But there is some building going on in Nevada, right? FINNEGAN: There is construction going on, but it's really interesting. I was out on the outskirts of Las Vegas kind of where the suburbs fade into the desert, and you can see some housing construction resuming.

The unemployment rate in Nevada at that time was only about 4 percent. And almost as soon as they started building, the economy started going bad.

And the stuff that the candidates are saying about the problems that they're experiencing with, you know, anecdotal - this was a small group of people. But nothing was resonating in any serious way.

State regulated systems are supposed to pay medical bills and lost wages when workers are injured on the job. Earlier this year, NPR and ProPublica reported that dozens of states have either cut workers' comp benefits or made them more difficult to get. And here's what's new this morning. Employers in two states are dumping out of workers' comp completely and providing fewer benefits. That's what NPR and ProPublica found after reviewing dozens of employer injury plans that replaced workers' comp. Here's NPR's Howard Berkes. HOWARD BERKES, BYLINE: Bill Minick says his Texas company, ParternerSource, has saved clients a billion dollars, money they didn't have to spend on workers' compensation. They avoided expensive treatment and litigation and delayed medical care by opting out of workers' comp. BILL MINICK: We can take care of injured workers more effectively, get them back to their families and to their work as productive members of society, save incredible amounts of money that create new jobs. That's what we do. BERKES: Some of Minick's clients pay more for lost wages in their own workplace injury plans. But NPR and ProPublica reviewed more than 100 of these opt-out plans. In Texas and Oklahoma, the two states that permit them, we found fewer benefits, tougher qualifying rules, even failures to comply with state law, regulators powerless to respond and workers suffering as a result. In Oklahoma, 32-year-old Rachel Jenkins was injured at work in March. The single mother of four tried to protect a client from an attacker at a sheltered workshop for disabled adults. RACHEL JENKINS: We went down to the ground, and that's when I heard my back crack. I had to put all my strength into this man, and that's when I hurt my shoulder. BERKES: Jenkins worked for ResCare, one of 59 employers in Oklahoma who've opted out of workers' comp. They're supposed to provide the same forms of benefits, but NPR and ProPublica found major gaps. And Jenkins' experience is one example. If ResCare had workers' comp, she would've had 30 days to report her injury. But when Jenkins notified ResCare, she was told she was too late to qualify for benefits. JENKINS: Because I didn't call the number within 24 hours. And I kept telling her, you know, I went to the emergency room. They put me on some powerful medicine, but I was two or three hours late from calling the number. She just kept repeating that over and over. She was like, I understand you got four kids, but there's nothing I can do. BERKES: Bob Burke is Jenkins' attorney. BOB BURKE: Everybody ought to report injuries quickly. But if they don't because a well-meaning employee thinks, oh, this is going to go away. . . Just giving the employer the right to deny all benefits - and no matter how serious the injury is - because it was not reported to a toll-free number within 24 hours, I believe is wrong. BERKES: Almost all of Oklahoma's opt-out plans have reporting deadlines of 24 hours or less. And most are so similar because most were written by Bill Minick's PartnerSource. Minick says employers can make exceptions. And in fact, ResCare did that for Rachel Jenkins. MINICK: Simply by voicing the concern and by having the claim reviewed informally, it was determined that that was not a good denial. It was not fair to the injured worker. BERKES: Actually, co-workers complained to ResCare. And 16 days after the incident, the company agreed to provide benefits. MINICK: And so the system worked. BERKES: Well, not to Rachel Jenkins, given 16 days of pain while unable to afford treatment and worried about getting back to work. JENKINS: I went through hell, a whole lot of pain where I was in tears. I was just thinking about, how am I going to take care of my kids? BERKES: It's not just reporting deadlines. NPR and ProPublica found that most approved Oklahoma plans don't comply with state law. The law permits settlements that provide lump sum payments instead of years of benefits. These settlements must be voluntary, but they're mandatory in most of the plans. Employers decide when to settle and how much to pay. And if workers say no, they get no benefits. Attorney Bob Burke doesn't blame PartnerSource or ResCare for problems with Oklahoma's alternative to workers' comp. BURKE: My fight is with the insurance commissioner of Oklahoma who approved that plan that clearly does not provide for the same benefits as required by statute. BERKES: So why were these plans approved? Gordon Amini is general counsel of the State Insurance Department. GORDON AMINI: It's my opinion that the Insurance Department does not have the statutory authority to disapprove or deny based on the content of the benefit plan. BERKES: So when the Insurance Department wrote employers and PartnerSource about problems in their plans, it focused almost exclusively on punctuation, spelling, language and even formatting. That's what NPR and ProPublica found in hundreds of pages of agency emails. The agency didn't even notice mandatory settlements until we asked about them, according to Amini. Bill Minick of PartnerSource says the plans will be revised, which Amini says the agency expects. MINICK: But it sounds like there's nobody who can make them do it. AMINI: The statute does provide an appeal process for denial of benefits that are not paid. MINICK: So it's up to the employees to enforce the validity of these plans. AMINI: It's up to the employee to enforce the requirements in regard to benefits. You bet. BERKES: Attorney Bob Burke is trying to get opt-out declared unconstitutional. BURKE: In every other area of the law, some government agency maintains accountability. It's asinine to think that any accountability factor would be put on the backs of the victim. BERKES: The harshest critics call opt-out a throwback to the industrial age before workers' compensation. But Oklahoma employers who opt out get to keep the biggest workers' comp benefit for them. They can't be sued for workplace accidents. As for Rachel Jenkins, she was eventually sent to an ear, nose and throat specialist for her back and shoulder injuries. He was a qualified doctor, says a ResCare spokeswoman, and he referred Jenkins to an orthopedic specialist, according to medical records which show ResCare rejected that referral. JENKINS: I'm still in pain to this day. I can't sleep at night. I need to see a doctor to really see what's going on with me. BERKES: And why aren't you doing that on your own? JENKINS: Because I don't have the insurance, and I don't have the money. BERKES: Opt-out is about a year old in Oklahoma. PartnerSource and state lawmakers promise adjustments, but there's no pause in spreading the opt-out gospel. A lobbying group is working in South Carolina and Tennessee. Bill Minick envisions a dozen opt-out states by the end of the decade. Howard Berkes, NPR News.

In essence, the government says people don't need that since the cost of living for the elderly has not gone up. To find out more, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so, like, someone over 65 right now may be - many people across America - screaming at the radio, what do you mean the cost of living has not gone on up? That's what the question will be. So what does the government mean that the cost of living really hasn't gone up for seniors? WESSEL: Well, since the mid-1970s, Social Security benefits have been adjusted automatically for inflation every January based on the September reading of what's called the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the prices of that basket of goods and services in September 2015 actually were a hair lower - about half a percent lower - than they were a year earlier. Basically, energy prices fell a lot. So did airfares and clothing, according to the BLS, and those decreases offset increases in food prices, housing costs and medical care. Now, I know a lot of consumers don't believe this, but when the government goes out and checks prices across the country, the ones that are going down offset the ones that are going up. And that means no cost of living adjustment for about 70 million people - retirees, disabled workers, disabled veterans and federal retirees. This happened also in 2010 and 2011. INSKEEP: I suppose we're more likely to notice the prices that go up than the offsetting ones that go down. But let me ask, David - is the mix of goods and services consumed by senior citizens a little different? And is it possible to see if their costs have also not gone up along with the broader population? WESSEL: It is. So Congress, because they've heard these cries from people, told the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate a special price index that's designed to capture the goods and services purchased by Americans who are over age 62. This is an experimental index. It's not used for anything. And what it does is it puts a heavier weight on health care and housing and a lighter weight on things like tuition and transportation and entertainment. So while the index that's used to adjust Social Security benefits fell a little bit over the last year, this one - this experimental one - rose, but only by about half a percent - not very much. And if you look over the last 10 years, these two measures actually go about the same, so the BLS says, if you use an elderly-tailored CPI, it doesn't make much difference. INSKEEP: Seniors have to spend a lot on health care, of course, even with Medicare - have to spend a lot. Is the cost for seniors of health care not rising as much as it used to be? WESSEL: Yes, the cost of health care has slowed a little bit over the past (unintelligible), and that's part of what's going on here. Now, a lot of seniors are mostly on Medicare. And this has gotten really complicated because the law says that Medicare beneficiaries - or 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries - don't have to pay more for Medicare if there's no cost of living increase. But premiums can raise for the other 30 percent - higher income beneficiaries, state governments that buy Medicare for the poor. So we have this situation where their premiums are going to go up a lot - 50 percent - unless Congress does something to intervene, which it's talking about doing. INSKEEP: Now, let's talk about this question of what consumers really believe. You've flicked at that a little bit. You've said Congress has been so sensitive to this, they've gone out and ordered extra studies. Are consumers just determined to believe, regardless of what the surveys may say, that prices are going up? That's what people always feel. WESSEL: Yeah, I think so. I mean, part of this is technical. The CPI's an average, and nobody's average. Someone who drives a lot is going to feel gas prices more. Some of it has to do with the way the government adjusts for improvements in quality. So if you buy a better flat-screen TV for the same price that you bought on 12 years ago, but it's so much better, that can be a decrease in price. So the CPI says the price of TVs adjusted for quality is half what it was five years ago. But I think, also, people tend to look - don't remember everything they buy, and they focus on the things that went up or down a lot. And the government tries to even all that out. INSKEEP: OK, David. Thanks very much, as always. WESSEL: You're welcome. INSKEEP: More free information - the price has not changed. David is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The government says Social Security beneficiaries will not be getting a cost of living increase in 2016. In essence, the government says people don't need that since the cost of living for the elderly has not gone up. To find out more, we turn, as we often do, to David Wessel. He is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. David, good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so, like, someone over 65 right now may be - many people across America - screaming at the radio, what do you mean the cost of living has not gone on up? That's what the question will be. So what does the government mean that the cost of living really hasn't gone up for seniors? WESSEL: Well, since the mid-1970s, Social Security benefits have been adjusted automatically for inflation every January based on the September reading of what's called the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the prices of that basket of goods and services in September 2015 actually were a hair lower - about half a percent lower - than they were a year earlier. Basically, energy prices fell a lot. So did airfares and clothing, according to the BLS, and those decreases offset increases in food prices, housing costs and medical care. Now, I know a lot of consumers don't believe this, but when the government goes out and checks prices across the country, the ones that are going down offset the ones that are going up.

More than half of working people have saved less than $25,000. As part of our series, Your Money and Your Life, NPR's Uri Berliner looks at how some young investors have turned to robo-advisers for help. URI BERLINER, BYLINE: Jesus Adrian Perez is 29, lives in Albuquerque, N. M. , and works as a biometric analyst. He's the first one in his family to graduate from college, and he told me he wants to climb from the working-class to the investment class. JESUS ADRIAN PEREZ: Out of all my whole family, I have the most income. And my parents and my brothers and sisters sometimes do look for me for that, you know. I mean, they need money. Not only do I have to worry about, like, my retirement, but I have to worry about my parents' retirement and my brother and sister, too. BERLINER: Perez is a math and statistics guy who knows what's at stake when lots of charges are tacked on to investments. PEREZ: I hear about investment advisers. Their fees are always really high, and you end up losing a lot of money in the long run. BERLINER: So he signed up with a robo-adviser called WiseBanyan. It's an online financial manager that builds you a portfolio of low-fee funds based on the customer's age, goals and tolerance for risk. All these decisions, they're made by an algorithm, not a broker. Do you feel strange having a robot managing your investments instead of a human being? PEREZ: No, no, I always think robots are better at everything than a human being can do. You know what I mean? They're going to be better at driving cars, identifying diseases. Human error is - human error is a big thing, and they're not greedy. BERLINER: Robo-advisers are significantly less expensive than human ones. The startup WiseBanyan is free. Fees at the largest robo-advisers are a small fraction of those at Wall Street firms and traditional wealth managers. GREG SMITH: People don't realize that the public are being used as pawns in this game where billions of dollars are being extracted out of their pockets. And, you know, 401(k)s are a great example. BERLINER: That's Greg Smith, president of a robo-adviser called Blooom that manages 401(k)s for customers. Smith is a former Goldman Sachs banker with an interesting back story. We'll get to that in a moment. But when it comes to 401(k)s, he says they're needlessly opaque, crammed with high-fee funds that perform poorly. SMITH: The average American household can pay $150,000 in fees into their 401(k)s over the lifetime of their retirement account. BERLINER: The Blooom algorithm hunts for the lowest cost options in a customer's plan. Typically, those are passive index funds. Passive funds automatically mirror a market index. They don't have highly paid managers. They don't try to beat the market. SMITH: After dealing with some of the smartest investors in the world for 11 years, I can conclusively say that I did not see any of them routinely beat the market. BERLINER: In 2012, Smith quit Goldman Sachs and slammed the company in The New York Times. He said Goldman's culture had become warped, and it was taking advantage of clients. According to Goldman, Smith left because he wanted more than a million dollars in salary, about double what he was earning. Now Smith works for a lot less - he calls it a startup salary - from a co-working space in midtown Manhattan. He says it's exciting. Robo- advisers like Blooom are at the birth of something big. SMITH: We think the whole industry is basically stuck in the 1970s. And finance and retirement might be one of the last bastions for the consumer that technology has not really helped at all. BERLINER: Now, this seems like the inevitable moment to say that these robo-advisers will disrupt financial planning. But there's no sign of that happening yet. SEAN MCDERMOTT: By comparison to the established players, it's a very small amount of money we're talking about. BERLINER: Sean McDermott is with the research firm Corporate Insight. He says the thing to watch is this. The use of robo-advisers is trickling up from millennials to older generations. MCDERMOTT: Their parents turn to them to ask for advice about the newest and latest technology that's out there. We don't think it's too large of a leap to say that they've been steering some of their parents into these services. BERLINER: At last count, he says the leading robo-advisers were giving advice on $21 billion in investor assets. And they're growing quickly. Though, to get some perspective, the mutual fund giant Fidelity by itself manages more than $2 trillion. Human, with all their flaws, still rule financial planning. The robots have their work cut out for them. Uri Berliner, NPR News.

For 40 years, he has led a revolution of sorts to help people avoid the pitfalls of Wall Street and build some real wealth. And the surprising thing about that revolution, he's winning. As part of our series Your Money and Your Life, NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: The founders of our nation, George Washington, Sam Adams, they were fighting against the tyranny of England. For 40 years, Jack Bogle has been calling for revolution against the tyranny of Wall Street. JACK BOGLE: Calling for revolution is exactly right. And I think really it is. I mean, it's changing the world of investing for all kind of investors. ARNOLD: We said Bogle is winning. The company he founded, Vanguard, is now the biggest mutual fund family on the planet. It only charges investors when it costs to run the funds with no profit margin. And as of this week, it now has $3. 2 trillion under management. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR CREAKING OPEN)ARNOLD: Bogle sat down with us at his vacation cottage, with a nice old wooden screen door overlooking a lake in upstate New York. Is it OK to leave the dog out or should. . . BOGLE: Yeah, he's fine. ARNOLD: OK. Bogle, who's now 86 years old, explained that at the heart of his investing revolution are low costs. BOGLE: Cost turns out to be everything. That gives us a huge edge and gives our investors a huge edge. And that's just mathematics. I mean, it may come across as bragging, but it's not. It's just what I have often called the relentless rules of humble arithmetic. ARNOLD: OK, for decades big financial firms have been telling Americans that they need Wall Street. They need to hire money managers to help them invest. Take this Smith Barney ad from 1979. Actor John Houseman is dressed up in a stuffy suit with a bowtie. And he's sitting in an ornate dining room. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)JOHN HOUSEMAN: Good investments don't walk up, bite you on the bottom and say, we're here. Finding them takes good old-fashioned hard work, research. ARNOLD: It's sort of like Wall Street nobility telling Americans the truth about investing. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)HOUSEMAN: Smith Barney, they make money the old-fashioned way; they earn it. ARNOLD: But back then, Jack Bogle had just set out to prove that that was a big, fat lie, that those fancy financial firms were not worth the money that they charged in fees and you could do much better another way. BOGLE: We live in this mythical world where we kind of believe the American way is if you try harder, you will do better, that if you pay a professional to do something, it will pay off. And these things are true, except in investing. ARNOLD: That was Bogle's insight. When you invest, you should own a mix of stocks and bonds. But paying investment managers to pick stocks, that just doesn't work because he says it's too expensive, and picking winners is very hard. This gets us back to. . . BOGLE: The relentless rules of humble arithmetic. ARNOLD: Here's a little math. But don't worry; it's not too painful. Bogle says over long stretches of time, like when you're saving for retirement, you can expect the stock market to return about 7 percent. That's actually great because at 7 percent, your money doubles every 10 years. So you can make some serious money. But you have to factor in let's say 2 and a half percent inflation. BOGLE: All of a sudden, the real return is not 7 percent but 4 and a half percent. ARNOLD: And then you add the fees from the mutual funds, where you're paying those people to pick stocks. Some of those fees you can see. Others are harder to see. BOGLE: The mutual fund managers take very close to 2 percent. So that 4 and a half percent now drops to 2 and a half percent. ARNOLD: Then, if you have an investment adviser, that might cost another 1 percent. We're getting down almost to a 0 percent return. So Bogle says the better thing to do is to just buy the entire stock market, and don't pay anybody to pick stocks. BOGLE: Owning a stock market is the way. It is - it's the way to do it. ARNOLD: This is not a new concept now. But back in 1975, it was a bold challenge to the industry when Bogle created the world's first index mutual fund. This kind of fund just blindly buys an index, which is a big list of stocks - say, the biggest 500 companies in America - and holds onto them. So for a tiny fraction of the cost, an annual fee of one-twentieth of a percent. . . BOGLE: You own corporate America, whether it's the index 500, or you can own the total stock market. ARNOLD: OK, so you own corporate America. You hang onto it. But that sounds kind of boring, right? I mean, you know. . . BOGLE: It is boring. It is the most boring investment strategy ever invented in the history of time. ARNOLD: But with each year that goes by, more Americans are buying into that boring investment strategy. Index funds now make up 34 percent of the market for stock mutual funds. So the world is changing. But most Americans who invest are still paying those higher fees for stock-picking. BOGLE: Oh, look at that, a nice one. ARNOLD: That was a nice one, yeah. After talking at his house, Jack Bogle and I headed over to the local golf course for lunch. Bogle actually goes to the public course, not some fancy golf club. We're eating pretty simple sandwiches. And it's a good spot to watch the golfers. Many of them, though, keep landing in a sand trap. So how come everybody hits the trap? BOGLE: They think they're stronger than they are. ARNOLD: And, Bogle says, so it is with investing. Our instinct is to swing hard and try to pick hot stocks or mutual funds. But all the time now there are more people giving up on that game and, in effect, joining Jack Bogle's revolution.

ALLEN: Murkowski heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee where the Obama administration today laid out its plan to help Puerto Rico. The island's financial problems are tied to a larger economic crisis. Over the last decade, Puerto Rico has lost a quarter-million jobs, and unemployment is twice the national average. The spiraling economy has sparked a huge outmigration. Eighty-four-thousand people left the island last year. Treasury official Antonio Weiss says once the money runs out in Puerto Rico, essential services may be cut, and the financial problems could become a humanitarian crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANTONIO WEISS: Without federal action, this crisis will escalate and result in further economic contraction, outmigration and suffering of American citizens in Puerto Rico. ALLEN: The Obama administration wants Congress to pass a new type of bankruptcy that would be available only to Puerto Rico and other territories. The White House says a financial control board would be set up for Puerto Rico similar to one established for Washington, D. C. , two decades ago.

That is a human tragedy, and in my view, Wall Street should not be believing that they can get blood from a stone. ALLEN: Puerto Rico's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, is endorsing the White House proposal. Along with a bankruptcy provision, it would increase Medicaid funding and extend the earned income tax credit to Puerto Rican residents. Garcia said his government can fix Puerto Rico's problems if Congress gives it the tools.

A couple days ago, we heard about a do-it-yourself option, going online and investing with the help of a robo-adviser. Well, perhaps you would prefer a human being, and if so, NPR's John Ydstie is about to tell you what you should look for and what you should try to avoid. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The first thing to realize about financial advice is that it's not free, and it often costs more than you think. That's what Morra Aarons-Mele found when she decided to find a financial adviser after she inherited an IRA from her father. MORRA AARONS-MELE: I felt like I wanted an adviser because I was uncertain about - I never had any money before, frankly (laughter). And, you know, I really wanted to be a good steward of it. YDSTIE: She found an adviser who charged her a yearly fee of 1 percent of the value of the IRA. That's pretty standard. But after receiving some quarterly reports, she started feeling uneasy about all the added fees. AARONS-MELE: The fees were all over the place, so that even though my fee that I had agreed with my adviser seemed completely reasonable, it was that there seemed to be all these hidden fees in various funds. YDSTIE: So in addition to paying her adviser 1 percent a year, Aarons-Mele was also paying a lot to managers of the mutual funds in her portfolio. The average U. S. mutual fund charges just under 1 percent in fees. That may sound like small change, but the impact can be truly dramatic. Over 30 years, paying 1 percent annually for advice and another 1 percent for your mutual funds could cut your retirement gains almost in half. So keeping fees much lower than average is critical, says Kate Fries, a retirement adviser at The Family Firm based in Bethesda, Md. Fries also charges a 1 percent fee for her advice, but she's all about keeping the other fees to a minimum. KATE FRIES: The vast majority of the time, whether in an index fund or ETF, it should be well under a half a percent. YDSTIE: An ETF is a basket of stocks traded like a single stock in the stock market. Often, investors pay too much in fees because their advisers get commissions from mutual fund companies to steer business to high-fee products. But Fries is a fiduciary, which means she is required to put her clients' interests first. That's something you should insist on when you seek financial advice. Of course, paying close to 1 and a half percent also could cut significantly into your investment returns, so why not just invest on your own in one of those cheap robo-advisers online? Well, Fries argues it can be worth it to pay for a human adviser. She says they can help organize your finances to achieve your goals and, when you're ready, structure your retirement. She also says she protects her clients from themselves. FRIES: It's really hard when the market is as volatile as it was this past August and to not knee-jerk react and decide, oh, gosh, is now the time to sell? You know, I don't want to lose everything. YDSTIE: But here's the problem for the vast majority of Americans. They don't have enough money to access Fries' advice. Her firm requires a $600,000 minimum investment. But there is a new model emerging for providing less expensive retirement advice. It's being offered by a number of firms, including a recent startup named Rebalance IRA. Its managing director, Scott Puritz, says the model is a hybrid that keeps costs low by combining human advisers on the phone and technology online. SCOTT PURITZ: Rebalance IRA charges a half of 1 percent for retirement investment advice for our clients. YDSTIE: That's half the cost of a traditional investment adviser. And Rebalance builds investment portfolios of index funds and ETF's that add just two-tenths of a percent to the fee. PURITZ: So our clients experience all-in, everything-type cost of seven-tenths of 1 percent per year. YDSTIE: But rebalance IRA requires a minimum investment of a $100,000, and Vanguard's similar service requires a $50,000 minimum. That still excludes the majority of Americans. To fill that gap, a new network of financial planners has sprung up. It's called the XY Planning Network. Christina Guglielmetti of Future Perfect Planning is one of them. CHRISTINA GUGLIELMETTI: We are all planners who are trying to deliver our quality, fiduciary financial planning services to clients who have traditionally been cut out of financial planning. YDSTIE: Her clients are often younger people - freelancers, new parents. Guglielmetti charges them $500 for an initial plan. She charges about a $100 a month to be on retainer. And like some other planners in her network and elsewhere, she'll work for an hourly fee. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

A new law requires that from now on, all employers automatically enroll workers in retirement savings plans, or pensions. As part of our series Your Money and Your Life, NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: One day not so long ago, the phone rang on Tim Jones's desk. He's a successful bank executive in London, so he's a pretty busy guy. TIM JONES: I got a call from a headhunter. And they said, don't hang up, Tim, it's pensions. And I laughed and said, look, I am going to hang up because pensions are very dull. And he said, you won't think so after you've been to see me. ARNOLD: The headhunter told Jones that the government wanted him to run an investment fund but on a massive scale, an investment fund for the working population of England. JONES: How often do you get a chance to build something from scratch that will only work if it does a really great job of helping millions of people and hundreds of thousands of employers create a great retirement savings solution? ARNOLD: So the U. K. had passed this auto enrollment system for all companies. Workers pay into what's basically like a 401(k) plan. But they needed a good low-cost investment fund to handle the money so employers would have a smart, safe way for their workers to invest. This fund - if it worked - was basically going to help an entire nation of people to build wealth. JONES: I thought, wow, this is going to be hard but a huge amount of fun. I was sold. ARNOLD: And Jones went on to create the National Employment Savings Trust. It's a nonprofit, now managing investments for millions of workers in the U. K. One reason that Jones said that savings is hard is that a lot of working-class people think that they just can't afford to save. At an outdoor market in London, 30-year-old Garfield Bloomfield is selling vegetables. And he smiles at me like I'm making a joke when I ask him if he's saving for retirement yet. GARFIELD BLOOMFIELD: I'm not really saving for the future. I would like to save for the future obviously, but at the moment, I'm just working to get by really. ARNOLD: Psychologists and behavioral economists say that there are all kinds of reasons that people don't start saving for retirement until it's too late. And some of them are very good reasons. BLOOMFIELD: My wife is not working at the moment because she decided to go back into studies. so I'm not really saving towards the future. ARNOLD: Because you're just not making enough to have any extra. . . BLOOMFIELD: Not making enough, and I've got kids to take care of, so it's like, yeah. ARNOLD: Of course, in the U. S. wages have been stagnant. A lot of people here, too, feel like they're just scraping by. But here's the thing. If you take someone like Bloomfield and enroll him automatically in a retirement savings plan - that is, he doesn't do anything at all, but money starts coming out of his paycheck - the odds are that he'll keep saving even though right now he thinks he can't afford it. And because of the new law, Bloomfield's employer soon will have to do just that. Charlotte Clark is the top government official for retirement savings in the U. K. She met me at the market here and explained that over the past year or so, a lot of workers have already been enrolled. CHARLOTTE CLARK: We still got another couple of years to roll out to all employers. So we still got some way to go. But we've got 5 million people saving. ARNOLD: And this is the kind of amazing thing - right? - that people can opt out if they want. They could say no, no, no, give me all my money, thank you very much. But when you sign people up, you've been finding that they actually stick with it. CLARK: Yeah, we're seeing over 90 percent of people sticking with it. So that's 9 out of 10 people are deciding that this is the right thing for them. ARNOLD: And Clark says an even higher percentage of lower income workers stick with it. It's made very clear to them that if they opt out, they're losing free money from their employer. Workers start just by putting in 2 percent of their salary into a retirement account. Employers match a portion of that, and the total with the employer match increases over time to at least 8 percent. Clark said she's especially happy about the lower income workers. CLARK: Yeah, if we look around, what do we see? You know, people who are working for relatively small businesses - we've got a pork pie shop sign just behind you. I don't think anyone's ever made too much of a fortune kind of selling pork pies. ARNOLD: But if all goes well, even a pork pie salesman will have a nice nest egg to help with retirement in 20 or 30 years. In the U. S. , more companies are starting to auto enroll employees on their own. And at least a few members of Congress are interested in a law like the U. K. 's. Chris Arnold. NPR News, London.

S. debt ceiling. In just over a week, the federal government may have to cut up its credit card. Treasury secretary Jack Lew warns that the government has nearly exhausted its borrowing authority, and unless Congress acts, the government won't be able to borrow additional money after next Tuesday. Aides say members of Congress are closing in on a budget deal which would include a debt limit increase. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Treasury secretary made his latest appeal to lawmakers today in an op-ed column for USA Today. Without a hike in the debt ceiling, he warns, the government won't be able to pay the bills it's already run up, including military salaries, veterans' benefits and Social Security checks. Lew told CNBC even toying with such a possibility is dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACK LEW: Any time you wait till the last possible minute, you're inviting a risk. And this is not a last minute that we can know with absolute certainty. I worry every time we hit this that some time, there could be an accident, and that would be terrible. HORSLEY: Lew's already been forced to move up the deadline more than once thanks to lower-than-expected tax revenues and higher-than-expected expenses. He says that kind of volatility would be especially problematic if the government suddenly had to live with only the cash it has on hand. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LEW: Think about it. We have a government in the United States - a $4 trillion-a-year enterprise - where swings of a few billion dollars can determine whether or not you have enough cash to pay your bills. It's ridiculous. HORSLEY: Even if lawmakers don't raise the debt limit by next Tuesday, the government probably wouldn't default right away. Forecasters estimate there would still be around $30 billion in federal coffers. That's probably enough to make payroll for federal workers a week from Friday and maybe enough to cut Social Security checks on November the 10, though it's hard to know for sure. SHAI AKABAS: I always like to say this is really more of an art than a science. HORSLEY: Shai Akabas of the Bipartisan Policy Center says the real test could come November 16 when the government is supposed to make some $30 billion in interest payments. He predicts if the debt ceiling's not increased, the government will run out of cash somewhere between November 10 and 19. Though he says pinpointing that moment is not easy. AKABAS: These are millions and millions of payments that are going out every single day. So this is really quite a sum for Treasury to be managing in a situation where they're in uncharted waters and unable to borrow from the public. HORSLEY: The Moody's credit rating agency issued a report today saying even if Congress fails to raise the debt limit, the government would likely continue to pay interest on its debt while postponing other payments such as federal workers' salaries. The administration has repeatedly dismissed that idea, and Akabas says it understates the risk in lost confidence and higher borrowing costs. So what really happens on the day the government doesn't have the money it needs to pay all of its bills? AKABAS: That's a great question, and the true answer is that we don't know because we really never encountered that in modern America. HORSLEY: Treasury Secretary Lew hopes this is not the year we find out. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Here's a way to think about the U. S. debt ceiling. In just over a week, the federal government may have to cut up its credit card. Treasury secretary Jack Lew warns that the government has nearly exhausted its borrowing authority, and unless Congress acts, the government won't be able to borrow additional money after next Tuesday. Aides say members of Congress are closing in on a budget deal which would include a debt limit increase. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Treasury secretary made his latest appeal to lawmakers today in an op-ed column for USA Today. Without a hike in the debt ceiling, he warns, the government won't be able to pay the bills it's already run up, including military salaries, veterans' benefits and Social Security checks. Lew told CNBC even toying with such a possibility is dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JACK LEW: Any time you wait till the last possible minute, you're inviting a risk. And this is not a last minute that we can know with absolute certainty. I worry every time we hit this that some time, there could be an accident, and that would be terrible. HORSLEY: Lew's already been forced to move up the deadline more than once thanks to lower-than-expected tax revenues and higher-than-expected expenses. He says that kind of volatility would be especially problematic if the government suddenly had to live with only the cash it has on hand. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEW: Think about it. We have a government in the United States - a $4 trillion-a-year enterprise - where swings of a few billion dollars can determine whether or not you have enough cash to pay your bills. It's ridiculous. HORSLEY: Even if lawmakers don't raise the debt limit by next Tuesday, the government probably wouldn't default right away.

The new rules would require the country's biggest banks to keep more capital on hand to cover any losses in case of another meltdown. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports that the banks will have to issue $120 billion in long-term debt to meet the requirements. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The taxpayer-funded bailouts of big banks in 2008 generated a wave of public anger that has still not subsided, and bank regulators around the world have been trying to deal with the consequences. They've set up stress tests to monitor the health of banks and force the banks to write up living wills spelling out how they could be dissolved in the event of a meltdown. The rules just approved are one more step in the effort to address the too-big-to-fail problem, said Fed Chair Janet Yellen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: The proposal, combined with our other work to improve the resolvability of systemic banking firms, would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability stemming from the failure of these firms. ZARROLI: The rules apply to eight big bank holding companies that are considered systemically important - that is, their failure would cause a major crisis in the global financial system. These banks are already required to keep certain levels of capital on hand to protect their customer's assets in the event of a downturn. Under the new rules, they would have to keep a new layer of what's called loss-absorbing capital on their balance sheets. Banks that don't have the capital would have to sell long-term bonds to raise what they need. Stephen Lubben teaches at Seton Hall Law School. STEPHEN LUBBEN: And the idea is that if the financial institution gets in trouble, the first thing that'll happen is the existing shareholders will be wiped out and those bondholders will be involuntarily made into the new shareholders of the financial institution. ZARROLI: Lubben says the new capital requirements would set up a kind of second layer of defense against another meltdown. LUBBEN: We're trying to create a series of steps that would all be in front of a possible federal bailout. ZARROLI: Down the road, the new capital requirements would also apply to big foreign banks that do a lot of business in the United States. The rules would be costly. Fed officials say that six of the eight biggest U. S. banks lack enough capital to meet the new requirements, although they wouldn't say which six. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

Well, next year, a new type of crowdfunding system could give you an actual stake in a startup or a small business. NPR's John Ydstie reports on the move today by the Securities and Exchange Commission. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: It's been more than three and a half years since Congress told the SEC to write rules for a system that matches small businesses with small investors. But it finally became a reality when SEC Chair Mary Jo White called for a vote today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARY JO WHITE: We'll start with a recommendation to adopt final rules for crowdfunding. YDSTIE: The commission voted 3 to 1 to approve. Now, this is not Kickstarter, where people just give their money to individuals or companies to get an interesting idea off the ground. What was approved today was a system where small businesses and startups can seek investors to buy their shares or give them a loan on a regulated Internet portal. Woody Neiss is one of the authors of the original framework that Congress approved. He explains how the system will work when it's up and running next summer. WOODY NEISS: Let's say I'm a main street business in the middle of Louisiana, and we're doing really well. We're a community, a hardware store, and we want to expand our operations. This would be a great opportunity for us to go to our customers and solicit them. YDSTIE: So the hardware store might use its customer mailing list to alert the community that it wants to expand to the next town. The hardware store would put relevant financial information on a website - either a registered portal or one run by an investment firm. NEISS: And these websites are where the investors will go to get the information on the offering and then decide whether or not they want to put some money in. They can invest right there with the click of a button. YDSTIE: Neiss says one reason crowdfunding is needed is that since the financial crisis, small businesses and startups have had trouble getting bank loans. He says crowdfunding also provides an opportunity for small investors to support local businesses or get in on the ground floor of startups. Under current law, only qualified investors with high incomes or net worth are allowed to do crowdfunded investing. The system approved today would allow people of modest means to invest as much as 10 percent of their income or net worth, whichever is lower. Barbara Roper of the Consumer Federation of America thinks this is a bad idea. BARBARA ROPER: Experience tells us that the vast majority of startup - early-stage startup companies fail. You know, there's a very real risk that crowdfunding investors will lose some or all of their money. YDSTIE: But Roper said she was pleased to see the SEC amended the proposed rule to put tighter limits on what people of modest means can invest. Woody Neiss, who now runs Crowdfund Capital Advisors, agrees that investors need to understand the risks and not expect to make money for seven to 10 years. NEISS: Absolutely, there's no get-rich-quick scheme here. And if they're going to go into this, they need to understand what the risks are and how long it's going to be before they get their money back if they get their money back. YDSTIE: Neiss says that businesses, who will be limited to raising $1 million annually in the system, also need to understand it will still take hard work to raise money.

Until recently, Brazilian tourists were the biggest spenders in the U. S. Brazil's economy, though, is now in a deep recession. Its currency has tumbled 40 percent against the dollar in a year. The weak real is having a significant impact on the U. S. -Brazil travel and trade relationship. So we sent our correspondents, Greg Allen in Miami and Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in Brazil, to learn more. We begin in Sao Paulo. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: My story is a love story. Or rather, it's a story about thwarted love. CAMILA NAGANO: My name is Camila Nagano. I'm 22 years old. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Nagano is a law student. She has long brown hair and she wears a heart-shaped locket around her neck. It's a gift from her boyfriend. NAGANO: His name is Pietro. He studies in the same college as me. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Except then he left - to Miami to work, which up until recently wouldn't have been a problem for Nagano. She, like many young Brazilians, used to go to the States a lot. Nagano grew up in Brazil's boom years when the economy was growing and Brazilians were traveling often. NAGANO: I thought it was easy because I mean, Miami is one flight. So I could sleep in the plane and be there. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Then the economy here crashed. Two years ago, the Brazilian currency was 2-1 to the dollar. Now it's around 4-1, which means America got really expensive for Brazilians. Nagano wanted to surprise her boyfriend for Valentine's Day. NAGANO: Yeah, a romantic getaway, and I had it all figured out (laughter). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Until she saw the prices. She just couldn't afford it. And she's part of a wider trend. Magda Nassar is the president of Braztoa, the Brazilian Association of Tour Operators. Travel to the U. S. is down at least 20 percent this year, but it's not as bad as it might've been because, she says, the travel industry reacted quickly to the bad news. MAGDA NASSAR: All the airlines, they started to put some very special promotions in the market, real promotions, like as low as $280 return. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Nassar says the aim is to keep people flying. So when you look at the cost of a ticket in the local currency. . . NASSAR: What we had is a price in reais year that is lower than last year. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Still, for Nagano, those special airfares are not enough. She says fine - flights are cheaper, but what she earns in Brazilian reais doesn't go very far in U. S. dollars when she gets to the States. NAGANO: Yeah, of course, this is terrible for my relationship. GARCIA-NAVARRO: She had hoped to do her masters at a university in the U. S. next year to be closer to Pietro. But American tuition, she says, is unaffordable too. NAGANO: I had a world of opportunities, but now I literally have no idea what's going to happen with my relationship, with my plans to study abroad.

Employers added 271,000 jobs in October - far more than expected. So we\u2019re going to talk through what happened with NPR's John Ydstie who's in our studios. John, good morning. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So what drove this? YDSTIE: Well, jobs came across the board - professional jobs in health care, in retail, in restaurants and on construction sites. And it's really good news because over the previous two months there were indications that the economy and the labor market could be weakening. INSKEEP: Yeah. YDSTIE: There's a slowdown in China that was worrying. The stronger dollar was hurting manufacturing and exports. But through all that, consumers have been spending more, partly because they're not paying as much for gas. And that helped produce the big job numbers you saw in October. INSKEEP: Oh, people were actually able to divert their money somewhere else. So what does that do to the other big employment number, the unemployment rate? YDSTIE: Well, the jobless rate ticked down to 5 percent. That's the lowest level in seven and a half years. And another good sign - the so-called underemployment rate fell last month to 9. 8 percent. Now, that includes people who've given up looking for work and part-time workers who want full-time jobs. INSKEEP: OK, so, John, we've had so much coverage of the fact that even as the unemployment rate has gone down, wages have not improved. Many people are still earning less than they were years ago. What's happening with that? What do these numbers mean for that? YDSTIE: Well, there was some good news there in this report as well. We saw a tick up in the rate of wage growth to about 2. 5 percent a year. Now, that's a slight increase, but it's promising, and it should be something that helps the Federal Reserve decide whether to move and raise interest rates in December. INSKEEP: OK, remind us of what the debate was here. The Fed was expected to raise interest rates or at least talk more seriously about it earlier this fall. YDSTIE: Right, and I think this report increases the odds the Fed will raise rates in December. Remember, after their meeting last week, Fed officials said they wanted to see more improvement in the labor market, and this certainly qualifies. So analysts are now saying there's a good chance the Fed will finally start raising rates in December. But there's still opposition to that, and maybe the Fed will decide it doesn't want to play grinch and raise rates just before Christmas. We'll see. INSKEEP: John, thanks, as always.

It mandates no minimum wage for the private sector, and the Legislature has made it illegal for cities or towns to pass their own. In San Antonio, a church-based organization is taking advantage of a loophole. It's pushing what it calls a living wage for county and city employees. From San Antonio, NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: It's a warm, humid September morning as a mixed-race group gathers in front of the steps of San Antonio's stunning historic City Hall. A mariachi band shows up in full regalia to play and sing and sweat. (SOUNDBITE OF MARIACHI MUSIC)GOODWYN: It's 8 a. m. It's a little early for a party, but that's what's going on here. UNIDENTIFIED BAND: (Singing in Spanish). GOODWYN: After a year of intense organizing, this organization, with the unwieldy name of Communities Organized for Public Service Metro Alliance, is celebrating an impending San Antonio City Council vote that will mandate a 13 dollar an hour minimum wage for all city employees. Draped across the steps of City Hall is a large group of smiling faces. JUANITA RAMOS MARTINEZ: Good morning. My name is Juanita Ramos Martinez. I am a member of St. Bonaventure Parish, and I'm a proud leader with COPS/Metro Alliance. (CHEERING)GOODWYN: COPS/Metro is part of a network of church-based organizations across the country called the Industrial Areas Foundation. It was started during the 1940s in the Back of the Yards neighborhoods in Chicago by well-known organizer Saul Alinsky. So these church-based organizations aren't focused on issues like abortion or marriage. Instead, they teach religious and and lay leaders how to use the grass-roots power of the collective churches to hold politicians accountable. WALTER D'HEEDENE: For me, it's not politics. It's justice. And asking for a decent wage is not unreasonable. GOODWYN: For 20 years, Father Walter D'heedene has been the pastor of Sacred Heart Church in San Antonio. The Belgian priest says he does sometimes get grief from conservative Catholic priests for his participation in what they consider to be a leftist organization. But D'heedene says he's following in the footsteps of Pope Francis and refuses to concede that advocating for the economic wellbeing of his parishioners makes him a liberal. D'HEEDENE: Conservative - I consider conservatives too but you know, care for what people need. That's being conservative. That means no looking for your own self. You look for your neighbor. GOODWYN: But in Republican-dominated Texas, it's more than just conservative clerics that COPS/Metro leaders have to react to. The prevailing political culture for the last 25 years has favored employers, not workers. Economist Dr. Vance Ginn is with the influential conservative think tank the Texas Public Policy Foundation. VANCE GINN: Texas doesn't have a minimum wage. In addition, in state law, cities and local jurisdictions can't set a minimum wage for the private sector. And, you know, I'd like to question whether or not the 13. 3 percent increase in the minimum wage in San Antonio for those government workers - are they providing a 13. 3 percent increase in value? GOODWYN: COPS/Metro knew that proposing a living wage for city workers meant swimming upstream. So they started off slowly by informing themselves, by doing the research. Rosa Araujo-Iracheta is a leader at St. Philip of Jesus Catholic Church. ROSA ARAUJO-IRACHETA: And we found that a family of four would have to make $19 an hour in order not to be able to qualify for services of the government like food stamps. GOODWYN: That's $19 an hour for one city worker to keep a family of four above the poverty line in San Antonio. While everyone thought this was a wonderful idea, the leaders also knew that asking the City Council for a minimum wage of $19 an hour was never going to fly politically. So COPS/Metro tried for $15 an hour instead. It didn't matter. The San Antonio City Council told them to forget it. There wasn't any extra money, not for that, anyway. City councilman Rey Saldana. REY SALDANA: City Council was worried about whether we should take something on like increasing wages for our civilian employees at the same time that we were having discussions with our police and fire on their contract. GOODWYN: The San Antonio City Council was a dead end. So on the advice of their organizers, the church leaders pivoted and approached the county commissioners instead. Would they agree to pay county workers a base of $15 an hour? Again, the answer was no. But after the church leaders filed out of the meeting, frustrated and discouraged, one powerful county commissioner, the former San Antonio mayor, Nelson Wolff, quietly began making his own inquiries. He began sidling up to the janitors and other service staff, asking them how much money they made. NELSON WOLFF: I started just quizzing them in the elevator. What are you making? I'm making $7. 50. How long you worked here? I worked here for three years. They would tell me what they were making. They didn't gripe. They didn't complain. And I thought, wow. GOODWYN: It would cost the county millions, but the highly respected mayor Nelson Wolff brought the other commissioners around not for $15 an hour, but $13, then $14 next year and finally $15 an hour in 2017, 2018. And with that victory, COPS/Metro turned back to the city of San Antonio and said if the county can do it, so can you. It took months and included a massive voter registration campaign which increased turnout in the targeted districts by as much as 30 percent. That got the City Council's attention. By fall, they'd lined up the six votes they needed. MINERVA CRUZ: Today, we are here to celebrate how far we have come. GOODWYN: On the day of the vote, COPS/Metro leaders streamed en masse into the council chambers to hear St. Leo the Great Catholic Church leader Minerva Cruz congratulate the City Council. CRUZ: Your vote today in support $13 per hour minimum wage is an important milestone. GOODWYN: COPS/Metro says they're far from done. Their next target - the San Antonio hospital district.

Working on high-voltage lines pays well, but utility companies are having a hard time replacing retiring lineman. Frank Morris of member station KCUR begins our story at the International Lineman's Rodeo. FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: Picture a forest of closely spaced utility poles, almost like a giant hairbrush with hundreds of burly men in hard hats, heavy boots with spikes, working furiously. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Smooth, Bobby, smooth, nice job. MORRIS: Throw in lots of tools and American flags and you begin to imagine an annual competition that some call a testosterone vortex. MARTIN PUTNAM: The International Lineman's Rodeo is the Super Bowl of rodeos for lineman. MORRIS: Organizer Martin Putnam, a former champion lineman himself, sporting a sharp flattop, says top workers qualify to compete here, among the best in a macho but exacting field. PUTNAM: They're kind of cowboys. You know, here's guys that are handling 7,200 volts every day, you know? It's a different deal. MORRIS: Especially considering the long hours fixing lines after hurricanes, ice storms and tornadoes. Still, many linemen say they wouldn't do anything else, despite the dangers that veterans like Danny Haithcock know well. DANNY HAITHCOCK: As a matter of fact, I lost my older brother to electrical contact. That doesn't happen that often anymore. MORRIS: Haithcock has been on the job for 28 years. That's not uncommon. About a third of the lineman working today will retire in the next decade, a serious issue for the utility industry. PUTNAM: Kids don't like it. It's hard to find young men and women to do this. MORRIS: Martin Putnam again. Line work pays well, more than $40 an hour with experience around Kansas City, but. . . PUTNAM: Nobody wants to climb polls, everyone's afraid of electricity. You work at night. You work in the storms. It takes a certain breed of cat. I mean, heck, today you can't get a kid to lick a stamp, much less climb a pole. MORRIS: The utility industry confronted this problem about a decade ago when it set up the Center for Energy Workforce Development, where Anne Randazzo's in charge. ANNE RANDAZZO: When we started, we were looking at about half of the workforce leaving within five years. MORRIS: A terrifying prospect because it takes almost five years to fully train a line worker. Randazzo says the recession delayed the problem because baby boomers put off retirement. In the meantime, she says, the industry has recruited thousands of replacement line workers by promoting line work in high schools, even elementary schools, producing documentaries. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The best part about being a lineman I have to say is the men I work with and the people I meet. MORRIS: And setting up dozens of training programs in the last few years. SUSAN BLASER: This is our training yard, basically our lab for the programMORRIS: It's another grove of utility poles - this one at a junior college in Kansas City, Mo. Director Susan Blaser - in the pink hard hat, a former line worker - is a rarity in a field with only about one woman for every hundred men. BLASER: Women just don't know about the opportunity and the money that they can make if they like working outside. I look for farm girls. They like working outside and know what their responsibilities are. MORRIS: And for line work, you'd have to give up not only comfort on the job but something almost vital to lots of people - a cellphone. BLASER: Because distractions lead to accidents. Phones are accidents (laughter) unfortunately. MORRIS: But despite the odds, last year retiring linemen were more than matched by new recruits, like 33-year-old Jeremy Kunz. JEREMY KUNZ: I like a challenge, and what's more challenging than messing with something that's real dangerous? MORRIS: Well, messing with something really dangerous high up on a pole in terrible weather. KUNZ: That's right. It doesn't get much worse than that. MORRIS: People with that special mix of careful, hearty and crazy it takes to be a line worker aren't getting any easier to find. But fortunately, for I guess everyone who likes electric power, the utilities are getting better at finding them. For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Kansas City.

And it's right that we do. But it's worth recalling also the lives of desperation lived out of public view. Poverty does not treat men and women equally, especially in old age. There are more than twice as many older women living in poverty than men. We're exploring the changing lives of women as they age, and NPR's Ina Jaffe met up with one elderly woman in Southern California. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: There are framed photographs covering almost every surface in the tidy apartment of 87-year-old Lydia Smith. They're mostly pictures of her family. LYDIA SMITH: This is my mother, my twin sister, my brother. Unfortunately, he's gone. She's gone. Mom is gone. JAFFE: The family all moved to the United States from Rome after World War II. Lydia Smith was what they used to call a war bride. SMITH: In 1944, the Fifth Army marched through Rome. And we were three sisters and all three married an American soldier. JAFFE: But she got divorced in the 1950s. She never remarried. Once her son and daughter were grown, she moved to this second-story walkup near downtown Los Angeles. SMITH: I've been here 46 years in this apartment. And I have no intention of moving, either (laughter). JAFFE: How could she disrupt all of her neatly arranged collections? The basket of baby dolls, the \"Hello Kitty\" knickknacks, the breakfront filled with Barbies - all the result of a discerning eye and the local Goodwill store. That's the only place she's bought anything in years. She gets just over $900 a month from Social Security. And that's it. Her apartment is subsidized through a program called Section 8. She pays about a third of her income in rent. The government picks up the rest. Smith doesn't get food stamps. But she does qualify for Medicaid, which is a good thing since she's being treated for a heart condition and severe arthritis. SMITH: When you're in constant pain, you have no desire to be active, you know? So this is why I stay home a lot. I don't go places. JAFFE: Smith never saved for retirement. It didn't occur to her. And with the kind of money she made working as a clerk in a department store and a cashier at a restaurant, there wasn't much left over anyway. This is a story of most of the 2. 6 million women who end up poor in their later years, says Joan Entmacher, vice president for Family Economic Security at the National Women's Law Center. JOAN ENTMACHER: Women earn less than men because their wages are lower, and they're more likely to take time out for care giving. Their life spans are longer, so they have to stretch these lower benefits over a longer life span. JAFFE: Decades ago, an older woman without much income might live with her children, says Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research. But now families are often spread out around the country. And it's rare for older people to move in with their kids. Hartmann says that women of color, women who are foreign-born and women who live alone like Lydia Smith have it the worst. HEIDI HARTMANN: The poverty of single women alone is 18 to 20 percent. Many of these women may not have any relatives. They might not have had children. Or those children might not be in a position to help take care of them. JAFFE: Which is the case with Lydia Smith. Neither of her children live in Los Angeles. They're both getting on in years themselves and have health and financial struggles of their own. Such situations are one of the reasons that Social Security advocates and some politicians talk about increasing Social Security benefits, especially for people 85 and older. But Lydia Smith says she never thinks about what life would be like if she had more money. Since she was a child in Italy, it's always been like this. She has her routine down. And she's content. SMITH: I read. I do puzzle, listen to music. I go out maybe twice or three times a week to go to the market. I have to go to public laundry mat to do the laundry. Don't remind me. JAFFE: She doesn't watch a lot of TV, though - too vulgar, too violent. SMITH: I have a lot of my own movies. When television was good, it used to show nice movies on TV. I used to record them. JAFFE: In fact, she has a huge collection of videos - another one of her many collections. None, though, are more important than her arrangement of Christmas decorations and the pictures of Pope John Paul II, Our Lady of Czestochowa (ph) and the Virgin of Guadalupe. You see, Smith's arthritis makes it hard for her to get to mass. SMITH: But I pray at home. And I have a video of the mass, you know. I watch it on television. JAFFE: And she's confident that God will accept her prayer no matter where she is. Ina Jaffe, NPR News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  You know, we focus so intently on news of tragedy.

But Lydia Smith says she never thinks about what life would be like if she had more money. Since she was a child in Italy, it's always been like this. She has her routine down. And she's content. SMITH: I read. I do puzzle, listen to music. I go out maybe twice or three times a week to go to the market. I have to go to public laundry mat to do the laundry. Don't remind me. JAFFE: She doesn't watch a lot of TV, though - too vulgar, too violent. SMITH: I have a lot of my own movies. When television was good, it used to show nice movies on TV. I used to record them. JAFFE: In fact, she has a huge collection of videos - another one of her many collections. None, though, are more important than her arrangement of Christmas decorations and the pictures of Pope John Paul II, Our Lady of Czestochowa (ph) and the Virgin of Guadalupe. You see, Smith's arthritis makes it hard for her to get to mass. SMITH: But I pray at home. And I have a video of the mass, you know. I watch it on television. JAFFE: And she's confident that God will accept her prayer no matter where she is. Ina Jaffe, NPR News.", "section": "The Changing Lives Of Women", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

S. cracked down on deadbeat dads. Stronger child support enforcement was part of a major welfare overhaul under President Bill Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CLINTON: Governments do not raise children. People do, and the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world. (APPLAUSE)SHAPIRO: It's largely worked. The child support collection rate has tripled since then. Yet today, there is more than a hundred-billion dollars in unpaid child support debt. The Obama administration says the bulk of men who owe it simply don't have the money to pay. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Forty-seven-year-old Harrelle Felipa owes $20,000 in child support, but Felipa says he's no deadbeat. HARRELLE FELIPA: Calm down, please, OK? UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I got you, Kamaya. FELIPA: You going to calm down? LUDDEN: Felipa lives in his late mother's West Baltimore rowhouse. His tween sons play Minecraft on the Xbox. His toddlers run and jump. Felipa fries up a large plate of fish and chicken for dinner. FELIPA: I try to feed them a nice meal. That way, at the end of the day, once they take a bath, they go right to sleep. LUDDEN: Felipa had his first child young, at 14. His own father wasn't around. He says being a dad makes him feel complete. Felipa has a five young sons with one woman. They've mostly lived with him while their mother worked as a restaurant manager. His child support debt is for two teens with his ex-wife. Their son lives with her. He has full custody of their 15-year-old. KARLITA FELIPA: Hello. I'm Karlita. LUDDEN: Yes, Felipa owes child support for his daughter even though she lives with him. It's not clear why. He's been asking the court to change it. He admits it's tough getting by with so many kids. He's paid child support sporadically. His last job was as a truck driver. FELIPA: I was making - what? - 1,300 every two weeks. And they were taking five-something out every two weeks. LUDDEN: Of child support. FELIPA: Right. And after the taxes and all that, can you image what that left me? LUDDEN: States can garnish up to 65 percent of parent's income for child support. Felipa says it didn't leave him enough for child care. His hours were crazy and long. He hated leaving the kids with a sitter. FELIPA: Sometimes you get that gut feeling. And when they cry, I just couldn't do it. I felt something wasn't right. LUDDEN: So in a move not likely to get much sympathy in family court, Felipa quit. For two years, he's relied on food stamps and other aid. His child support debt has ballooned. VICKIE TURETSKY: When people have orders that they can't comply with, it doesn't motivate them to work and pay. It does the opposite. LUDDEN: Vickie Turetsky heads the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement. She says too many men quit jobs, turn down promotions or go underground when courts set child support orders too high. That's because when there's no income, she says many judges impute it, basing payments on, say, a full-time minimum-wage. TURETSKY: I'm going to call it magical thinking. You could call it the income we think you should have. But the bottom line is that it is income that does not exist. LUDDEN: The child support system was set up four decades ago, and Turetsky says it seems stuck there as if a man with no college can still walk into a factory tomorrow and pull down middle-class wages. In fact, Jacquelyn Boggess of the Center for Family Policy and Practice says most child-support debt is owed by men who make less than $10,000 a year. JACQUELYN BOGGESS: Those women and children - we're asking that become dependent on men who are just as poor as they are. LUDDEN: And Boggess says when parents face jail for nonpayment, it burdens entire families. BOGGESS: I've seen the parent of the guy paying his child support regularly. We've also talked to many custodial parents paying the child support so he won't go to jail. (CROSSTALK)LUDDEN: At the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore, Antonio Martin's come for job training, hoping to start paying his child support. ANTONIO MARTIN: One-eighty-three - one-eighty-three-fifty, to be exact. LUDDEN: One-eighty-three-fifty twice a month - that's how much he was ordered to pay for his daughter five years ago even though - another quirk in the system - Martin was in jail serving time for robbery. MARTIN: So in my mind, I'm thinking, like, upon release, I'll start paying this amount a month. LUDDEN: But many states consider incarceration voluntary unemployment - no excuse to suspend child-support. MARTIN: When I came home and I got the first letter, I seen it was $4,000 on there. LUDDEN: That was two years ago. With his criminal record, Martin struggled to find work. His debt is now near $6,000. The Obama administration wants to bar states from letting child-support pile up in prison. More controversially, it wants to make sure child support orders are based on a parent's actual income. ROBERT DOAR: We can't be naive when we're dealing with parents who have walked away from providing for their children. LUDDEN: Robert Doar is with the American Enterprise Institute and used to head child-support enforcement in New York state. He says some parents go to great lengths to hide income. He worries the proposed changes would make it too easy to let fathers off the hook and hurt mothers and children. DOAR: We're talking about poor single parents, often moms, and the child-support collections that they get, when they get it, represents 45 percent of their income. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Daddy. . . FELIPA: Yes, Sir. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I know my letters. FELIPA: You know your letters. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Yes. LUDDEN: Harrelle Felipa's youngest will head to school soon. And his mom, Felipa's ex, recently lost her job, so Felipa's looking to work again. This time, he hopes what's left in his paycheck after child support will be enough. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News.

S. has climbed to well over $100 billion. Enforcement agencies have given up on collecting much of it. They say too many men are simply too poor to pay. Instead, states are looking to cut parents a deal. NPR's Jennifer Ludden looks at one such effort in Baltimore. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: When the state of Maryland wanted to reach dads with child support debt, it started here. The boarded-up blocks of West Baltimore, neighborhoods marked by drugs, violence, unemployment. The state surveyed the area with Joe Jones of the Center for Urban Families. JOE JONES: Within those zip codes, there are approximately 2,400 men who owe $20 million in back state-owed child support. LUDDEN: State owed. It means this kind of child support is actually supposed to reimburse taxpayers for welfare paid to the child's mother. But Jones says most who owe it earn less than $10,000 a year. JONES: So even if we use taxpayer dollars to chase them down and we catch them, right, and we go into their pockets, there's nothing in there. LUDDEN: Are they deadbeat? JOSEPH DIPRIMIO: I don't like that expression. I think that's vulgar. I don't use it. LUDDEN: Joseph DiPrimio heads Maryland's Child Support Enforcement Office. He prefers dead broke. DIPRIMIO: We're talking about individuals that are economically challenged. They're underemployed. But they want to do the right thing. LUDDEN: Research shows high child support debt can leave parents feeling so hopeless they give up trying to pay it. DiPrimio wanted to make parents an offer. But he needed their trust and that was a problem. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The lead county investigators say they set up a unique sting operation to take down deadbeat moms and dads. LUDDEN: Stings like this one in Alabama four years ago have happened all over the country including Baltimore. The local Sheriff's office sent fake letters telling parents they'd won free football tickets. Instead, WTVM's Evening News showed them getting arrested. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Take him down. Take him down. LUDDEN: To break through years of distrust, Maryland sent letters to parents with the logo of the Center for Urban Families. They made this offer. If you take the center's month-long employment training course and land a job we'll forgive 10 percent of your child support debt. Complete a responsible fatherhood program, we'll write off another 15 percent. Response has been slow. In two years, just over 100 parents have signed on, many attending fatherhood meetings like this one. EDDIE WHITE: We definitely want to start with introductions. LUDDEN: Two dozen men sit in a large square - 20-something to middle-aged in sweats and in suits. Some complained their exes won't let them see their child if they haven't paid child support. Others don't understand why it doesn't count as support when they take their kids out to eat or buy them clothes. Mostly, like 30-year-old, Lee Ford, they say it is so hard to find work. LEE FORD: But you are telling me, no matter what, I got to pay. But I can't get a job to work to save my soul. LUDDEN: Group leader Eddie White cuts no slack. WHITE: If you know you've got a criminal record, sure it's going to be hard for you to get a job. But it don't mean you can't work. LUDDEN: A big part of this class is also educational. WHITE: I'm paying my child support and I get laid off or I lose my job, right? What should happen? UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You got to call to the office immediately. WHITE: There you go. That's the word - immediately. LUDDEN: Immediately ask the court for an adjustment, White says. The Obama administration has proposed rules to make child support orders more in line with what parents actually earn. They'd also provide more job training. Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution says it's a good investment. RON HASKINS: More fathers will get a job. More fathers will have earnings. And more fathers will use those earnings to pay child support. LUDDEN: So far that's what has happened in Baltimore. The numbers are small but the amount of child support that's been paid is more than double the amount of debt written off. WHITE: Right over left, grab the wrist. LUDDEN: In a ritual end to their meeting, the men gather in a circle, arms entwined. UNIDENTIFIED MEN: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.

Stock markets started flat this week as the financial world tried to assess the effect of this attack and others and what it might do to the economy of France, Europe, even the U. S. Five days later, it looked as though most everyone who watches markets and economies had moved on. David Kelly is chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds. He joins us from the studios of WGBH in Boston. Thanks so much for being with us. DAVID KELLY: I'm glad to be here. SIMON: What are you seeing as you look at the economies of the world? KELLY: Well, I think the overall global economy is doing OK, it's moving ahead slowly. But in particular, when you look at the reaction to the Paris attacks, you know, the economy in pretty cold and unemotional. It's really all about demand. And so, you know, it's a human tragedy, it's a human disaster, but for France, it probably means more government spending, more spending on security. Clearly the way the markets reacted around the world and in France itself, people don't think this is a negative for the French economy. SIMON: I understand, in fact, that there's - do I refer to it as a principle in economic thinking that big, disruptive events might actually benefit an economy? KELLY: Yes, I think that's right. I mean, a good example was Hurricane Andy, which hit Florida in 1992. The Florida economy was in deep recession, and this hurricane hit it and everybody thought, well, that's going to be the final blow that puts Florida under. In fact, the Florida economy began to expand very rapidly after that just because of all the rebuilding. And that's what happens - people react, they rebuild. But most of the reaction to a disaster, whether it be a military reaction or a construction reaction, actually tends to add to aggregate demand and make an economy grow faster. SIMON: Mr. Kelly, we've seen, I think we can fairly say, a series of terrorist attacks over the past couple of weeks. Paris, of course, but other attacks in the Middle East and Africa. What if this is a sustained campaign? What are the economic effects of that? KELLY: Well, I'm afraid it probably is. But the - I mean, the reality is that global terrorism is here to stay. It's almost impossible to use conventional techniques to stop a small cell of deranged people from attacking a major city. The problem is that the public doesn't know how they're supposed to react to it. You can't just stop living. You can't not go outside of your house. So I think it's part of life. I think we will see these attacks - we will hate them. But I don't think people will fundamentally change the way they live. You may see more surveillance over time, and you may see more domestic security. But ultimately, I think people will continue to travel, to eat out, because you can't protect yourself against every possible attack. And I think the one thing we've seen is that these attacks come in a very wide variety of forms. SIMON: So - not to put words into your mouth - if it was the hope of terrorists that tourists would stop coming for a length of time to Sharm el-Sheikh or to Paris or to Euro Disney, you don't feel that's going to last? KELLY: No, well, I mean, Sharm el-Sheikh may be slightly different for other reasons, but Paris? No, I think Paris is always going to be Paris. And I think also among civilized people, there's a determination not be terrorized. That was very evident in the United States after 9/11. I think it's evident in Europe right now. People refuse to stay home and not go out. I think they don't want to be terrorized, they want to get on with their normal lives. And I think civilized people will. SIMON: David Kelly at J. P.

I think we will see these attacks - we will hate them. But I don't think people will fundamentally change the way they live. You may see more surveillance over time, and you may see more domestic security. But ultimately, I think people will continue to travel, to eat out, because you can't protect yourself against every possible attack. And I think the one thing we've seen is that these attacks come in a very wide variety of forms. SIMON: So - not to put words into your mouth - if it was the hope of terrorists that tourists would stop coming for a length of time to Sharm el-Sheikh or to Paris or to Euro Disney, you don't feel that's going to last? KELLY: No, well, I mean, Sharm el-Sheikh may be slightly different for other reasons, but Paris? No, I think Paris is always going to be Paris. And I think also among civilized people, there's a determination not be terrorized. That was very evident in the United States after 9/11. I think it's evident in Europe right now. People refuse to stay home and not go out. I think they don't want to be terrorized, they want to get on with their normal lives. And I think civilized people will. SIMON: David Kelly at J. P.

In Minneapolis, reporter Kaomi Goetz looks at the challenges facing shoppers and retailers. KAOMI GOETZ, BYLINE: Just before 8 a. m. on a sleepy Sunday morning in suburban Minneapolis, Holly Lafferty sat in her SUV in a parking lot, waiting for Target to open. HOLLY LAFFERTY: As I pulled in this morning, I thought it's hard to decide where the line between insanity and parenting ends. But I think I found that line this morning, and that's here. GOETZ: The Edina, Minn. , mom wanted to get a jump on the holiday shopping season. She was trying to take advantage of a special toy offer. Lafferty was the only one there. Even so, she worried about potential competitors. LAFFERTY: Now I'm like if somebody pulls in, I'm going to be a little paranoid. Like, do I have to race in there? Like, that line just keeps escalating, so - I'll remain civilized. GOETZ: There wasn't Black Friday chaos though, despite stores proclaiming the start of the season weeks in advance. This year, some retailers are adding more services, like curbside pickup and same-day delivery. Stores will also have more workers on the floor, and that creates demand for seasonal hires. And that's how it went for Mario Juarez last year. The 20-year-old started as a holiday temp at Target. But after three months, he got a permanent job as a stocker on the overnight shift. He says it was a good way to try out Target. MARIO JUAREZ: It's nothing permanent. It's just kind of, like, testing the water. You want to see what it's about. You can apply seasonal, and then if you like it or not, you can leave. It's not going to be a problem. GOETZ: The National Retail Federation says U. S. retailers are looking to add more than 700,000 jobs this holiday season. That's about the same as last year. But finding workers could be harder this time around. The U. S. unemployment rate has fallen to just 5 percent, the lowest in recent years. Chris Christopher's an economist for IHS Global Insight. He says one reason for the unemployment dip is that some workers were discouraged by the recession and have dropped out altogether. CHRIS CHRISTOPHER: It's people leaving the labor force. We had some good employment numbers. However, people sort of get fed up looking or they just don't want that particular type of job. GOETZ: So employers must hire from a smaller pool of job seekers. And these days, they need workers who can help boost sales both in the store and online. Jack Kleinhenz is the chief economist with the NRF. He says added conveniences and an improved economy are driving hiring. For example, this past August. . . JACK KLEINHENZ: There were 650,000 openings, and we haven't seen that in the last 10 years. And there has been, you know, a considerable amount of hiring going on. GOETZ: And with more permanent jobs available, workers are passing on seasonal work. Some employers are offering higher hourly pay as an added incentive. Delivery companies that partner with stores are also in a hiring binge. For example, FedEx says it's adding 55,000 temps - that's nearly triple the number from just three years ago. Back in Minnesota, Carly Hoffman was at Target to pick up a birthday cake. She says she now expects stores to make shopping as convenient as possible, and that can mean blending store visits with online shopping. CARLY HOFFMAN: I think they're necessary, and I think in theory it's great. But, like, I tried to do that for a friend's baby shower just last week, and they lost my order that I placed ahead of time. So there's still kinks. GOETZ: But if Target can work them out, Hoffman said she'd shop that way more often. And that means the retailer might have to hire more workers to improve that experience.

And this morning, we're hearing from the world's third biggest producer of emissions that cause climate change, India. The carbon footprint of individual Indians is actually quite small. But with 1. 2 billion people, the country is very polluting, a lot of those emissions coming from burning coal. NPR's Julie McCarthy begins her story from the coal rich Indian state of Jharkhand. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: I'm standing in the pitch darkness in India's vast Jharia coalfields in the east of the country. The ground beneath me is black, but the earth before me in this open pit mine is on fire, coal seams burning at night, setting off a ghostly glow and emitting toxic gases such as CO2 into the atmosphere. India intends to triple its production of coal by 2030, extracting rich seams of black gold from cavernous pits like this one. Coal burning power plants account for 65 percent of India's energy today, and a ramped up reliance on the most carbon intensive fossil fuel presents a profound dilemma. A third of the world's poor live in India. Indians need massive energy to fuel new industries and jobs to pull millions out of poverty. Three hundred million more Indians need basic electricity. But coal and its byproducts are hazardous to public health. Even a brief stay in the cities of this Jharia coal mining area takes a toll. A smoky film from its many coal fires burns the eyes and stings the throat. Soot covers homes and clings to forlorn-looking animals, all while India is opening a mine a month. Coal India, a government behemoth, mined 500 million tons of coal last year. We watch as operators at this open pit coal project dynamite the side of a terraced canyon that's so deep, the chalks below look like Tonka toys. Charan Singh, the general manager of this mine, leads us to an area of the Coal India subsidiary, where blasting is not necessary. India has virtually no oil or gas, but we crunch over row upon row of neatly piled deposits of coal that stretch across the land like a farm at harvest. We're standing on seams of coal. CHARAN SINGH: Seams of coal. MCCARTHY: It looks like crops in a field. SINGH: Yeah, yes, we are cropping coal here. This is a coalfield. MCCARTHY: Machines cut away surface rock to expose the coal seam that is then pummeled into slate-shaped chips. Singh says the crushing on-site saves electricity and shrinks the carbon footprint here. In one year, he's reduced the footprint of two mines by 5 percent and 7 percent. I ask if that progress isn't too modest for a world anxious about India's pollution. World, he says, be patient. SINGH: Be patient because you have progressed, but we still require time. We are increasing the production and reducing the footprint. You can't say that we are not taking action. We are taking action. MCCARTHY: Anil Swarup, the secretary of India's Coal Ministry, says India is committed to switching to cleaner energy as part of its pledge to the U. N. climate convention. India set an ambitious target of 100 gigawatts of solar energy by 2022, a nearly 25-fold increase. Swarup says by 2030, coal will make up just 45 percent of India's power generation. But until renewables are more widely available, Swarup says coal must be king. ANIL SWARUP: No one would want coal to happen. Coal is happening because that's the only alternative available with us at this point in time. Until there is an answer available, how do you suddenly stop mining coal? You can't. MCCARTHY: The affirmed goal for negotiators in Paris is to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. But, India opposes efforts to obligate countries, especially developing economies, to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Coal secretary Swarup says per capita, India releases one-twelfth of the heat-trapping gases the United States does and that forcing Indians to cut emissions would unfairly penalize them. SWARUP: Per capita consumption of energy in this country is of the levels of 19th century U. S. And yet everyone is looking at India as if India is trying to not accept their responsibility. We are indeed accepting a responsibility. But what has to be understood very clearly is the requirement for development of this country. MCCARTHY: The need to develop appears to have eclipsed the imperative to preserve the environment. Much of India's air is foul, the water undrinkable. According to the World Health Organization, 13 of the world's 20 most polluted cities are in India. New Delhi's air registers the worst in the world, says the WHO. Before, during and after the recent festival of lights known as Diwali, small particulate pollution, much of it from cars, reached lethal levels beyond anything seen here previously. Meanwhile, India's Himalayan glaciers are melting, its farmland becoming arid. Sunita Narain of the Center for Science and Environment says climate change has already arrived in India. SUNITA NARAIN: We are getting unseasonal rain. We are getting hailstorms. We are getting frightening developments which is impacting our farmers. This is happening not even at 2 degrees. It should scare us. MCCARTHY: Julie McCarthy, NPR News, New Delhi. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  We are looking ahead to the big climate change summit in Paris next week.

Many people stayed home to shop online. And some of those who did show up at, you know, stores, as they're called, used their phones to try to get the best deals while they stood in line. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports on how the smartphone is taking some of the frenzy out of Black Friday. SONARI GLINTON: If you want to get a glimpse of just how hard it is out here for retailers, just ask Ava Bassarat. She's a shopper with a mission. She has a very specific reason for buying an iPod touch. AVA BASSARAT: I'm one of the only people in my grade that doesn't have an iPod, which really makes me feel bad 'cause all my friends are probably texting each other right now. GLINTON: Bassarat, who's 11, says the only reason she made her mother bring her to the store was to get a very specific deal. AVA: 'Cause I want to have money leftover when I buy my iPod. GLINTON: Every dollar counts now 'cause you've been saving your money? AVA: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: She's a smart shopper. She wants money in her wallet after she's bought the iPod. She doesn't want to spend it all. AVA: So I have, like, $100 more than what I need to buy. So I have $100 left in my wallet. GLINTON: Surveys show that consumers are demanding discounts and are willing to wait for them. Hannah Egan with IBM says the ability to research is changing the way we shop, which stores are starting to realize. HANNAH EGAN: What they need to think about and remember is that when consumers are waiting in line outside their store, they have their mobile phones with them. GLINTON: Egan says big retailers have spent billions beefing up their online presence. Online sales are growing, largely due to mobile. Egan says people are getting used to their phones and their phones are getting more shopper-friendly. EGAN: I mean, we've seen pretty much every maker of a smartphone come out and make a larger screen this year. And that enables easier shopping, whether it's removing that whole pinching - the pinching of the screen - just an easier interface comes with that larger screen. GLINTON: That doesn't mean that shoppers aren't coming out for the experience. Kris Gaines says she's mainly come to work off the turkey and champagne from the holiday. KRIS GAINES: You kind of want to go out. You kind of want to see what there is to buy. And, I mean, I went to Nordstrom's. Everything was gift-wrapped. So, you know, done deal. But online, I would say shopping - especially for myself - probably about 90 percent. GLINTON: But when it comes time to buy, Gaines says most of those purchases are likely to be done on her phone. Sucharita Mulpuru is an analyst with Forrester Research. She points out that Target, Amazon and Wal-Mart have poured billions into their mobile business. SUCHARITA MULPURU: The big challenge is to make money off of mobile because there is a ton of traffic coming from mobile devices. But what we call mobile conversion rates, the percent of people that actually buy after going to a mobile site, is pretty low. GLINTON: A big part of the frenzy for stores to get mobile and to beef up their online supply chain, I got one word for you - Amazon. A recent survey showed that nearly a quarter of households have Amazon Prime accounts, which, among other perks, offer free shipping and often lower prices. HOWARD DAVIDOWITZ: That's why they've got all the business. It's not magic. GLINTON: Howard Davidowitz is a retail analyst. He says in many ways, the move towards mobile is a play to keep up with Amazon. DAVIDOWITZ: Amazon is eating their lunch. Amazon's killing everybody. So there is no way not to invest in this business because of the performance of Amazon, who's gaining market share across the board. GLINTON: Let the holiday shopping season and the era of mobile retail begin. Sonari Glinton, NPR News, Los Angeles. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Black Friday shopping was reportedly a little less frenetic and crowded this year. Many people stayed home to shop online. And some of those who did show up at, you know, stores, as they're called, used their phones to try to get the best deals while they stood in line. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports on how the smartphone is taking some of the frenzy out of Black Friday. SONARI GLINTON: If you want to get a glimpse of just how hard it is out here for retailers, just ask Ava Bassarat. She's a shopper with a mission. She has a very specific reason for buying an iPod touch. AVA BASSARAT: I'm one of the only people in my grade that doesn't have an iPod, which really makes me feel bad 'cause all my friends are probably texting each other right now. GLINTON: Bassarat, who's 11, says the only reason she made her mother bring her to the store was to get a very specific deal. AVA: 'Cause I want to have money leftover when I buy my iPod. GLINTON: Every dollar counts now 'cause you've been saving your money? AVA: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: She's a smart shopper. She wants money in her wallet after she's bought the iPod. She doesn't want to spend it all. AVA: So I have, like, $100 more than what I need to buy. So I have $100 left in my wallet. GLINTON: Surveys show that consumers are demanding discounts and are willing to wait for them. Hannah Egan with IBM says the ability to research is changing the way we shop, which stores are starting to realize. HANNAH EGAN: What they need to think about and remember is that when consumers are waiting in line outside their store, they have their mobile phones with them. GLINTON: Egan says big retailers have spent billions beefing up their online presence. Online sales are growing, largely due to mobile. Egan says people are getting used to their phones and their phones are getting more shopper-friendly. EGAN: I mean, we've seen pretty much every maker of a smartphone come out and make a larger screen this year. And that enables easier shopping, whether it's removing that whole pinching - the pinching of the screen - just an easier interface comes with that larger screen. GLINTON: That doesn't mean that shoppers aren't coming out for the experience. Kris Gaines says she's mainly come to work off the turkey and champagne from the holiday.

The International Monetary Fund today announced plans to include China's currency in its lending reserve. And this is an important step for China. It's a recognition of the country's role as a global economic power. But as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, the yuan is still far from being a reserve currency around the world. YUKI NOGUCHI, BYLINE: The IMF's lending reserves are made up the world's most prominent reserve currencies. That are currently four on that elite list - the U. S. dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. Each one is freely traded, and each represents a country or group of countries with the euro that do a lot of exporting. What's interesting is that the yuan is not a popular reserve currency. It makes up about 1 percent of the money held by the world's central banks. But in recognition of the country's growing significance in international trade and its recent liberalization of its monetary policies, the IMF says its currency now belongs on that list. Christine Lagarde is managing director of the IMF. CHRISTINE LAGARDE: And it will clearly better represent the international community based on those two criterion of trade and of freely usable currency. NOGUCHI: The move will likely increase the world's appetite for the yuan but only in the long run, says Nicholas Lardy, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. NICHOLAS LARDY: This is, in effect, kind of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. It doesn't mean you're going to buy the product, but you're more likely to look at it carefully and consider doing that. And I think central banks will begin to accumulate R&B assets very slowly at first but perhaps building over time. NOGUCHI: Lardy says the move will put pressure on China to liberalize its monetary policy even more. He says the impact on the U. S. will not be felt immediately. Historically, it takes a long time for a new currency to displace incumbents. And the U. S. dollar, the most popular currency, makes up over 60 percent of the world's reserves.

LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: You know the stereotype. Americans don't make stuff anymore. Manufacturing has declined. People work service jobs or in finance and buy stuff made in China. INSKEEP: This week, we'll explore what is still American-made. Our colleague David Greene begins in the American metropolis with more manufacturing jobs than any other. DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: We've come to a place that some people might not expect. It is the Los Angeles area, which is, in terms of number of jobs, the biggest manufacturing hub in the entire country. And I'm with my colleague, NPR's Sonari Glinton. And Sonari, you and I are standing at an airport. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Yeah, this is - it's not a fun place to be, man. GREENE: Because you don't like flying. You like driving. But you and I are about to fly and go up in a very small helicopter that is sitting about 20 feet to your right. UNIDENTIFIED PILOT: I'm going to close the doors and put guys in there. (Over radio) Helicopter 3067 Poppa (ph) northwest corner with alpha (unintelligible) departure please. GREENE: And up we went. GLINTON: Holy mackerel. GREENE: Over the San Fernando Valley. We turned south, and soon we were right over Los Angeles International Airport, LAX. We are literally crossing over the runways. GLINTON: What am I. . . GREENE: There's actually a plane landing just below us. Wow. GLINTON: Yeah. GREENE: The Pacific is off to the right. We're looking left in search of this very recognizable building. So we're looking for a building here, Sonari, that has a big X on top of it. Is that right? GLINTON: Yes. GREENE: And that building is SpaceX. GLINTON: And SpaceX is the future of an industry that has its heart in Los Angeles, right? GREENE: Aerospace has been important in Los Angeles for, I mean, decades and decades. GLINTON: World War II and before - and if you look over here and you see the building. . . GREENE: Yeah, there it is - big, white X on top of the flat roof of a massive building there. This building used to be used to make, like, fuselages for airplanes, right? GLINTON: Yes, and now the idea is to put a rocket ship into orbit. GREENE: We're nowhere near orbit, just 1,500 feet. And now we're approaching the massive ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. GLINTON: A billion dollars in goods comes in and out of this port every single day - a billion with a B. GREENE: I just want to paint a picture here. There's so many shipping containers that look kind of small from up here. But they're just piled on top of each other, like a game of Tetris or when you were building Legos when we were kids. But it's just extraordinary. GLINTON: Look at all the ships that are waiting along the coast to get in. GREENE: From the port, we swing to the left now, inland, and back north, towards downtown LA. And below us, there's this sea of white roofed buildings. They're factories making everything from clothing to furniture, metal parts, food products. And we're going to spend some time down there tomorrow. I'm just struck because, I mean, downtown is right there. And literally in the shadow of those skyscrapers, you have factories - I mean, for miles. GLINTON: Yeah. GREENE: Why isn't LA known for this? GLINTON: Well, because we've got the thing that's awesome. We've got - we've got Hollywood, man. And that's - that takes up a lot of your headspace. GREENE: Right, Hollywood and that sign, which is actually getting really close. Yeah, we should get a picture of that. The Hollywood sign is outside our right window. GLINTON: That is nuts. GREENE: That is kind of nuts (laughter). GLINTON: Over here, this is Warner Bros. GREENE: Just sort of behind the Hollywood sign. GLINTON: Behind the Hollywood Hills. This is Burbank. And you'll see some of Burbank's industry way back there that has survived. GREENE: Now, let me ask you something, Sonari Glinton. A place like Burbank is now thought of as more studios and entertainment. But did that grow up because of manufacturing back in the day? GLINTON: Yeah, essentially, when these aerospace manufacturers in World War II and after got these big defense contracts, they needed space to go. I mean, this is back in the day. Like, this is about as far as people came. Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra and people like that lived in, like, some big houses over here. And this was orange groves for a long, long time. So if you were looking to build a factory, you were going to come to a place where you had access to water. And you had a lot of space, and because of the automobile, you could get people there. GREENE: So you could say manufacturing sort of, I mean, created the geography of Los Angeles as it is today. GLINTON: Yeah. GREENE: Sonari, I think on this flight, I mean, it looks like we're going down here. But I'm just amazed at the amount of space that is taken up by things related to manufacturing. You just don't think of LA in that way. GLINTON: We still make stuff here in LA, whether it's a movie or a drone. GREENE: Perfect way to finish our flight as we have touched down now. I'm going to shake your hand because we've made it safely. GLINTON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GREENE: Now, let's be clear. It is not like manufacturing is thriving here the way it once did. There's so many challenges in today's economy. And let's zero in on one industry we saw from the air, aerospace. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The Vultee (ph) plant, Downey, Calif. GREENE: This old video was playing up LA's role in making planes during World War II. And then later, legendary LA Dodgers announcer Vin Scully made this in the 1970s. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)VIN SCULLY: You can sit in a seat like this at the ballpark. Here's another kind of a seat from a Wide Body Continental Airlines DC-10. GREENE: Made in Southern California. But let's move to today. The aerospace industry has lost tens of thousands of jobs over the past 25 years. There's no more Cold War, no space race. Costs are high in Southern California, and some companies are moving. Jeff Hynes has lived through all of this. JEFF HYNES: So let's put on our glasses. GREENE: Sure. HYNES: We're going to walk through the two factories where all of our polymeric composite work is done. GREENE: He's the CEO of a company called Composites Horizons. They make jet engine parts that can withstand a lot of heat. He loves this work. HYNES: There is certainly no greater joy for a manufacturer to walk through the factory and hear the noises and sounds of machines turning and people doing work. GREENE: We sat with him in the conference room of the company that his dad started in 1976. HYNES: We're in a transformational time. Just aerospace manufacturing in general, it's a good time. So yeah, we aren't looking at a cliff. GREENE: The cliff for Jeff Hynes was 1997, when McDonnell Douglas, huge airplane manufacturer, left after merging with Boeing in Seattle. Hynes' company instantly lost 40 percent of its work. HYNES: So we were kind of in a seminal moment in terms of determining where we were going to go with the business. GREENE: The company shrank but then reinvented itself, focusing more on a niche, these specialized jet engine parts that can get super-hot. You started saying no to things that were not sort of in your wheelhouse. HYNES: In our wheelhouse, right. And it's a scary thing to do when your business gets cut. GREENE: A lot of companies have had to take risks like that. Some American manufacturers have figured out that in this crazy global marketplace, one way to survive is to focus on something high-end or specialized and just to do it really well. But that's presented another challenge. HYNES: It's not likely that we're going to find people that are trained in the skills that we need them to be trained in. GREENE: Specialized manufacturers are not finding the workers they need. The companies are doing their best to train on their own, but schools are beginning to adapt as well. And my colleague Shereen Marisol Meraji from NPR's Code Switch team visited one. PHILIP YAGHMAI: So on the tool path, what operation would you choose? UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Drills. YAGHMAI: Exactly, drilling. SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: It's about 10 in the morning. And six guys have been slouched in front of computer screens for nearly two hours in Professor Philip Yaghmai's machining 101 course at El Camino Community College in Compton. Eighty percent of the world's aerospace fasteners - nuts, bolts, things that hold one part of a plane to another - are made right here in Southern California. And with industry help, Yaghmai developed the only community college program in the country that trains machinists to make them. YAGHMAI: On a CNC, once you bring the tool down, it's a piece of cake. Keep it down. Save the time. Save manufacturing time. Just go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. MERAJI: The students are drilling five different types of holes in a metal block virtually, using computer-aided manufacturing software. Yaghmai, who's 62 and originally from Iran, worked most of his life in the U. S. as a mechanical engineer but has been a professor here in Compton for the past six and a half years. YAGHMAI: I felt I could contribute more here at Compton. MERAJI: Why is that? YAGHMAI: A number of reasons. My wife is African-American. And I like to contribute to the people that are maybe not economically as privileged as some other places. MERAJI: Compton is an economically depressed community. Only 7 percent of residents hold a bachelor's degree. African-Americans were once the majority, but now Latinos hold that status. And in Yaghmai's class today, all the students are Hispanic, like Franz Dirzo, whose parents migrated from southern Mexico. Dirzo finishes his overnight job operating a forklift for Lowes at 5 a. m. , grabs a bite and a nap and takes class from 8 to 3 two days week. He's hoping he'll land a job in aerospace making more an hour. FRANZ DIRZO: Oh, I'm hearing things from, like, 18, 20, so very, you know, enticing. MERAJI: How much are you making now, if you don't mind me asking? DIRZO: Thirteen. MERAJI: He's encouraged his cousin, 24-year-old Jose Lazaro, who's working at Home Depot, to join him. DIRZO: I figured it would be useful for the two of us. MERAJI: Yaghmai says Lazaro and Dirzo are two of his better math students. And basic math is one of the skills necessary if you're hoping to be an aerospace machinist. But, he adds, it's also one of the reasons recruiting and retaining students has been tough. YAGHMAI: I grew up in a different country. And in that country, to say I don't know math was a shame. Here in the United States, it seems like it's a matter of pride for someone to say, oh, I'm not good at math. MERAJI: And it's not just the math that makes holding onto students hard. They skew older. Many have families to support, and they come to class after working long hours. Even his good math students, cousins Dirzo and Lazaro, have been coming late, missing class or nodding off during the lectures. Yaghmai says he doesn't mind sleeping in class, as long as they show up. Lazaro says he and his cousin have a plan, and they won't quit. JOSE LAZARO: We're going to SpaceX. That's the goal right there. I see myself at SpaceX. I see him at SpaceX. That's where we're going. MERAJI: SpaceX - two of Yaghmai's students have landed jobs there. And about 70 have gotten job offers from aerospace fastener companies in the last couple of years. But the industry insiders I spoke with told me the skilled labor one small community college program can provide is frankly nowhere near enough. Their boomer workforce is retiring. And they're worried. Shereen Marisol Meraji, NPR News, Compton, Calif. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Here's a chance to get a fuller picture of this nation's economy.

Some American manufacturers have figured out that in this crazy global marketplace, one way to survive is to focus on something high-end or specialized and just to do it really well. But that's presented another challenge. HYNES: It's not likely that we're going to find people that are trained in the skills that we need them to be trained in. GREENE: Specialized manufacturers are not finding the workers they need. The companies are doing their best to train on their own, but schools are beginning to adapt as well. And my colleague Shereen Marisol Meraji from NPR's Code Switch team visited one. PHILIP YAGHMAI: So on the tool path, what operation would you choose? UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: Drills. YAGHMAI: Exactly, drilling. SHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, BYLINE: It's about 10 in the morning. And six guys have been slouched in front of computer screens for nearly two hours in Professor Philip Yaghmai's machining 101 course at El Camino Community College in Compton. Eighty percent of the world's aerospace fasteners - nuts, bolts, things that hold one part of a plane to another - are made right here in Southern California. And with industry help, Yaghmai developed the only community college program in the country that trains machinists to make them. YAGHMAI: On a CNC, once you bring the tool down, it's a piece of cake. Keep it down. Save the time. Save manufacturing time. Just go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. MERAJI: The students are drilling five different types of holes in a metal block virtually, using computer-aided manufacturing software. Yaghmai, who's 62 and originally from Iran, worked most of his life in the U. S. as a mechanical engineer but has been a professor here in Compton for the past six and a half years. YAGHMAI: I felt I could contribute more here at Compton. MERAJI: Why is that? YAGHMAI: A number of reasons. My wife is African-American. And I like to contribute to the people that are maybe not economically as privileged as some other places. MERAJI: Compton is an economically depressed community. Only 7 percent of residents hold a bachelor's degree. African-Americans were once the majority, but now Latinos hold that status. And in Yaghmai's class today, all the students are Hispanic, like Franz Dirzo, whose parents migrated from southern Mexico. Dirzo finishes his overnight job operating a forklift for Lowes at 5 a. m. , grabs a bite and a nap and takes class from 8 to 3 two days week. He's hoping he'll land a job in aerospace making more an hour. FRANZ DIRZO: Oh, I'm hearing things from, like, 18, 20, so very, you know, enticing. MERAJI: How much are you making now, if you don't mind me asking? DIRZO: Thirteen. MERAJI: He's encouraged his cousin, 24-year-old Jose Lazaro, who's working at Home Depot, to join him. DIRZO: I figured it would be useful for the two of us. MERAJI: Yaghmai says Lazaro and Dirzo are two of his better math students. And basic math is one of the skills necessary if you're hoping to be an aerospace machinist. But, he adds, it's also one of the reasons recruiting and retaining students has been tough. YAGHMAI: I grew up in a different country. And in that country, to say I don't know math was a shame. Here in the United States, it seems like it's a matter of pride for someone to say, oh, I'm not good at math. MERAJI: And it's not just the math that makes holding onto students hard. They skew older. Many have families to support, and they come to class after working long hours. Even his good math students, cousins Dirzo and Lazaro, have been coming late, missing class or nodding off during the lectures. Yaghmai says he doesn't mind sleeping in class, as long as they show up. Lazaro says he and his cousin have a plan, and they won't quit. JOSE LAZARO: We're going to SpaceX. That's the goal right there. I see myself at SpaceX. I see him at SpaceX. That's where we're going. MERAJI: SpaceX - two of Yaghmai's students have landed jobs there. And about 70 have gotten job offers from aerospace fastener companies in the last couple of years. But the industry insiders I spoke with told me the skilled labor one small community college program can provide is frankly nowhere near enough. Their boomer workforce is retiring. And they're worried. Shereen Marisol Meraji, NPR News, Compton, Calif.", "section": "American Made: The New Manufacturing Landscape", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The first big meeting took place 18 years ago in Japan. The Kyoto conference produced the first international treaty to slow climate change. But the treaty fell apart, and scientists say the planet is now closer than ever to a climate catastrophe. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports that this time negotiators say they've got a radically new approach to avoid a repeat of Kyoto. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: You could say the 1990s was when the world got a little scarier. Scientists said the planet is warming unnaturally and they were pretty sure humans were causing it by burning too much fossil fuels like coal and oil and natural gas that put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Governments met in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, to do something about it. Two weeks into the talks, though, it looked hopeless. People thought their economies would tank without energy from fossil fuels. Then Vice President Al Gore flew in to reassure everyone that cutting back on CO2 would not break the bank. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AL GORE: The imperative here is to do what we promise rather than to promise what we cannot do. JOYCE: A treaty emerged. It set targets for developed countries to reduce the greenhouse gases that cause warming. Gore reassured the developing world that they would be exempt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GORE: We understand that your first priority is to lift your citizens from the poverty so many endure and build strong economies that will assure a better future. This is your right. It will not be denied. HARALD DOVLAND: I thought we had come a very big step forward. JOYCE: Harald Dovland represented the Norwegian government in Kyoto. DOVLAND: We had the first commitment. We had a process on strengthening commitments. It didn't work out. JOYCE: Why not? Well, these emissions cuts were set to start 10 years later so everyone had time to prepare. But the U. S. never even signed on. The Senate would not approve it. And during that 10 years, China's economy took off. Their greenhouse gas emissions soared. Valli Moosa, a South African delegate at Kyoto, says the treaty was handicapped from the start. VALLI MOOSA: You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it. JOYCE: And many developed countries either didn't live up to their promised emissions cuts or dropped out of the treaty. By 2009, it was clear that Kyoto was not going to slow the planet's fever. World governments met in a mood of desperation in Copenhagen to draft a new treaty. They failed. Rich countries were worried about ruining their economies. And many wanted developing nations to pitch in as well. That set off a global spat. You made this mess, said the developing countries. It's like the sign at the gift shop. You break it, you pay for it. Copenhagen rattled the international climatocracy so much that they radically changed course. So for Paris, here's the thinking. For one thing, says South Africa's Valli Moosa, international bureaucrats just cannot tell the world's biggest economies what to do. MOOSA: I don't believe that you're going to be able to make through this process a China or a United States do something that it already doesn't want to. JOYCE: So this time, governments are volunteering to limit emissions. The limits won't be set by international bureaucrats. Moreover, everybody, not just the developed world, has to limit their emissions. And now there's lots of money for developing countries to use to help with climate change. There's an international fund that will have $100 billion in it eventually. The U. S. has promised $3 billion; China, $3. 1 billion. French climate negotiator Laurence Tubiana says the message from Paris will be you can get rich and still reduce emissions. LAURENCE TUBIANA: How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emission reductions - it's no more. And now from the Chinese to even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy. JOYCE: So the Paris conference, the climate community wants you to know, will be very different from the diplomatic failures of the past. Valli Moosa, the former climate negotiator who's now a businessman in South Africa, says he hopes that people are still listening. MOOSA: You know, the eyes just glaze over. Now, even people in the environmental movement actually don't understand the detail of the current negotiations because they just can't - you just can't keep up your energy to follow all of this stuff for so many years. JOYCE: But he and everyone else in the climate policy world say this problem is way too big to have any simple solution. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

The economy there is just now starting to grow after half a century of decline. Supporters of the Buffalo Billion, as the plan is known, are calling it a possible national model for struggling cities, but other people say it's an expensive and risky way to create jobs. NPR's Joel Rose reports from Buffalo. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Fully half of the Buffalo Billion is going to one place. It's billed as the largest solar panel factory in the Western hemisphere rising on the site of a demolished steel plant in south Buffalo. So is there actually a factory on this scale doing this anywhere in the country? STEVE JAMES: Maybe there's some that are 50 percent bigger in China, but there's nothing nearly this big in the U. S. ROSE: That's Steve James of SolarCity, the company that will lease the finished factory from the state. It looks like a bunch of empty big-box stores squeezed together. Until now, SolarCity bought all its panels from China. James says that will change when this factory opens late next year. JAMES: You know, we really sharpened our pencil and made sure that every aspect of, you know, the whole supply chain is low enough cost to be very competitive globally. ROSE: New York state is betting that James is right, that SolarCity is going to turn Buffalo and western New York into a hub for advanced manufacturing and renewable energy. The state is funneling cash and tax incentives into those industries and more with the goal of jumpstarting the modest turnaround that's already happening here. Real estate prices are going up, millennials are moving into the city, and for the first time in years, giant construction cranes are rising into the sky. HOWARD ZEMSKY: The outlook for Buffalo is a lot different than it was five years ago. ROSE: Howard Zemsky is a local real estate developer and the president of Empire State Development, the state agency that's in charge of the Buffalo Billion. We're standing on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus near downtown, between a brand-new medical building and another one that's still under construction, thanks in part to millions of dollars from the Buffalo Billion. ZEMSKY: For a town that would've been easy to bet against after 40 years of decline, I think it's had a huge impact on Buffalo and western New York. ROSE: But to skeptics, it's a risky bet. JIM ALLEN: It better pan out. If it doesn't, boy, that's a lot of money that didn't work. ROSE: Jim Allen is an economic development expert in Buffalo's largest suburb, Amherst. He wishes more of that money was going to help startup companies get off the ground. ALLEN: If you look at Silicon Valley, you look at Austin, you look at Research Triangle, they grew organically. We're trying to do something that's never truly worked, which is try to lure a company in that's so wonderful that it's going to attract new - other companies to the area. ROSE: But New York state is betting on a company that has so far had trouble turning a profit, and Wall Street is nervous about what happens to SolarCity when the federal tax credit for consumers to buy solar panels expires next year. But Howard Zemsky of Empire State Development defends the state's investment. ZEMSKY: You know, people will say, well, what happens if things don't work out for SolarCity? Well, we own all the equipment and we own the facility, which is really where most of that money goes to. So I mean, in the worst-case scenario, the state is left with an amazing asset. ROSE: There are also questions about how the contracts for these huge construction projects were handed out. U. S. Attorney Preet Bharara reportedly issued subpoenas about those contracts earlier this year. That inquiry added to concerns that the state's investment won't be shared equally with everyone in Buffalo. CHARLEY FISHER: It's a billion, but for whom? ROSE: Charley Fisher is a former Buffalo city councilman and a community leader on the city's east side, which is largely African-American and low-income. Fisher wants to make sure everyone in the city has a shot at the new jobs. FISHER: It could be that a billion dollars could come here and if we're not careful, the disparities won't change. ROSE: The Buffalo Billion does include more than $30 million for job training, and SolarCity VP Steve James says the company will need to hire a lot of different skill sets. JAMES: Everything from people right out of high school, two-year degrees, four-year degrees, Ph. Ds. There'll be a few people like me either coming in from the outside because we don't have the experience here, but almost everyone is going to be local. ROSE: SolarCity has committed to hiring 500 people in the factory and a total of 5,000 in the state, but the folks who live near the factory in South Buffalo are skeptical. JACK SENGBUSCH: They're going to hire top-notch people. They're not just going to hire people off the street for anything. That's my opinion. ROSE: Jack Sengbusch has been living in South Buffalo since there was a working steel plant on the SolarCity site. SENGBUSCH: Back in the day, yeah, most of the people lived in South Buffalo that worked in this place. Businesses were going. Nothing was shut down. Now you look at it today, it looks like a ghost town. ROSE: Sengbusch says the solar panel factory is a good place to start, but it's going to take a lot more to replace what South Buffalo and the rest of the city have lost. Joel Rose, NPR News, Buffalo. MCEVERS: And tomorrow on Morning Edition, Joel looks at another driver of Buffalo's turnaround, the city's fast-growing refugee population.

While there are far fewer manufacturing jobs in the U. S. today, our country is still making stuff. We wanted to meet some of the people who were doing that. Los Angeles is a region better-known for Hollywood. But it actually has more manufacturing jobs than any other metro area in the U. S. , more than half a million total. When we heard yesterday from our colleague David Greene, he was high above LA in a helicopter. DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: I bet we could reach out and touch some of the skyscrapers of downtown LA right now. This is - we are very close to downtown and literally in the shadow of these buildings. There's Staples Center, the major sports arena in Los Angeles. I mean, we just look off to our left, then, and there's a lot of factories. Now, a lot of those factories we were seeing from that chopper, they make clothing. Fashion, it's always been part of LA's identity. And you certainly feel that when you visit the fashion district downtown. BRIAN WEITMAN: So the building across the street here was the old epicenter of the garment industry. GREENE: That's a guy named Brian Weitman. Every time you reach into your jeans for your keys and you rub your hand against the lining of the pocket, there is a chance that Brian's company made that material. WEITMAN: We supply pocket linings, inner linings, linings, waistbands, all the things that go on the inside of a garment. GREENE: You're the pocket-liner guy, if I may. WEITMAN: I'm the pocket-lining guy. I also do inner linings. So it goes inside the collar of your shirts. Plackets, dress linings, I. . . GREENE: Brian and I were standing below these beige towers - think total '60s, '70s architecture. It's a complex that's known as the California Mart. And it's a place that was once buzzing. WEITMAN: It was first-generation migrant workers working their butts off all day long on a sewing machine or cutting tables. And these buildings were just humming. And there were racks rolling in and out all day long. These freight elevators, you'd have to wait to just load your garments in them to get them out to get into a truck to ship out to a store. But everyone wanted to be around here because this was the hub. This was the only showroom center in LA. GREENE: There's a cool energy in this building. WEITMAN: It was an amazing energy. And also, inside of this building, you could almost, like, live in there and never leave except for sleep. They had a barbershop, drycleaner, I don't know, 15 different restaurants you could eat in, a dentist. People just spent all their time in this building. It was pretty unbelievable. GREENE: Now, you keep talking in the past tense. WEITMAN: Yeah, so today, that building right there - and I'm probably being generous - is probably at 50 percent occupancy. GREENE: And that tells one side of the story here. The fashion industry in LA has been bleeding jobs for years. A lot of low-end work has moved overseas. And this is impacting lives. My colleague in LA, All Things Considered host Kelly McEvers, has done some reporting on this. And I met her a few blocks away in a different part of the fashion district. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: We're sort of in the part where there's these very plain storefronts. But some of them, behind these steel, corrugated doors that, you know, come down with a big loud chain, are actually garment factories, places where there are tables lined up. There are women sitting at these tables, piecing together garments. GREENE: And I remember the story that you did last year that aired on our program. I mean, you were actually meeting some of the people who were working behind these doors that we're looking at. MCEVERS: I met two women, actually - one who had worked in this industry decades ago. She came here from El Salvador. She was able to raise four children on the money that she made doing this work, even though it was difficult work. And I met another woman, who works in the industry now. The first woman, her name's Esperanza Monterrosa. She did this work out of her house a lot of the time. She got paid per piece of garment that she sewed to another piece of garment. GREENE: Let's listen back to some of your piece from last year, if we can. MCEVERS: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)MCEVERS: Esperanza saved up, bought an industrial-sized sewing machine. A manager would drop off material at her house. ESPERANZA MONTERROSA: (Speaking Spanish). GILBERT MONTERROSA: She said sometimes, they would deliver the kids' diapers with the material that they would bring to her. They didn't want her leaving the house. For seven days straight, she would work and work and work, piece after piece after piece. MCEVERS: That's Esperanza's oldest son, Gilbert. He even worked back then, removing lint for 3 cents apiece. By the mid '90s, the garment industry was changing. Some big factories closed and sent work overseas. But still, immigrants kept coming to LA to do the work. MONTERROSA: (Speaking Spanish). MCEVERS: Esperanza says that's when the pay and the quality got worse. So did her eyesight. The kids eventually said they would support her if she quit. Gilbert now manages the Genius Bar at an Apple Store. Another son is a welder at SpaceX. The youngest daughter is in college. And the other daughter - well, listen to how this guy describes her. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Cynthia Florez is the daughter of a single mom who worked as a seamstress and a housekeeper, the first in her family to graduate from high school, the first in her family to graduate from college. MCEVERS: So even though the work for Esperanza Monterrosa was grueling, she was able to raise four kids on her own. Now you can't even do that. Economists say that's because when factories go overseas, it forces wages for unskilled work down. While the garment industry has helped keep LA as a manufacturing city for longer than other American cities, economists agree this industry is not the way of the future. So it's still dark. It's 6 in the morning. ELIA REYES: (Speaking Spanish). MCEVERS: It's early, and Elia Reyes is heading downtown. Elia is a trimeadora. She cuts pieces in garment factories for as low as 8 cents apiece, like almost half what Esperanza was making in the '80s and '90s. We make it to downtown and drop Elia off at the factory. It looks like just another storefront on a dirty street. We can't go inside. So we wait. REYES: (Speaking Spanish). MCEVERS: (Speaking Spanish). No work today, Elia says. She smiles, shrugs and asks us for a ride to the next factory down the street. GREENE: So that is from a piece last year from Kelly McEvers, host of All Things Considered, who I'm standing with in downtown LA. And Kelly, that's amazing. I mean, it sounds like a couple of decades ago, you could actually survive and raise a family. But now. . . MCEVERS: I mean, Elia Reyes was living in a one-bedroom of the back of a house here in LA and barely getting by - I mean, not enough to send money home, hardly enough to feed herself. GREENE: So manufacturing in LA is changing, and not always for the better. But there are success stories. Inside many of the buildings we flew over, people are working on high-end denim. That's been a bright spot. A lot of $30 jeans are made in Mexico or China. But designer jeans almost always come from LA. It's because hot trends will come and go. And designers can't really send stuff abroad and wait for it to come back. They're still using the talent and expertise here in LA. OSCAR QUINTERO: She's distressing all of the edges along the pockets. GREENE: They're doing it at places like Blue Creations. It's a washhouse that puts finishing touches on designer jeans - serious finishing touches. Designers send their instructions, and employees here cut those perfect designer rips. They iron. They sand. They load jeans into ozone machines to distress them, or they stuff them into massive dryers with a bunch of golf balls. O. QUINTERO: Throw the golf balls in with the jeans, and it tumbles. GREENE: What? O. QUINTERO: Yeah, it softens it up. GREENE: How loud is that? O. QUINTERO: Very loud - yeah, every loud. GREENE: That's like a million times worse than having just a zipper that's clanging around in the dryer. O. QUINTERO: Yeah (laughter). GREENE: That's Oscar Quintero. He and his family run this washhouse. With all those cheaper jeans being made overseas, Oscar is dealing with some seriously fancy designer stuff. O. QUINTERO: Yeah, yo, check these out. These jeans were made from a chemical from Japan, a special dye. . . GREENE: Uh-huh. O. QUINTERO: That's heat sensitive. GREENE: I don't think I would wear this color pink. I - wait. What are you - you're blowing on the. . . Whoa. You blew hot air on the legs, and it just changed the color. O. QUINTERO: Yeah, you go into the sun, and it'll change the color. . . GREENE: OK. O. QUINTERO: To a blue. GREENE: So who's wearing this stuff? O. QUINTERO: Kim Kardashian wears some of the jeans that we wash here. Kanye West has been seen. Drake has been seen. Rihanna has been seen - a lot of different artists. GREENE: And so jeans that cost two, maybe 300 bucks, they are coming through a washhouse that actually has really humble roots. Oscar's dad, Raul, who was also sitting with us, brought the family to the U. S. from Mexico in the 1980s. He worked in this washhouse, and then he bought it in 2004. RAUL QUINTERO: In the beginning, when I take over the company, I doing everything - sales, driving, answer the phone - everything. I don't have money to bring somebody to help me. GREENE: And you mortgaged your house - right? - to buy the company. R. QUINTERO: Yes. I did. I asked to the bank for to lend me some money. So that's how I started. GREENE: Why was the previous owner selling the company? R. QUINTERO: Because they know that some of the clients, they want to move the production to China. So that's why they sold the company. But I decided to stay here, and God helped me. GREENE: That was a big risk. R. QUINTERO: Yeah. But at that time, I didn't know. So maybe if I know what happening, maybe I don't take it. I don't know. GREENE: It's amazing. The people he was buying the company from didn't even tell him about all those clients fleeing for China. Here's this ambitious entrepreneur from Mexico who was unaware of that China narrative. He took a risk. And he is still in the game today. Did you worry about your dad when you were in high school, watching him mortgage your house and take. . . O. QUINTERO: Yeah, of course, it's a huge risk. There's a lot of money involved. So I was worried, to be honest. I was really worried (laughter). But I have a lot of faith in my dad. And he's made it possible all these years. GREENE: And Oscar feels a lot of pride when he's strolling by those loud machines and his dozens of employees working on these fancy jeans, the niche he and his dad have found to keep this company going. Oscar's holding one pair of hot pink jeans. What do you think personally of this design? O. QUINTERO: Personally, it's not my taste. But, I mean, there's a market for everything. GREENE: (Laughter). O. QUINTERO: I like more of a raw, more - nothing crazy. It's kind of funny. I'm here creating a bunch of different things, but I like the simple stuff. GREENE: We're meeting LA manufacturers this week, people like Oscar Quintero, in our series, American Made. WERTHEIMER: That's our colleague David Greene. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  American Made, that's what we're calling our series this week looking at manufacturing. While there are far fewer manufacturing jobs in the U. S. today, our country is still making stuff. We wanted to meet some of the people who were doing that. Los Angeles is a region better-known for Hollywood. But it actually has more manufacturing jobs than any other metro area in the U. S. , more than half a million total. When we heard yesterday from our colleague David Greene, he was high above LA in a helicopter. DAVID GREENE, BYLINE: I bet we could reach out and touch some of the skyscrapers of downtown LA right now. This is - we are very close to downtown and literally in the shadow of these buildings. There's Staples Center, the major sports arena in Los Angeles. I mean, we just look off to our left, then, and there's a lot of factories. Now, a lot of those factories we were seeing from that chopper, they make clothing. Fashion, it's always been part of LA's identity. And you certainly feel that when you visit the fashion district downtown. BRIAN WEITMAN: So the building across the street here was the old epicenter of the garment industry. GREENE: That's a guy named Brian Weitman. Every time you reach into your jeans for your keys and you rub your hand against the lining of the pocket, there is a chance that Brian's company made that material. WEITMAN: We supply pocket linings, inner linings, linings, waistbands, all the things that go on the inside of a garment. GREENE: You're the pocket-liner guy, if I may. WEITMAN: I'm the pocket-lining guy. I also do inner linings. So it goes inside the collar of your shirts. Plackets, dress linings, I. . . GREENE: Brian and I were standing below these beige towers - think total '60s, '70s architecture. It's a complex that's known as the California Mart. And it's a place that was once buzzing. WEITMAN: It was first-generation migrant workers working their butts off all day long on a sewing machine or cutting tables. And these buildings were just humming. And there were racks rolling in and out all day long. These freight elevators, you'd have to wait to just load your garments in them to get them out to get into a truck to ship out to a store. But everyone wanted to be around here because this was the hub. This was the only showroom center in LA. GREENE: There's a cool energy in this building. WEITMAN: It was an amazing energy. And also, inside of this building, you could almost, like, live in there and never leave except for sleep. They had a barbershop, drycleaner, I don't know, 15 different restaurants you could eat in, a dentist. People just spent all their time in this building. It was pretty unbelievable. GREENE: Now, you keep talking in the past tense. WEITMAN: Yeah, so today, that building right there - and I'm probably being generous - is probably at 50 percent occupancy. GREENE: And that tells one side of the story here. The fashion industry in LA has been bleeding jobs for years. A lot of low-end work has moved overseas. And this is impacting lives. My colleague in LA, All Things Considered host Kelly McEvers, has done some reporting on this. And I met her a few blocks away in a different part of the fashion district. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: We're sort of in the part where there's these very plain storefronts. But some of them, behind these steel, corrugated doors that, you know, come down with a big loud chain, are actually garment factories, places where there are tables lined up. There are women sitting at these tables, piecing together garments. GREENE: And I remember the story that you did last year that aired on our program. I mean, you were actually meeting some of the people who were working behind these doors that we're looking at. MCEVERS: I met two women, actually - one who had worked in this industry decades ago. She came here from El Salvador. She was able to raise four children on the money that she made doing this work, even though it was difficult work. And I met another woman, who works in the industry now. The first woman, her name's Esperanza Monterrosa. She did this work out of her house a lot of the time. She got paid per piece of garment that she sewed to another piece of garment. GREENE: Let's listen back to some of your piece from last year, if we can. MCEVERS: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MCEVERS: Esperanza saved up, bought an industrial-sized sewing machine. A manager would drop off material at her house. ESPERANZA MONTERROSA: (Speaking Spanish). GILBERT MONTERROSA: She said sometimes, they would deliver the kids' diapers with the material that they would bring to her. They didn't want her leaving the house. For seven days straight, she would work and work and work, piece after piece after piece. MCEVERS: That's Esperanza's oldest son, Gilbert. He even worked back then, removing lint for 3 cents apiece.

There's been less talk about what happens when refugees put down roots in their new community. Consider the case of Buffalo, N. Y. After losing jobs and people for half-a-century, the region is growing again, and refugees may be one reason why, as NPR's Joel Rose reports. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: If you want to see how refugees are changing Buffalo, the West Side Bazaar is a good place to start. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Unintelligible) combination. ROSE: It's an incubator for immigrant-owned businesses, and it's the only place in town where you can eat Ethiopian sponge bread, Burmese noodles and Peruvian chicken at the same table. It's also a market, with clothing and gifts. Nadeen Yousef is one of the vendors. She moved to Buffalo from Iraq last year. NADEEN YOUSEF: We are like family here family, family form different country (laughter). ROSE: My tour guide is Denise Beehag, a longtime staffer at the International Institute of Buffalo, one of several resettlement agencies in the city. Beehag started placing refugees in the neighborhood about 15 years ago. DENISE BEEHAG: And they were pretty much the only group that was moving into the west side of Buffalo and taking over those vacant houses and vacant businesses and changing the overall vibe of the area and making it a more desirable place to live. ROSE: Now, there's a coffee shop, bookstore and bar side-by-side with immigrant-owned restaurants and grocery stores. The neighborhood's population is growing, and property values are rising. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown says refugees are one reason why the city's population has stopped falling for the first time in decades. BYRON BROWN: It's a huge change since 2006. The presence of foreign-born residents of the city of Buffalo has increased by 95 percent. And that community feels that Buffalo has been a welcoming place. ROSE: Roughly 10,000 refugees have resettled in the Buffalo area since 2003, with the biggest contingents coming from Myanmar, Somalia and Bhutan. That's a huge influx in a medium-sized city, and it's brought some major challenges, too, like meeting the refugees' medical and mental health needs. UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Foreign language spoken). Yeah, so she comes from the Kayin State. ROSE: A translator helps a new refugee who's brought her three young children in for a checkup at the Jericho Road Community Health Center. The clinic has come to specialize in treating refugees since it was founded almost 20 years ago by Dr. Myron Glick. MYRON GLICK: We're resettling these refugees in one of the poorest cities in the country. We're taking folks who are already stressed, who are coming from refugee camps, and we're resettling them on the west side and east side of Buffalo. And it's great. They're helping to bring Buffalo back, but there is a cost. ROSE: The refugee influx has put an additional strain on a school system that's one of the most troubled in the state. There's been a spike in burglaries, especially among refugees from Myanmar. And there's lingering resentment from some residents about the specialized attention and support that refugees get. Mia James is a grandmother who's lived in Buffalo all her life. MIA JAMES: They come here; they get all the stuff. We get nothing. ROSE: What do you mean they got all the stuff? JAMES: They get everything. We're from here, and we get nothing - nothing. It's hard for us to even take care of our children here. ROSE: The mayor insists that local residents have access to all the same city benefits as refugees. And immigrants like Louise Sano say they've worked hard to get their businesses off the ground. LOUISE SANO: Hi. How are you? ROSE: Sano owns a store on Buffalo's west side called Global Villages, where she sells jewelry, gifts and clothing from Africa. SANO: Every piece has a history and a story. And I can always explain what it is all about. So I tell my customers, if it's not wow, don't buy it. ROSE: Sano was born in Rwanda and fled to Namibia in the 1990s. Four years ago, she moved to the Buffalo region, where her husband's family had resettled. SANO: People are very friendly. It's very easy to integrate as a new American, a new person coming to the U. S. So I feel like I have created my own village. ROSE: And Sano is changing the face of her new city in the process.

S. government reports another month of solid job growth. It happened in November, when employers added 211,000 jobs, according to the government. That sets the stage for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month. NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Job creation was widespread across the economy in November, with only a couple of industry sectors lagging. Mining, which includes the oil and gas industry, continued to lose jobs because of the oil glut, and manufacturing was down slightly. It's being hurt by a strong dollar and weak global growth. Wells Fargo chief economist John Silvia says the strong job growth, despite these factors, signals the basic health of the U. S. economy. JOHN SILVIA: We can worry about Europe and China and Brazil and everything else, but it does seem like the domestic U. S. economy is doing pretty well, thank you very much. YDSTIE: Silvia says continued job growth across most sectors also signals that the economy has largely returned to normal seven years after the start of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen expressed similar sentiments in appearances this week. She also said raising interest rates for the first time in seven years will be a live option at the Fed's mid-December meeting. John Silvia says this good employment report solidifies the case that the Fed will act, but he says the rise in interest rates to more normal levels will be gradual. SILVIA: If you look at the three-month moving average, you're talking about, you know, 210,000, 220,000 jobs. That's the kind of number that allows the Fed to move ahead but doesn't have to hurry. YDSTIE: Some economists have worried that the Fed has waited too long to raise rates and that inflation, which is currently well below the Fed's target, will quickly emerge as the labor market gets tighter and employers start raising wages to attract workers. But there was no sign of that in today's report. Wages rose just two tenths of a percent, well below the wage gains in a normal economy. Also the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent despite the November job gains. That's partly because hundreds of thousands of workers have joined or returned to the labor force in the past couple of months. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The U.

Wells Fargo chief economist John Silvia says the strong job growth, despite these factors, signals the basic health of the U. S. economy. JOHN SILVIA: We can worry about Europe and China and Brazil and everything else, but it does seem like the domestic U. S. economy is doing pretty well, thank you very much. YDSTIE: Silvia says continued job growth across most sectors also signals that the economy has largely returned to normal seven years after the start of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen expressed similar sentiments in appearances this week. She also said raising interest rates for the first time in seven years will be a live option at the Fed's mid-December meeting. John Silvia says this good employment report solidifies the case that the Fed will act, but he says the rise in interest rates to more normal levels will be gradual. SILVIA: If you look at the three-month moving average, you're talking about, you know, 210,000, 220,000 jobs. That's the kind of number that allows the Fed to move ahead but doesn't have to hurry. YDSTIE: Some economists have worried that the Fed has waited too long to raise rates and that inflation, which is currently well below the Fed's target, will quickly emerge as the labor market gets tighter and employers start raising wages to attract workers. But there was no sign of that in today's report. Wages rose just two tenths of a percent, well below the wage gains in a normal economy. Also the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent despite the November job gains. That's partly because hundreds of thousands of workers have joined or returned to the labor force in the past couple of months.

But yesterday, a team of scientists unveiled something new that took a lot of people here by surprise. NPR's Christopher Joyce is here in Paris covering the summit with me and has this report. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Since the 1960s, scientists have tracked what's been an almost inexorable rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas that causes warming, so more CO2 means more warming. Last year, however, that rise apparently flattened out, and this year, CO2 emissions around the world actually dipped. Climate scientist Rob Jackson from Stanford University says it's a small dip - less than 1 percent - but it's significant. ROB JACKSON: I was surprised by the result. Previously, we've only seen this sort of thing when global economies were in crisis. That's the most exciting piece of this puzzle. We're seeing a flattening or a decline in emissions at a time when the global economy is still growing robustly. JOYCE: Usually when economies are doing well, they're using more energy and putting out more CO2. Jackson and an international team used data from the Global Carbon Project, which tracks worldwide CO2 emissions. Climate scientist Corinne Le Quere from the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom says there's one main reason for the good news. CORINNE LE QUERE: It's mostly down to China's use of coal. JOYCE: China burns an enormous amount of coal, and that creates an enormous amount of CO2. LE QUERE: And now China's economic growth has slowed down. They have done massive measures to deal with their problem of air pollution. And all of a sudden, well, it looks like their use of coal in 2015 has actually gone down. JOYCE: That's lowered China's CO2 emissions a startling 4 percent this year. Worldwide, a total decline is less than that - less than 1 percent. It's not much, but it reverses a relentless increase over the past few years. Writing in the journal Nature Climate Science, the team also notes that the emissions from Western Europe and the U. S. have also flattened out. That's largely due to a lot more solar and wind power and natural gas replacing coal in the U. S. But Le Quere says it's China, the world's biggest source of CO2, that will drive the ups and downs in the admissions numbers for the world. And she says people should not expect the downturn to last. LE QUERE: From now, whether the emissions are going to pick up again in China, I certainly think they will. JOYCE: Because, she says, China's economy will probably revive. Moreover, the researchers say the findings are based on emissions reports from China, which have not always been accurate. But John Holdren, the science adviser to the White House, says whether the decline is a blip or more permanent, it suggests that a real decline in emissions is within reach. JOHN HOLDREN: The global total should absolutely be going down after 2020. So what we are seeing now is a good sign, and it should not be regarded as cause for false hope. It should be regarded as cause for real hope that the world is turning this around. But we'll need to do much more. JOYCE: That's because India will soon be the world's biggest source of CO2 instead of China, as it embraces coal to bring electricity to hundreds of millions of its citizens.

S. economy cranking again. They've been really aggressive. They've kept interest rates at zero. They done something called quantitative easing, spending $3 trillion to buy up bonds. It is looking like the Fed is going to end these policies soon, among other things, raising interest rates. And that's because jobs numbers and the economy as a whole appear to be improving. And let's talk about that, as we often do, with David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street journal. David, good to talk to you again. Good morning. DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So let's start with a - one simple question, or at least it seems simple. I'm not going to be so cruel as to make you answer it yes or no. But is the U. S. economy getting better? WESSEL: Absolutely. The U. S. economy is unquestionably getting better, though it's not great for everyone. We've recovered all the jobs we lost during the great recession, and the government reported last week we now have four-and-a-half million more jobs than we did before the recession. The official unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent, is down to 5 percent. And broader measures of the job market are improving as well. But lots of people are still on the sidelines of the economy not looking for work because they doubt they can find it. Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, made that point last week. Six million Americans have part-time jobs but want full-time jobs. More than 1 in 8 Americans with a mortgage has a house that's worth less than the value of their mortgage. Business investment has been sluggish, so the economy is better. It's been growing for more than six years now, which is a long time, but it's growing so slowly that we're not yet at full employment. GREENE: And I just wonder - that seems like an important point you made. If there are people out there who aren't even looking for jobs anymore, and in sort of the traditional measures you might think an economy is getting much, much better, but that can be a real problem if people have sort of given up. WESSEL: Absolutely, that - but I think the number of people on the sidelines has shrunk but it remains very large. And the question the Fed is trying to answer is, if the economy is doing better, would those people come back into the workforce and find jobs or have they been permanently sidelined on, quote, \"early retirement or disability? \"GREENE: So much has been done to try and get the economy to improve - I mean, these extraordinary steps the Fed has taken as we said. There was President Obama's stimulus package, billions of dollars in tax cuts and spending increases. I mean, why has this stuff not worked faster? WESSEL: Well, there are a lot of explanations, some of which reflect economic difficulties outside the United States. The different explanations are not mutually exclusive. And I don't think there's consensus among the experts. But there are a few hypotheses. One - history suggests economies take a long time to recover after a borrowing binge in a financial crisis. Two - maybe the Fed didn't administer the right medicine or in the right dosage. Three - after the Obama stimulus, the spending increases and tax cuts to which you referred, Congress got overly tightfisted. We had the across-the-board spending cuts of the so-called sequester, and that hurt the economy. On the other hand, economists who dismiss that theory say that Congress did create a lot of uncertainty about taxes, spending, the debt limit, and that kept businesses from hiring or investing more aggressively. And then finally, maybe the economy is like someone who had a heart attack. The economy's recovered, but it's now suffering from arthritis and diabetes. In other words, that we had an acute illness. It's been cured, but now we're showing signs of a kind of chronic economic disease. GREENE: Chronic disease - something that can't always be cured, though. WESSEL: Well, it can be treated. So what kind of chronic disease are we talking about? Productivity - the amount of stuff we produce for each hour of work - has been growing very slowly. That limits the pace at which wages can rise. We have a widening gap between winners and losers in the economy. GREENE: Just a few seconds left, David, I'm sorry. WESSEL: And there's a widespread lack of trust that interferes with the government changing policies that might be more growth friendly. GREENE: All right, David, thanks as always.

Ashley Lopez from member station WFPL has been spending time in a county where many people depend on Medicaid. STEPHANIE WILSON: I haven't - I'm not done. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Stephanie Wilson is cutting Angel Strong's hair at a salon in McKee, Ky. WILSON: All right, you want it shorter? ANGEL STRONG: I want some poof back there. LOPEZ: McKee is a tiny town nestled in the middle of the Daniel Boone National Forest in Eastern Kentucky. The town is in Jackson County, where the population barely breaks 13,000. And half of the people who live here are on Medicaid. Strong, the woman who's getting her hair cut, is one of them. STRONG: I had never had Medicaid 'cause I had insurance at my job. I was a nurse, you know? But I just - now I'm out of a job. And I'm looking for another job. But in the meantime, I had no income. LOPEZ: Strong got Medicaid recently because the outgoing governor embraced Obamacare. But the incoming governor, Matt Bevin, isn't a fan of expanded Medicaid. Strong says Bevin's position didn't affect her vote. She cares more about stopping gay marriage and abortion. STRONG: My religious beliefs outweigh whether or not I have insurance. SHANE GABBARD: I don't think that people was really worried about the health care swing of it 'cause it's not a hot topic here, you know. LOPEZ: That's Shane Gabbard. He's a county administrator and a local pastor. He says people worry about how there's nothing to do here, and there are no jobs. GABBARD: Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of factories here right now. We're working on that, trying to get some - get some industry going. And so we have a lot of people who have commuted out of the county to work. LOPEZ: While Kentucky's cities and suburbs have recovered from the recession, rural Kentucky is still struggling. Thirty-four percent of Jackson County's residents live below the poverty line, compared to almost 19 percent of the population statewide. Doug Justice helps people in Jackson County sign up for health insurance. He says most people here need some kind of financial help to get covered. DOUG JUSTICE: I do have some who are subsidized, you know. They get some help there. But the majority of mine's Medicaid. A lot of it is. And it's helped a lot of people. LOPEZ: Even though the future of Medicaid in Kentucky is cloudy, Justice says people don't seem worried about it. JUSTICE: They're not getting into the details. That either may be because they don't understand the ramifications of that should it happen, or they're just - they just say, well, I'll deal with it when it takes place. LOPEZ: Back at the hair salon in McKee, stylist Stephanie Wilson and her client, Angel Strong, say tough love might be good for some people around here. Both women say they voted for Matt Bevin because they say too many people in Jackson County rely on the government. STRONG: They want everything they can get for free. WILSON: And they think somebody owes it to them just because. Nobody knows you anything. You earn what you get. LOPEZ: Strong says she's optimistic Bevin will boost the economy, which will make it easier for her to find another job soon. Then she'll no longer need Medicaid.

That's according to a report from the Pew Research Center. Rakesh Kochhar is the report's lead author, and we welcome him to the program now. Hey there, Rakesh. RAKESH KOCHHAR: Hello. Thank you for having me. CORNISH: So we're saying that the middle class no longer represents the majority. Give us some context here. Who are we talking about? What are the parameters? KOCHHAR: Our definition is based on income. So if you live in a household whose income is two-thirds to double the national median income, we say that you are in a middle-income households. CORNISH: And so right now in America, if you have a family of three and your households making between 42,000 and 126,000 a year, you're middle-class. KOCHHAR: Right. CORNISH: In the '70s, 60 percent of Americans fit that description, and now that's shrunk to 50 percent. You call this a demographic shift that could signal a tipping point. So what would we be tipping toward here? KOCHHAR: Right. So if we have fewer people in the middle, the question is, where are they moving to? And we find they're moved both to the low end of the income distribution and to the high end of the income distribution. But when we take a deeper look within the lower end, we find that they are moving to the lowest end of the income distribution. And then when we take a deeper look at the upper end, we find that they're moving to the very top end of the income distribution. So the movement out of the middle is not just to the margins but to the farthest edges of the income distribution. In other words, there's a deeper polarization underway in the American economy. CORNISH: But does this mean that more people are experiencing success? KOCHHAR: Yes. Some indeed are, and specifically people who have experienced greater gains include older adults, people 65 and older, people who are married and people who have a college education. CORNISH: For people who are older, what is a reason that they've gained ground? KOCHHAR: Early in the 1970s, improvements in government benefits, especially Social Security and Medicare, pushed the poverty rate down dramatically among older adults. And over time, more and more older adults are spending time in the labor force in what used to be traditional retirement years. But keep in mind that they still remain more likely to be lower income than adults overall. CORNISH: Rakesh Kochhar is associate director of research at the Pew Research Center. Thank you so much for talking with us. KOCHHAR: Oh, you're welcome. CORNISH: The middle class has always been a potent symbol in American politics. And to talk more about what these numbers mean, we turn to Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi. Audie. CORNISH: So candidates on all sides always vow to strengthen the middle class. So let's talk about this - right? - the fact that it's shrinking. Why is this dynamic so important in an election year? LIASSON: Well, the middle-class squeeze, the fact that it's gotten harder to stay in the middle class or get into the middle class, is really the most important dynamic in this year's election. And middle-class incomes are about the same as in 1989. And voters are looking for someone who can provide an answer to the question, how can I maintain a middle-class lifestyle and make sure that my kids do better than me? And both parties have been having a hard time coming up with a compelling answer that question. CORNISH: But looking at the demographics here, which party should be paying closest attention? LIASSON: Well, I think both parties have to pay attention to this, but it is true that the Republican Party proportionally now has more non-college-educated voters, a greater proportion of white working-class voters. And they have spent - the Republicans have spent 50 years attracting these voters. They've had a compelling message for them, whether it was social issues or a rejection of the cultural elites. They haven't come up with an economic program for them, and I think that's one of reason that so many of those voters are gravitating to Donald Trump. CORNISH: OK, so looking forward, how should we think about this? LIASSON: When you have a prolonged period of middle-class income stagnation, which we have had, and a prolonged period of gridlock in Washington where politicians can't do anything about middle-class incomes, you get political volatility. And that's why you've seen, since 2000, all the elections we've had, with the exception of 2012, have been change elections. That means one house of Congress or both or the White House have - has changed party control. Voters keep on voting for change, but they never get the change they want. CORNISH: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  The middle class no longer represents America's majority.

Now, it's just half, not even the majority. Those are the findings of a new Pew Research Center survey we've been talking about this week. And today, we'll take a look at what to do about the shrinking middle class. And NPR's Scott Horsley joins me now to talk more about it. Hey there, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Audie. CORNISH: OK so to start, the Pew survey we've been talking about deals mostly with income. And we use, like, middle-income and middle-class interchangeably, but there are actually distinctions there, right? HORSLEY: Yeah. There's a lot of different ways to look at this, Audie. One is a sort of absolute standard of living. You know, you might think you're middle-class if you've got a solid roof over your head, plenty of food in the fridge. You get to take a vacation once in a while, maybe you have some confidence about your retirement. Another way to look at it, though, is how does your income compare to that of other Americans? And these are related questions, but they're not the same thing. The Pew researchers were very clear in defining the middle class in relative terms - that is, if you make between two-thirds of the middle income and twice the middle income, you're middle-class. For a family of three, that's between around $42,000 a year and $126,000 a year. So if that middle class is shrinking, it doesn't necessarily mean absolute standards of living have fallen, but it does mean that income's getting more stratified or stretched out. Most of us used to be bunched up somewhere in the middle. Now we've got more Americans making a lot more, and in some cases a lot less. CORNISH: And, of course, politicians are always, like, campaigning on protecting the middle class. But what tools really does the government have to address this? How could they fix the slide? HORSLEY: A big tool that has been used is taxes and transfer policies. The Pew points out that one of the big winners over the last four decades has been the elderly. More generous Social Security benefits help move a lot of seniors into the middle class from the lower rungs on the economic ladder. And, of course, a progressive taxation can whittle away at the top end. That's the most direct way the government can influence this distribution of income around the country, but there are some drawbacks. It can be inefficient so when you take a dollar from a wealthy person, it's worth less by the time it gets to a poor person. And politically, there are also limits to have anything that smacks of redistribution. CORNISH: So what are politicians looking at instead? HORSLEY: On the Democratic side, you're starting to hear about more ways the government could rewrite the rules. So the market itself divides the economic pie more equitably. So much of the pie in recent years has gone to the wealthiest Americans. A lot of those ideas have to do with boosting workers' bargaining power, whether through collective bargaining or things like mandatory overtime or maybe a higher minimum wage. Now, as we have seen under President Obama, none of those things is easy to do politically. But they are the kind of policies that could make a difference. Trade policy, immigration policy also come into play here, although the effects of those can be pretty complicated. CORNISH: What about Republicans? HORSLEY: In general, Republicans don't like talking about how the economic pie is divided. They prefer to talk about the overall size of the pie and how to grow it faster. One GOP prescription for that has been overhauling the tax code, which they argue has been holding the economy back. Now, making the tax code flatter, though, could exacerbate income stratification. In other words, the division of the pie could get even more lopsided. But, as Margaret Thatcher used to argue, the gaps in the ladder are less important to Republicans than the absolute height of every rung. Another proposal you often hear from Republicans has to do with workforce education and training. And certainly one of the findings of the Pew study is that Americans without a college degree are most at risk of falling out of the middle-class on the low end. CORNISH: That's NPR's Scott Horsley.

A year ago this week, the city emerged from a historic bankruptcy. That allowed the city to shed some $11 billion in debt. Construction is starting to boom in parts of downtown, one sign of an economic recovery. But as WDET's Quinn Klinefelter tells us, residents have mixed feelings about whether the city is really better off. QUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: At a news conference in Detroit City Hall, the head of one of the city's police unions, Mark Young, is facing something that he hasn't in almost 30 years on the job. The city, now unencumbered by the billions of dollars of debt erased through bankruptcy, is offering the woefully underpaid police force a raise before their contract is up. MARK YOUNG: I want to get the bankruptcy behind us. We have to move this forward. It's no longer the Motor City like it used to be, it's no longer Motown, but we can write a new history. KLINEFELTER: Detroit emerged from bankruptcy with a razor-thin financial cushion, where even being a few million dollars off in its billion-dollar general fund budget could trigger another fiscal collapse. But Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan says, even with the state having final say, the city is still making substantial progress. MIKE DUGGAN: You know, we have almost 90 percent of the lights in this city replaced. We have a full contingent of buses and the ambulances are arriving within eight or nine minutes, which is the national standards. KLINEFELTER: But some financial analysts say Detroit's bankruptcy has made the national bond markets leery of loaning money to any municipality. Stephen Spencer represented Detroit's major bondholders. He testified at a recent U. S. Senate hearing that the bankruptcy court allowed Detroit to pay far more of what it owed to city retirees than to bondholders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN SPENCER: Detroit wasn't a bankruptcy. It was a stick up. KLINEFELTER: Yet even those who Spencer claims received preferential treatment say they don't feel favored at all. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: In Jesus name we pray, hallelujah. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Hallelujah. KLINEFELTER: A group of Detroit city retirees is gathering at a church today. The retirees here lost a portion of their monthly pension payments, all the savings the city had invested for them and their health care benefits. Now retirees like Sheila Baker say they're paying five times more for health insurance while the city's downtown is booming with new construction. SHEILA BAKER: All of a sudden you've got money in your pocket? They knew what they were doing. You know, it's just all a racket, literally, and waited till we got older to do this to us. (SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION)KLINEFELTER: New development is erupting downtown - a new hockey arena complex, a new light rail line. Detroiters like Paul Garrison, picking his way through ongoing construction at a downtown park, called the efforts a godsend. PAUL GARRISON: Bankruptcy, in my perspective and opinion, was 10 years overdue. But fortunately, it did finally take place and so the money that the city will be bringing in will not have to all go to debt. KLINEFELTER: But only a few blocks away at Detroit's major transit center, bus rider James Jordan says he's yet to see the new development touch the city's outer-lying neighborhoods. JAMES JORDAN: OK, they're opening a Nike shop, but you never hear about a new housing development or a new grocery store being built in the heart of the neighborhood. KLINEFELTER: For their part, business leaders say Detroit cannot survive by becoming, in essence, two cities - one of haves and one of have-nots. Detroit-based businessman and auto-racing legend Roger Penske is helping redevelop the city's downtown. He says Detroit's success depends on making it a city people want to live in. ROGER PENSKE: To me, I'm going to be sure it's not two cities. KLINEFELTER: City officials are tearing down tens of thousands of blighted buildings and offering cut-rate prices to those who will move in and fix up salvageable homes. But Detroit still needs more jobs and a better school system. If efforts to make those improvements fail, Detroit's fragile financial forecast could again falter.

QUINN KLINEFELTER, BYLINE: At a news conference in Detroit City Hall, the head of one of the city's police unions, Mark Young, is facing something that he hasn't in almost 30 years on the job. The city, now unencumbered by the billions of dollars of debt erased through bankruptcy, is offering the woefully underpaid police force a raise before their contract is up. MARK YOUNG: I want to get the bankruptcy behind us. We have to move this forward. It's no longer the Motor City like it used to be, it's no longer Motown, but we can write a new history. KLINEFELTER: Detroit emerged from bankruptcy with a razor-thin financial cushion, where even being a few million dollars off in its billion-dollar general fund budget could trigger another fiscal collapse. But Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan says, even with the state having final say, the city is still making substantial progress. MIKE DUGGAN: You know, we have almost 90 percent of the lights in this city replaced. We have a full contingent of buses and the ambulances are arriving within eight or nine minutes, which is the national standards. KLINEFELTER: But some financial analysts say Detroit's bankruptcy has made the national bond markets leery of loaning money to any municipality. Stephen Spencer represented Detroit's major bondholders. He testified at a recent U. S. Senate hearing that the bankruptcy court allowed Detroit to pay far more of what it owed to city retirees than to bondholders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHEN SPENCER: Detroit wasn't a bankruptcy. It was a stick up. KLINEFELTER: Yet even those who Spencer claims received preferential treatment say they don't feel favored at all. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: In Jesus name we pray, hallelujah. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Hallelujah. KLINEFELTER: A group of Detroit city retirees is gathering at a church today. The retirees here lost a portion of their monthly pension payments, all the savings the city had invested for them and their health care benefits. Now retirees like Sheila Baker say they're paying five times more for health insurance while the city's downtown is booming with new construction. SHEILA BAKER: All of a sudden you've got money in your pocket? They knew what they were doing. You know, it's just all a racket, literally, and waited till we got older to do this to us. (SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION) KLINEFELTER: New development is erupting downtown - a new hockey arena complex, a new light rail line. Detroiters like Paul Garrison, picking his way through ongoing construction at a downtown park, called the efforts a godsend. PAUL GARRISON: Bankruptcy, in my perspective and opinion, was 10 years overdue. But fortunately, it did finally take place and so the money that the city will be bringing in will not have to all go to debt. KLINEFELTER: But only a few blocks away at Detroit's major transit center, bus rider James Jordan says he's yet to see the new development touch the city's outer-lying neighborhoods. JAMES JORDAN: OK, they're opening a Nike shop, but you never hear about a new housing development or a new grocery store being built in the heart of the neighborhood. KLINEFELTER: For their part, business leaders say Detroit cannot survive by becoming, in essence, two cities - one of haves and one of have-nots. Detroit-based businessman and auto-racing legend Roger Penske is helping redevelop the city's downtown. He says Detroit's success depends on making it a city people want to live in. ROGER PENSKE: To me, I'm going to be sure it's not two cities. KLINEFELTER: City officials are tearing down tens of thousands of blighted buildings and offering cut-rate prices to those who will move in and fix up salvageable homes. But Detroit still needs more jobs and a better school system. If efforts to make those improvements fail, Detroit's fragile financial forecast could again falter.

That's defined as someone with a disabling condition who has been homeless for more than a year or four times in the last three years. Ten years ago, Utah had about 2,000 chronically homeless people. Today, there are fewer than 200. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  But another 14,000 people just became homeless in Utah this year as another state's rising housing prices are a big part of the problem. Our co-host Kelly McEvers has this report. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: We are here in Salt Lake City, Utah. We are in a part of the city that's in downtown. There are a lot of services for homeless people here, and that means there are a lot of homeless people here concentrated in this one area. There's a shelter just up ahead of us. There are, right now, hundreds of people waiting outside to get a free meal. When you here about Utah, you sometimes hear that it's a place that's solved the problem of homelessness. And of course, when you come down to a place like this, you see that's clearly not true. That shelter we see is called The Road Home. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And this is Jennifer. MCEVERS: Hi. How are you? We go inside and meet Jennifer Carter, who's been living there with her two kids who are 5 and 7. JENNIFER CARTER: Do you guys want to take the elevator or the stairs? MCEVERS: She shows us a huge room upstairs that's full of steel bunk beds with thin mattresses. Carter says they call them jail beds. CARTER: This is my bed. MCEVERS: So you sleep on the bottom, and the kids sleep on the top or vice versa? CARTER: So yeah. I sleep on the bottom. I let them sleep on the top. Most of the time, my youngest sleeps with me. MCEVERS: About 200 people sleep in this room - all families - moms, dads, kids. It's cleaning time, so people's stuff is off the floor. Plastic bins full of clothes, shoes, fleece blankets and jars of peanut butter are stacked on the beds. Jennifer Carter has a degree in business management and accounting. She had a job answering phones, but her hours got changed to evenings, and she couldn't afford childcare. So she quit her job and worked odd jobs but couldn't make rent. CARTER: I tried to talk to the landlord about making an arrangement. I had most of the money, but I still needed a little bit. I was like, can you wait 'til Wednesday? And she told me if I didn't have it by Friday, I had to leave. MCEVERS: She was evicted. That was about two months ago. Then she moved into The Road Home. It's the second time the family's been homeless this year. The kids keep going to school, but then, when they come home, it's to a shelter. CARTER: The hardest thing is, like, they are tired because it's loud. There's a lot of people. There's a lot of crying babies. It's loud. They don't get a lot of sleep. MCEVERS: Are there fights? Like, do people have their disagreements? There must be. CARTER: Yes, lots. MCEVERS: So Jennifer Carter has a plan. While the kids are at school, she works the computers and the phones at the shelter. CARTER: My strategy is, I do 10 job apps a day, and I call 10 of the previous week. MCEVERS: The thing is, even if she finds a job, it might not be enough. CARTER: Even - I was making $13. 50 an hour. My rent was almost $900 a month for a two-bedroom. MCEVERS: Plus childcare. CARTER: They would have to go to daycare for two hours. It was $800 a month for both of them. MCEVERS: On top of. . . CARTER: On top of rent, food, clothes, toiletries, utilities. MCEVERS: How are you going to do it? CARTER: I don't really know (laughter). MCEVERS: Jennifer Carter is in the process of getting assistance called Rapid Rehousing. It's a program that many cities and states are using to give people just enough money to get a place to live. The idea is it costs less to pay a family security deposit and first month's rent than it does to keep them in shelter for months and months. But as housing prices continue to rise in Utah and in most major cities across the U. S. , this won't work long-term, says Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. NAN ROMAN: A better solution would be to have more longer-term rental subsidies, but we don't have them. So Rapid Rehousing is better than leaving people in shelter. MCEVERS: The real need, Roman says, is simply more affordable places for people to live, and this is a newer problem. ROMAN: I can say from my own vantage point that when I started working on housing and urban issues in the '70s, we really did not have widespread homelessness at all, and that's because there was an adequate supply of affordable housing. MCEVERS: So why hasn't - I guess, why hasn't more been done on this front? I mean, what's holding us back? ROMAN: You know, it's a mystery as to why there's not more attention paid to it. Congress regularly ranks housing as one of the things that they are least interested in pursuing or working on. There doesn't seem to be a lot of political will around it. And it's hard to see with 560,000 homeless people on any given night how bad things have to get before we decide to do something about it. MCEVERS: The federal government has a plan to end family and youth homelessness in five years. But with housing costs and rents continuing to go up around the country, getting people housed keeps getting harder.

This Wednesday, exactly seven years later, the Fed is on track to increase interest rates for the first time since. As NPR's John Ydstie reports, analysts are split on whether the timing is right. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Carl Tannenbaum is the chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. CARL TANNENBAUM: The Fed is certainly going to raise interest rates on Wednesday. They've waited a long time for this moment. YDSTIE: And Tannenbaum says the evidence is now clear that the economy is ready for a rate hike. The unemployment rate has fallen five percentage points from its peak during the recession, and job creation remains strong. TANNENBAUM: I don't think the Federal Reserve would be making or contemplating this move if they didn't feel confident that the economy could withstand it. And in fact, some market participants are likely to interpret the Fed's hike in interest rates as something of a vote of confidence. YDSTIE: But Megan Greene is not so sure. MEGAN GREENE: No, I don't think that the economic data really justifies an interest rate hike right now. YDSTIE: Greene is the chief economist at John Hancock Asset Management. She says there are still millions of Americans on the sidelines who want jobs or who work part-time and would rather have full-time jobs. And she says even with solid employment growth, wages aren't rising fast enough to push inflation higher. The Fed's mandate is to create the maximum number of jobs while keeping inflation in a sweet spot, about 2 percent a year, the level the Fed thinks is most conducive to healthy economic growth. For the past few years, inflation has been well below that target, and Greene says there's no sign that it's rising. GREENE: I think the inflation outlook would suggest that the Fed shouldn't be hiking. YDSTIE: Carl Tannenbaum acknowledges inflation is currently very low. TANNENBAUM: The numbers on inflation certainly would not, on the surface, support a raise in interest rates. YDSTIE: But Tannenbaum argues inflation is being held down in part by the sharp drop in oil prices, which he says will eventually reverse. He says rents, the biggest part of the consumer price index, are growing about 3 percent a year. He also points to a bump up in wage gains in recent jobs reports as a sign the upward pressure on wages is growing. That will boost consumer spending and put upward pressure on prices, he says. But Megan Greene is not convinced. She says an over-supply of labor globally is holding back the wages of U. S. workers. The modest wage gains they're experiencing won't lead to information, she says, and that means the Fed should leave rates right where they are, near zero. GREENE: That being said, I think that the Fed will go ahead and hike. YDSTIE: Greene says there are a couple of reasons the Fed might want to hike, even though there's no inflation pressure. One is that the Fed's low-interest policy has been aimed at pushing investors to take more risks to boost economic growth. But that can lead to bubbles in stocks, in bonds or real estate that threaten the financial system when they burst. Carl Tannenbaum agrees. TANNENBAUM: The longer that they take before beginning to raise interest rates, the more likely it is that we could have excesses build up in markets because credit is so cheap, and money looking for a home might take too much risk. YDSTIE: But in any case, Tannenbaum says the Fed's initial quarter-point hike in rates won't have much effect on the economy. And he says the Fed will likely signal it's going to take its time getting rates back to more normal levels. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

But oh, my goodness, it does not feel like the holidays out here at all - 62 degrees, the sun is shining. And the question economists are asking is, the lack of sleigh bells and eggnog - how will that affect retail sales this year? MANNY DESPORTE: The place is mobbed. LANE: What do you mean, mob? What do you see? DESPORTE: You can't find a parking space. We rode around for 10 minutes. LANE: Meet the Desporte family - Manny, Manny, Jr. and the grandson Anthony Carmine. Manny says the little guy here is the recipient of all their consumer love this year. DESPORTE: He's the guy. He's the main man. It's all about him. LANE: So the warm weather doesn't change anything about how much you're going to spend? DESPORTE: No, not really. LANE: They were on their way to an outlet mall in Deer Park, a suburb 50 miles east of Manhattan. Ever since gasoline prices tumbled and unemployment dropped this past fall, stores have been waiting for people like the Desportes to come in and do their holiday shopping. But initial sales reports seemed subdued, not exuberant. Chris Christopher is an economist with IHS Global Insight. CHRIS CHRISTOPHER: Many retailers, for the most part, maybe overestimated what we call the pump-price dividend in terms of spilling over into other areas. LANE: According to government reports, cheap gas this year should have given consumers an extra 700 bucks to spend. CHRISTOPHER: But it hasn't had the effect of really increasing consumer spending all that much. LANE: In late November, when weak Black Friday numbers came out, it caused concern. Some doomsday economists went so far as to declare the holiday season a disaster. But other economists say Americans may be just spreading out their holiday shopping over a longer period. Shawn DuBravac is an economist with the Consumer Technology Association. SHAWN DUBRAVAC: We've seen what used to be, historically, a single day gravitate towards late Thursday night store openings and then gravitating even earlier into the week. LANE: Instead of the infamous door buster sales with very limited quantity the day after Thanksgiving, stores are now offering larger inventory with less drastic discounts, so consumers just don't have that rushed feeling anymore. The effect is a broadening of the shopping season through November and December. Gus Faucher is an economist at PNC Financial Services. He says even though Black Friday numbers weren't so big, he still expects many consumers to start spending their gas savings as chilly weather and Christmas draw closer and more people catch the spirit that Manny Desporte already has. GUS FAUCHER: Consumers are feeling better about the way things are going. Things still aren't great, but they're definitely headed in the right direction. LANE: When the cold weather hits, they will be buying mittens and boots. And, on the final weekend of December after Christmas Day, consumers will also be armed with gift cards. Consumer Technology Association's DuBravac says retailers will capitalize on that with post-Christmas bargains. DUBRAVAC: Part of what they're trying to do is accelerate the redemption of those gift cards, and they're also trying to continue to leverage the momentum that exists around consumers and their willingness to spend. LANE: Most economists figure that by the time it's all over, holiday sales will have gained a solid 3. 5 percent. For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane.

LANE: When the cold weather hits, they will be buying mittens and boots. And, on the final weekend of December after Christmas Day, consumers will also be armed with gift cards. Consumer Technology Association's DuBravac says retailers will capitalize on that with post-Christmas bargains. DUBRAVAC: Part of what they're trying to do is accelerate the redemption of those gift cards, and they're also trying to continue to leverage the momentum that exists around consumers and their willingness to spend. LANE: Most economists figure that by the time it's all over, holiday sales will have gained a solid 3. 5 percent.

This week, though, seems to finally be the week. If they do go higher, those interest rates will be visible to most Americans in the form of higher mortgage rates. NPR's Chris Arnold has this look at the housing market. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Some people who are watching interest rates very closely - home builders. That's because this 100-year flood of a housing crash has been especially tough on that. So I guess this is in here is going to be the living room? DE DESHARNAIS: Yeah, exactly. So we have a big, eat-in kitchen. And this will be a two-story living room, so it's wide open to the upstairs. ARNOLD: De Desharnais is a homebuilder in Nashua, N. H. She's walking me through a half-built house that her crew is putting the siding on. Desharnais says she's lucky - her company survived the crash. But it's been painful. DESHARNAIS: We had 32 employees on our payroll at normal times. We have six on our payroll right now. ARNOLD: Still, really? DESHARNAIS: Yeah. ARNOLD: The housing market has definitely improved over the last few years. But Desharnais says homebuilders like her can't help but be a bit nervous about the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. That's because if mortgage rates were to rise by a lot. . . DESHARNAIS: People are out there finally buying. So builders like us that have been around a long time, we have big subdivisions that we've been carrying through that recession. I think there is a big concern if the interest rates go up that everything is going to come to a screeching halt. ARNOLD: But actually, she says, most homebuilders don't think that's what's going to happen. The Fed's been signaling that interest rates are going to start rising, but very slowly. And some of that's already baked into today's mortgage rates. Also, Desharnais says she doesn't see any rush by homebuyers to buy before rates go up. DESHARNAIS: I'm actually a licensed realtor as well. And no, people aren't out there going, jeez, we've got to hurry up and do something because the rates are going to increase. There's no sense of that within the real estate community at all. ARNOLD: Some economists, though, think that people who want to buy a house should have a greater sense of urgency. John Burns runs a national real estate consulting firm. He says mortgage rates are expected to rise by about one percentage point over the next several years. And that would mean that the same-priced house will cost you 12 percent more in monthly payments. JOHN BURNS: So if mortgage rates go from four to five, payments are going to go up 12 percent. That'll hit affordability hard. And I don't think that message has really gotten out there to people that they understand they should take advantage of where rates are today. ARNOLD: Also, Burns says it's once again become easier than many people think to qualify for a mortgage. He says that some of the biggest banks are not so eager to make home loans. But. . . BURNS: . . . There's a lot of non-banks like Quicken Loans and loanDepot that are taking a lot of market share from the banks. So as long as you can provide the income, and you are not, say, below a 660 FICO score - which is about a bottom 30 percent of the country - they can get you a mortgage relatively affordably. ARNOLD: As we look ahead to next year, one big question is whether first-time homebuyers will finally return to the market. William Wheaton is a housing economist at MIT. He says millennials just aren't settling down to buy houses like people have in past generations. A big issue there. . . WILLIAM WHEATON: The absence of marriages. ARNOLD: Wheaton says people 20 to 35 years old - if you look back to 1980, 1990 and 2000 - the share of households of that age that had never been married was about 30 percent. In the 2010 census, though, it was twice that - 62 percent. WHEATON: That's just an enormous change. These people are not getting married. I don't know why. That's a really interesting question. ARNOLD: And Wheaton says it's a question that has big implications for the future of the housing market. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

Pollsters saw a big shift after the attack in San Bernardino. It is hard to measure the cost of a tragic event like that. But we're about to meet a man who tries. Health economist Ted Miller analyzes the financial toll of violence. He crunches numbers on a variety of social ills, including mass shootings such as the 2011 incident involving former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords. In that event, 6 people died. Thirteen were wounded. TED MILLER: The worst wounded was Gabby Giffords herself. Her medical costs alone were well over half a million dollars. She was in the hospital for 140 days. GREENE: Wow. What about that incident over all - I mean, do you look at what an entire incident, when you have people injured, people killed, you know, costs society? MILLER: I haven't calculated that one totally. But we would figure that each death was worth about $7 million. And the way we'd look at that is we've - have interviews where people have been asked how much they would pay to reduce their chance of being killed or injured in a violent incident. People actually pay that when you look at housing prices. We pay more for housing in safe neighborhoods. GREENE: You're looking at actually the cost of a human life. Tell me more about exactly what you're looking at. MILLER: We're looking at the value of a human life, not the cost of a human life. GREENE: OK. MILLER: We look at the wage loss. We look at the household work loss. We look at the value people place on their pain, suffering, loss, quality of life. Fatality is a lot cheaper, medically, than surviving. It makes a real difference if you have insurance. GREENE: If you have insurance or not, if you're involved in an incident. . . MILLER: That's right. The Boston Marathon is interesting because people who were uninsured who were injured in that bombing, who were from Massachusetts, could even after the fact buy health insurance, whereas people who were not from Massachusetts couldn't. GREENE: You said something that makes me really uncomfortable, that you're actually better off dying, in financial terms, than. . . MILLER: In medical cost terms. GREENE: Medical costs. MILLER: The pain, suffering, loss, quality of life and lost wages is far larger if you die than if you live. Although, some people will live as quadriplegics. Some people will live with severe traumatic brain injury. There are people who, when you ask them, say that's a fate worse than death. GREENE: Is it tough sometimes to spend so many hours looking at this subject matter? MILLER: I think of my numbers as giving people the numbers they need to save lives. I mean, take the example of the cost of a bicycle helmet. I've looked at the savings from bicycle helmets. That's resulted in laws being passed some places. For a lot of legislatures, it can - it builds a legislative case. When we say a child seat returns more in medical cost savings alone than the cost of the seat, that makes it easier to pass a law requiring kids to be in child seats, going back to when we didn't have those laws. GREENE: So let's take an event that's still in the minds of a lot of people. And that's San Bernardino. Can we come to a number at San Bernardino if we sort of had a ballpark? MILLER: Probably about $125 million for San Bernardino. Perhaps more telling is the total cost of firearm injury is 235 billion a year. So 125 million is less than a day's firearm injuries on average - well less. GREENE: It's interesting because it's - I expected you to be saying, look at this tragedy in San Bernardino. The financial cost is astounding. But that's not exactly what you're saying here at all. MILLER: Yeah, no, what I'm saying is that that's a small piece of even a day's firearm injuries costs. GREENE: Well, Ted Miller, let me just ask you this last question about San Bernardino. Is there any way to put a number on the cost of fear that people are now feeling after something like that takes place? MILLER: There are costs that we've not been able to look at. One of them is the cost of just things like more security systems in homes and the effect, in general, of fear in the population. GREENE: How you might change your behavior or what you do because you're scared. MILLER: Yes. GREENE: Ted Miller, this is really interesting to learn about. Thank you so much. MILLER: You're welcome.

She's chief economist at John Hancock asset management. Welcome back to the program, Megan. MEGAN GREENE: Thanks. CORNISH: So talk a little bit about why you think the Fed might have moved too early on this rate increase. GREENE: Well, I think that the only economic indicator that really suggested the Fed should be hiking rates is the unemployment figure, which at 5 percent, is very low even by American standards. But I think the relationship between unemployment and wages and inflation, on the other hand, gets broken down. And so we've heard that inflation is well below the Fed's preferred targets. And Yellen spoke a lot about oil prices being lower, and they just need to stabilize for that to stop putting downward pressure on inflation. But even if you strip out the price of oil and look at core PCE, which is the Fed's favorite measure of inflation, it's around 1. 3 percent, which is well below the Fed's targeted 2 percent. And I don't think we're going to have any kind of upward wage pressures really coming in, and therefore, we're not going to have a lot of upper pressure on inflation, on top of which, as the Fed hikes, then every other major central bank weakens. The U. S. ends up importing a lot of deflationary pressures, so that will keep inflation on the floor as well. So I think the Fed could have afforded to have waited, but obviously they chose not to. CORNISH: But this was a unanimous decision, right? GREENE: It was. I think that there is a natural bias on the part of central bankers, generally, but the Fed in particular towards normalizing monetary policy. And part of that is because at the zero lower bound, monetary policy tools that the Fed's used to using just aren't as effective as they would like them to be. So they'd like to get rates up so that their tools are more effective. On top of which it, I think, when you have such extraordinarily easy monetary policy, the Fed starts being blamed for things like inequality because quantitative using and rates at the zero lower bound really boosts asset prices, and that really benefits people who are holding on to those assets - so the upper echelon of society. And so it's stoking inequality, and the Fed doesn't want to be under the spotlight for doing that sort of thing. And so the Fed would like to normalize monetary police to get out of the spotlight and under the influence of politicians or the media or society at large. CORNISH: You talked about the upper echelons. What about everyone else, right? I mean, how should people be thinking about their finances as this interest rate increase kind of signals the end of easy money? GREENE: Well, I think we can expect that rates will continue to go up from here gradually, but they're on an upward trajectory unless the Fed really messes up and raises rates too quickly and has to reverse course. And so that has the biggest implication on those who are sitting on credit card debt because credit card debt is linked to short-term rates. For those on credit card - who are holding on to credit card debt should look to pay that down because it will only get more difficult to service. Those who have mortgages are usually more lucky because those tend to be linked to long-term rates. And as short-term rates are going up, long-term rates will go up as well but much more gradually. I think that those who are looking to take out car loans or student loans - new car loans or student loans - they'll also have - be affected by higher short-term rates. CORNISH: And, Megan, just a short time left - most big banks increased their prime rates - the rates they charge customers, but they didn't raise what people can earn on their accounts. What gives? GREENE: That's right. I mean, that tends to be the case that banks aren't passing through the benefits to their customers. For what it's worth, we see negative rates in Europe. And actually, banks there aren't passing on that charge to customers, either, so I think it works both ways. CORNISH: That's Megan Greene, chief economist at John Hancock. Megan, thanks, as always. GREENE: Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Megan Greene isn't convinced the Fed did the right thing today. She's chief economist at John Hancock asset management. Welcome back to the program, Megan.

And so the Fed would like to normalize monetary police to get out of the spotlight and under the influence of politicians or the media or society at large. CORNISH: You talked about the upper echelons. What about everyone else, right? I mean, how should people be thinking about their finances as this interest rate increase kind of signals the end of easy money? GREENE: Well, I think we can expect that rates will continue to go up from here gradually, but they're on an upward trajectory unless the Fed really messes up and raises rates too quickly and has to reverse course. And so that has the biggest implication on those who are sitting on credit card debt because credit card debt is linked to short-term rates. For those on credit card - who are holding on to credit card debt should look to pay that down because it will only get more difficult to service. Those who have mortgages are usually more lucky because those tend to be linked to long-term rates. And as short-term rates are going up, long-term rates will go up as well but much more gradually. I think that those who are looking to take out car loans or student loans - new car loans or student loans - they'll also have - be affected by higher short-term rates. CORNISH: And, Megan, just a short time left - most big banks increased their prime rates - the rates they charge customers, but they didn't raise what people can earn on their accounts. What gives? GREENE: That's right. I mean, that tends to be the case that banks aren't passing through the benefits to their customers. For what it's worth, we see negative rates in Europe. And actually, banks there aren't passing on that charge to customers, either, so I think it works both ways. CORNISH: That's Megan Greene, chief economist at John Hancock. Megan, thanks, as always.

After months of speculation and anticipation, the Fed's official interest rate has gone up. This is the first time that's happened since the rate was driven to near zero in December of 2008. The increase was small, and as NPR's John Ydstie reports, Fed officials made clear the process of raising rates to more normal levels will be gradual. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: After two days of meeting with her Fed colleagues, Janet Yellen sat down before reporters and said the decision had been made. The federal funds rate, the bank's benchmark rate would rise a quarter of a percentage point, and she noted the historic nature of the act. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JANET YELLEN: This action marks the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression. YDSTIE: And Yellen was asked how regular Americans should view the Fed's action. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: The first thing that Americans should realize is that the Fed's decision today reflects our confidence in the U. S. economy. YDSTIE: Yellen said the Fed's sees an economy that's on a path of sustainable improvement. She said the Fed believes it's nearing its goal of maximum employment, though she acknowledged there are still Americans who want jobs or full-time work and can't find it. But Yellen acknowledged the Fed is still far below its inflation goal. The Fed believes inflation of around 2 percent a year is best for economic growth, but its preferred inflation measure is running far below that. Yellen has blamed the huge drop in oil prices over the past year and a half for suppressing inflation, but a reporter pointed out that Yellen has said for months, that dip is transitory, but oil prices keep falling. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: I have been surprised by the further downward movement in oil prices, but we do not need to see oil prices rebound to higher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out. So all they need to do is stabilize. YDSTIE: But with inflation so low, Yellen was asked, why the need to raise interest rates right now? The normal reason for a rate hike is to head off accelerating inflation. Yellen pointed out that rate hikes only work with a lag. They spread through the economy and have an effect on growth and inflation only slowly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)YELLEN: What I - we would like to avoid is a situation where we have waited so long that we're forced to tighten policy abruptly which risks of boarding what I would like to see as a very long-running and sustainable expansion. YDSTIE: In other words, she doesn't want to risk pushing the economy into recession. But Yellen also explained that raising rates gives the Fed a little more room to maneuver. If the economy now turns down unexpectedly, they can actually cut rates again. That room to maneuver will grow as the Fed gradually raises rates to more normal levels over the next few years. Financial markets responded positively to the rate hike. The major U. S. stock index has rose one and a quarter to 1-and-a-half percent. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

For workers in the energy sector, this December is turning out to be especially stressful due to industry layoffs. From Houston Public Media, Andrew Schneider reports. ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: It's a weekday afternoon at the Fry's Electronics store in Stafford, Texas, just south of Houston. To judge from the light floor traffic, you'd never guess Christmas was just around the corner. Robin Ewan is a good indicator why. For more than 30 years, he worked as a test engineer for a global oilfield service company. Not anymore. ROBIN EWAN: This the first time around Christmas that I've been laid off, and it has a bit of an effect because now, you know, you're wondering about who to buy presents for and what presents. You're going to make it more meaningful ones than expensive ones. SCHNEIDER: Ewan started working for Schlumberger in Aberdeen, Scotland. He spent the last 20 years based in Texas. In February, he had to rush home to the U. K. to say goodbye to his dying mother. The day after he returned, he was told he no longer had a job. EWAN: Basically, I've been doing odd jobs for people here and there. Electronic-related stuff, fixing computers, fixing cars, whatever. But as for looking for a real job, I basically haven't tried because I know there's so many people my situation in this town that are in the same boat. SCHNEIDER: Crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest level in nearly seven years. Oil and gas companies have laid off close to 56,000 Texans since December of last year, according to the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers. That doesn't include cuts in industries dependent on the oil sector, like trade and professional services. Debbie Milks is chief operating officer for Brookwoods Group. The staffing firm specializes in finding jobs for marketing and communications workers. DEBBIE MILKS: Some of them, this is their second or third time that they've been let go from different oil and gas firms service companies, and what we're seeing now is some are actually saying oh my gosh. You know, maybe it is just time to let it go and get out of here. SCHNEIDER: Milks says her clients are now begging to be placed somewhere more stable than the energy sector, even if it means taking a pay cut of tens of thousands of dollars. MILKS: They know the pink slips are coming and they hear the talk. There's a lot of stress associated with that, and then the holidays, it doesn't make it any better. SCHNEIDER: Companies can take steps to manage that stress. If they make sure employees feel they're being treated fairly during layoffs, those who remain are more likely to concentrate on doing their jobs. But Brent Smith, who teaches industrial psychology at Rice University, says that's not happening. BRENT SMITH: The magnitude of the downsizing is quite large. So it's very difficult to accomplish that in a manner that probably is going to be perceived as fair and equitable by the surviving employees. SCHNEIDER: The Greater Houston Partnership is predicting Metro Houston will lose another 9,000 energy jobs in 2016. That will include more cuts at Schlumberger, which is finalizing its multibillion-dollar merger with Cameron International.

The two countries have reopened their embassies. They've agreed to re-establish commercial air travel. But in finance, progress has been slow. There's just one U. S. financial institution doing business with Cuba. NPR's Greg Allen reports on this small bank in Pompano Beach, Fla. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Until this year, few people had heard of Stonegate Bank outside of the 21 communities in Florida where branches are located. Stonegate was founded just 10 years ago as a commercial bank focusing on businesses. Stonegate CEO Dave Seleski says in March, one of his customers was having lunch with the head of the State Department's Cuba desk, Mark Wells. The discussion turned to the difficulty the State Department was having finding a bank willing to handle accounts for Cuban diplomats in Washington. Larger, better established banks, Seleski says, weren't interested. DAVE SELESKI: My friend-slash-customer said, well, why not Stonegate Bank? And so they literally handed the phone to Mark Wells, and he said would you be interested? And I said, yeah, we'll take a look at it. And then we didn't feel there was a whole lot of risk with it, and we felt like this was going to move this process forward. I mean, I've always been against the embargo. And so it was - we took that first step. ALLEN: A few months later, Stonegate took another step. It became the first and still only U. S. bank to set up a correspondent relationship with Cuba's central bank. That means, theoretically, that Stonegate customers will be able to transfer funds directly between the U. S. and Cuba. But despite the Obama administration's new policies, the U. S. trade embargo ordered by Congress remains in place. And Seleski says that means Stonegate has to go through an institution in a third country to transfer funds. SELESKI: You still have to use an intermediary bank. So the correspondent relationship is not really truly operating, functioning, as an actual correspondent relationship. And that's probably one of biggest challenges to U. S. businesses doing business in Cuba is just getting the money back and forth. ALLEN: With claims and sanctions still outstanding, companies that do business with Cuba have to proceed very carefully. Funds and goods that belong to Cuba can and have been seized while on U. S. soil. Jodi Bond of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce says, this is one reason the large banks have been reluctant - it's risky. JODI BOND: You can lose a lot of money quickly. ALLEN: In October, the Justice Department fined a French bank more than $700 million for financial transactions that violated U. S. sanctions, including unauthorized business with Cuba. This month, the two countries began negotiations to resolve 50-year-old claims by U. S. citizens and companies that had properties seized by Cuba. Bond says those claims will have to be settled in order to resolve the uncertainty that keeps the big banks away. Stonegate Bank recently became the first U. S. institution to issue debit cards that can be used in Cuba. Credit cards should soon follow. But a major challenge Stonegate and other banks face in Cuba are the currencies. There are two official currencies - the Cuban peso, used by the people who live there and the convertible peso, the one visitors use. Fernando Capablanca, head of the Florida International Bankers Association, says there's also an underground economy with its own dollar exchange rate. FERNANDO CAPABLANCA: I like to say they are three currencies in Cuba. What kind of exchange rate are they using when someone uses a debit card or credit card in Cuba? Not to mention the fact that there are so very few merchants in Cuba that accept any kind of credit card. ALLEN: Cuba says it plans eventually to unify its currencies. Stonegate CEO Seleski says that will do a lot to open the island's economy. And, he says, there are some big players now eager to do business. SELESKI: You've got Amway. You've got Caterpillar. You've got American Airlines. You've got Morgan Stanley. You know, you've got big companies that are really getting behind. Look, it's time to normalize relations and drop the embargo. ALLEN: That would require an act of Congress, which, big business or not, proceeds on its own timetable. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

Stonegate CEO Seleski says that will do a lot to open the island's economy. And, he says, there are some big players now eager to do business. SELESKI: You've got Amway. You've got Caterpillar. You've got American Airlines. You've got Morgan Stanley. You know, you've got big companies that are really getting behind. Look, it's time to normalize relations and drop the embargo. ALLEN: That would require an act of Congress, which, big business or not, proceeds on its own timetable.

Or more accurately, I was thinking about his parents, who were - how should I put this? - special. Don't get me wrong, they were the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. They were warm and welcoming. They traveled. They were interesting, but they had a very interesting perspective on most social issues. They really felt that just about any problem you could think of was easily solved with a comfortable pair of walking shoes and an in-ground swimming pool. You think I'm kidding? My friend was in the health field, so when he came up that African-American kids disproportionately suffer drowning deaths because swimming pools in the U. S. had been segregated for so long, generations of black people never learned how to swim, they said why didn't their parents just put a pool in their backyards? When my friend brought up some of the issues related to the fact that millions of Americans at that time did not have health insurance, they said, why, what you need is a comfort pair of walking shoes and a healthy diet, and you should be all set. Of course, I found them hilarious because they weren't my parents. And, yes, I give them a pass because they weren't born in this country and didn't really know the history. And, sure, there was a shred of truth in their idea that if the society doesn't provide you what you need, your only choice is to try to find a way to do for yourself somehow. But there was a reason they drove their own kids crazy, my friend included. His parents were hard-working people, but both had been born into affluence. As adults, they did even better and, except for the war years, had never known any deprivation, did not know anyone who had and were generally oblivious to the realities of people not like them - not mean, not hateful, just oblivious. Can I just tell you - I was thinking about them after I read the recent Pew Research Center study about the decline of the American middle class. The study found that after more than four decades with the middle class as the nation's economic majority, more people are now either upper-income or lower-income. The study goes on to say that is, in one sense, a sign of progress because more people moved into the upper tier than were added to the lower. But it also meant that upper-income families now control a much larger share of the nation's wealth than ever before. Fully 49 percent of the nation's aggregate income went to upper-income households in 2014, up from 29 percent in 1970. Over the same period, the share that went to middle-income households slid from 62 percent to 43 percent. And the wealth held by the middle class has dropped dramatically in the new century, thanks in part to the housing crisis and the Great Recession. Why does this matter? It matters because anybody who has ever climbed a ladder knows it's a lot harder to jump the rings than it is to make them one at a time. You can do it, but it's harder. It also matters because the people in the middle often have a foot in both worlds - the world of plenty and the world of make do and do without. That's why I thought of my friend's parents. They literally could not understand why if you couldn't go to a public pool, you didn't just build your own 'cause they didn't understand not having a backyard. Perhaps that's why the politics of the moment sound so extreme - because the middle is hollowing and the ends of the spectrum cannot hear each other except when they shout.

It's been a few days now, so let's see what did happen and where to from here. We're joined, as we often are, by David Wessel. He's director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution and a contributing correspondent to The Wall Street Journal. Good morning. DAVID WESSEL: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: So, David, the Fed raised the short-term interest rate. It had been holding near zero for years, just one quarter percentage point above zero. This was long-awaited, but then, finally they did it. Remind us of the immediate reaction. WESSEL: Well, this move was so well-advertised by the Fed that much of the market reaction actually occurred in advance. It pretty much went as smoothly as the Fed could have hoped. Short-term interest rates, the ones over which the Fed has the most control, are moving up, so people are getting a little bit more money on their money market funds and paying little bit more money on their credit card loans. Interestingly, the stock market had a great day on Wednesday after the Fed announcement and then it was terrible on Thursday and Friday. I think that's a reminder that the Fed isn't the only actor in this game. Bull market seems spooked by how fast oil prices are falling, and, now today, the markets will have to wrestle with the Spanish election, which suggests a lack of political support for the austerity program they've been running there. MONTAGNE: And we heard a lot about - speaking of Spain - about the ripple effects this long-discussed move might have overseas, particularly in emerging markets. They weren't too happy, were they? WESSEL: No. I mean, there's a lot of bad stuff going on in the economies of emerging markets, the big ones like South Africa, Brazil, Russia, China - much unrelated to the Fed. But basically, when the Fed raises U. S. rates, the value of the dollar goes up, and the value of other currencies tend to go down. The dollar's up about 10 percent on foreign exchange markets over the past year. Now, some countries like this, makes their exports more attractive. Europe is one. But others worry, with very good reason, that this could help create inflation in their countries that they don't want, or it could really shake up their banks or their companies that have borrowed in U. S. dollars. So you see a divergence of reactions. In Mexico and Chile, they were very quick to raise their interest rates to match with the Fed did to cushion their currencies, but Taiwan cut rates and there's speculation that Canada, which is suffering from low oil prices, is about to do it - the same thing. So basically, nothing bad has happened, but it's still early days in this Fed tightening cycle. MONTAGNE: And David, Janet Yellen is getting near the end of her second year as Fed chair. What have we learned about her? WESSEL: Well, I think one thing we learned is she learned from her mistakes. In September when they didn't raise interest rates, she left everybody confused as to what the Fed's rationale was, so this time when they raised rates, she was very clear. She said we are raising interest rates because we anticipate inflation will rise over the coming months, and we want it moved gradually. If we wait, we'll have to have abrupt interest rate increases. Two, she really, really prepares for these things. I mean, you could tell when the press asked her questions on Wednesday that she had written out the answers. And third, even more that predecessor Ben Bernanke, she's working very, very hard to build consensus. There were no dissents on the Fed policy committee even though we know there are some big disagreements about policy. MONTAGNE: And just getting back to the practical aspect of interest rates, where do we see them going? Up some more? WESSEL: Definitely up. Look, their new projections show that they expect to raise rates another full percentage point over the next year, provided the economy performs as they forecast, but they've left themselves a lot of wiggle room. And Jenny Yellen's press conference made clear that they will hold off on raising rates more if the economy stumbles or inflation fails to rise to their targets. But - sure looks we're going to get another increase or two and maybe four before this time next year. MONTAGNE: David, thanks very much. WESSEL: You're welcome.

Blake Farmer of member station WPLN reports from Nashville, which has one of the worst shortages in the country. BLAKE FARMER, BYLINE: Listen to the radio chatter between bus drivers, and it's clear why being short-staffed is stressful. Everyone is trying to cover for someone. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I just finished unloading at Mountain View for my route. You want me to go pick up Lakewalk? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Ten-four 'cause I've just got three more stops left. FARMER: In Nashville, there are 550 slots for drivers. Nearly a quarter are unfilled, and that's when no one's sick. SUZANNE ADAMS: (Laughter) Thank you. Have a good day. Thank you, bye-bye. FARMER: Veteran driver Suzanne Adams drops off a load at Overton High School, which, earlier this year, had 10 routes with no dedicated drivers. Every day was a mad scramble. ADAMS: So you should be doing three routes in the morning and three in the afternoon. I was doing six-and-a-half in the morning and six in the afternoon - a lot. FARMER: That doesn't even seem possible. ADAMS: Yeah, it's a lot. You're just running back to back. FARMER: Kids were left waiting for an hour or more and showing up to class after the bell rang. Sophomore Souleen Ramazan, who rides on Adams' bus, says that she understands. SOULEEN RAMAZAN: It is a hard job. You have to wake up extra early in the morning. I mean, it's hard for them, too. FARMER: It's not the odd scheduled. For many, the hard part is the unpaid time off - spring break, fall break, Christmas break, not to mention summer. That requires disciplined budgeting even for someone like Suzanne Adams who's topped out on the hourly pay scale. ADAMS: When the kids are out of school, you know, we don't get paid. That's really hard. And so I do understand, you know, people going somewhere else. TRACY GARTON: I've said, like, every year that I'm going to quit and look for something else. FARMER: Tracy Garton has driven for a decade now, and the kids are not what keep him coming back. In the last week, he's caught one smoking marijuana. Another threw a bottle out the window and busted a windshield. GARTON: You got to sit with the police and go through all that, you know? It's just stressful, you know? I mean, it's not like a regular job where you just, you know, you go into work, go home. FARMER: And there are many other regular jobs out there right now. They can make more driving charter buses or 18-wheelers. And the trucking industry has an even more pressing driver shortage, so sometimes, there's a signing bonus. Like other desperate districts, Nashville's public schools have raised pay and offered bonuses. Administrators admit they fail to keep pace during the economic recovery, especially since bus drivers were some of the budget cuts during the recession. TOM MCMAHON: An ancillary service like transportation can be one of the first places that school districts will look to make cuts. FARMER: Tom McMahon is the editor of a trade publication called School Bus Fleet. He surveys districts every year on staffing levels. There's a direct correlation. When unemployment is high, districts have very little trouble finding drivers. But low unemployment spawns an exodus.

The school system is paying new drivers like Roman Steele while they study to get their commercial licenses. ROMAN STEELE: Pretty much, I thought it'd be a cool opportunity.

That's because crude oil has plummeted to its lowest price in eight years. We'll hear what people are doing with the money they're saving in just a moment. But first, NPR's Jeff Brady explains why more savings are in store. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: At a Philadelphia gas station, Sharlene Brown is filling up her minivan. When prices are down, Brown says she drives more. SHARLENE BROWN: It changes where I go, who I pick up 'cause a lot of times I pick up and do errands for the church. BRADY: Lower prices make it easier for her to volunteer more and help out with grandkids. So what's her wish for the price of gas in 2016? BROWN: Hopefully it'll go down some more. BRADY: Her wish most likely will be granted, says Tom Kloza with the Oil Price Information Service. TOM KLOZA: I wouldn't be surprised to see a year where we might see gasoline prices nationally average between, let's say, 1. 85 and 2. 75, which will be very similar to this year. BRADY: Kloza says the variation will depend on refinery operations near you. Gas prices tend to go up when refineries have to shut down for maintenance or switch to gasoline blends that produce less smog in the summer. In addition to lower prices prompting people to drive more, Kloza says there's evidence consumers are starting to buy bigger cars again that use more gas. KLOZA: I would hope that people might make good choices and buy vehicles recognizing that somewhere in the life of that vehicle, we're going to see high gas prices again. BRADY: Beyond what it costs the individual driver, there are environmental concerns. The U. S. is among countries that pledged in Paris to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. But if people start driving more because of lower prices, that will work against the goal. And there are some in the oil industry predicting that low oil prices will prompt more demand by the second half of 2016. AMY MYERS JAFFE: I'm a little skeptical of that outcome. BRADY: Amy Myers Jaffe is executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. She says a big factor will be what choices members of the huge millennial generation make. She suspects they'll continue to embrace things like carpooling and more efficient hybrid and electric cars. MYERS JAFFE: And car sharing, you know, where you don't own a car but you just rent your car when you're going skiing for the weekend. All of those trends really are going to have a substantial impact, negative on the oil industry and positive on climate solutions. BRADY: Myers Jaffe says in a world with plenty of oil reserves, that could eventually lead to an interesting outcome - low gas prices forever because demand is low. But that's looking way out into the future, and we're talking about just 2016 here. One thing that Myers Jaffe suggest watching closely next year is the big oil states like Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Low prices can make those governments less stable. She says if one of them goes through a significant upheaval, or even falls, that could reduce world oil production dramatically and drive up prices again. Jeff Brady, NPR News, Philadelphia.

BRADY: Her wish most likely will be granted, says Tom Kloza with the Oil Price Information Service. TOM KLOZA: I wouldn't be surprised to see a year where we might see gasoline prices nationally average between, let's say, 1. 85 and 2. 75, which will be very similar to this year. BRADY: Kloza says the variation will depend on refinery operations near you. Gas prices tend to go up when refineries have to shut down for maintenance or switch to gasoline blends that produce less smog in the summer. In addition to lower prices prompting people to drive more, Kloza says there's evidence consumers are starting to buy bigger cars again that use more gas. KLOZA: I would hope that people might make good choices and buy vehicles recognizing that somewhere in the life of that vehicle, we're going to see high gas prices again. BRADY: Beyond what it costs the individual driver, there are environmental concerns. The U. S. is among countries that pledged in Paris to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. But if people start driving more because of lower prices, that will work against the goal. And there are some in the oil industry predicting that low oil prices will prompt more demand by the second half of 2016. AMY MYERS JAFFE: I'm a little skeptical of that outcome. BRADY: Amy Myers Jaffe is executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. She says a big factor will be what choices members of the huge millennial generation make. She suspects they'll continue to embrace things like carpooling and more efficient hybrid and electric cars. MYERS JAFFE: And car sharing, you know, where you don't own a car but you just rent your car when you're going skiing for the weekend. All of those trends really are going to have a substantial impact, negative on the oil industry and positive on climate solutions. BRADY: Myers Jaffe says in a world with plenty of oil reserves, that could eventually lead to an interesting outcome - low gas prices forever because demand is low. But that's looking way out into the future, and we're talking about just 2016 here. One thing that Myers Jaffe suggest watching closely next year is the big oil states like Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Low prices can make those governments less stable. She says if one of them goes through a significant upheaval, or even falls, that could reduce world oil production dramatically and drive up prices again.

Well, that is not going to happen. One reason - landlords are reluctant to rent to homeless individuals, even when the rent is guaranteed. NPR's Pam Fessler has more. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE: At the end of October, almost 6,200 homeless veterans had government vouchers to cover their rent, but they'd yet to find landlords willing to accept them. One of those vets is Joseph Coles of Washington, D. C. , where you're lucky to get a one-bedroom apartment for under $1,400 a month. JOSEPH COLES: At one time, you could get an apartment anywhere for nothing. Now, with so many people moving in the area, we're at the mercy of the landlord and apartment complexes. They can choose who they want and who they don't want. FESSLER: So Coles, who's been searching since September, has yet to find a place. He's in temporary transitional housing now, but doesn't know what he'll do if an apartment doesn't come through soon. COLES: I shudder to think about that. FESSLER: The problem is popping up everywhere, but especially in tight rental markets like Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In Miami, government vouchers cover $900 a month in rent for a one-bedroom apartment, but those are hard to find. RON BOOK: We're out there begging, pleading and doing whatever is necessary to persuade landlords to participate in our program. FESSLER: Ron Book is chairman of the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, which is trying to place 200 homeless vets by year's end. Earlier this month, the trust held a telethon with a local TV station which produced dozens of promising leads. Books says they're fighting not only a tight rental market, but stereotypes. BOOK: Quite candidly, look, there's always going to be some hesitancy by landlords to house somebody that they perceive having lived on the streets. FESSLER: So part of his appeal has been to make sure that landlords know that their new tenants have been screened and, once housed, they'll get the support they need, like mental health services and job counseling. Still, Eric Grumdahl, who is coordinating Minnesota's effort to end veterans homelessness, knows that landlords are being asked to take a leap of faith. His state recently decided to offer property owners a $1,000 signing bonus for each vet that they house by the end of January. ERIC GRUMDAHL: To recognize that we are asking landlords to affirmatively choose to house veterans who, frankly, in this market, would be very easy to screen out. There are often, you know, veterans that are facing challenges that may have to do with the fact that they have a poor rental history or very little rental history. FESSLER: And it's not just veterans. Washington, D. C. , is trying to house 700 homeless families and another 1,000 individuals. The city just hired a team of navigators to work with landlords, but it can be a tough sell. Navigator LaShun Lawson recently tried to finalize a deal with property manager Oswald Durant. He wants to help and has six units available, but needs some reassurance. OSWALD DURANT: Well, that would be important if we could be assured that the inspectors are coming, you know, because everyone wants it quick. You want it quickly. We want it quickly. We definitely don't want to go over 30 days. FESSLER: The city has agreed to advance Durant $1,000 for each apartment that he holds open while the city works to place a family. That's attractive. But like other landlords, Durant's also worried about getting mired in bureaucracy or having to do with a problem tenant on his own. DURANT: So who is it that comes to visit the client in their house every four month, the caseworker? LASHUN LAWSON: The caseworker. DURANT: So can't we know about that, or you'll just tell us the results? LAWSON: If I know - if I know that it's happening. . . FESSLER: Eventually, Durant agrees, but on a trial basis. DURANT: We'll see how it works out. That's the point. We'll work with  it together. LAWSON: We can reassess it. Let's reassess it. That makes sense. FESSLER: Pam Fessler, NPR News, Washington.

In a few minutes, we'll hear about several major companies that had troubles. One of the small businesses that had to make tough choices is CakeLove, a bakery in Washington, D. C. 's, historic U Street neighborhood. When it opened back in 2002, The Washington Post said it created a, quote, \"baked good buzz years before people thought of standing in line for a cupcake,\" unquote. CakeLove's success turned owner Warren Brown into a celebrity foodie. By 2005, he was hosting his own show, \"Sugar Rush,\" on the Food Network. At one point, his empire included seven stores and a cafe. But the last brick-and-mortar store is set to close at the end of the week. He's turning CakeLove into an online business. Recently, Brown shared his story with us, starting with what inspired him to open up shop. WARREN BROWN: Baking was a New Year's resolution for me. And I was tickled that people were interested in buying the cakes, but my curiosity about baking and my passion for sharing it with people has never, you know, gone away. MARTIN: Do you have any advice for people who are thinking about ending something or starting something? I mean, how do you know when it's time? BROWN: I don't really think you're ever going to know it's time to have done something until you've already done it. When you're in the midst of it, it's very, very difficult to know, you know - is this actually it? My biggest advice to other people is, like, you're always going to be a little scared, nervous, frightened about going from the known to the unknown. There's not that much you can do to ameliorate that. Just kind of have to get used to it and recognize that if it's a solid plan, you should feel good about it. MARTIN: Warren Brown is the owner of CakeLove, which is closing its last brick-and-mortar store in Washington, D. C. , at the end of this month. And he's focusing now on his other businesses, including Cake in a Jar. Warren Brown, thanks so much for speaking with us, and happy new year to you. BROWN: Thank you, Michel. Happy new year. MARTIN: So let's turn now to some big companies that went through major changes in 2015 - retailers, including RadioShack, Office Depot, Staples, American Apparel and even Target have all announced closing stores over the past year. We called The Wall Street Journal's Suzanne Kapner in New York to find out why. SUZANNE KAPNER: Well, we've see the shift in online shopping becoming even more pronounced. We've noticed that very much during this holiday season on Black Friday, the crowds at stores were noticeably thinner - same on Super Saturday. And you just see more and more people ordering gifts online, particularly during the holiday season. They don't want to fight the crowds at the mall. And retailers have just made it too easy for them, with free shipping, free returns, last-minute delivery guaranteed. So, you know, we really reached that tipping point where online is really starting to pressure the stores at the mall. And you're seeing, you know, those stores at the mall really offering these big, big discounts to try to get shoppers in their doors. MARTIN: So brick-and-mortar stores are really the ones where this is showing up. That experience is really changing. KAPNER: The experience is changing at the brick-and-mortar store. And retailers are trying to - they're trying to figure out ways to get you to make a visit, whether it is, like, an experience, like having a special event at the store. There are Origin stores that now have, like, these sinks, and they let you wash your hands and try the product. They have coffee bars. Uniqlo has Starbucks in its stores. They have couches, TVs. The retailers are trying to sort of make the shopping at their stores into an experience to give you a reason to visit. MARTIN: Now, we just heard from a person who - you know, you'd think a bakery would be the ultimate kind of brick-and-mortar thing. You know, it's generally kind of an impulse purchase. You walk by. You smell it. It smells good. You're hungry. You go get your cupcake. And this person - the person we just spoke to, Warren Brown - said that he's actually moving to all online - that you can still order his goods, but he's going to deliver them online, or maybe they'll be available in stores. So haven't stores really contributed to this themselves by shifting a lot of their operations online? KAPNER: Well, they've had no choice but to shift online. The way they've contributed to the problem is by over-expanding. Over the past decade or two, you've just seen these chains open dozens and dozens of stores. We have too many stores in this country. By one count, there's something like 23 square feet of gross leasable space for every person in the country. We don't need this many stores, and now as people buy more online, we certainly don't need as many stores. But that doesn't mean stores are going away. In fact, you see online retailers - retailers that started as e-commerce-only players like Bonobos and Warby Parker - they've actually started opening stores because what people are saying is the sweet spot is you want some combination of online and a physical experience. MARTIN: So you're leading me to the last question I have. What does this mean for workers, and what does this mean for consumers? KAPNER: Well, for workers, you know, the type of job openings have shifted. You've seen during this holiday season there was a big shortage in warehouse workers. Retailers are scrambling to find employees to fill their warehouse to stock, you know, to handle their logistics and their backend e-commerce operations. And they've been cutting back on the number of employees on the store floor, so the type of labor is shifting. And, you know, for consumers - consumers are really the big winners here because they have all the options now. I talked to a woman yesterday who - on Sunday, she ordered Christmas gifts without leaving her bed, so you can't really beat that as a shopper. MARTIN: That's The Wall Street Journal's Suzanne Kapner with us from New York. Suzanne, thanks so much for speaking with us, and happy New Year to you. KAPNER: Thanks. Happy New Year to you, too.

S. Just before the holidays, Congress approved tax credits for clean energy. They haven't gotten a lot of attention, but solar and wind power companies liken them to Christmas presents that will catapult the industry forward. NPR's Chris Arnold reports. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Thanks to fracking, solar and wind power now have to compete with super-cheap natural gas. So more than ever, if you run a wind farm, you want to squeeze every bit of power and efficiency you can out of it. And you can see that at SunEdison's national control center in Boston. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We're done with the breaker installation. MEGAN RODGERS: Ten tack one at Milford two. You guys have completed the breaker installation and you're ready to return to service? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Ten-one. RODGERS: Ten tack one. . . ARNOLD: Megan Rodgers is working at a bank of big wall-sized digital displays. She's tracking the solar arrays and wind farms that the company builds and operates in Texas, Hawaii, Maine and 20 other states. Right now she's talking to some technicians who are out in a field of wind turbines in Utah. Some of the turbines there have gone dark on her display and they might've stopped spinning. RODGERS: Actually, there's a whole string of them that are out right now - 10-one, 10-two, 10-four, five, six and eight. And I was thinking it was due to the work that you guys started at 10-five earlier. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh, you know what? Yes, I did. . . ARNOLD: Wind turbines have gotten taller in recent years, with 200-foot-long blades that help kick out more electricity. Altogether, the solar and wind farms Rodgers is watching here power the equivalent of about 1 million homes. Still, so far, wind power only makes up about 5 percent of total U. S. power generation. Solar is even less. But SunEdison general manager Matt Kearns says these tax credits that Congress just passed will help to change that. MATT KEARNS: This is a really big deal. I mean, I think it is probably the biggest thing that's happened to the renewable energy business certainly since I've been involved - over the last decade or so. ARNOLD: Kearns says that's because tax credits are still crucial to get financing for big solar and wind installations. And in recent years, he says Congress created too much uncertainty around the tax credits. But now Congress has extended them for five full years. That's created a lot more certainty. And already, Kearns says he's in conversations with industrial clients about new projects as a result. KEARNS: They are eager to move. So this is a really important moment for the industry. ARNOLD: It's an important moment in another way too. Jonathan Mir heads up power and utility research for Lazard. It's a big financial firm. JONATHAN MIR: What we've seen that's so interesting is the very remarkable decline in the costs of utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar. ARNOLD: Mir says if you go back to 2009, the cost of wind power in North America on an unsubsidized basis was $135 a unit. A hundred and thirty-five dollars. Compare that to today. . . MIR: The best in class, unsubsidized wind can be built at prices of $30. So you've seen costs come down by 60 percent, 70 percent on utility-scale wind. ARNOLD: Solar has fallen in price even more sharply. So Mir says, in just the past two years, we've come to a new place. He says some power utilities now want to add more, say, wind power because that power can be cheaper than even upgrading an old coal plant to meet pollution standards. MIR: That's an amazing, amazing inflection point. ARNOLD: Ron Binz is an energy consultant. He says the energy department finds that wind power alone could double in the U. S. in the next five years. And it reached 20 percent of total U. S. power generation in 15 years. RON BINZ: Renewables have reached a point where there's no going backwards. They are becoming cheaper and cheaper and will eventually become the cheapest resource that we can use. ARNOLD: But Binz says there's still the problem with renewables that they're intermittent - the sun goes down and the wind stops blowing - so one big area of research going forward is energy storage to help get around that problem.

I mean, I think it is probably the biggest thing that's happened to the renewable energy business certainly since I've been involved - over the last decade or so. ARNOLD: Kearns says that's because tax credits are still crucial to get financing for big solar and wind installations. And in recent years, he says Congress created too much uncertainty around the tax credits. But now Congress has extended them for five full years. That's created a lot more certainty. And already, Kearns says he's in conversations with industrial clients about new projects as a result. KEARNS: They are eager to move. So this is a really important moment for the industry. ARNOLD: It's an important moment in another way too. Jonathan Mir heads up power and utility research for Lazard. It's a big financial firm. JONATHAN MIR: What we've seen that's so interesting is the very remarkable decline in the costs of utility-scale wind and utility-scale solar. ARNOLD: Mir says if you go back to 2009, the cost of wind power in North America on an unsubsidized basis was $135 a unit. A hundred and thirty-five dollars. Compare that to today. . . MIR: The best in class, unsubsidized wind can be built at prices of $30. So you've seen costs come down by 60 percent, 70 percent on utility-scale wind. ARNOLD: Solar has fallen in price even more sharply. So Mir says, in just the past two years, we've come to a new place. He says some power utilities now want to add more, say, wind power because that power can be cheaper than even upgrading an old coal plant to meet pollution standards. MIR: That's an amazing, amazing inflection point. ARNOLD: Ron Binz is an energy consultant. He says the energy department finds that wind power alone could double in the U. S. in the next five years. And it reached 20 percent of total U. S. power generation in 15 years. RON BINZ: Renewables have reached a point where there's no going backwards. They are becoming cheaper and cheaper and will eventually become the cheapest resource that we can use. ARNOLD: But Binz says there's still the problem with renewables that they're intermittent - the sun goes down and the wind stops blowing - so one big area of research going forward is energy storage to help get around that problem.
