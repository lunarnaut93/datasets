Representative MARTIN MEEHAN (Democrat, Massachusetts): Congress has a constitutional responsibility to provide oversight, and that oversight hasn't been provided. ELLIOTT: That's Massachusetts Democrat Martin Meehan, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. He is expected to be named chairman, next week, of a subcommittee on oversight and investigations, a panel that Republicans disbanded in 1995. In a conversation in his office yesterday, Congressman Meehan said there were costs to disbanding that subcommittee. Rep. MEEHAN: I don't think you have to look any further than the Iraq war to see the lack of oversight, the mistakes that were made, that the administration was never held accountable for. Not only the fact that the intelligence was wrong, the fact that they never came back to Congress for a war vote to begin with, which under the Constitution, they should have. And then a series of mistakes: letting the Iraqi Security Forces go without vetting them. ELLIOTT: You're talking about the members of Saddam's army that were immediately suspended. Rep. MEEHAN: Members of - That's exactly right. If you vetted those members of the army you probably could have ended up with about 70 percent of them. And rather than send them out and encourage them to be part of an insurgency, you could have put them on the payroll and had them secure Baghdad right away. Secretary Rumsfeld and the Pentagon totally ignored General Shinseki, and they did things their own way - without oversight, without anyone holding them accountable. And we have paid the price for that over the last three years or so. ELLIOTT: Do you plan to seek testimony from Donald Rumsfeld? Rep. MEEHAN: We haven't made decisions about who we're going to call. I've been talking to many retired generals that I know to get suggestions on it. I think part of our focus has to be on Iraqi security. General David Petraeus, who I have enormous respect for - I think he's highly skilled, highly competent and took over a mess - he would be someone who could shed light on what has gone wrong, what we need to do better, how we engage other countries in the region to be part of this effort. And then in terms of who we ask to come before the committee, that's something that I think depends upon what information we're able to gather. ELLIOTT: Now a lot of these things that you're talking about, are things that were happening as the war started. What can Congress do about them now? These things have happened. Rep. MEEHAN: Well, the first thing I would like to have a hearing about is making sure that the men and women who are in Iraq now, have the latest technology available to them in order to try to protect American lives. If you look at what's happening in Iraq, there has been a spike in the number of American soldiers and Marines who are being killed by snipers. We have technology that is designed to identify where a sniper shot is coming from. We don't have enough of this technology in Iraq. I also want to find out why in the world Americans are still up front when they need to be in the background. As long as we're perceived as an occupying force in Iraq, we are not going to be able to defeat an insurgency. ELLIOTT: There were reports this week from the Wall Street Journal, that as part of President Bush's strategy that he'll be announcing next week, he's going to suggest that billions more go to Iraq, go to Iraqi reconstruction, go to actually the political parties in Iraq. Is that something that your committee would have oversight over? Rep. MEEHAN: It's certainly something that we need to oversight and investigation of what has happened to the billions of dollars of reconstruction monies that we have already sent. We have invested billions and billions of dollars into an infrastructure for police and security in Iraq, and they literally have nothing to show for it. We need to find out why. ELLIOTT: Now, the oversight and investigation sub-committee that you will chair is under the House Armed Services Committee. But there are reports of other similar investigations and oversight panels under other committees that are being formed right now. Isn't there a risk here, that the Democrats might be on some sort of a partisan witch-hunt? Rep. MEEHAN: Well, I think it depends upon how these oversight hearings and investigations are conducted. I'm going to work as hard as I can, I know speaker Pelosi is going to work as hard as she can to make sure investigations are conducted thoughtfully, conducted in a bipartisan way. And in the end, it's about the constitutional responsibility that our forefathers gave the Congress of the United States. When the Congress of the United States appropriates hundreds of billions of dollars, there is a responsibility to make sure that that money is being spent wisely and effectively. And that simply hasn't happened. And we need to do everything we can to makes sure that we don't waste another hundred to 200 billions of dollars doing the same thing. ELLIOTT: Congressman Martin Meehan, thank you for speaking with us. Rep. MEEHAN: Thank you, glad to join you.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. The president's plan to send more troops to Iraq got a chilly reception on Capitol Hill today. In an interview you'll hear in just a moment, this is how Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid summed up the president's plan for Iraq. Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada; Senate Majority Leader): I don't think it's the biggest foreign policy blunder since Vietnam. I think it's the biggest foreign policy blunder in the history of our country. NORRIS: That kind of tough rhetoric ricocheted all around Congress today. At separate committee hearings in the House and the Senate, top administration officials faced skeptical lawmakers as they try to explain the president's plan. Senator CHUCK HAGEL (Republican, Nebraska): Madam secretary, your intelligence and mine is a lot different. And I know my time is up here. But to sit there and say that, madam secretary, that's just not true. Secretary CONDOLEEZZA RICE (State Department): Well, Senator\u2026 Sen. HAGEL: That is not true. Sec. RICE: Well, Senator, if you allow me to finish, I think you - there is a point that I'd like to make about the Iraqis killing Iraqis and what that really is. Sen. HAGEL: Well\u2026 Sec. RICE: There are\u2026 Sen. HAGEL: What that really is? It's pretty obvious what really is. Sec. RICE: There are death squads - there are death squads, Senator. NORRIS: That was Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sparring with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel. Earlier today, I spoke with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in his office. The Nevada Democrat said he intends to ask senators to make their positions clear to, in his words, belly up to the bar with an up or down vote on the president's plan. Sen. REID: The war in Iraq has been going on for almost four years. The president gave a speech. Everyone is hoping that he would say I'm going to change course in Iraq, and he didn't do that. What we're going to vote on here in the Senate in the near future is a resolution saying, do you support the president's escalation in Iraq? Simple. NORRIS: You know, this is a symbolic vote. Why is it important to do that? Sen. REID: We have shown during these first few weeks in January that there is something happening in Washington. The speaker of the House and I have sent letters to the president saying, Mr. President, don't escalate the war. He has ignored our advice. He's ignored the advice of the American people. He's ignored the advice of generals on the ground. We're disagreeing with the president. We're doing it very vocally and openly. And I'm very impressed with my Republican colleagues. They're also speaking out against this. NORRIS: Senator, if the president is ignoring your advice, if he, as you say, stands alone - if his plan is the wrong way forward - what is right way forward? What is the Democratic alternative at this point? Sen. REID: I, along with 99 other senators, were elected to represent states. We have certain constitutional obligations and duties as a result of being United States senators. We are not the secretary of state. We're not the secretary of defense. We're not the commander in chief. President Bush is the commander in chief. He is responsible for conducting this war. Now, do we have a plan? We voted here in the Senate floor - the Democrats put forward a plan that we should, first of all, redeploy troops. Does that mean pull them all out? Of course it doesn't. But it means that we would focus on training Iraqis. We would focus on counterterrorism. We would focus on force protection. We believe that there should be a regional conference held. And we also believe that the force structure of our military is in very, very dismal shape. There is not a single, non-deployed Army unit that is battle ready. It's going to cost $75 billion to bring this military up to what it was before the war started. So that's not a bad direction that we believe the president should go in, and we've told him that. NORRIS: Now you talk about the withdrawal of troops, and you all say the Democrats are now asking tough questions. They're holding hearings. In a hearing this morning, Senator Biden posed a question to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that I'd like to put to you. How do you withdraw troops from Iraq and leave anything close to stability in that country? Sen. REID: My response would be that we're talking about redeployment, which will, of course, include some soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen leaving the battlefield. But it also means that we're going to take a look at new duties for our troops there, and I think that's the key to that. I think that's the key. I think there would be much more stability if we got the vast majority of the Americans off the streets and had them training Iraqis. There's no\u2026 NORRIS: Are there indications, though, that the Iraqis can stabilize the country on their own? Sen. REID: There's no military solution to this. There's only a political solution. The Iraqis are going to have to acknowledge that they're the ones who are going to have to solve this problem. And I think that once we get out of the battlefield - I mean, I'm listening to your network, public radio, a couple of days ago. They went around an interviewed a bunch of Iraqis. What do you think about bringing more Americans? They all said, no, don't bring any more. NORRIS: You know, at this point, with the president's proposal appeared to be on somewhat of a collision course on Capitol Hill, I wonder if this is good for the country, a country that is so conflicted about the war, to have another war going on here in Washington between Democrats on the Hill and the president in the White House. Sen. REID: Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican, said today in those hearings you referred to that he believed that the situation in Iraq is the biggest foreign policy blunder since Vietnam. Now, here's someone who speaks with authority. He's a decorated combat veteran. But I have to go one step further than Senator Hagel. I don't think it's the biggest foreign policy blunder since Vietnam. I think it's the biggest foreign policy blunder in the history of our country. NORRIS: But trying to find some sort of way to move forward together - I've heard a lot of talk about bipartisanship, and yet it seems that the Democrats are girded for battle. Sen. REID: The Democrats are what? NORRIS: Is there - girded for battle - is there a way to - will you have some sort of voice in helping the president move forward in Iraq? He's talked about a bipartisan study group \u2014 a study group is probably the wrong word - he's talked about a bipartisan group to look at what's going on in Iraq. He talked about Joe Lieberman perhaps leading that group. Would Democrats\u2026 Sen. REID: But you know that that is so - I want to pick a word that isn't too argumentative, but that - we have bipartisan organizations looking at this right now. The hearing that you're talking about, chaired by Biden and Lugar, good friends, they work together, one a Democrat and one a Republican. That's a bipartisan committee. It's called the Foreign Relations Committee. Standing by is the Armed Services Committee, another bipartisan committee, chaired by Levin from Michigan, and the ranking member on that is McCain from Arizona. That's about as bipartisan as you can get. What is the president trying to do? What is this all about? I mean, we had a bipartisan group called the Iraq Study Group. They told the president what they thought should be done. He's ignored every provision they've made. Every one. So why does he need something that is - now he's asking for the legislative branch of government, a separate branch of government from his executive branch of government, to give him some other direction. He has all the directions that he needs. He just refuses to listen to what people are telling him. NORRIS: What about the power of the purse? How far are you willing to go there? Are you willing to withhold money? And if not, what power do you really have? Sen. REID: First of all, there will be no money withheld from the commander in chief and the troops in the field. We are going to make sure that the fighting men and women of this country in Iraq and Afghanistan have everything they need. But we're going to make sure that Halliburton doesn't get everything they need. There are 100,000 contractors in Iraq. I think that's quite a significant number of people. A 100,000 contractors in Iraq? I don't think they deserve to be treated as Halliburton's been treated - instant millionaires. NORRIS: If I can turn to other matters, your colleagues in the other chamber, in the House, are passing legislation like gangbusters. A mountain of legislation is soon going to be heading your way. Do the two chambers speak with one voice on all these issues, from stem cell research to the minimum wage? Sen. REID: Speaker Pelosi and I have had a wonderful relationship since I became Democratic leader more than two years ago now. I have great affection for Nancy Pelosi. She's my friend. But these two bodies are different. The founding fathers set up the House, they set up the Senate. They set up the House to be extremely efficient. They set up the Senate to be extremely inefficient. Two different bodies, that's how they work, but for almost 220 years, these two institutions served our country well, and they may be able to get a lot more done in a short period of time, but we'll just spend more time and accomplish the same that they do. NORRIS: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, it's been good to visit with you here in your office. Thank you so much. Sen. REID: You bet.

We're joined now by two young people who have recently enlisted in the Marines. Christopher and Bethany Wade are brother and sister. They live in Lewis, Delaware.  Welcome to the program. Ms. BETHANY WADE (High School Student): Hi. How are you? Pfc. CHRISTOPHER WADE (U. S. Marines): Hello.  ELLIOTT: Hello. Chris, I'm going to start with you. You're 19 and the older brother, so let's find out a little bit more about your decision. You enlisted back in August of 2005. Why? Pfc. WADE: Well, because I've had family fighting for this country since the Civil War. And I knew it was my job to do good to this country and serve in the military.  ELLIOTT: Bethany, you're 17 and will be graduating from high school in June. Did Chris encourage you to join the Marines to follow in his footsteps? Ms. WADE: He always supported me, but ultimately the decision was mine. And I knew that I always wanted to be next to him fighting for our country. So that, you know, that did influence me, but the decision was mine. So. . . ELLIOTT: You know, you both have enlisted in a part of the military at a time when the country is at war. Is that a factor when you're making your decision? Does it motivate you to either join because you know your country needs you? Or do you stop and think, wait a minute, this is a, you know, a country at war, maybe I don't want to enlist? Ms. WADE: It motivated me to join.  ELLIOTT: How so? Ms. WADE: I feel that, you know, our country needs us. You know, it's an honor to me to be able to stand there and say I'm defending my country. I think it's a privilege.  ELLIOTT: Chris?  Pfc. WADE: I'm also (unintelligible) it motivated me, because what they did on September 11, 2001 was completely - I don't know how to say it, but it was horrible. And we have to strike back against those people that did that to us. And that's one of the main reasons why I joined, was to get back at the people that did this horrible act to this great country of mine. ELLIOTT: Do you think that going to Iraq, you will be fighting the people who are responsible for 9/11? Pfc. WADE: Yes. And if it wasn't 9/11 - if we hadn't have gone over there when we did, there would - I believe there would be more attacks on America and other democratic governments in this world. Because there are some people in America that are afraid to go to sleep at night because there's bad people out there that are willing to do anything and everything for their cause. ELLIOTT: You know, as the Pentagon is talking about increasing the size of the U. S. military force, some have said that military recruiting might be a problem, that the military has already had to extend tours of duty, is stretching National Guard and Reserves, stretching the active military, having to change some of the requirements to make it a little bit easier to recruit people. But it doesn't sound to me like it was very difficult to recruit the two of you. Pfc. WADE: Well, it was. . . Ms. WADE: I think they got lucky. ELLIOTT: You think they got lucky? Ms. WADE: No. It's not often you'll find a brother and sister that are willing to just sign right away. And both of us knew that it our duty to our country. So. ELLIOTT: What about the toll of the war? Have you had soldiers from that area, you know, come back wounded or have. . . Ms. WADE: We actually had a soldier die.  Pfc. WADE: We've had - two Marines from Seaford, Delaware were killed. And just this past week a airman - a female airman in the Air Force - she was supposed to be coming home in two days - was blown up by an IED.  ELLIOTT: Doesn't that scare you just a little bit? I'm sure it must scare your mother. Ms. WADE: It's scary, but you take that chance. You know, when you sign up for the military, you realize that's a chance you're talking. Pfc. WADE: It really doesn't scare me because I'm a very religious person, so I know ultimately where I'm going in the end. You know, if I've got to go, I'm going to go for this country. And that's to me is the highest honor that anybody can ever have, is to die for their country in battle. So no, it doesn't scare me at all.  ELLIOTT: Christopher Wade is a private first class in the Marines. Thank you for speaking with us. Pfc. WADE: Thank you. It was (unintelligible)   ELLIOTT: And his sister, Bethany Wade, is a recruit who will be joining the Marines this summer after she graduates from high school. Thank you, Bethany. Ms. WADE: Thank you. Have a great day.   DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:   Expanding the ranks of a volunteer military depends not just on money, but on the willingness of Americans to join up. We're joined now by two young people who have recently enlisted in the Marines. Christopher and Bethany Wade are brother and sister. They live in Lewis, Delaware.   Welcome to the program.  Ms. BETHANY WADE (High School Student): Hi. How are you?  Pfc. CHRISTOPHER WADE (U. S. Marines): Hello.   ELLIOTT: Hello. Chris, I'm going to start with you. You're 19 and the older brother, so let's find out a little bit more about your decision. You enlisted back in August of 2005. Why?  Pfc. WADE: Well, because I've had family fighting for this country since the Civil War. And I knew it was my job to do good to this country and serve in the military.   ELLIOTT: Bethany, you're 17 and will be graduating from high school in June. Did Chris encourage you to join the Marines to follow in his footsteps?  Ms. WADE: He always supported me, but ultimately the decision was mine. And I knew that I always wanted to be next to him fighting for our country.

I'm Debbie Elliott. The nation is in the midst of a heated debate over the size of the U. S. force in Iraq, and it's going to be debating the size of the country's standing military. This week, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed adding 92,000 troops to the Army and Marine Corps. This would b the biggest buildup of U. S. ground forces since the Cold War.  One man who will be paying close attention to the proposal is Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. He's a former Army Ranger who now serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I spoke with him yesterday.  Senator Reed, is it the right strategy to add 92,000 troops to the Army and Marine Corps over the next several years? You know, Secretary Gates seems to have a very different approach from Secretary Rumsfeld. When he first came into office, the goal seemed to be to streamline U. S. forces and rely less on manpower.  Senator JACK REED (Democrat, Rhode Island): Well, over the last several years, because of the actions of the administration, the Army and the Marine Corps have been stretched to close to the breaking point. And in fact, we really don't have a ready strategic reserve. The non-deployed Army units in the United States and outside of Iraq are not reporting ready because of equipment and training shortcomings. And so as a result, we do need additional personnel. And that is something that is required regardless of the present situation in Iraq or Afghanistan. We have to restore, I think, a larger land-based military force. ELLIOTT: Is this kind of boots on the ground military solution what's going to be necessary to fight what some in the administration are now calling the long war? That term seems to be replacing war on terror? Sen. REED: Well, first, the war on terror is most precisely not a conventional war. It is a Special Operations war relying on intelligence, Special Operations troops, and in many cases police forces, when you talk about more developed countries. It's an international area issue of concern across the globe. The real stress on the military is the current commitment in Iraq and Afghanistan to fight vestiges of sort of the war on terror, but more particularly insurgencies. And that also requires a reconstitution of the Reserve in case there's another problem around the world that require conventional forces. ELLIOTT: Will 92,000 more troops be enough? You say that our Army and other military branches are stretched to the breaking point. Sen. REED: Additional increment of troops is necessary. The right size in the troops depends upon the strategy and depends upon the contingencies. Right now, we just don't have a reserve in case there's a conflict elsewhere, or we need to use military forces as a deterrent or as a compliment to diplomatic activity. So we do have to increase the force. And I think this is a significant increase, which is appropriate.  I would caution, though, that today, unlike several years ago, when I first advocated increasing the size of the Army, it's a lot harder to recruit soldiers because of the obvious issues in Iraq, because of the concerns expressed by families. And so it's going to be a very difficult challenge, even if these troops are authorized to fully complete the ranks.  ELLIOTT: Well, military recruiters have already been having problems. Sen. REED: Indeed, they have had significant problems. The year before, the Army did not meet its recruiting goals. This year, the Army did meet its goals, but part of that was reducing standards, increasing bonuses, and really sort of beginning to drive down the level of expectations in recruits that was maintained and built up over the last several decades.  ELLIOTT: How realistic is it to think that recruiters can come up with 92,000 more troops? Sen. REED: I think it's going to be a huge challenge. And obviously the tools they have available to them are increased financial incentives. And also there'll be a temptation, I think, to lower standards, and that's not good. I think that so far they've adjusted standards, but they have not, I think, done so to the overall detriment of the force. But the pressure to recruit will be a pressure also to reduce the standards, the high standards that we've established for our volunteer forces. ELLIOTT: If you're talking more troops and paying them more money, you're talking about higher costs for U. S. taxpayers, who are already spending billions to cover the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Will the Democratic-controlled Congress be willing to fund this type of military expansion? Sen. REED: Well, I think there is a - obviously the support is there, I think, for increasing military forces. But I think the first point is the president has to level with American people, not only about the need for more troops but it's going to cost a lot. And it's also, I think, not only in terms of the active forces, but I think you also heard where they'll need more Reserve and National Guard forces, and that will cost additional money also.  Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Thank you. Sen. REED: Thank you.

Senator, thank you so much for being with us. Welcome to the program. PATRICK LEAHY: Happy to be with you. BLOCK: Now you said during the hearing that you thought this change signifies a good start, but it sounds like you're not fully convinced that it qualifies as meaningful oversight. What would actually constitute meaningful oversight? LEAHY: Well, I wanted to know exactly what they've done. We've asked the court if they'd show us the order. They say they have no objection. The administration is equivocating a little a bit. Let's see the order. After I see the order, I'll take a look at the briefing. If it is a real change, if they decide to follow the law, if they decided that before they can spy on Americans they have to have a court order, then that's good. Obviously, the first question one might ask is why now? Why didn't they do that right to begin with? But at least it will be a start, because as I've always maintained, no one's above the law - not the president, not senators, no one else. BLOCK: You note the timing, we're going to get to the question of timing in just a minute. But first there's also the issue of disclosure. Today, the presiding FISA judge said that she would release documents related to oversight of the spy program, particularly surveillance of targets linked to al-Qaida. But Attorney General Gonzales said he'd like to keep some of those details private. I understand that you plan to go ahead and ask for these documents anyhow? LEAHY: Well, I asked the FISA judge if she would. And said yes - the attorney general referred to them publicly yesterday. We will see the documents. I have every intention of seeing them. Then we'll go from there and see whether they are following the law. BLOCK: But, you know, the administration seems to be saying that there's some danger here that operational details might be revealed? LEAHY: Well, I think the danger is whether the president, or any president, is not following the law. Operational details don't have to be revealed. This could be shown in a classified forum. Certainly the operational details are known now by hundreds and hundreds of people. Making sure that they're following the law does not disclose anything. BLOCK: On the question of the opening of the mail as we heard in Ari Shapiro's piece, you really pressed the attorney general on this. The attorney general said that to his knowledge the government is not opening individual mail without that individual's knowledge. But you really pressed him on that. Were you satisfied? Do you still suspect that this might be happening and that the attorney general just doesn't know about it? LEAHY: I worried that before the attorney general would not respond to that. Then, of course, we found the president signing statements saying well, he has the right to open the mail, which he does not - certainly not without a court order. The attorney general said under oath that he's not aware that this is being done. Fine. I think now we should ask both the CIA and the Department of Defense, because a very troubling thing that's come out of the hearing today and earlier information is that contrary to all the history of this country, the CIA and the Department of Defense are going into people's bank accounts and things here in the United States. I'm not talking about going into foreign nationals' bank accounts. But going into Americans' bank accounts. The attorney general said under oath he's not aware of mail being opened without a warrant. I just wanted to make sure there's no other departments that are doing it. BLOCK: As to that question of timing, the Department of Justice has said that they've been trying since before the program was made public to actually get this program under the FISA court. Alberto Gonzales denied again today that the November election, the sea change in power in Washington, had anything to do with the sudden change. Do you actually buy that? LEAHY: No, of course, I don't. The fact of the matter is they could have changed FISA. We've actually made a number of changes to FISA to accommodate things they want to do. And that's been done the bipartisan way. Nobody from the administration came to us and said we need a change in the law. All of a sudden, they no longer have a rubberstamp Congress as they had had before. And they say whoops, I think we better start following the law, somebody might start asking us questions about it, as I did today under oath. BLOCK: We've been speaking to Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Senator, thanks so much for being with us. LEAHY: Great to be with you.

That virus was called Brain, and compared to today's viruses, it was virtually cute, only rewriting a couple of lines of text. The virus is famous for being the first of its kind, but wouldn't make a headline if it popped up today. Nicholas Thompson is with \"Wired\" magazine. He joins us now from New York City. Thanks so much for being with us. Mr. NICHOLAS THOMPSON (\"Wired\" Magazine): Thanks for having me on. SIMON: And what did this Brain virus do? Mr. THOMPSON: It infected what's called the boot sector of a floppy disk. And what this would do is it would make the computer basically unable to boot up. The boot sector is a very dark part of the computer system. It's used in the initial processing as your computer goes from off until on. And this virus affected that. SIMON: How significant was this virus at the time? Did people think that it exposed the soft underbelly of new technology or something? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, people always think that when a virus comes out, and there's always a lot of concern. And I think back then people thought, oh, well this is something that's going to start to grow and we're going to see a lot more of. And that's what did happen. SIMON: It's been a while, I think, since we read a story about a virus shutting down a lot of computers. Is that just a lot less common than it used to be? Mr. THOMPSON: It's a little bit less common, but there's actually something going on right now in Europe. There's a virus that's spread, and I think the e-mail header is something like storm surge kills 200. And people who open the e-mail, open the attachment, it affects their computer. But the heyday of viruses was probably five or six years ago. I suspect that a lot of the people who used to create viruses, who used to play and try to, you know, tweak other people's computers, they're now doing other stuff like BitTorrent, or they're downloading movies online. There are a whole bunch of other ways that you can do illegal, dangerous, dark things online without creating viruses. SIMON: Now BitTorrent is a legal program, isn't it? But you can use it for nefarious purposes? Mr. THOMPSON: Oh, BitTorrent is legal, and in fact there's a legal company built up around it. But you can certainly use it for nefarious purposes, and there are lots of people using it for nefarious purposes. My main point is that I think they're just - there are so many things you can do online now and there are so many illegal things and so many shady things that you don't really need to go around infecting your neighbor's computer and trying to spread a virus. It's also - I don't know. . . SIMON: When you can rob a casino in Las Vegas or whatever they do in the movie, right? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, that's actually a very good point. And a lot of people who do write viruses, or the kind of people who would be attracted to writing viruses, what they do now is they write viruses that give spamming companies access to other people's computers. And so what they're doing is they're not trying to destroy your computer to show that they can; what they're trying to do is they're trying to open a little backdoor so they can sneak in, and when you're not looking they can send out thousands of spam messages; they can use your PC's power and they can your bandwidth. SIMON: So the spamming companies will find some promising young talents and say help us figure out a way to latch onto several million e-mails? Mr. THOMPSON: Something like that or maybe the promising young talents will find the spamming companies through their friends. I mean the Internet has made - there are all sorts of bulletin boards and there are ICQ communities and their chat groups where people get together. I remember writing a story about people who stole credit cards and passed that information around. And you would go on, you'd start looking; you didn't have to look very hard, and suddenly you'd find thousands of people talking about this. And I think what they're doing now is they're talking about the neatest ways to open backdoors in computers. But it's no longer cool to be the guy who wrote the program that spread through a million computers and clogged up everybody's e-mail. That's kind of pass\u00e9 now. SIMON: What about cell phone viruses? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, cell phone viruses, we haven't had a terrible one yet. We've had a few that have spread around. But it's a lot harder to spread viruses between cell phones than it is to spread viruses between computers. SIMON: Why is that? Mr. THOMPSON: Well, with computers, everybody uses Microsoft Windows, or certainly in the heyday of viruses five years ago everybody used Windows; they used Internet Explorer and they used Outlook Express. So I could write a little virus program that would spread from my Outlook Express to my hundred closest friends' Outlook Express. Cell phones, people use different operating systems. Second of all, we mostly use cell phones for talking. We're not downloading software. We're not pulling things off the crazy Internet. At least we're not doing that yet. But we're starting to do that a lot. And that's why people are beginning to get concerned about cell phone viruses. SIMON: Nicholas Thompson, senior editor at \"Wired\" magazine, thanks so much for being with us. Mr. THOMPSON: Thanks a lot for having me here.  SCOTT SIMON, host:   It's been 21 years since the first virus infected a computer hard drive. That virus was called Brain, and compared to today's viruses, it was virtually cute, only rewriting a couple of lines of text. The virus is famous for being the first of its kind, but wouldn't make a headline if it popped up today.  Nicholas Thompson is with \"Wired\" magazine. He joins us now from New York City. Thanks so much for being with us.  Mr. NICHOLAS THOMPSON (\"Wired\" Magazine): Thanks for having me on.  SIMON: And what did this Brain virus do?  Mr. THOMPSON: It infected what's called the boot sector of a floppy disk. And what this would do is it would make the computer basically unable to boot up. The boot sector is a very dark part of the computer system. It's used in the initial processing as your computer goes from off until on. And this virus affected that.  SIMON: How significant was this virus at the time? Did people think that it exposed the soft underbelly of new technology or something?  Mr. THOMPSON: Well, people always think that when a virus comes out, and there's always a lot of concern. And I think back then people thought, oh, well this is something that's going to start to grow and we're going to see a lot more of. And that's what did happen.  SIMON: It's been a while, I think, since we read a story about a virus shutting down a lot of computers. Is that just a lot less common than it used to be?

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, Host: And I'm Melissa Block. Toward the end of his State of the Union address last night, President Bush proposed creating what he called a volunteer civilian reserve corps. GEORGE W: Such a corps would function much like our military reserve, would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve out missions abroad, where America needs them. BLOCK: We were curious to find out more, so we've called Carlos Pascual. He was a main promoter of this idea when he worked at the State Department as the coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization. He's now at the Brookings Institution. And Mr. Pascual, tell us, please, when this idea first started kicking around? CARLOS PASCUAL: It really came up in 2004, as many people who were reflecting on their experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, but then also in other conflict environments such as Kosovo and Bosnia, and understood the reality that you need to be able to draw on people like police, police trainers, rule of law experts, who can be put on the field and quickly to deal with conflict environments, to help be able to stabilize the situation and begin to introduce new civilian capabilities in a place where the capacities of government have been challenged or in fact in some cases eclipsed. BLOCK. You mentioned policing - what other sorts of things might this civilian corps be trained to do? PASCUAL: That was the core function that was initially conceived of. But there are other aspects that can be put into place, such as civil administrators who are engineers, who are economists. These are individuals who would be able to lend their expertise and skills to governments that are being formed, to transitional societies that are seeking to put in place a more effective form of governance. NORRIS: Well, who likes this idea? And who doesn't? PASCUAL: Well, the strongest supporter of it certainly has come from the U. S. military, because they have recognized that in transitional environments, that while the military has been trained in how to engage, as they call it, into the kinetic aspects of warfare, they themselves are not experts in how rebuild governments, how to build the rule of law. In the Congress, Senators Lugar and Biden and Hagel have been extraordinarily strong supporters, and they put forward legislative proposals dating back to 2004 and 2005 that advocated this concept. BLOCK: So you mentioned who's for it in terms of the people and also in the Pentagon. Who's against it? PASCUAL: The principal skepticism is really coming from the appropriators in the Congress, some who have been concerned that this would become a mechanism for preemption planning that would give an administration a greater capacity to inject force into other situations throughout the world. I don't think that's a realistic criticism because relative to the size of our military, which is the core requirement for any kind of use of force, this is simply a tiny, tiny additional resource that would be added, and I don't think that's a fair criticism. NORRIS: This idea for the civilian reserve has now been in the stadium, you know, the president has talked about it. Do you figure that's just a throw away line in his address or do you think this is actually something that could come to pass? PASCUAL: It really will depend on whether the secretary of State, the National Security Advisor and the president say to senior members of the appropriations committee in the Senate and House leadership that they want this and that the administration sees this as an absolute top priority for the long term in being able to have the capacity to engage on the war on terror. NORRIS: Well, what do you think? PASCUAL: If past experience is a trend, it will be unlikely that the administration gives it strong support. It was in the budget last year for $25 million. It was not strongly pushed. I hope that there has been sufficient of heart, reflected by the fact that this was in the State of the Union address, that the administration will push it this year. NORRIS: Mr. Pascual, it's good to talk to you. Thanks. PASCUAL: Thank you very much. NORRIS: Carlos Pascual is director of foreign policy studies at The Brookings Institution.

I'm Jacki Lyden. Today is International Holocaust Memorial Day. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution yesterday condemning the denial of the Holocaust. The only abstention was Iran, where last month the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held a conference that cast doubt on the Nazi genocide. The conference provoked worldwide outcry. Now more than 100 Iranian exiles have signed a petition adding their voices to the chorus of condemnation. We spoke with two of the signatories: Afshin Molavi, a journalist and author, and Azar Nafisi, author of \"Reading Lolita in Tehran. \" I asked Azar Nafisi what went through her mind when she first learned about the Holocaust conference. Ms. AZAR NAFISI (Author, \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\"): Well, I thought not again and not in my name. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. NAFISI: Because the fact of the matter was that certain events, historical events like the Holocaust or apartheid, do not just implicate the people who are the criminals or the victims in the matter. It implicates the whole humanity. And it should transcend any form of political manipulation. And President Ahmadinejad was manipulating this tragic event in the worst sense of the word, and in the name of Iranian people whose voices could not be heard by the rest of the world - whose protests could not be heard. Mr. AFSHIN MOLAVI (Journalist, Author): I think I felt that very much the same way. And you - when I saw it on TV, I thought about it on two levels. You know, first you think, you know, what a devastation of this history, of this, you know, of this horrible tragedy of the Jews. But then on a more personal level, as an Iranian - an Iranian-American - I think to myself, what sort of image is this portraying of Iran to the international community? And, you know, one of things that I often notice is in America is that often Middle Eastern countries are often defined in many ways by their governments. For us Iranians, we've had 27 years of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with this scowling image accelerated by Ahmadinejad and Iran being defined by the politics of Holocaust denial and uranium enrichment. And those of us who know Iran and understand it, know it's a far more dynamic and sophisticated place than, in many ways, both the media image portrays and the Islamic Republic of Iran portrays it as. LYDEN: Let's turn a corner in this because it isn't only about the Holocaust conference and Iranian attitudes regarding the West and the greater world, but American attitudes; specifically, the administration's position. Iran is rising to the top of the Bush administration's agenda. And in his State of the Union Address this week, the president mentioned Iran five times, stressing the Iranian role in Iraq and support for Shiite extremists. Let's listen. President GEORGE W. BUSH: Radical Shia elements, some of whom received support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day. LYDEN: What response did you have to Iran being named in this way, Afshin? Mr. MOLAVI: Well, you know, the response I have in general is that I get the sense that the administration oftentimes - to my frustration - doesn't see some of the nuance that is taking place in Iran today. One of the interesting things that is going on today is a pushback against Mahmoud Ahmadinejad within the Iranian political elite. There have been petitions signed by Iranian economists directed at Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, saying he's bankrupting and ruining the economy. LYDEN: Inside Iran. Mr. MOLAVI: Inside Iran, yeah. There has been an open letter by 150 members of the Iranian parliament directed at the president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, saying his policies are undermining the Iranian economy and national security. And there is this significant pushback of Ahmadinejad. And there is, I think, an opportunity there. LYDEN: Is that pushback, Azar Nafisi, coming because of President Ahmadinejad's insistence on developing nuclear capability? Ms. NAFISI: Well, you know, a lot of times with the Iranian politicians, we act as if we just didn't know anything about them and we just discovered something. I mean, Iran has always had nuclear ambitions for the past 30 years. Almost 30 years, it has been supporting terrorist groups and it has been using belligerent rhetoric. But I think one thing that the policymakers in the U. S. forgot about Mr. Ahmadinejad is that his violent rhetoric and his repressive measures at home are not a sign of strength, but of weakness. And we should take this opportunity to encourage the dissent and the divisions and the more democratic-minded voices to speak up, rather than reduce Iran into a country that is nuclear. LYDEN: Writers Azar Nafisi and Afshin Molavi, thank you both very much for being with us today. Ms. NAFISI: Thank you, Jacki. Mr. MOLAVI: Thank you, Jacki.

I'm sure that that's not the intent behind the resolutions, but I think it may be the effect. Senator JOHN WARNER (Republican, Virginia): I personally, speaking for myself, have great concern about the American G.

In fact, the way ahead will be neither quick nor easy, and there undoubtedly will be tough days. We face a determined, adaptable, barbaric enemy. He will try to wait us out. In fact, any such endeavor is a test of wills and there are no guarantees. (Soundbite of chanting) CROWD: Impeach Bush!  Impeach Bush!  Impeach Bush! Ms. JANE FONDA (Actress): That's right.

Senator JOHN WARNER (Republican, Virginia): I personally, speaking for myself, have great concern about the American G. I. being thrust into that situation, the origins of which sometimes go back over a thousand years.  Lieutenant General DAVID H. PETRAEUS (U. S. Army): None of this will be rapid. In fact, the way ahead will be neither quick nor easy, and there undoubtedly will be tough days. We face a determined, adaptable, barbaric enemy. He will try to wait us out. In fact, any such endeavor is a test of wills and there are no guarantees.  (Soundbite of chanting)  CROWD: Impeach Bush!  Impeach Bush!  Impeach Bush!  Ms. JANE FONDA (Actress): That's right.  CROWD: Impeach Bush! Impeach Bush! Impeach Bush!  Ms. FONDA: I haven't spoken at an anti-war rally in 34 years, but silence is no longer an option.

I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. JUAN WILLIAMS: If Iran escalates its military action on Iraq, how will the U. S. respond? INSKEEP: That is one of the questions that NPR Juan Williams put to President Bush in an interview at the White House this morning, to which the president replied\u2026 President GEORGE W. BUSH: If Iran escalates its military action in Iraq to the detriment of our troops and/or innocent Iraqi people, we will respond - firmly. INSKEEP: President Bush at the White House this morning. Juan Williams is back from there and joins us in the studio. And Juan, do you get the sense the president is looking for a fight with Iraq? WILLIAMS: No, Steve. I had the sense that he is defensive about this. He said that he would take action, that he thinks the American people would want him to take, that the American military want him to take to protect America interests and even to protect Iraqi interests. And then he kind of shied away from the idea that that necessarily meant an escalation in terms of American conflict with Iran, despite of course you know the presence now of two fighter carrier units in the Gulf and the president giving authority last week for American military to arrest and even target Iranian forces. INSKEEP: Let's talk about that. If it ever did get to stronger military action against Iran, it would be dealing with allegations, allegations that Iran is interfering in Iraq, allegations about Iran's nuclear program. Does the president have the credibility to make the case on those allegations? WILLIAMS: He feels he has the credibility. The question is whether or not he has the support of the American people. And as you know, that has been a problem, and so it's a matter of intelligence. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about another issue here. Last week Vice President Cheney was asked about U. S. progress in Iraq now, in Iraq, and he said the U. S. was having enormous success. Does the president agree? WILLIAMS: Well, this is very interesting. Here's what the president said, Steve. President BUSH: I think the vice president is a person reflecting a half-glass-full mentality, and that is he has been able to look at - as have I, and I hope other Americans have - the fact that that the tyrant was removed, 12 million people voted, there's an Iraqi constitution in place. It is a model for - and unique for the Middle East. INSKEEP: So he's saying he doesn't necessarily disagree with what the vice president says, but does the president belief right now - and this is important because he's the guy determining policy - does the president believe that they're succeeding in Iraq right now? WILLIAMS: He said to me that what he understands the vice president's position to be was, you know what, we have some issues but that the vice president was supportive of putting the additional 21,000 in and understood that changes had to be made, and so he said - you know, as you heard, that vice president is a glass-half-full kind of guy, but he understood that their problems that exist. INSKEEP: Does the president think that they're doing well? WILLIAMS: Well, the president does. I mean, given with the fighting over the weekend in Najaf, he said he thought that the Iraqi military was stepping up to the plate. INSKEEP: Let's listen. President BUSH: This fight is an indication of what is taking place, and that is the Iraqis are beginning to take the lead. INSKEEP: The Iraqis are beginning to take the lead, is what he says. Is he saying the glass is half full at the moment? WILLIAMS: At the moment he seems cheered by the developments over the weekend rather than fearing that it might devolve into further kind of internecine warfare, this time between various factions in the Shiite sect. INSKEEP: I pursue this to some degree, Juan, because it's been an issue of some debate. Some people have been mystified that the president did not call for more dramatic changes in recent weeks in Iraq. They are increasing troops but not by an amount that we haven't seen before. They are making some other changes, but it's not a huge change. And you do get the impression that the White House believes that in spite of public skepticism, they do believe that they are doing well in every department except keeping the American people behind them perhaps. WILLIAMS: Well, I think the key here is that the president and his staff feel, Steve, that they are getting more cooperation out of Prime Minister Maliki at the moment, and for example, the effort made over the weekend in Najaf would suggest that the Iraqi military is willing to become more intensely involved and more capably involved in terms of battling people who are, as the president calls them, insurgents. INSKEEP: Hard to gauge this from one conversation, but I know you followed the White House closely. Does the president still seem comfortable with his job and where he's taking the country? WILLIAMS: Yeah. In fact, what's interesting, we were in the Roosevelt Room and he was very comfortable. I had the sense ever more so than watching him during State of the Union or in the address that he gave on Iraq, that he feels he's battling something that has long-term consequences. At the end I asked him about Harry Truman and his legacy, and he said he thought that he'll leave that to the historians but he's doing something that he thinks would be judged as right in generations to come. INSKEEP: Juan, thanks very much. That's NPR's Juan Williams. And you can hear more of that interview later today on NPR's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. The president will respond to a question from an American soldier in Iraq. He'll talk about Hurricane Katrina and global climate change.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

But it has yet to offer any solid proof. The State Department had promised to make its case against Iran public. But it's holding off amid questions about just how solid U. S. intelligence is. NPR's Michele Keleman reports. MICHELE KELEMAN: State Department spokesman John McCormick has said that the U. S. has, as he put it, a mountain of evidence, convincing clear proof that Iranians are supplying Shiite groups in Iraq with weapons technology to kill U. S. troops. Last week he was promising to make it public. Mr. JOHN McCORMICK (State Department): There was apparently a challenge put out there, I believe, from the Iranian ambassador that night and said well, show us the evidence, show us the evidence that Iranian agents are engaged in these activities. And Ambassador Khalilzad, rightly so, said we will present that evidence. We will make it public. KELEMAN: McCormick said the U. S. just wants to do it in a way that won't hurt its sources of information. But today in Baghdad, U. S. officials called off a briefing on the issue and officials in Washington are now downplaying expectations. Georgetown professor Paul Pillar, a former national intelligence officer, is not surprised. Professor PAUL PILLAR (Georgetown University): Certainly in the wake of the unhappy experiences with the evidence relating to Iraq and its supposed weapons of mass destruction, it should not be surprising that extra caution is being observed in not putting out anything publicly that might later be revealed to have been based on bad sources. Beyond that, we can only speculate as to how much actually is there. KELEMAN: Iranian-made ordinance found in Iraq, he says, is not proof of Iranian government involvement, and he says it would be very difficult to trace attacks on U. S. forces back to Iran, a thought echoed by retired Colonel Sam Gardiner. Colonel SAM GARDINER (Retired, U. S. Air Force): Most Americans are killed in Sunni areas, not in the Shiite areas, so that you ask the question to what extent is the arming of the militia having a direct impact on Americans. It certainly is to some degree. But then to a larger degree, we don't know. KELEMAN: Gardiner says the Bush administration is trying to hype Iran's role in Iraq to elicit outrage among Americans. Take for instance a recent case in Karbala, when attackers posing as Americans killed five U. S. soldiers. The Pentagon is investigating and U. S. officials leaked word of possible Iranian involvement. Many experts saw this as part of the U. S. drumbeat against Iran. And Paul Pillar is among those with serious questions about the reports. Professor PILLAR: Most of what we've heard pertaining to Iran is simply speculation to the effect that an operation this sophisticated must have had a government behind it. I would caution against jumping toward that kind of conclusion. KELEMAN: There is one thing that everyone seems to agree on, that Iran's influence in Iraq is widespread. Colonel Larry Wilkerson was former Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff. Colonel LARRY WILKERSON (U. S. Army): Iran is more or less sitting in the catbird seat with regard to Iraq and its position in Iraq. So it doesn't need to do anything untoward. That's not to say it isn't doing it. KELEMAN: But he's not convinced the Bush administration can make a persuasive case. Colonel WILKERSON: Even if they are doing something far more nefarious than that, and they very well could be, I don't think we have the intelligence capability to ferret it out and prove it in a definitive sort of way. KELEMAN: His former boss, Colin Powell, was the one to present faulty intelligence to the United Nations on Iraq, so Wilkerson says he can see why there seems to be some angst in the State Department about how and when to present its case on Iran.

It's frequently minimized or dismissed as irrelevant or sometimes even denied in Arab discourse. Well, Robert Satloff is back from an unusual lecture tour in Egypt where he spoke about the Holocaust in Arabic. And he's with us once again. Welcome back to the program. Dr. ROBERT SATLOFF (Author and Historian): Thank you. SIEGEL: And first a bit of news that you have nominated one of the men you wrote about, a Tunisian Muslim Arab, to the Israeli National Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem. Dr. SATLOFF: That's right. That's Khaled Abdelwahhab, who is now under consideration by Yad Vashem to be the first ever Arab to be recognized as a righteous - a non-Jew who saved Jews during the Holocaust. And hopefully before too long a final determination on his status will be given. SIEGEL: Well now the speaking tour. You went to Egypt. Whom did you talk to about the Holocaust? Dr. SATLOFF: Well, first I was quite pleased to be invited by the State Department to go overseas and talk about this book of mine. And I spoke to real institutions of the state, Cairo University, the Foreign Ministries Training Institute, at Al-Ahram - the national newspaper - even at the Arab League, that citadel of Arabism. SIEGEL: And what kind of reception did you get? Dr. SATLOFF: I can't say that everywhere I went I was showered with rose petals. I was pilloried by the opposition press. You know, why should we let this person come in and talk about this when we should be talking about the genocide of the Palestinians, for example. But I'd say the dominant response was respectful and open and candid. That was certainly the response from officialdom, even at the Arab League, where some of the Arab ambassadors lost their cool in criticizing what I had to say. The secretary general said we have a political conflict with Israel, but it's a political conflict, and for us Holocaust denial is unacceptable. SIEGEL: Your tour to Egypt - an Arab country, seat of Arab nationalism for many years - came right after the conference that the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, organized in Iran - not an Arab country, a Persian country, not a Sunni Muslim country, but a Shiite country - that was virtually a Holocaust denial conference. Relationship between the two events? Dr. SATLOFF: Yes. I think that there is a fundamental connection here. Sunni Arab leaders, Sunni Arab intelligencia are apoplectic about the rise of Iranian and more generally Shiite influence that they see throughout the Middle East. They fear that the Iranians have their tentacles out and that they are spreading their influence and they fear the United States is receding. And they are begging the United States help the Sunni Arabs combat the spread of Shia radicalism. SIEGEL: So perhaps in the approach that you experienced, in their approach to the issue of discussing the Holocaust and Arabs acknowledging the significance of the Holocaust, a Sunni Arab country is saying we are different from those Iranians - or the Arabs might say those Persians - we are not the other, we are with you on this. We understand Western civilization. Dr. SATLOFF: Yes. I think that is the political message that they are sending. That this apocalyptic, messianic leader of Iran is the adversary. And the Sunni regimes are trying to line themselves more closely with America and the West and even Israel in some respects. And this discussion of the Holocaust is perhaps one tool, one vehicle, through which they're making their case. SIEGEL: Beyond declarations in conferences in Cairo, any actions by Egypt? Has anyone seized part of this attitude toward the Holocaust? Dr. SATLOFF: Well, just last week the U. N. General Assembly voted on a resolution condemning Holocaust denial. And one of the first representatives out of his chair was, surprisingly, the Egyptian ambassador to support this resolution. And this was quite ironic, because two years ago the Egyptians led the charge against recognizing Holocaust Remembrance Day. But now, they're leading the charge in support of this. Even, if you'd like, today there's a new story reporting that the Saudi ambassador attended a reception for the new U. S. envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism and said some very positive things about anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. These are all signs of the political trend that's going on here. SIEGEL: Now, you're not going too far here and forecasting any great (unintelligible), but there are some different atmospherics in this issue. Dr. SATLOFF: Yeah. I totally agree. We should be extremely modest in suggesting that there is any mass move toward Jewish/Muslim amity that we're seeing. This is politics, and Sunni Arabs are using this issue as a way to differentiate themselves from Iran. And I think, however, we live in a political world and we should take advantage of political openings where they present themselves. And I think such is a moment that we have now. SIEGEL: Robert Satloff, thank you very much for talking with us once again. Dr. SATLOFF: Thank you.

The papers were stuffed in a briefcase that belonged to one of Florida's civil rights pioneers, Harry T. Moore. Moore was executive director of the Florida NAACP and during the 1930s and '40s he championed black voting rights. His briefcase had been missing for more than half a century, ever since he and his wife Harriette were killed on Christmas night in 1951; that's when a bomb ripped through the family's home in rural Mims, Florida. Ms. EVANGELINE MOORE (Daughter of Harry T. Moore): My parents were thrown all the way up through the ceiling and through the rafters on the house. And they landed back in a hole and all of the rafters that they had caused to be loosened, the furniture and everything was on top of them. ELLIOTT: Evangeline was 21 years old at that time. Ms. MOORE: The end of my world had just come. My parents were my whole world, especially my daddy. ELLIOTT: Ms. Moore lost most of her childhood memories after that tragedy. But today she is learning about her family's history through the newspaper clippings and meticulous records her father kept in his briefcase. The satchel was recently discovered just a half of mile from where the Moore's home once stood in a barn that was about to be torn down to make way for development. We visited Evangeline Moore at her home in New Carrollton, Maryland to find out more about the long, missing briefcase. Ms. MOORE: It had been turned over to the Brevard County authorities the night of the bombing. And we had sort of looked forward it since that time and it never turned up, so I had about forgotten it because it should have been in a property room storing murder investigation material at the Brevard County Courthouse - that's logical. When it got to the cow barn, I've no idea. ELLIOTT: Now who found it? Ms. MOORE: Historian Roz Foster with the North Brevard County Historical Society. The briefcase was in a box. It was standing up on two huge jars with a lid from a trashcan on top of it. So when Roz took the cover off and looked at it closer, she said, ah, Harry T. Moore. It was dad's briefcase. ELLIOTT: They have given you all the papers in the briefcase. I see before us, you have them organized in big fat notebooks. Ms. MOORE: Yeah. ELLIOTT: There are at least five of these books. Ms. MOORE: Yes. ELLIOTT: What happened to the briefcase itself? Ms. MOORE: It fell apart when they touched it. It will be shipped to me. Although it's in shambles, I want to see it and I want it in my possession. ELLIOTT: Would you share for us some of the documents? Ms. MOORE: Papers concerning projects that my dad was involved in. I have a lot of newspaper articles that he wrote on various subjects; particularly I was interested in one that he wrote an article to the paper stating why should Negroes become Democrats, because he was the one who forced the state of Florida to allow blacks to register Democrat and vote in the Democratic primary. ELLIOTT: Now, this was at a time when the Democratic Party was the dominant party in states like Florida, so by winning a Democratic primary you were pretty much assured a win in the general election. This was also a time when most blacks were associated with the Republican Party. Ms. MOORE: Yes, they were. But the Democratic primary was the election which determined state and local officials. When they could only vote Republican, they have no voice at all. But by becoming Democrats they could decide who the sheriff was going to be, who the governor was going to be, and that had never happened. ELLIOTT: Harry T. Moore documented the ways white registrars kept black voters from registering as Democrats. Ms. MOORE: Here's a section in here of affidavits. Henry Day Strickland, 55, Box 101, Mims, Florida - lived in Mims, Florida since 1914, has been registered consistently since almost 1914 - always Republican because he wanted to try to change his registration from Republican to Democrat. She said, Didn't have no instructions to change and therefore she did not say she would see Bailey - that was the person in charge of registration - and find out. Saw her after that and she said Bailey had instructed her to make no change.  So this particular bunch of affidavits were when he was trying to force the attorney general, whose name was Tom Watson, to make sure that he sent out definite instructions to all of the registrants that they could not avoid registering blacks as Democrat or changing their registration. And I don't how many letters and calls dad made. But in the end, Tom Watson finally sent the instructions along to all the registrants in the state of Florida. So we got it done.  ELLIOTT: Now, this was in the '30s and '40s. This was pre-Voting Rights Act. But yet your father had the vision to see that black political power could be a force back then.  Ms. MOORE: Yes, he did. He knew it. He didn't have to assume it, but he knew it. Dad was the first civil rights martyr. My dad and mom are the only couple who died in the civil rights fights. And dad did things that were completely and positively unheard of. No small-statured black man, quiet but oh so forceful, would have taken up the fight for the things that he fought for. ELLIOTT: What do you think gave him his passion? What do you think motivated him to do this? Ms. MOORE: He was a child of God and he believed that God sent him on a mission, just like he sent Moses on his mission. And nothing but nothing and nobody but nobody was going to deter him. He had a mission and he fulfilled it.  ELLIOTT: Evangeline Moore, thank you so much for talking with us.  Ms. MOORE: You're welcome.  ELLIOTT: Florida authorities say the contents of Harry T. Moore's briefcase revealed nothing new about the bombing that killed him and his wife Harriett in 1951. Last year the state named four now-dead Ku Klux Klansmen as the killers; they never faced trial.

C. , the head of Wal-Mart and the leader of the Service Employees International Union shook hands and announced a common goal - to change the way Americans buy healthcare. They didn't agree on specifics, but it's one more sign that the current healthcare system may be crumbling. It seems that everybody's working on a plan to reform that system. Republican governors in California and Massachusetts, Democratic presidential candidates, and President Bush. Many of these initiatives are shaking a central pillar of the current system, the assumption that most of us will get health insurance through our employers. Len Nichols has been pushing for the shift. He's director of health policy for the New America Foundation in Washington, D. C. He joins us by phone from Atlanta. Mr. Nichols, thanks for being with us. Mr. LEN NICHOLS (New America Foundation): Glad to be here, Scott. SIMON: Is there room for everyone on your bandwagon? Mr. NICHOLS: Oh, I think so. I think, in fact, what's going on is more and more people are realizing the 21st century economy cannot sustain our reliance on the employer to finance health care. SIMON: So under your plan, Mr. Nichols, would people be required to buy health insurance the way - if you want to drive a car you have to have insurance for it? Mr. NICHOLS: Well, that's right. The fundamental reality of health insurance is that the market would be both more efficient and more fair if everyone had to buy. Because then all the healthy and the sick would be in the single risk pool, and insurers would not have to protect themselves against worry of only having the sick try to buy. And we would be able then to charge fair prices to everybody, and therefore the market would work better. SIMON: And of course this would lift a burden from employers. Mr. NICHOLS: Well, the idea would be though to preserve what's useful about the employer system. It did come about as somewhat of an accident. It grew rapidly during World War II, when businesses could not raise wages because of wage freezes and they decided to offer health benefits to compete for labor and suddenly it began to grow. But it's also true, the idea of buying insurance in a big group is far, far more efficient. So when we would do away with the employer system, we would preserve those administrative economies of scale and risk pooling by having people buy through large pools. SIMON: Would millions of people nevertheless not be covered because they just couldn't afford to buy such a plan? Mr. NICHOLS: Well, you wouldn't want to do this kind of thing unless you had a social commitment to provide subsidies for the low income. But that's what's so interesting about moving away from the employer system. Right now, we don't tax employer contributions for health insurance, and because of that, we lose 200 billion in revenue that we would get if we did away with that tax exclusion, as the president proposes. Then that gives you a lot of money back you can use for subsidies. SIMON: Do you sense that events are socially and politically at a crunch point? Mr. NICHOLS: Andy Stern is the president of the Service Employees International Union, one of the most active leaders on the health care benefits front. And Lee Scott is the CEO of Wal-Mart, a company who is, I think now, the largest employer in the world, certainly the largest in the United States. But Andy and Lee Scott have been, in a sense, antagonists for some time. So for them to come together on a stage in Washington and shake hands and agree that the uninsured problem is sufficiently severe it needs to be solved, that we have to do it together - business, labor and government - that's equivalent in my view to Anwar Sadat going to Jerusalem to shake hands with Menachem Begin. It is a very big deal because it says people with very different views have come to the agreement we must and we can do this.  This gives cover to Republican moderates who actually want to solve the problem but have been stymied by their own party's leadership of refusal to deal with the reality we're going to have to cover this many people and it may cost some money. It also gives cover to Democratic moderates who want to reach across the aisle and meet those moderate Republicans halfway with a market oriented solution that nonetheless has subsidies for the low income and a fair and efficient market for us all.

I'm Scott Simon. The United States announced this week it will admit 7,000 Iraqi refugees into the country within a year. Since 2003 it's taken in only about 600. The magnitude of the refugee problem in Iraq is enormous. An estimated two million people have already left Iraq since the war began and another 1. 7 million at least are internally displaced. Antonio Guterres is the U. N. high commissioner for refugees and a former primer minister of Portugal. He joins us in our studios. And Prime Minister, thanks very much for being with us. Mr. ANTONIO GUTERRES (U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees): It's a great pleasure. SIMON: This has been called the largest refugee crisis in the Middle East since 1948. Mr. GUTERRES: It is. SIMON: Help us understand. We've got more than a million Iraqis who've reportedly wound up in Syria, more than half a million in Jordan. Why are those countries absorbing the bulk of the refugees so far as opposed to Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia? Mr. GUTERRES: Well, both Syria and Jordan have had a very generous attitude. They have opened their borders. That was not the same in the other countries of the region. And even not considering them as refugees - they called them visitors or guests. They considered them as sisters and brothers because they all belonged to another Arab states. They have been receiving them now for years, and as a matter of fact, paying a heavy price. The education systems, health systems no longer can cope with such a huge influx of people. You see inflation, you see the real estate market with very high prices, difficulties to find the housing, even for the local citizens. And this is causing a change of moods in the public opinion. And more and more people start being against the presence of such a large number of Iraqis. SIMON: How are the refugees in Jordan and Syria living? Mr. GUTERRES: Jordan has a population that in average is richer than the population in Syria. But  we are having more and more people also in Jordan. In Syria you have basically middle class and poor people. And more and more people that came with some resources after months, after one year, after two years, they're no longer anything to be able to sustain their livelihoods. SIMON: Are there tented camps? Are they living in apartments? Mr. GUTERRES: They live in towns, they share the neighborhoods with the local population. And that's why the pressure is so high. Until now both countries have rejected the idea of having camps. And of course we will never insist on such an option, because to live in a camp is much worse than to live in a neighborhood, even with the extreme difficulties they face. And so it's essential to help these countries, to have a massive commitment from the international community to support these countries in order to preserve (unintelligible) space. But let's be honest, the international community cannot go on letting them abandoned. SIMON: To put it this bluntly, you met with Secretary of State Rice. Are you satisfied with the amount of support from the United States? Mr. GUTERRES: I think the United States is now moving in the right direction. That is the most important. It was announced that there will be a dialogue even with Syria on refugee issues, and I hope the United States will play a major role in the support of these two countries. In the support also to the broad humanitarian community, including ourselves in our actions there. And it is also important that, as you have mentioned, some resettlement opportunities are now clearly being opened. And it's very important that this step, that I consider the first step, could also help solve not the problem of the refugees as a whole, but the problem of very vulnerable people. It's clear that for the bulk of the refugees, the solution they want is to be able to go back once the political problem is solved. But we have very vulnerable people. We have unaccompanied minors, we have women in extremely difficult situations, handicapped people. We have members of groups that are particularly targeted. But we are a humanitarian agency. We consider ourselves as nurses. We are not doctors. We don't cure the disease. We deal with symptoms. The disease is political and the solution is political. SIMON: Mr. Guterres, while we have you here in our studio, can we ask, is there area of the world that's afflicted with the humanitarian crisis that in your judgment has gone relatively unreported? Mr. GUTERRES: Well, there are many forgotten crises in the world. Nobody speaks about Central African Republic. Situation is (unintelligible) is appalling. You have not only displacement, you have conflict, you have areas that have been almost abandoned by the population. A few agencies try to do their best with very scarce results. We could go on and on. Even the Democrat Republic of Congo, the number of victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in six months, corresponds to the number of victims of the tsunami. So we have a tsunami every six months in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Unfortunately, many (unintelligible) crises go on without being noticed and lots of people suffer tremendously because of that. SIMON: Antonio Guterres, U.

Schoomaker is now approaching retirement again. He's a strong advocate of substantially increasing the size of the Army, and of transforming the Army, making it more modular, with smaller, more lethal units, able to deploy more quickly. General Schoomaker called that transformation the most dramatic change to the Army since World War II. General PETER SCHOOMAKER (U. S. Army): We've described building the Army and transforming it while at war, much like building an airplane while in flight. And it's quite challenging. So while the stress is on the force, and while we're trying to not only change it internally but grow it, it presents unique challenges in almost every dimension. And one of the biggest issues I have is that we find our soldiers returning with less dwell-time. BLOCK: And by dwell-time you mean time at home, time between deployments? Gen. SCHOOMAKER: I mean time at home, that's correct. And ideally, while we're trying to transform, change the Army and prepare it, we also want to see a time for families and our people to recuperate and to reintegrate and to rest. And when the Army is as busy as it is, the place that in my view - having grown up in the Army, and my father was 32 years in the Army; I know what the family stresses are - we would like to see much more time for the actual personal recuperation. BLOCK: General, you've said before Congress that the current burden on active duty soldiers at this phase will break the active component. What do you mean by that? Gen. SCHOOMAKER: Well, I don't believe I said it that quite starkly. I am concerned about our ability to indefinitely sustain this level of effort, you know, without the increased growth. And the president, as you know, just a few months ago made the decision to grow the Army. And with that size Army we can sustain this level of effort with a proper period to dwell, but we're not there yet. And so, you know, saying that we're on the verge of breaking is not correct. We're not. BLOCK: General, you said in the past that the Army started out in the Iraq war flatfooted, was your expression. What would you have done at the beginning to have been more effective in Iraq? Gen. SCHOOMAKER: There's little you can do at the point that a conflict arises other than use the force that you have. And we had a very good force to do -you know, we defeated the Iraqi army in very short order and captured Baghdad, etc. And that's exactly where we're optimized. But where we lacked a lot of capacity and doubtfulness and all of the kinds of things that we needed below that. You know, if I had a magic dust, I would have jumped to the kind of force that we're building today. But unfortunately, that's not - physics doesn't allow you to do that. BLOCK: There were also, of course, calculations that were made, though, of what would be needed, not just what was available, but what would be needed. Your predecessor as Army chief of staff, Erick Shinseki, said that just before the war began, he said the U. S. would need several hundred thousand troops to occupy Iraq. He was swatted down by other members of the Pentagon. Do you think he was right? Gen. SCHOOMAKER: First of all, I think I'd have probably answered the same way. I have a lot of respect for Rick Shinseki. I've known him a long time. He's a very thoughtful and experienced individual. And I think he gave the best advice that he could. And his advice, in my opinion, is correct. That doesn't make everybody else wrong. It means that, you know, his view of where this thing may go, you know, perhaps he saw it in a different way than other people did. BLOCK: Well, Paul Wolfowitz, I believe, responded to that by saying that U. S. troops would be greeted at liberators and a couple of hundred thousand troops was really out of whack. Gen. SCHOOMAKER: Well, I think there was an expectation of that. And again, I wasn't involved in any of those conversations, so I don't know what else went on. BLOCK: General Schoomaker, how do you assess the legacy of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld? Gen. SCHOOMAKER: First of all, he's very bright. He has a lot of energy. He cares a great deal. I know that. But I do know that - I mean he likes to come to solutions through a very confrontational kind of way, and he's an impatient individual who wants to see change and he wants to see results. So I respected him from that position. I'm not one that's a detractor. BLOCK: You've heard, I'm sure, the comments made by Senator John McCain this week about Donald Rumsfeld. Senator McCain said we are paying a very heavy price for the mismanagement, that's the kindest word I can give you, of Donald Rumsfeld, of this war. And he went on, I think that Donald Rumsfeld will go down in history as one of the worst secretaries of defense in history. Gen. SCHOOMAKER: Well, I really don't have any comment to make on that. I mean, you know, there are multitude of opinions, and I don't second guess anybody's motivation on anything. Senator McCain said that. I didn't hear him say that, by the way. But if that's what he said, I'm sure he believes it. And it doesn't mean I agree with it. BLOCK: General Schoomaker, thanks very much for talking with us. Gen. SCHOOMAKER: Absolutely. My pleasure. Thank you. BLOCK: That's General Peter Schoomaker. He's retiring as the Army chief of staff on April 10th.

I'm Scott Simon.  Defense Secretary Robert Gates yesterday examined the facilities at Walter Reed Army Center and announced that a commission will investigate the medical services that injured soldiers received there and other military facilities. Secretary Gates and other officials have vowed to improve the care that wounded soldiers receive.  The sudden focus on this issue was prompted by a Washington Post series this week that portrayed squalid living conditions and bureaucratic delays at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  Steve Robinson, a Gulf War veteran, is an advisor to Veterans for America, an advocacy organization for veterans. He joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. Mr. STEVE ROBINSON (Veterans for America): My pleasure. SIMON: Help us understand what you think are the first priorities that are necessary for veterans to get the treatment they have earned. Mr. ROBINSON: Well, the first thing is the medical care on the battlefield is saving lives and we need to laud them for that. The second thing is that once they're evacuated to Walter Reed they get state of the art care in terms of medical procedures, prosthetic limbs, burn care, bullets and bombs injuries. They're getting care. But then comes the hard part. When they transition from inpatient care to outpatient care they languish. And for those soldiers what needs to happen is that they need to have care managers in that hospital helping the soldiers navigate what I like to call one of the most convoluted workman's comp systems in the world, which is the military discharge process. SIMON: Mr. Robinson, what about long term care for those veterans who are permanently disabled? Mr. ROBINSON: Well, now you're talking about the transition from getting out of DOD and moving into the VA health care system. There's a thing that we've been arguing about for seven years called the seamless transition.  It's supposed to happen that there is no bump in the road between getting out of the military and getting into the VA health care system. But what veterans are finding is that once they survive the Walter Reed experience and then get out, they then face an entirely new and the second largest bureaucracy in the federal government, which is the Department of Veterans Affairs.  And that in and of itself is a whole other war, a battle of paperwork, a battle of proving that your injury that you got while you were serving is compensatable and deserving of healthcare and treatment. SIMON: Mr. Robinson, forgive me for not knowing this. We've literally just met when you've come into the studio. But were you injured? Mr. ROBINSON: I was injured in actually peacetime. Yeah, I did. I was blown up - had my right hand blown up and had my lips blown off in a training accident. I was fortunate enough to get some really good surgery at a German hospital. It wasn't a military hospital. And. . . SIMON: But you were in the Army when this injury occurred? Mr. ROBINSON: Oh, yeah. SIMON: Do you need continuing care now? Mr. ROBINSON: I have filed a claim with the VA. And it took me two and a half years from the moment I filed my claim to the moment I received disability compensation for the injury I sustained in the military. Now, fortunately I had a job.  If you can imagine having to wait two and a half years and not being able to work if you had your right hand blown off; that's the problem, the gap between getting out and getting the care. The bureaucratic delays of getting out of DOD and the long time to wait to get into the VA health care system is extremely frustrating. It's not necessary and we can do better.  SIMON: Is there a hierarchy among wounded war veterans? Mr. ROBINSON: It's interesting you ask that question, because the first part of the answer is yes, they try to treat the most severely wounded first. The problem with that is there are many people that are coming back that aren't missing limbs or didn't receive injury from bullets and bombs.  They have the unseen wounds of war, the psychological wounds of war, and they're no less debilitating than a bullet to the brain. And so we have a tough time with those guys, getting them the appropriate care. But yeah, there is a hierarchy.

Archbishop DONALD WUERL (Washington, D. C. ): There are times when we all feel alone, separated from our families, friends and even god. We may feel like we have nowhere to turn. But we're not alone. Forgiveness is readily available to us through the goodness of god's grace and the sacrament of reconciliation. ELLIOTT: That's the voice of Donald Wuerl, the Archbishop of Washington. This radio spot is part of a marketing blitz to bring D. C. -area Catholics back to confession during the Lenten season. The Archdiocese is setting aside 90 minutes every Wednesday evening until Easter to offer confession to parishioners like Danielle Driscoll(ph). Ms. DANIELLE DRISCOLL (Parishioner): I go to church here at St. Matthews every Sunday, and I realize that I haven't gone to confession in four years, so I thought maybe it was time to go. And I usually have a class on Wednesday nights, but this week it got cancelled, so I figured I should go because my favorite TV show's not on until 8:00. ELLIOTT: To find out why there has been a drop-off in confession, we turn to Monsignor Kevin Irwin, dean of theology and religious studies at Catholic University. Thanks for coming in, Sir. Monsignor KEVIN IRWIN (Catholic University): You're very welcome. ELLIOTT: Now, according to Georgetown University, a poll in 2005, 42 percent of American adult Catholics said they never go to confession. Fourteen percent said they go once a year, and only two percent said they go once a month or more. What does the church require? Monsignor IRWIN: It requires that one go to confession when one has sinned seriously, and especially during the Easter season. So the prescription that sometime between the beginning of Lent, the season we're in now, until Pentecost Sunday, which will be in May, that Catholics would go to confession at least once a year with serious sin to confess. ELLIOTT: I read somewhere that after the Second Vatican Council, when the church continued to consider using birth control a sin, that you had a lot of people fall off of confession at that time because they didn't agree with the church's definition of sin. Do you agree that that was at a point at which people began to not go to confession? They felt like they couldn't continue to confess something they planned on continuing to do? Monsignor IRWIN: Well, certainly I think in hindsight you could put a timeframe, the 1960s. 1968 was Paul VI's encyclical on birth control. But ways of describing sin and what really is very seriously sinful has had its own evolution over time. For example, it seems to me in the last 40 years the church has appropriately brought back notions of social sin - racial prejudice, gender discrimination. Those kinds of things are out there that we wouldn't probably have talked about, about 40 years ago. So I wouldn't put it on birth control necessarily, but a number of other things that were going on, including the church saying maybe we need a more biblically based notion of confession, and perhaps we should emphasize this social dimension. So a number of things went into play the very same years, I would say. Not just birth control. ELLIOTT: Yeah. I am not a Roman Catholic, and so I think a lot of my image of confession comes from maybe films, where you see people going into the confessional and there's the screen. And is it like that or has it changed? Monsignor IRWIN: Well, we all have our images of \"Going My Way\" and \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" and Bing Crosby and all those kinds of things in 1950s Catholicism. But as a matter of fact, there was no confession screen required until the 16th century. We had no such thing. And now what you have in churches is the possibility to go face-to-face to a priest. It could be in a rectory parlor, it could be in the body of the church, or it could be behind a screen to preserve your anonymity. And sometimes what you have to say, what you want to say, is somewhat so humbling that the church respects you want to be anonymous about that. But there are several ways to do that and have been in the history of the church. ELLIOTT: Has the nature of the type of sins that people confess, has that changed over time? Monsignor IRWIN: Well, yes, it has, and I've been a priest now going on 36 years. I would say that the evolution has been very marked. While there's concern about numbers of confessions and how often people go, I'd have to say that when people come, it's a much richer, much deeply felt experience of conscience, of putting themselves before God. So I would say that people come to you when they deal with addiction to the Internet. They deal with compulsions. They deal with their crackberry(ph) addictions, the 24/7 work addictions. Some people come to me and say I simply have too much money and I wonder whether I should be looking at my life in terms of how I might channel that. So in a fairly well-to-do society sometimes the confessions are a much, much more deeply rooted and not simply a list of - a laundry list of peccadilloes. ELLIOTT: What about the penance? Has that changed over time? Monsignor IRWIN: It has, and I will often say to someone, well, in line of your confession, why don't you offer me an idea of what you might think would be a good penance, because I can't diagnose their lifestyle needs. And sometimes people say to me, I'm so busy, I don't know what else I can do. And my reaction is maybe something qualitatively different might help you with the rest of what you do. But I invite them to offer an idea, but it would not be inappropriate for me to say I think you should call a couple of sick friends and get them on the phone and let them know they're not alone, or bring a meal to someone who is grieving or do something like that as well as to come back to church more faithfully. ELLIOTT: Do campaigns like the one that the Archdiocese of Washington is now in the midst of during this Lenten season, do these kind of campaigns work? Do they actually bring people back to confession? Monsignor IRWIN: I have to say, we don't really know. And the last thing I'd want to do is on Easter Sunday have a head count - or a soul count, how many people came back. My reaction is, I think that this says to people, you matter, this matters, give it serious thought; in God's good time you're welcomed back to the church. You can always come back. I think that's what this message is. ELLIOTT: Monsignor Kevin Irwin is dean of theology and religious studies at Catholic University and author of \"Models of the Eucharist. \" Thank you for coming in, sir. Monsignor IRWIN: Thank you.

But there are several ways to do that and have been in the history of the church.  ELLIOTT: Has the nature of the type of sins that people confess, has that changed over time?  Monsignor IRWIN: Well, yes, it has, and I've been a priest now going on 36 years. I would say that the evolution has been very marked. While there's concern about numbers of confessions and how often people go, I'd have to say that when people come, it's a much richer, much deeply felt experience of conscience, of putting themselves before God.  So I would say that people come to you when they deal with addiction to the Internet. They deal with compulsions. They deal with their crackberry(ph) addictions, the 24/7 work addictions. Some people come to me and say I simply have too much money and I wonder whether I should be looking at my life in terms of how I might channel that. So in a fairly well-to-do society sometimes the confessions are a much, much more deeply rooted and not simply a list of - a laundry list of peccadilloes.  ELLIOTT: What about the penance? Has that changed over time?  Monsignor IRWIN: It has, and I will often say to someone, well, in line of your confession, why don't you offer me an idea of what you might think would be a good penance, because I can't diagnose their lifestyle needs. And sometimes people say to me, I'm so busy, I don't know what else I can do. And my reaction is maybe something qualitatively different might help you with the rest of what you do.  But I invite them to offer an idea, but it would not be inappropriate for me to say I think you should call a couple of sick friends and get them on the phone and let them know they're not alone, or bring a meal to someone who is grieving or do something like that as well as to come back to church more faithfully.  ELLIOTT: Do campaigns like the one that the Archdiocese of Washington is now in the midst of during this Lenten season, do these kind of campaigns work? Do they actually bring people back to confession?  Monsignor IRWIN: I have to say, we don't really know. And the last thing I'd want to do is on Easter Sunday have a head count - or a soul count, how many people came back. My reaction is, I think that this says to people, you matter, this matters, give it serious thought; in God's good time you're welcomed back to the church. You can always come back. I think that's what this message is.  ELLIOTT: Monsignor Kevin Irwin is dean of theology and religious studies at Catholic University and author of \"Models of the Eucharist. \" Thank you for coming in, sir.  Monsignor IRWIN: Thank you.

Thanks for being with us. Representative ADAM PUTNAM (Republican, Florida): Delighted to be here. Thank you. BLOCK: And how do you read the Democratic plan that would set a timetable for troop withdrawal, set conditions for the Iraqi government to meet? Rep. PUTNAM: Well, you know, we've been talking about benchmarks for some time, but it's unfortunate with these arbitrary deadlines. It does, I think, create an unnecessary and undue burden on those commanders and deprives them of the flexibility they need to wage this war as successfully as they can. Ultimately, this papered-over compromise that has still not been vetted by the Democratic caucus is the result of four or five weeks of failed strategies that have not generated a sufficient support from within the Democratic Party. And so they keep coming back with a different iteration of the same plan, which ultimately is to cut off funding for our troops who are in harm's way. BLOCK: Aren't benchmarks, though, a reasonable thing? To say, look, if we're going to fund this war, then we need to see the Iraqi government pulling its weight, making progress in a certain key areas. Rep. PUTNAM: Americans at their core are scorekeepers. They want some objective criteria to know what's working and what's not. The problem with the Democratic plan is that it puts in motion the cutting off of funds for those troops who are in harm's way and it starts to tie the hands of those commanders on the ground. So you now have Washington making key battlefield decisions instead of the military. BLOCK: Democrats would say, look, we're not cutting our funding for the troops who are there. We are setting a benchmark of funding that would mean those troops will start coming home because we're not seeing the Iraqi government step up to the plate and make the changes that need to be made. Rep. PUTNAM: Well, I don't think anybody necessarily has a problem with being able to measure the progress of the Iraqis to meet their end of the bargain. But what you don't want to see is Congress giving the enemy the message that if you just stay in your cave until a date certain, the Americans will be gone and you can come out and do whatever you want to do to destroy this country and the progress that has been made there in the last several years. BLOCK: Congressman Putnam, is any other limit on troop withdrawal acceptable to you, or would you say no matter how long this goes, no matter how costly it is, we will fund this war without conditions? Rep. PUTNAM: Ultimately, the military commanders need to be empowered with the tools they need to win. And I can't think of any president in the history of warfare where you set a date after which you will no longer fight whether you win or lose. BLOCK: But there's certainly plenty of examples of Congress cutting off funding for wars. Rep. PUTNAM: The Democrats refuse to have that vote. If they want to have that vote, we could have it this afternoon about whether to cut off funding for troops in the field, to cut off funding for this war. And ultimately you've hit upon the core of this plan that has been rolled out today, which is an attempt to bridge the gap between the two thirds of the Democrats who would like to cut off funding and the third who ran in the fall elections essentially against that stance, and the inability of the Democratic leadership to bridge that gap. Ultimately, we would like to see the Democrats follow through on their rhetoric about cutting off funding and have that vote so that we then can move on. But as it is right now, they're going through strings and caveats and too cute by half machinations so that they don't have to take the political heat for cutting off funding but they accomplish the same thing.

It's the last stop on Mr. Bush's five-nation tour of Latin America. He's working to convince leaders there that the region remains a priority. It's his first summit meeting with President Calderon, who took office just a few months ago. NPR's David Greene has been traveling with the president and he's with us now. David, hola. What's expected from today's conversation? DAVID GREENE: Hola, Alex. Well, it's the first time these two leaders are sitting down since President Calderon was sworn in as you said, and so a lot of this is going to be getting a sense for one another. And Calderon - at a welcoming ceremony for President Bush - was pretty blunt. He said he thinks Mexico is the most important relationship for the United States. He said after the 9-11 attacks, President Bush's priorities changed. He said that was understandable, but that he's going to stress to the American president that Mexico should be back at the top of the agenda now. CHADWICK: One strain in the relations: the U. S. fence being built along the border to stem the flow of immigrants. You know I heard President Bush speaking about this fence earlier today on MORNING EDITION, and it didn't sound to me as though what he was saying would actually be very helpful. He was saying, well, it's not just a fence. It's a berm. It's all these other kinds of things. I mean, what's going on there? GREENE: Well, President Bush's immigration policies so far have not satisfied Mexico. He had promised Vicente Fox that he would get some sort of a guest worker deal. The president has not gotten that yet. His relationship with former President Fox broke down, and this fence has really rankled a lot of Latin-American leaders. In Guatemala yesterday, the president defended it and said it's just part of beefing up security on the border. But Calderon has said that he wants this relationship to be about more than immigration, but he's also made clear - as Guatemala's president did yesterday - that if President Bush is going to show that he's reaching out to Latin America, he's going to have to do something with them on immigration policy.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. The 2007 Templeton Prize - which recognizes research and discoveries about spiritual realities - went to a philosopher today. Professor Charles Taylor - long of McGill University in Montreal, and now at Northwestern University - has been writing for decades about the need to include the spiritual dimension in discussions of policy history, literature and language. The award carries a prize of about $1. 5 million. And Professor Taylor joins us from New York. Welcome to the program and congratulations. P: Thank you very much. SIEGEL: You have said the deafness of many philosophers, social scientists and historians to the spiritual dimensions can be remarkable, and that that is damaging in that it affects the culture of the media and of educated public opinion in general. What's an example of that? P: I think the example of that is how a lot of people were surprised at what they call the - a little while ago - the return of religion. When they saw these phenomena - religiously mobilized politics and so on - as though it had somehow disappeared. And here it was back. And they were surprised that it was back, because they sort of bought into a narrative of secularization, that the more modernization proceeds, the less religion there is in the society. It kind of fades away before modernity. And I think that blinded them to what had been going on all along. And it - in order to understand what did happen, you have to stop thinking of \"return of religion\" and think of, yeah, changes in religion, very definitely. But you have to be aware of that dimension in people's lives, and how it's very important and how it shapes what they do. SIEGEL: Do you think that political discourse in the United States actually suffers from a deficit of talk about God or religion? P: Well, I think it suffers from a deficit of maybe serious talk about God and religion. I mean, religious belonging and God and the Bible are used as kind of clubs to beat other people over the head with. If you have religion without an absolute, you know, touch of self-criticism, then you have some kind of, I think, distorted religion. SIEGEL: On the other hand, I noted this week that a group that advocates - and I'm not sure how they used the word, whether it's secularism or atheism - determined by survey that it had found the highest ranking nonbeliever in the U. S. government - or the highest ranking, self-confessed nonbeliever. And he's a veteran California Democratic congressman, Fortney Stark, Pete Stark, who admitted that he does not believe in a higher power. The fact that one could find no higher than that. . . P: Yeah. SIEGEL: . . . in American politics suggests that indeed our politics don't suffer form the lack of religious belief. P: Well, maybe it proves the opposite - maybe it proves that there's a high degree of hypocrisy about all this because there are demands made by religious-believing voters on people that they can't possibly get elected unless they declare themselves. And I think that probably what you have here is a very high hypocrisy level. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: You suspect there are more than a few agnostics and atheists in the closet in American life. P: I would lay some serious money on that proposition. But we'll never know, because they won't want to shoot themselves in the foot by admitting it. SIEGEL: Can there, do you think, actually be a level of diversity of religious - and for that matter, nonreligious - ideological beliefs within society in which people are devoted to what they believe in, sufficiently so to act on that belief, and sufficiently so to actually regard an utterly different concept of humanity's place on earth or the order of the universe with a truly generous democratic spirit? Or ultimately, if people are wedded to very powerful beliefs, are they ultimately going to be intolerant of ideas that are completely and philosophically at odds with their own? P: Yes, that's - in my experience, intolerance and depth of religious commitment just don't correlate at all. I mean - even perhaps the opposite. I've known lots of people who are kind of - let's say - lax agnostics, where they aren't very invested into it but they just take for granted that religion is passe and so on. And they are, in some ways, incredibly intolerant. Certainly, they have no understanding for what they're denying. And then there are people that are very, very profound believers, but are interested in the fact that people are atheist, that there's some kind of very deep position here which has driven people to that. SIEGEL: But if one truly believes as either a Christian or a Jew - or a Marxist, for that matter - that there really was no divine prophecy related through the Koran, can one be tolerant? When somebody regards that as somebody else's belief, but absolutely out of the ball park for oneself? P: Well, there still is something very mysterious here. There is something very great and I think captiv- I'm not a Muslim. See, I'm a Christian. About this whole idea of the Koran, of the recitation of God's word recited like that, it's a very profound and powerful idea. There's something so important and so captivating and so interesting here that I would feel I'm not acting as a human being if I don't try to understand it.

I'm Luke Burbank. MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. Military desertions are less common today than during the Vietnam era. Coming up, we'll look up at what happened after one soldier went AWOL. BURBANK: But first, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the Kuwaiti national suspected of being al-Qaida's number three, has confessed to planning the September 11th attacks. He spoke to a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba over the weekend. And the Pentagon has just released the transcript. His admission to the 9/11 attacks was the big headline, but he also claimed partial or full responsibility for more than 30 other terror plots and attacks, and also reportedly the beheading of Daniel Pearl. Here to talk with us about the confession is journalist and author Ron Suskind. He wrote the book, \"The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of its Enemies Since 9/11. \" Ron, thanks for coming on. Mr. RON SUSKIND (Author, \"The One Percent Doctrine\"): My pleasure. BURBANK: So the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this is something the 9/11 Commission found in relation to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, which is that he is a guy who kind of has seen himself as a quote \"super-terrorist,\" and have even heard him referred to as a sort of the Forrest Gump of terrorism. I mean, how reliable are these admissions from him, you think? Mr. SUSKIND: Well, you know, some certainly more than others. You know, he's always had a flair for self-aggrandizement and self-promotion, I think, better said. You know, he confessed to being the mastermind of so-called of the 9/11 attacks as far back as spring of 2002 to an Al-Jazeera reporter, and the fact is that was an admission that soon became a cause of little surprise to the United States. He was the operational commander of that disastrous day. In terms of so much of the rest of it, though, you know, there are many, many things he cites. The fact is it's like the CFO of General Motors claiming responsibility for thousands of actions that occur beneath him or her. So it's hard to know exactly how much he was involved in many of these things. BURBANK: There are just only so many hours in the day for him to be sort of managing all these different projects. These confessions, they came during a hearing that a lot of the detainees are getting, the question being, I guess, are these enemy combatants? And he didn't have a lawyer at this hearing. He had a personal representative. And he wasn't allowed to make phone calls to witnesses. I mean do you think these hearings actually sort of got to the truth of the matter? Mr. SUSKIND: Well, you know, it's hard to say what he may be saying differently now than what he was saying in interrogation. There are certain things I do know he said under interrogation, and frankly under torture, which I think everybody admits to - at least in some way, not the government officially, but folks in the know inside of CIA and elsewhere - is, you know, he did offer some valuable information. It's difficult to know whether now he's sort of arriving at his media moment a bit. Lots of these folks have a fairly highly evolved media sense. They read and watch and troll the Internet, and they Google themselves, if you will, getting a sense of whether they're popping up and, you know, whether they are at the center of discussions in South Asia or America or around the world. And I think that's one of the things that people will probably find as they get to know more about KSM. BURBANK: That was the interesting thing looking at the transcript of this hearing - through, you know, broken English and sort of meandering points, you get a sense for a guy who almost seemed at certain terms to be contrite; you know, he said he didn't want kill kids. And it was weird to see the sort of workings of this guy's mind because always just been a photograph of a guy with wild hair who was arrested in the middle of the night. Mr. SUSKIND: Right. You know, he is not an inconsequential character. He was tapped by al-Qaida and rose up the ranks because he is particularly good at complex organization and in commanding a kind of respect and control from subordinates. That's not easy. This is a bit of a motley band that ends up in various parts of this al-Qaida organization. And KSM was very effective in going from the planning stages, the talk stages, to execution. But you know, the fact is, is that there are many, many plans in the al-Qaida playbook, and I think that's part of what we're seeing here. They often take years to come to fruition. Certainly the 9/11 attacks were planned for years in advance, had been talked about, you know, well into the mid-'90s. And I think what you see here is just the kind of longitudinal patience that al-Qaida tends to exhibit. You know, we tend to think in news cycles. They think in decades or even centuries. BURBANK: One of the questions a lot of people have had too in terms of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, you know, admitting to these various plans is the question of torture and sort of what he was subjected to. And if you look at his statement before it's redacted, anyway, you can see him saying that - at least he alleges that some of his statements were made after he was treated pretty roughly. Do we have a sense for what he was subjected to and if that was kind of outside the bounds of what the military considers acceptable? Mr. SUSKIND: Yeah. Well, it's certainly outside of the bounds of what the military has since said is acceptable. At this point in 2003, when we finally picked up KSM, who really was the prize, that was the one we are looking for, you know, we more or less threw everything in the toolkit at him, you know, in terms of deprivations, you know, hot and cold, sleeplessness, some physical abuse. You know, he was, like a lot of the early captures or captives, a kind of guinea pig in terms of us stretching the boundaries to get what we needed at a time when we felt the clock was ticking. I think that time has passed a bit now. But at this juncture, certainly, when KSM got picked up and in the months after his capture, he faced pretty much everything we could come up with. BURBANK: Ron Suskind, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of \"The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11. \" Ron, thanks for coming on DAY to DAY. Mr. SUSKIND: Yeah. My pleasure. Take care.  LUKE BURBANK, host:  From the studios of NPR West, this is DAY TO DAY. I'm Luke Burbank.  MADELEINE BRAND, host:  I'm Madeleine Brand. Military desertions are less common today than during the Vietnam era. Coming up, we'll look up at what happened after one soldier went AWOL.  BURBANK: But first, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the Kuwaiti national suspected of being al-Qaida's number three, has confessed to planning the September 11th attacks. He spoke to a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba over the weekend. And the Pentagon has just released the transcript.  His admission to the 9/11 attacks was the big headline, but he also claimed partial or full responsibility for more than 30 other terror plots and attacks, and also reportedly the beheading of Daniel Pearl.  Here to talk with us about the confession is journalist and author Ron Suskind. He wrote the book, \"The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of its Enemies Since 9/11. \" Ron, thanks for coming on.  Mr. RON SUSKIND (Author, \"The One Percent Doctrine\"): My pleasure.  BURBANK: So the first thing that comes to mind when you hear this is something the 9/11 Commission found in relation to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, which is that he is a guy who kind of has seen himself as a quote \"super-terrorist,\" and have even heard him referred to as a sort of the Forrest Gump of terrorism. I mean, how reliable are these admissions from him, you think?  Mr. SUSKIND: Well, you know, some certainly more than others. You know, he's always had a flair for self-aggrandizement and self-promotion, I think, better said. You know, he confessed to being the mastermind of so-called of the 9/11 attacks as far back as spring of 2002 to an Al-Jazeera reporter, and the fact is that was an admission that soon became a cause of little surprise to the United States. He was the operational commander of that disastrous day.  In terms of so much of the rest of it, though, you know, there are many, many things he cites. The fact is it's like the CFO of General Motors claiming responsibility for thousands of actions that occur beneath him or her. So it's hard to know exactly how much he was involved in many of these things.  BURBANK: There are just only so many hours in the day for him to be sort of managing all these different projects. These confessions, they came during a hearing that a lot of the detainees are getting, the question being, I guess, are these enemy combatants? And he didn't have a lawyer at this hearing. He had a personal representative. And he wasn't allowed to make phone calls to witnesses. I mean do you think these hearings actually sort of got to the truth of the matter?  Mr. SUSKIND: Well, you know, it's hard to say what he may be saying differently now than what he was saying in interrogation. There are certain things I do know he said under interrogation, and frankly under torture, which I think everybody admits to - at least in some way, not the government officially, but folks in the know inside of CIA and elsewhere - is, you know, he did offer some valuable information. It's difficult to know whether now he's sort of arriving at his media moment a bit. Lots of these folks have a fairly highly evolved media sense.  They read and watch and troll the Internet, and they Google themselves, if you will, getting a sense of whether they're popping up and, you know, whether they are at the center of discussions in South Asia or America or around the world.  And I think that's one of the things that people will probably find as they get to know more about KSM.  BURBANK: That was the interesting thing looking at the transcript of this hearing - through, you know, broken English and sort of meandering points, you get a sense for a guy who almost seemed at certain terms to be contrite; you know, he said he didn't want kill kids.  And it was weird to see the sort of workings of this guy's mind because always just been a photograph of a guy with wild hair who was arrested in the middle of the night.  Mr. SUSKIND: Right. You know, he is not an inconsequential character. He was tapped by al-Qaida and rose up the ranks because he is particularly good at complex organization and in commanding a kind of respect and control from subordinates.  That's not easy. This is a bit of a motley band that ends up in various parts of this al-Qaida organization. And KSM was very effective in going from the planning stages, the talk stages, to execution.

Do we have a sense for what he was subjected to and if that was kind of outside the bounds of what the military considers acceptable?  Mr. SUSKIND: Yeah. Well, it's certainly outside of the bounds of what the military has since said is acceptable.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has been in custody for about four years. On Saturday, he told a closed-door military hearing at Guantanamo Bay that he planned the attack on September 11th and nearly 30 others. Those include the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the bombing of a nightclub in Bali in 2002. In the transcript, Mohammed detailed many plots that were never carried out, including plans to bomb other New York City landmarks and several in London as well. There were also assassination plots against former Presidents Carter and Clinton. Jack Cloonan joins us now to talk about this. He's a former FBI agent who was assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force for New York. Good morning. Mr. JACK CLOONAN (Former FBI Agent): Good morning. How are you? MONTAGNE: Fine, thanks. What do you make - let's begin with this - of this confession? Mr. CLOONAN: Well, I tell you, it seems like - that Khalid Sheikh has claimed responsibility for so much. I often wonder now if a lot of this isn't frankly exaggerated. Clearly we understood - we had him indicted as early as 1996 for his involvement in the plot to try to blow up the airlines in Manila, the so-called Bojinka plot, the plot to assassinate former President Clinton and the pope. These things we're very clear on. The rest of it I think at this point I'm a bit suspect of. But I think, irrespective of my view on this, I think that what I'm troubled about by this confession is that there's sort of a cloud hanging over the whole Khalid Sheikh Mohammed issue, if you will, and that is not the fact that he was captured in Pakistan and rendered to a location that we still don't know where it was, but now he's in Gitmo; I would like to have thought that he might have been sent back to the United States to stand trial in the 7th District of New York, where he could have been confronted with the evidence, and for all of us to see exactly what it is. MONTAGNE: Right. Mr. CLOONAN: Who he is frankly. And that's so important, I think. MONTAGNE: Well, there is some evidence, of course, to support his admissions, as you said, and it was laid out in this transcript. Were there any surprises that you saw here in these confessions? Mr. CLOONAN: No, none of this, it doesn't surprise me. Frankly, we know from other people that - from al-Qaida that they had done any number of possible surveillances. They did a lot of practical training, frankly, and he makes reference to the Sears Tower, he makes reference to the Empire State Building. All these things don't come as a surprise. I think, frankly, Renee, I think he's claiming a lot of responsibility for it because its his ego. He has an enormous ego. I don't think he was a very difficult guy to probably deal with. In the first instance, I did review, frankly, part of the videotape when he was first captured in Pakistan. And frankly, I don't think it was going to take much to get him to confess. So I'm suspect a little bit of what he's claiming now to be responsible for. MONTAGNE: Were you at all surprised by these admissions in the transcripts that he felt bad? I mean he's quoted as saying I'm not happy that 3,000 have been killed in America, and then kind of the language of war is victims. Mr. CLOONAN: Well, I think what you're hearing now is the transition from a man who went from a person who was dedicated to the radical notion of jihad, carrying out operations, to a guy who has made a transition from that, having been captured. He's gone through the psychological process of now accepting his fate. I mean, he probably realizes that he's going to be sentenced to death at some point. And I think that what you see now is that transition and the ultimate fact that he's facing reality and that he will be sentenced to death. I think that's what you hear coming out. MONTAGNE: And just finally, the hearing and release of this transcript - do you get a sense we've learned all there is to learn from Khalid Sheikh Mohammmed? Mr. CLOONAN: I don't know. The devil's always in the details. It's one thing to just say that I'm responsible for such and such, what you really have to be able to provide and I would feel much better about this so-called confession, is if he provides more details. He didn't do all this alone; he had confederates, he had associates. And that's what I need to hear. Who, what, when, where, why. MONTAGNE: Thank you very much. Mr. CLOONAN: You're welcome.

Do you hold Attorney General Gonzales responsible for that cloud? Sen. SESSIONS: You know, sometimes those events occur that cause - raise questions based on inadvertence or just error, forgivable error. Sometimes it can be more serious than that. I don't think we know that yet. I believe the attorney general will be forthcoming. He's got some questions he's got to answer. And this is a tough town. People are not very forgiving. And he's going to have to answer them clearly and in with - and convincingly. And I think he can, but we'll have to wait and see. SIEGEL: You say you think he can. At the moment, does he still enjoy your confidence as attorney general? Sen. SESSIONS: Well, he's always been a straight shooter to me, a decent person who I believe has tried to serve his country well. I'm convinced of that. I'm not joining the call for his resignation, but when a top official in the department is inaccurate in their testimony, we're going to have a look at it and that's just the way it is. And I hope that he'll be able to answer that convincingly, that there's no ethical or other mal-intent in misleading Congress. If he did, I think he will be out of there. SIEGEL: At the moment, from the contradictory explanations that have been given of the dismissals, and the e-mail that was published last night that still contradicts prior accounts - can you square that simply with a communications problem or innocent mismanagement, or do you suspect people were trying to get away with telling Congress less than Congress wanted to know? Sen. SESSIONS: Well, if they were, then people need to be sanctioned for it. Apparently the chief of staff to the attorney general, who is in the middle of most of this, his e-mails are most prominent, has already been - he's been booted or he resigned. So obviously there is some suggestion in that that he did not perform according to the highest standards of the Department of Justice. But I got to tell you, I have some sympathy for these people trying to serve in public office. Things are happening at random, a hundred decisions a day. People are in and out of their office discussing matters. It is easy to fail to communicate adequately or to remember adequately. So I think he deserves a real chance to explain what happened. SIEGEL: You're a former U. S. attorney from Southern Alabama. Sen. SESSIONS: Yeah. SIEGEL: When you read an e-mail from that chief of staff to the attorney general that says approvingly of some U. S. attorneys that they are loyal Bushies - those were his words - do you hear a hint in that language of more politicization of Justice Department prosecutors than is healthy? Sen. SESSIONS: Well, that's not a good philosophy to utilize, I think. You want people, and the president, any president, whether it's President Clinton or President Bush or anyone else, is entitled to United States attorneys who are loyal to his priorities. And they should be that. And if they fail to execute, as some did, some failed, I think, to follow aggressively the priorities of this United States Department of Justice, then I think it's time for a parting of the ways. United States attorneys are not entitled to keep their office for one day, much less indefinitely. So that's the fact about it. But I think it's not their politics.

That resolution supported a troop withdrawal from Iraq. Now with the funding bill that includes the withdrawal goal of next March, Senator Pryor says he wants the withdrawal deadline to be kept secret. Senator Pryor joins us from Capitol Hill. Senator, thanks for being with us. Senator MARK PRYOR (Democrat, Arkansas): Thank you. BLOCK: And why don't you explain your rationale behind this plan that would classify the timetable for withdrawal? Sen. PRYOR: Well, I actually support a timetable, but I just believe it should be classified. The concern I have is that if it's not classified, if it's a public timetable, it might actually do more harm than good to our troops down on the ground in Iraq. BLOCK: Well, who would know if it were classified? Who would know what the timetable was, and how would you try to keep it secret? Sen. PRYOR: Well, certainly the administration would know, the Pentagon would know, members of Congress would know, both Houses, and I assume, because of the working relationship with our military and Iraq's military and our civilian people in Iraq - civilian people - they might know or at least might have a sense of what that classified information may be. But like I said, I support a timetable. I think that that's something that this administration has been very reluctant to present to the Congress. So my proposal would be to require them to come to the Congress with a classified plan, and so far the White House has been very reluctant to do that. BLOCK: That sounds like a lot of people who would know the classified details of what this is. How confident are you that you would be able to keep it classified, keep it secret? Sen. PRYOR: Well, I'm confident. Congress, we handle classified information all the time. I'm on the Armed Services Committee. We all do have the credentials to sit through classified hearings and ask questions in a classified manner. BLOCK: And a lot of that information does leak? Sen. PRYOR: Well, if you - I mean, with all due respect, if you look at the leaks so far in the last couple of years, they haven't been coming from Congress. They have been coming from another branch of government. BLOCK: Well, if your proposal to classify the timetable, if that is not in the funding bill, will you vote for it? Will the Democrats have your vote? Sen. PRYOR: I will vote for the funding bill in the end because I support the troops and, you know, I don't want to hold hostage the equipment to a difference between the House and Senate and maybe the White House. So I'm going to support this in the end. BLOCK: When you say you worry that a public timetable for withdrawal would be damaging to troops on the ground, how would it be damaging? Sen. PRYOR: Well, I think that if - anytime you telegraph to the other side what you're going to do, I think that they can start to plan accordingly. What I think we should do and should have been doing over the last couple of years there is we should have been doing everything we can to turn more and more responsibility over to the Iraqi government and to the Iraqi people. But at the same time, in my view, a public timetable does not help circumstances on the ground in Iraq and it's probably not helpful for the future of Iraq. BLOCK: But at the same time, you would support the bill that would include that timetable, even though you have these concerns about being damaging to the troops. Sen. PYRON: Well, I do support the legislation overall because I believe we need to fund our troops there. I think we need the body armor, we need the armored Humvees, we need the ammunition. I don't want to be in a position where we're cutting funds to the troops while they're in the field. So I may lose this battle, may win this battle, but regardless of how this one particular issue works out, I am for, overall, the supplemental. BLOCK: How do you think this issue is playing back home? Sen. PYRON: People that I talked to in Arkansas, they've been fairly pleased overall with my position. I think if you ran an opinion poll in Arkansas, most people would want us out of Iraq. But you really can't base military decisions and strategic decisions based on opinion polls, because the situation in Iraq is much more complicated than what you can pick up on an opinion poll. I have a lot of people in the military in Arkansas who support me, a lot of National Guard, a lot of Reserve, a lot of active duty there. And I think to the person, everyone I've talked and every family I've talked to, they appreciate my position on this. BLOCK: Senator Pryor, thanks for being with us. Sen. PYRON: Thank you very, very much. BLOCK: That's Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor is one of the two Democrats who voted against the non-binding resolution earlier this month.  That resolution supported a troop withdrawal from Iraq. Now with the funding bill that includes the withdrawal goal of next March, Senator Pryor says he wants the withdrawal deadline to be kept secret. Senator Pryor joins us from Capitol Hill. Senator, thanks for being with us.  Senator MARK PRYOR (Democrat, Arkansas): Thank you.  BLOCK: And why don't you explain your rationale behind this plan that would classify the timetable for withdrawal?  Sen. PRYOR: Well, I actually support a timetable, but I just believe it should be classified. The concern I have is that if it's not classified, if it's a public timetable, it might actually do more harm than good to our troops down on the ground in Iraq.  BLOCK: Well, who would know if it were classified? Who would know what the timetable was, and how would you try to keep it secret?  Sen. PRYOR: Well, certainly the administration would know, the Pentagon would know, members of Congress would know, both Houses, and I assume, because of the working relationship with our military and Iraq's military and our civilian people in Iraq - civilian people - they might know or at least might have a sense of what that classified information may be. But like I said, I support a timetable. I think that that's something that this administration has been very reluctant to present to the Congress. So my proposal would be to require them to come to the Congress with a classified plan, and so far the White House has been very reluctant to do that.  BLOCK: That sounds like a lot of people who would know the classified details of what this is. How confident are you that you would be able to keep it classified, keep it secret?  Sen. PRYOR: Well, I'm confident. Congress, we handle classified information all the time. I'm on the Armed Services Committee. We all do have the credentials to sit through classified hearings and ask questions in a classified manner.  BLOCK: And a lot of that information does leak?  Sen. PRYOR: Well, if you - I mean, with all due respect, if you look at the leaks so far in the last couple of years, they haven't been coming from Congress. They have been coming from another branch of government.  BLOCK: Well, if your proposal to classify the timetable, if that is not in the funding bill, will you vote for it? Will the Democrats have your vote?  Sen. PRYOR: I will vote for the funding bill in the end because I support the troops and, you know, I don't want to hold hostage the equipment to a difference between the House and Senate and maybe the White House. So I'm going to support this in the end.  BLOCK: When you say you worry that a public timetable for withdrawal would be damaging to troops on the ground, how would it be damaging?  Sen.

The fresh cut grass of center field? There's still a chill in the air, but the sun's rays are strong. The promise and heartbreak - or if you're a Cub fan, the promised heartbreak - of yet another Major League Baseball season. Anything is possible as the 2007 season starts Sunday, at least for a few weeks. We're joined in our studios for a look ahead at the baseball season by our friend Howard Bryant, staff writer for the Washington Post and author of \"Juicing the Game. \" Howard, welcome back. Mr. HOWARD BRYANT (Washington Post): Good morning, Scott. SIMON: First of all, it's going to be harder than ever to watch games on television, isn't it? Mr. BRYANT: It's going to be virtually impossible to watch games on television if you don't have a satellite dish, thanks to the Direct TV/Major League Baseball exclusivity deal where baseball is essentially following the NFL with their Sunday Ticket. And all of the games this year out of market are going to be only on satellite instead of cable. So about - I think baseball estimated that 300,000 homes will not be able to watch the games. SIMON: Is this such a good deal economically, it's worth the sacrifice of audience? Mr. BRYANT: What baseball is doing is that they're trying to pressure the cable companies into making a better deal, because baseball is launching its own network in 2009. So what you have here is, you've got a leverage deal. You've got these two sides trying to force each other to make a favorable deal, and the person who loses, as always, is the consumer, because if you have cable, you can't watch a baseball game unless it's on ESPN or unless it's a game that's already in your market. And so once again baseball has really chosen more money over what's good for their fan base. SIMON: Look, you wrote the book on steroids in the game in \"Juicing. \" Is there joy in your heart as Barry Bonds approaches his record? Mr. BRAYNT: No, I think it's going to be very, very sad. And I think for most people outside of San Francisco it's going to be sad. And the commissioner hasn't committed to being there when Barry breaks the record, 21 to tie, 22 to pass. And I think what it is, I think the sadness isn't the fact that Barry Bonds can be a reprehensible character as much as it is that baseball had an opportunity to police itself on drugs and didn't do it, and now you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. It's too late. SIMON: Tom Glavine can set a rather happier mark, right? Mr. BRYANT: Ten wins to 300, and Randy Johnson eats 20 for 300. And I think that's that thing that's amazing in this era of offense and muscles and drugs and steroids and everything else. You're going to have four pitchers - Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Randy Johnson and Tom Glavine - all hitting the 300 win mark, which is really an amazing feat. SIMON: I have to ask about Lou Piniella and the Cubs. Mr. BRYANT: Oh, Lou, I love Lou. I saw Lou down in Arizona just a few weeks ago. And once again I talked to his predecessor, Dusty Baker, who was fired in the off-season. and these are the Cubs, a hundred years without winning, and. . . SIMON: Ninety-nine. Mr. BRYANT: I'm sorry. SIMON: Let's not exaggerate. Mr. BRYANT: Did I say 100? SIMON: Yes. Mr. BRYANT: They could do it this year. And you've got Lou coming in, and no-nonsense Lou, who's going to get tough with everybody. He wants these guys to play for him, and he's got the passion back after taking the year off. And so what happens to him, his two best pitchers, Pryer and Wood, neither one is going to start the season with the big club. And so once again, it's the curse of the Cubs. SIMON: Hey, Howard?

S. presidential race. The Republican field is growing. Former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson told ABC this week he's running. He called himself the reliable conservative. Another dark horse who comes with conservative credentials: Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo is expected to formally announce his candidacy tomorrow. Congressman Tancredo gained national prominence with his fierce opposition to allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens. We caught up with him this morning on the campaign trail in Waterloo, Iowa. Congressman Tancredo, you're best known for your tough stand on illegal immigration. You've even sparred with the White House on this issue. How will you be convincing voters that you're not just a one-issue candidate? Representative TOM TANCREDO (Republican, Colorado): Well, I have run into that quite a bit, of course, when people ask me about the issues, and there is that suggestion that I'm a one-trick pony, a one-issue candidate. And I always say, well, you know, at least I have an issue. And this issue happens to be really quite extraordinary in many ways because it - touches so many facets of American life. And, well, if you talk about education, if you talk about health care, if you talk about prison systems - all of these things are impacted, of course, by massive illegal immigration into the country. And then there is national fence-related issues in terms of the security of our borders. There is also the issue of the culture itself and whether or not we are being Balkanized. ELLIOTT: What about the issue that polls show as uppermost on voters' minds: Iraq? I understand you don't support the president's troop surge; do you support a timeline for withdrawal? Rep. TANCREDO: No. What happened is the president actually stated something of a similar nature in terms of a timeline. He said, by November, Iraq will be under control of the Iraqis. That was the benchmark he set. I hope that the pacification of Iraq is successful, that a government is able to take over by that time. I believe that that is exactly what should happen for us to be able to be successful in the bigger war that we are in, frankly, against radical Islam. I think that the present policy, our present configuration there, is wrong. ELLIOTT: What would you do? Rep. TANCREDO: Well, I would - the policy that I suggest or that I put forward is one that calls disengagement without withdrawal. We need to disengage; we cannot leave the country, however. We can't\u2026 ELLIOTT: How do you disengage without leaving the country? I don't understand. Rep. TANCREDO: You can do that. But in the end, of course, it relies heavily upon the Iraqi government being able to control the country. But we have to be in a position to respond to whatever might happen there that threatens our interests. ELLIOTT: I'd like to ask you a little bit about - I'm going to call it the Tancrazy, I think that's what Esquire called you one time. Rep. TANCREDO: Oh yeah. ELLIOTT: You are known for speaking your mind in a way that some might consider outrageous. You've compared Miami to a third world country. At one point, you suggested the U. S. should bomb Mecca in respond to terrorist attacks. You were even part of a group of Colorado lawmakers earlier in your career who called themselves The Crazies. Do you think that voters will be able to look at you as presidential material? Rep. TANCREDO: Well, first of all, when you said I called ourselves The Crazies, the - actually the press dubbed as that. (Soundbite of laughter) ELLIOTT: Oh, okay. Rep. TANCREDO: Because we were a group of people, very conservative, and we were trying our best to reduce taxes in that particular case - a crazy idea at the time in Colorado. However, we were successful in a number of ways in doing so, and it didn't seem to hurt my possibilities, that even at the time, I mean, I was reelected three times. I went on to win five elections for Congress in Colorado. People there know me and I think understand exactly what it is I'm trying to accomplish. And, yes, I say some outrageous things. It's probably true. And I say - and I have a controversial figure. But, you know, just saying outrageous things doesn't get you anywhere, and it's certainly not my purpose. My purpose is to say exactly what I feel and what I think about issues, and it's good to have a debate. It's healthy for the country to have debates on these subjects, I think.

He joins us now from his home state of Wisconsin. Senator, thank you so much for being with us. Senator RUSS FEINGOLD (Democrat, Wisconsin): Good to be on the show. NORRIS: And as we just heard, the president had harsh words for the efforts to tie the funding for the war to the withdrawal date in Iraq, and he said again that he will veto any bill put before him that actually does so. So what is your response to his comments today in the Rose Garden? Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, this is some of the worse conduct by a president I've ever seen. It's beyond stubborn. It's irrational. The American people spoke very clearly in November. They wanted this war over and the Congress has responded -Democrats and some republicans voting every time stronger and stronger provisions. Until last week, a majority of the senate said look, we have a binding provision that the war starts ending in 120 days and a goal of it finishing by the end of next March. And the president said he'd veto that. So he leaves us essentially with no choice if we want to end this war. We have to turn to our ability to say, look, by this date the funding for the war won't be available. We have to give enough time for the troops to be safely redeployed, but the idea that somehow the president can completely ignore the Congress is absurd. And we have to stand up to his views here. NORRIS: And as you know, there's a certain amount of finger pointing in Washington and some are saying that you and the senator are acting a bit stubborn as well. Why not work toward a compromise? Why send the administration a bill that you know full well is going to be vetoed? Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, the idea that somehow we should compromise for political reasons on something that affects the lives of so many American men and women who are in Iraq strikes me as just wrong. Our job is to end this war. This is exactly what the American people called for. What the president is doing here is saying something that I just can't believe. Here we are voting for the funding. Both the House and the Senate voted to provide the funding. We're just saying, however, you need to start ending the war. And he's saying, look, I should be able to get the funding and have my policy with no influence at all of the Congress. NORRIS: But just, you know, to look at this from the other side, is it possible to see this in another way. Because it is such an important issue, is it appropriate to play this kind of political chicken? Sen. FEINGOLD: There is no political chicken going on here. We have an absolute obligation to end this war. And for us to back down would be cowardice. For us to say, well, gee, the president's hurting us politically, so maybe we'll just keep this war going a little bit longer. That, to me, is utterly irresponsible. NORRIS: You're in your home district right now and you've been a strong and outspoken critic of the war. Are you hearing anything from your constituents that gives you pause at all? Are you hearing from constituents who are concerned that the troops might suffer if you do withhold funding? Sen. FEINGOLD: No, I'm hearing the opposite. I'm hearing people, please be as aggressive as you can, be even more aggressive in ending this war. They believe that it is this Bush administration that put our troops in danger and that obviously are continuing to endanger our troops by having them in a war that doesn't make any sense. NORRIS: The president today suggested that lawmakers return early from their spring vacations. He said come off vacation to get a bill to my desk. Any chance of that happening? Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, it would be fine with me. Whenever we want to take action, whenever the president wants to relent and talk in terms of trying to come together on this issue, I'm happy to do that. The fact is I'm out here listening to the people of my state and of this country. And that's what the president should be doing. He should be out hearing the facts that these aren't just Democrats or liberal Democrats, that there is a consensus against the view he is taking. NORRIS: Okay, if we look down the road a bit, two weeks from now, if the two branches are still in the same position, looking at each other, not moving closer at all, what happens then? Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, I'm sure one way or another we will be able to provide the funding that is absolutely necessary to continue what is going on right now. The question is whether we follow the will of the American people and start ending this war or whether we cave to the president's outrageous demand that this war just continue without a plan. NORRIS: Well, what will you do if you get beyond two weeks? I mean the Pentagon has said that they can continue operations through June, perhaps July, but it gets a little bit dicey beyond that. Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, I certainly hope the president recognizes that as the president of the United States and commander in chief he has a responsibility to sign legislation that would provide the funding for the troops. It will be on his hands if he doesn't. NORRIS: Senator Feingold, thank you so much for speaking with us. Sen. FEINGOLD: Thank you. NORRIS: That was Senator Russell Feingold. He's a Democrat from Wisconsin.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  Senator Russ Feingold is one of the sponsors of the bill that would cut off funding for the war. He joins us now from his home state of Wisconsin. Senator, thank you so much for being with us.  Senator RUSS FEINGOLD (Democrat, Wisconsin): Good to be on the show.  NORRIS: And as we just heard, the president had harsh words for the efforts to tie the funding for the war to the withdrawal date in Iraq, and he said again that he will veto any bill put before him that actually does so. So what is your response to his comments today in the Rose Garden?  Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, this is some of the worse conduct by a president I've ever seen. It's beyond stubborn. It's irrational. The American people spoke very clearly in November. They wanted this war over and the Congress has responded -Democrats and some republicans voting every time stronger and stronger provisions. Until last week, a majority of the senate said look, we have a binding provision that the war starts ending in 120 days and a goal of it finishing by the end of next March.  And the president said he'd veto that. So he leaves us essentially with no choice if we want to end this war. We have to turn to our ability to say, look, by this date the funding for the war won't be available. We have to give enough time for the troops to be safely redeployed, but the idea that somehow the president can completely ignore the Congress is absurd. And we have to stand up to his views here.  NORRIS: And as you know, there's a certain amount of finger pointing in Washington and some are saying that you and the senator are acting a bit stubborn as well. Why not work toward a compromise? Why send the administration a bill that you know full well is going to be vetoed?  Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, the idea that somehow we should compromise for political reasons on something that affects the lives of so many American men and women who are in Iraq strikes me as just wrong. Our job is to end this war. This is exactly what the American people called for.  What the president is doing here is saying something that I just can't believe. Here we are voting for the funding. Both the House and the Senate voted to provide the funding. We're just saying, however, you need to start ending the war. And he's saying, look, I should be able to get the funding and have my policy with no influence at all of the Congress.  NORRIS: But just, you know, to look at this from the other side, is it possible to see this in another way. Because it is such an important issue, is it appropriate to play this kind of political chicken?  Sen. FEINGOLD: There is no political chicken going on here. We have an absolute obligation to end this war. And for us to back down would be cowardice. For us to say, well, gee, the president's hurting us politically, so maybe we'll just keep this war going a little bit longer. That, to me, is utterly irresponsible.  NORRIS: You're in your home district right now and you've been a strong and outspoken critic of the war. Are you hearing anything from your constituents that gives you pause at all? Are you hearing from constituents who are concerned that the troops might suffer if you do withhold funding?  Sen. FEINGOLD: No, I'm hearing the opposite. I'm hearing people, please be as aggressive as you can, be even more aggressive in ending this war. They believe that it is this Bush administration that put our troops in danger and that obviously are continuing to endanger our troops by having them in a war that doesn't make any sense.  NORRIS: The president today suggested that lawmakers return early from their spring vacations. He said come off vacation to get a bill to my desk. Any chance of that happening?  Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, it would be fine with me. Whenever we want to take action, whenever the president wants to relent and talk in terms of trying to come together on this issue, I'm happy to do that. The fact is I'm out here listening to the people of my state and of this country. And that's what the president should be doing. He should be out hearing the facts that these aren't just Democrats or liberal Democrats, that there is a consensus against the view he is taking.  NORRIS: Okay, if we look down the road a bit, two weeks from now, if the two branches are still in the same position, looking at each other, not moving closer at all, what happens then?  Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, I'm sure one way or another we will be able to provide the funding that is absolutely necessary to continue what is going on right now. The question is whether we follow the will of the American people and start ending this war or whether we cave to the president's outrageous demand that this war just continue without a plan.  NORRIS: Well, what will you do if you get beyond two weeks? I mean the Pentagon has said that they can continue operations through June, perhaps July, but it gets a little bit dicey beyond that.  Sen. FEINGOLD: Well, I certainly hope the president recognizes that as the president of the United States and commander in chief he has a responsibility to sign legislation that would provide the funding for the troops. It will be on his hands if he doesn't.  NORRIS: Senator Feingold, thank you so much for speaking with us.  Sen. FEINGOLD: Thank you.  NORRIS: That was Senator Russell Feingold. He's a Democrat from Wisconsin. ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

BLOCK: And what do you want to hear from him when you do talk to him? Mr. SUMMERS: I just want to hear his voice, just can't wait to see him. BLOCK: How did you hear that Nathan was going to be released? Mr. SUMMERS: Well, actually, we was working yesterday and my manager's wife in Worth(ph) rang him to say they're going to free the Navy personnel, and that's the first I heard of that. So within about an hour after hearing it, you know, I was allowed to come home and face the media, basically.

Mr. SUMMERS: I honestly couldn't believe it's true until I actually came home and seen it on the, you know, on the news channels. BLOCK: This has been a two-week ordeal for you. I'm trying to imagine what those two weeks must have been like. Mr. SUMMERS: It's been very up and down, and sheer hell, to be perfectly honest.

Mr. SUMMERS: When they did the first showing of the captives, Nathan wasn't in the picture at all, and I was really worried then. But when he was actually showed on the TV making a statement, I mean, it was such a relief just to see how well he was looking.

He used to work in a pub called The Cornubia. We had a little party last night, which we're all worse for wear. We're just getting in practice for when he actually comes home. And there's banners, there's yellow ribbons tied outside the pub. And there's a massive big banner, which is up at the moment, it says: Welcome home, Nathan. In the pub, the landlord says these, put that up, just in case Nathan gets lost again. (Soundbite of laughter) BLOCK: And maybe just one or two drinks on the house, I'm guessing.

I'm Robert Siegel. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has completed a Middle East trip that included a meeting on Wednesday with the president of Syria and a trip yesterday to Saudi Arabia where she met with its unelected advisory council. We reached Speaker Pelosi in Portugal where she is on a stopover on the way home. Welcome to the program, Speaker Pelosi. Representative NANCY PELOSI (Democrat, California; Speaker of the House): A pleasure. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you. SIEGEL: You have been criticized not just by President Bush and Vice President Cheney for this trip, but even The Washington Post editorial page devotes an editorial called, Pratfall in Damascus, about your visit and talks with President Assad. Was this trip worth it? Rep. PELOSI: The trip was, very much. I - the facts of the trip are what we are bringing back now. It's a fact-finding trip. The purpose of our trip was to assess for advancing our own national security and fighting the war on terror, what the situation was on the ground in the Middle East. It was our purpose to come here to have a clear message to all of the countries that we're interested in peace in the Middle East, with Israel; to go to Damascus and say to President Assad the same message that President Bush has for him. While we may disagree on whether we should have a trip to Damascus, there's no division in our views and the case that we made to him. SIEGEL: Could you just sort out for us, though, the confusion over the message that you carried from Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, which - was it. . . Rep. PELOSI: There was no confusion. There was absolutely no confusion. The message that we carried from Prime Minister Olmert was the exact message that he gave us. He is a man of peace, and he expressed to us that we should express to the president of Syria his interest in going to the negotiating table, but not until Syria took steps to stop its support for Hamas and Hezbollah. And that is exactly the message that we conveyed. SIEGEL: But the prime minister of Israel's office issued a clarification, a denial, in effect, because according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the other day, the statement from the prime minister's office - from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office - said that Olmert had told Pelosi that Israel continued to regard Syria, quote, \"as part of the axis of evil and a party encouraging terrorism in the entire Middle East. \" If I heard you, you didn't - you don't recall him saying that in your conversation. Rep. PELOSI: No. What he told us was that - the thrust of his statement is that Israel is prepared to go to the negotiating table. We are not preparing for war - that was the important part of it - we are not preparing for war. We're prepared to go to negotiation when Syria takes steps to stop its support of Hamas and Hezbollah. SIEGEL: And you say that's what you told Syrian President Assad? Rep. PELOSI: Well, not only just I. Tom Lantos, Henry Waxman - two strong supporters of Israel who - we had made a very direct message to the president on that score. Actually, Prime Minister Olmert - his office is the one who put out the idea that we would be taking a message in the first place, because we had a meeting with the prime minister. We didn't go to the press and say what we did there, but their office put out the message that they had asked us to take this message to the Syrians. And whatever press they heard about the visit may not have been satisfactory to them, so they may want to clarify it for that purpose. But there was no clarification needed in terms of what (unintelligible) our message was. SIEGEL: Can you tell us, in Saudi Arabia, what did you hear from the Saudis about the House Democrats' preference and your preference for the U. S. to start withdrawing from Iraq next year? Rep. PELOSI: Well, we - in our meeting in Saudi Arabia, they're really more related to the purpose of our trip. Our trip was to be involved in what we disagree with the president on - we already did that here. What we went to the Middle East was to convey a message of the - but where we are in agreement with the president. So our differences are what we debated in the states. What we stand together on is what the message that we took, at the least. SIEGEL: But just to clarify, when you met with the Saudi monarch, you didn't talk about withdrawal from Iraq with him? Rep. PELOSI: In our general debate there and we had met with him for three hours. And from - certainly the issue of troops going in and out of Syria into Iraq is part of the concern we have with Syria, and we expressed that to him. In his response, he had some opinions about Iraq, but again, it was related to the subjects that we went there to talk to him about. And we had a wide range of subjects. We talked about Somalia. We talked about Darfur and we've spent most of our time talking about the Saudi Initiative for Middle East Peace, and how it is being received in the Arab world, and what prospect it was with the Israelis, who have obviously are the other most important part.

I'm Robert Siegel. Matthew Dowd was the chief strategist for President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. He was a Texas Democrat who had been impressed by Governor George Bush's talent for governing from the center, cooperating with Democrats. He switched parties and went to work for the Bush campaign. So the story in last Sunday's New York Times was big political news. Matthew Dowd had lost faith in George Bush and felt it was time to get out of Iraq. Mr. Dowd joins us now from Austin. Welcome to the program once again. Mr. MATTHEW DOWD (Former Consultant for President George W. Bush): Thank you, glad to be here. SIEGEL: What was it that disenchanted you with President Bush? Mr. DOWD: It wasn't one thing. I mean, when I joined him in '99 and 2000 and then did the re-elect in 2004, my hope and sort of my aspiration was that we could take the same things that were done in here in Texas, bridging divides with the Democratic lieutenant governor and the Democratic speaker here and working on behalf of the people of Texas. And as I looked at Washington and the polarization that existed in Washington, it was my hope and our hope that that would be done and could be done up there. And, you know, over time, things happened. And, you know, when you add it all up, that consensus building and bridging those divides and reaching across the aisle and trying to get things done just never happened. SIEGEL: When the president was asked about the New York Times story last week in a news conference this week, he said I respect Matthew, he was an integral part of my 2004 campaign. But then he said that you have a son in the Army who's awaiting deployment, and he said I understand his anguish over the war. I understand this is an emotional issue for Matthew, as it is for a lot of other people in our country. Is he right about that? Mr. DOWD: Yeah, he's right about all the facts that he laid out. But my conclusion on Iraq specifically, it's hard to say it has nothing to do with that, but there's much more involved in what I believe about decisions that have been made, especially related to Iraq, than have to do with the direct interest of my son. SIEGEL: There is, though, an inference that some drew from him saying it's an emotional issue for Matthew, that it's not an intellectual dissent. There's something more heartfelt or visceral at work here. Mr. DOWD: Well, it's interesting. I think all the best decisions we make are heartfelt, and so part of what's in my heart is obviously my son, but it has much more to do with the whole panorama of the issues involved in Iraq than just one single thing about my son. SIEGEL: When I interviewed you in 2004, during both conventions in fact, we talked about Iraq. During that campaign, Iraq for most Democrats was viewed as a discrete, separable conflict from the war against al-Qaida or the war against terror. For Republicans, it was the central front in a global war on terror. You linked Saddam Hussein to the war on terror. In 2004, did you believe it sincerely and do you believe it now? Mr. DOWD: Well, I've always tried to be one that whatever information I have and what I feel in my heart, I say it. And so I think like many Americans and like many leaders of both political parties, people that voted for the resolution, we all were under the sort of impression with the information presented that Saddam Hussein was involved in trying to, you know, build weapons of mass destruction and all those other things that could obviously impact the world on terror, we all - everybody thought that, the previous administration, this administration. But it turns out that wasn't true, and. . . SIEGEL: But by 2004 that was very much in dispute, and people had raised questions about vague Czech intelligence reports of a meeting in Prague between Mohamed Atta and somebody else. It was in debate. And to what degree was this a policy belief of yours, or were you the good professional partisan and your job was to make the case for the Bush campaign? Mr. DOWD: Well, I think you have to say it's a little bit of both. I didn't disbelieve at the time that the decisions that led up to that Iraq invasion were made up or were somehow nefarious. So I believed that the decisions that were reached at the time were the right ones at the time. Again, as it turned out, that turned out not to be the case. And it's also -I'm hired and I'm part of a campaign that I don't agree with every single thing the president did, even back in 2000 and 2004, but I have to say it's a little bit of both. I believed what we knew at the time. Even though as time went on and we learned differently, you know, it takes a bit for people to sort of go through this conversion process. SIEGEL: Well, part of that is breaking with what you said, is in effect saying I was wrong. But what would you say is right today? What should be the policy in Iraq? Mr. DOWD: In my view, and I'm not a military person, in my view we should pick from between one of two policies. We should either bring our - we should admit that it's a mess there and we need to get our soldiers home and the loss of blood is not going to accomplish anything, we should - anymore. We should either do that or we should do some wholesale change in the policy where we really - the idea that we're going to have a surge of 20,000 or 25,000 or something, if we really wanted to say we're going to really change what's going on there, it's going to take, you know, 100,000 or 200,000. The problem with that, I think, is that the American public just would not support that. And so in my view, where the public is today, they want to begin - they want us to begin withdrawal. And I think that 300 million Americans are smarter than a few people in Washington, and I trust the views of 300 million Americans more than a few people in Washington, D. C. SIEGEL: Just one other point I wanted to raise with you. It seems that President Bush in his - first in his commitment to defend Secretary Rumsfeld when there was a chorus of people from both parties and former generals suggesting that the secretary should go, and in his current treatment of Attorney General Gonzales's woes with the dismissal of the U. S. attorneys - the president seems to be remarkably loyal to the people whom he has brought into government, and personal loyalty seems to figure a great deal in this. Did the president's relationship and his sense of loyalty figure in your calculus of how to go about publicly breaking with him? Mr. DOWD: Obviously it figured into it, the loyalty that he has and the loyalty that we were, you know, all expected and some of us felt. Ultimately, that is the thing that I had to struggle with most, and I finally decided that really in our hearts or really who we are is we're not supposed to be loyal to a person or we're not supposed to be loyal to a party. We're supposed to be loyal to what truth we believe in ourselves and where our heart leads us. SIEGEL: Well, Matthew Dowd, thank you very much for talking with us today. Mr. DOWD: So glad to be here. Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: Matthew Dowd, former chief strategist for President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign, who has now broken with the president primarily but not exclusively over Iraq, spoke to us from Austin, Texas.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Robert Siegel.  Matthew Dowd was the chief strategist for President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. He was a Texas Democrat who had been impressed by Governor George Bush's talent for governing from the center, cooperating with Democrats. He switched parties and went to work for the Bush campaign.  So the story in last Sunday's New York Times was big political news. Matthew Dowd had lost faith in George Bush and felt it was time to get out of Iraq. Mr. Dowd joins us now from Austin. Welcome to the program once again.  Mr. MATTHEW DOWD (Former Consultant for President George W. Bush): Thank you, glad to be here.  SIEGEL: What was it that disenchanted you with President Bush?  Mr. DOWD: It wasn't one thing. I mean, when I joined him in '99 and 2000 and then did the re-elect in 2004, my hope and sort of my aspiration was that we could take the same things that were done in here in Texas, bridging divides with the Democratic lieutenant governor and the Democratic speaker here and working on behalf of the people of Texas. And as I looked at Washington and the polarization that existed in Washington, it was my hope and our hope that that would be done and could be done up there.  And, you know, over time, things happened. And, you know, when you add it all up, that consensus building and bridging those divides and reaching across the aisle and trying to get things done just never happened.  SIEGEL: When the president was asked about the New York Times story last week in a news conference this week, he said I respect Matthew, he was an integral part of my 2004 campaign. But then he said that you have a son in the Army who's awaiting deployment, and he said I understand his anguish over the war. I understand this is an emotional issue for Matthew, as it is for a lot of other people in our country. Is he right about that?  Mr. DOWD: Yeah, he's right about all the facts that he laid out. But my conclusion on Iraq specifically, it's hard to say it has nothing to do with that, but there's much more involved in what I believe about decisions that have been made, especially related to Iraq, than have to do with the direct interest of my son.  SIEGEL: There is, though, an inference that some drew from him saying it's an emotional issue for Matthew, that it's not an intellectual dissent. There's something more heartfelt or visceral at work here.  Mr. DOWD: Well, it's interesting. I think all the best decisions we make are heartfelt, and so part of what's in my heart is obviously my son, but it has much more to do with the whole panorama of the issues involved in Iraq than just one single thing about my son.  SIEGEL: When I interviewed you in 2004, during both conventions in fact, we talked about Iraq. During that campaign, Iraq for most Democrats was viewed as a discrete, separable conflict from the war against al-Qaida or the war against terror.  For Republicans, it was the central front in a global war on terror. You linked Saddam Hussein to the war on terror. In 2004, did you believe it sincerely and do you believe it now?  Mr. DOWD: Well, I've always tried to be one that whatever information I have and what I feel in my heart, I say it. And so I think like many Americans and like many leaders of both political parties, people that voted for the resolution, we all were under the sort of impression with the information presented that Saddam Hussein was involved in trying to, you know, build weapons of mass destruction and all those other things that could obviously impact the world on terror, we all - everybody thought that, the previous administration, this administration. But it turns out that wasn't true, and. . .  SIEGEL: But by 2004 that was very much in dispute, and people had raised questions about vague Czech intelligence reports of a meeting in Prague between Mohamed Atta and somebody else. It was in debate. And to what degree was this a policy belief of yours, or were you the good professional partisan and your job was to make the case for the Bush campaign?

I'm Debbie Elliott. A congressional delegation led by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi returned to Washington this afternoon from a Middle East tour, including a stop in Syria that drew sharp rebuke from the White House. A spokesman for the National Security Council said such visits have convinced the Syrian regime that, quote, \"its support of terrorists has no consequences. \" But it's not just Democrats out on diplomatic jaunts. Several Republicans have visited Syria in recent days - Congressman Darrell Issa of California, Robert Aderholt of Alabama, Frank Wolf of Virginia, and Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania. I spoke earlier with a member of Speaker Pelosi's delegation, Congressman Tom Lantos of California. He's chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Representative Lantos responded to the Bush administration's criticisms. Representative TOM LANTOS (Democrat, California): Our delegation was not a Democratic delegation. It was a bipartisan delegation. A highly respected senior Republican, David Hobson of Ohio, was co-chairman of our delegation. So the White House criticism of this visit is so pathetically hypocritical that one is at a loss for words. ELLIOTT: You know, Speaker Pelosi says your delegation delivered exactly the same message as the Bush administration has been delivering to Syria. Is there any danger here of sending mixed diplomatic signals when you have members of Congress who appear willing to engage with countries that the administration is not? Rep. LANTOS: Well, look, the administration is not omniscient. Maybe the administration's judgment is wrong on this issue. And I firmly believe that it is wrong. I would much prefer to have the administration engage in an active dialogue with Syria, as members of Congress do. But the fact that the administration is pursuing an ostrich policy should not lead Congress to do the same. ELLIOTT: Your delegation issued a statement saying that you strongly urge President Assad to control Syria's border with Iraq. You want him to stop the flow of foreign fighters who are a threat to both U. S. troops and Iraqis. Did President Assad acknowledge his country's role in Iraq, and with Hezbollah, and with Hamas? Rep. LANTOS: Well, the nature of the conversation was candid, and since it was a private discussion I don't think I want to go into details of who said what to whom. The only thing I am saying is that Speaker Pelosi represented bipartisan U. S. foreign policy interests magnificently. ELLIOTT: Your delegation presented the U. S. demands on Syria when it comes to its role in Lebanon, in Iraq, with Hamas. What did Syria indicate it would want in return from the U. S. in order to start to address some of these issues? Rep. LANTOS: Well, look. The Syrians are very anxious to have normal relations with the United States. They would like to see, obviously, our ambassador returned to Damascus. They would like to see restrictions on the sale of American products to Syria lifted. They would like to see a more normal, broad-gauge pattern of relations between our two countries. And we made it clear that the United States is not opposed to that goal. But Syria will have to take the necessary steps, which at the moment make the relationship so constrained and so difficult. By the way, we also demanded that Assad not stand in the way of the continuation of the Hariri assassination investigation. This was a very important point we made. ELLIOTT: You had stops in other countries as well as Syria - Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Israel. Overall, what do you think this congressional trip achieved? Rep. LANTOS: Well, you don't expect one single trip to change the face of the universe. It achieved a great deal. It presented to the Syrians, to the Saudis, to the Lebanese, to the Israelis and to the Palestinian Authority people the bipartisan foreign policy of the United States, in great detail with respect to the Middle East. It indicated our willingness to move towards improving relations on the assumption that each of these countries in its way moves towards our goals and objectives. I think on the scale of one to 10, the Pelosi-led visit was a 10. ELLIOTT: Congressman Tom Lantos, Democrat of California. Thank you for speaking with us. Rep. LANTOS: My pleasure.

Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. Not since a 1993 battle on the streets of Mogadishu has a senior American official visited that country, Somalia. Jendayi Frazer, the U. S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, made an unannounced visit to the Somalia city of Baidoa on Saturday. She was supporting that country's transitional government. A cease-fire between government troops and Islamic fighters is providing relative calm we're told, although the government has postponed a planned reconciliation conference. Ambassador Frazer is back in Washington and joins us to talk more about her trip. Good morning. Ms. JENDAYI FRAZER (Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, U. S. State Department): Good morning. INSKEEP: Well, how do you find the situation in Somalia? Ms. FRAZER: Well, I was in Baidoa, and it was quite quiet in Baidoa. I had an opportunity to meet with the leadership and civil society groups there, as well as the parliament. But everything was quiet on that front. INSKEEP: Which raises the next question of the less stable parts of the country. Do you think that progress is being made towards stabilizing the situation in places like Mogadishu? Ms. FRAZER: Yeah. Mogadishu is the place where there's violence and I think that much more progress needs to be made to stabilize it. I think the source of the violence is mainly started with insurgents associated with remnants of the Council of Islamic Courts and also include Hawiye clan militia. And I think that for the first it's going to be difficult to bring them into a reconciliation process, but for the second, the clan, it's going to be essential that they're brought into a reconciliation and political dialogues so that the violence can come to an end. INSKEEP: Why have the various troops in Mogadishu been unable to stop the violence? You've had African Union soldiers to some numbers anyway, you've had Ethiopian soldiers there, and things seem more violent than before they started moving in. Ms. FRAZER: Well, they have become more violent when you had mortar attacks by these, again, remnants of the Council of Islamic Courts who were firing mortars from neighborhoods, civilian neighborhoods, trying to attack Ethiopian forces in positions, attacking the Traditional Federal Government, for instance, the presidential villa, attacking the deployment of (Unintelligible) peacekeepers. When the government forces and Ethiopian forces fire back into those neighborhoods, that has outraged, I think, the Hawiye clan from the communities in which these terrorists are attacking. And so there's been a spiraling effect of violence, with one side killing civilians and the other side firing back and also killing civilians since these extremists are located in neighborhoods. INSKEEP: And forgive me for asking, if I can get an answer in about 10 seconds: Is the United States any closer to avoiding Somalia being a sanctuary for terrorists? Ms. FRAZER: Yes. I think that we're much closer to avoiding Somalia becoming a sanctuary. But I think that, you know, to be quite realistic, there are terrorists in many countries throughout Europe. And so it's going to be an ongoing effort. There's not going to be a moment in which we can declare victory that there are no terrorists in Somalia. Somalia had become a safe haven. Now it has the Transitional Federal Government with not complete authority across the country or even within Mogadishu. INSKEEP: Ambassador, thanks very much. Ms. FRAZER: Thank you very much.

Prof. LES BOURQUIN (Food Science, Michigan State University): Thank you. SIMON: And could - sir, could this have happened a can of pork and beans meant for human consumption? PROF. BOURQUIN: Well, there are situations where there are accidental contaminations of food ingredients intended for humans that occur around the world. One very good example that is kind of near and dear to the State of Michigan is a few decades ago where a fire retardant was accidentally incorporated into animal feed and ended up in PBB contamination of cow's milk that was consumed by essentially all citizens in Michigan back in the late '60s. These things do happen from time to time, and hopefully, you can learn from them and make sure that they don't happen again. SIMON: Is it possible, Mr. Bourquin, to absolutely guarantee food safety without making a potato cost $10? PROF. BOURQUIN: Well, there's no absolute guarantee that all the foods that are produced and traded in commerce are 100 percent safe. There's always going to be some risk. The key is to make sure that you are doing what you can to focus on the most significant hazards and conducting appropriate surveillance to make sure that all actors in the food industry are playing by the correct set of rules. SIMON: Mr. Bourquin, let me put you on the spot a little bit. When you go into a supermarket, is there something you just - as in really won't buy because you won't trust it? PROF. BOURQUIN: Actually, I'm probably not a good person to ask this question to because I tend to eat almost anything. I tend to be a risk-taker. I travel enough a lot in my work. So I do get exposed to a lot of things. I do a lot of work in India. I visited China a few times. SIMON: And what sort of advice do you give them about how to improve food safety for food that's going to be exported anywhere, or for that matter, consume locally? PROF. BOURQUIN: I'll just give you one example. One of the programs that we operate here in Michigan State is a program called Partnerships for Food Industry Development, focusing on helping small farmers who produce fruits and vegetables produce safe products that can be either marketed in their domestic markets or exported to other countries. Often times we have to focus particular attention on food hygiene issues, making certain that, for example, irrigation water or processing water is potable, is not a source of contamination; making sure that the chemicals that are used in productions are safe and approved around the world - really trying to bring them up to the level of the standards expected in international commerce.

SIMON: Is it possible, Mr. Bourquin, to absolutely guarantee food safety without making a potato cost $10?  PROF. BOURQUIN: Well, there's no absolute guarantee that all the foods that are produced and traded in commerce are 100 percent safe. There's always going to be some risk. The key is to make sure that you are doing what you can to focus on the most significant hazards and conducting appropriate surveillance to make sure that all actors in the food industry are playing by the correct set of rules.  SIMON: Mr. Bourquin, let me put you on the spot a little bit. When you go into a supermarket, is there something you just - as in really won't buy because you won't trust it?  PROF. BOURQUIN: Actually, I'm probably not a good person to ask this question to because I tend to eat almost anything. I tend to be a risk-taker. I travel enough a lot in my work. So I do get exposed to a lot of things. I do a lot of work in India. I visited China a few times.  SIMON: And what sort of advice do you give them about how to improve food safety for food that's going to be exported anywhere, or for that matter, consume locally?  PROF. BOURQUIN: I'll just give you one example. One of the programs that we operate here in Michigan State is a program called Partnerships for Food Industry Development, focusing on helping small farmers who produce fruits and vegetables produce safe products that can be either marketed in their domestic markets or exported to other countries.  Often times we have to focus particular attention on food hygiene issues, making certain that, for example, irrigation water or processing water is potable, is not a source of contamination; making sure that the chemicals that are used in productions are safe and approved around the world - really trying to bring them up to the level of the standards expected in international commerce.  SIMON: Mr. Bourquin, thank you very much for being with us.  PROF. BOURQUIN: Okay, thank you.  SIMON: Les Bourquin, an assistant professor of food science at Michigan State University.

But, as we all know, the race for the nomination is already well underway. The latest horserace polls show a lot of flux on the Republican side. The Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg poll has Senator John McCain, who used to be called the obvious frontrunner, in third place now, behind former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former senator and current actor Fred Thompson, who hasn't even entered the race. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is behind them, but doing well at fundraising. The Democratic field seems to be a little clearer. Clinton, Obama and then, John Edwards, followed by several other candidates. That same poll shows Senator Hillary Clinton in first place, about 10 points ahead of Senator Obama. But John Edwards' third place showing is strong. And psychologists say that who's in third place can have a strong effect on how somebody may choose number one. Shankar Vedantam wrote about what psychologists called this decoy effect in his Washington Post column. He joins us now. Mr. Vedantam, thanks so much for being with us. Mr. SHANKAR VEDANTAM (Columnist, Washington Post): Thanks so much for having me, Scott. SIMON: Before we get into politics, let's talk about how the decoy effect works in other, maybe, more mundane areas of life. You heard about, for example, a study by a marketing professor at Duke University who took a look at restaurant choices. Mr. VEDANTAM: That's right. Joel Huber, who's a marketing professor at Duke University, gave this example. I'm going to change his numbers a little bit just to make it easier for your listeners. Imagine you're choosing between two restaurants, one of them is a five-star restaurant that's five miles away, and the other is a three-star restaurant that's three miles away. Now if the better restaurant was also closer, there would be no dilemma at all. But as in many choices we have to make in life, we have to trade off, in this case, quality against convenience. Now what Huber did is he introduced a third option to a group of people. He said, what if you had a four-star restaurant that was six miles away? And when he presented that option, a lot of people said, well, the five-star restaurant that's five miles away is both better than and closer than the new third candidate, so it's probably the best restaurant of all. But when Huber presented a different group of people with a different third option, a two-star restaurant that was four miles away, now the three-star restaurant started looking a lot better on both quality and convenience, whereas the five-star restaurant was better than this new option only on quality. What's interesting about it is that the third candidate, in this case, the third restaurant, is always inferior to either one of the front-running candidates. And so in a rational world, you should assume that it would have no effect whatsoever on our decision, but it has a pretty big effect on which restaurant we end up choosing. SIMON: Let's chance nosing into politics with this. How could this ostensibly play out on either party? Mr. VEDANTAM: Well, politics is a little bit more complicated for several reasons. For one thing, you have often many more than just two or three candidates. Also, people are thinking not just of one or two dimensions such as quality and convenience, but they're thinking of dozens of different issues. You know, your position on the war in Iraq, your position on health care. Your position on taxes, and they're playing off all of these issues against one another in their heads. So it's a very complicated decision. But what the decoy effect suggests is that when you have two frontrunners, and as you pointed out, the Democratic field right now does have two frontrunners -Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The characteristics that people perceive John Edwards bringing to the race can subtly alter whether they think Obama or Clinton is the better candidate. SIMON: How could the qualities that Senator Edwards projects, in theory, affect how people wind up feeling about Senator Obama and Senator Clinton? Mr. VEDANTAM: Before I give the example, I should also mention that the decoy effect works only if you're an undecided voter. Let's say an undecided centrist, Democratic voter, and you like Clinton on the fact that she's strong on national security. But you also want somebody who's a fresh face in Washington, and you like Obama on that issue. So now let's say you have Edwards enter the race. And you see Edwards as more dovish than Obama on national security issues, but also part of the same establishment as Clinton. He was, after all, the vice-presidential candidate in the last election. So Obama now looks better than Edwards on both counts, whereas Clinton beats Edwards on only the national security issue. And if you configure Edwards differently in the mind of this undecided voter, Clinton could end up looking much better than Obama, which is why it could potentially stand to the advantage of both Clinton and Obama to draw attention to certain characteristics of Edwards but not to others. But politics is a volatile game and, you know, you talk up a third candidate too much, and the third candidate could stop being a third candidate and become a frontrunner. SIMON: And what about on the Republican side, any guesses? Mr. VEDANTAM: The Republican side is a little bit more confusing, I think, because it's changing so rapidly. So, I think, it's safe to say the decoy effect is probably playing a role, but how exactly, you know, I would be hesitant to make an assertion about that. SIMON: Do you think the decoy effect had any discernible outcome in the election of 2000? Mr. VEDANTAM: Well, you know, before I reported this column I would have said the presence of Nader in the race, you know, tipped the election to Bush, especially in Florida because some or many of those 9,000 votes of Nader would have gone to Gore if Nader had not been in the race. After reporting this column, I'm actually not entirely sure that that's true. I think it's possible that Nader did indeed take away some votes from Gore, people essentially who were to the left of Gore, who found Nader to be a more appealing candidate. But I think it's also possible that Nader ended up pulling some voters, who were undecided between Gore and Bush to the Gore camp. And the way I would think about this is, imagine a straight line where you have Gore on the left and Bush on the right. And let's say you have an undecided voter who is somewhere in the middle between Gore and Bush, and now you have Nader enter the race and Nader is to the left of Gore. And what essentially the presence of Nader does is it tips the overall scale, so that Gore feels like the better candidate among the three candidates that this voter is thinking about. And so it's possible that the presence of Nader in the race actually drew many voters to the Gore camp. Whether Nader ended up taking more votes away from Gore than he ended up giving to Gore, that I don't think anyone really can answer. SIMON: Mr. Vedantam, thanks so much. Mr. VEDANTAM: Thank you for having me, Scott. SIMON: Shankar Vedantam writes the Department of Human Behavior column for The Washington Post.

I'm Scott Simon. Coming up, contaminated food. It may not be limited to the cat's bowl. But first, there were many groups and individuals who expressed outrage at Don Imus this week. But the train of events that caused CBS and MSNBC to cancel his show may have begun with a researcher from Media Matters, a liberal advocacy group, who was monitoring Mr. Imus' show early Wednesday morning more than a week ago. That researcher recorded the radio host's characterization of the Rutgers Women's basketball team, posted the video to a Web site and alerted hundreds of journalists. Eric Burns is senior communications director for Media Matters and joins us in our studio. Mr. Burns, thanks very much for being with us. Mr. ERIC BURNS (Senior Communications Director, Media Matters for America): Oh, it's a pleasure. Thank you for having me, Scott. SIMON: What do you think made this story catch fire? Mr. BURNS: That's a great question, and one that we probably asked ourselves internally quite a bit because we do these items everyday and have been covering Don Imus and his history of bigoted language and racial slurs for a couple of years. I've had several journalists tell me that the fact that the target wasn't a politician or a public figure, but were a group of young women, who were student athletes and not political figures or media personalities, I think, showed how inappropriate that kind of language is, and there was a lot of outrage as a result. SIMON: So the difference might have been the story itself? Mr. BURNS: It might have been the story itself, but I tell you that we feel, in many sense, is that this is the type of coverage and the type of attention that should have been paid a long time ago to this type of language, which is not isolated. This type of language - racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic language - has become more and more commonplace on the radio and on cable news. SIMON: How do you monitor? What kind of operation is that? Is there one or two people in a vast room or. . . ? Mr. BURNS: No, no. It's a much larger organization than that. We've got over 50 people working at our Washington office. And it's a very intense and laborious process. Each morning, our researchers, our team of researchers come in, and they are listening to their appointed programs, be it a radio show, you know, Glenn Beck's \"Headline News\" broadcast from the evening before. And they're listening for conservative misinformation, for falsehoods, for omissions of important facts, for, you know, racist or sexist language. And then, once that is identified, there is a very stringent process that we go through as an organization to ensure accuracy and fairness in the way that we ultimately release research items on these incidents. SIMON: And we should make plain, you as an organization, have - you've taken your shots at NPR. Mr. BURNS: Yeah. I mean, we've gone after NPR. We've gone after the New York Times, the Washington Post. And - yeah, we try to monitor everybody, to the extent that we can. SIMON: We get your e-mails and you are in our spam filter. Mr. BURNS: And we work hard to get around that. (Soundbite of laughter) SIMON: Yeah, and you do, I must say. They tend to burst through there all the time. Curious about this. Don Imus isn't Rush Limbaugh, or Bill O'Reilly or Glenn Beck or Michael Savage. Don Imus has had politicians of both parties; certainly, a whole slew of journalists including, I think, a couple of NPR people. He has referred to Vice President Cheney as a war criminal, repeatedly. This is not somebody we would ordinarily think would be in your sights. Mr. BURNS: We think that everybody is going to be held to a high standard, in the same standard. And I think you're touching on a very interesting point because, you know, when you talk about Glenn Beck, or Bill O'Reilly, or Rush Limbaugh, for so many years, a lot of these folks weren't held to the same standards as Brian Williams or Tom Brokaw.

I'm Jacki Lyden. Debbie Elliott is away. It may be the most obvious statement to come out of the mouth of a Washington official recently: In hindsight, I would have handled this differently. These were the words of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales today reflecting on his department's dismissal of eight U. S. attorneys. His statement is part of written testimony Gonzales is submitting to Congress. He's scheduled to appear at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. NPR's Ari Shapiro is here to walk us through what the attorney general is prepared to say. Hi, Ari. ARI SHAPIRO: Hi, Jacki. LYDEN: What's in the written testimony, and why did he release it today? SHAPIRO: Well, a lot of it is a big apology. He released it today to get ahead of this big hearing that everybody is looking forward on Tuesday. And at least, the apology part of the testimony has an apology to the U. S. attorneys and their families. He calls this an unfortunate, an undignified public spectacle. He apologizes that he didn't do more personally to ensure that the review of the U. S. attorneys was more rigorous, that each U. S. attorney was informed in a more personal and respectful way of the dismissals. And he also apologizes for what he calls misstatements about the firings. Like, a lot of people have focused in on his March 13th statement, where he said: I was not involved in any discussions about what was going on. Well, we now, of course, know that he was involved in discussions. And he says he didn't try to mislead anyone, but he just should have been more precise. LYDEN: I did read the attorney general's long op-ed in The Washington Post today, and one thing hasn't changed: he still dissents the decision to dismiss the eight U. S. attorneys. SHAPIRO: Right. He said there's no wrongdoing here. He says no one was fired for improper reasons. The quote from his testimony is: I did not and would not ask for a resignation of any individual in order to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan, political gain. I also have no basis to believe, he says, that anyone involved in this process sought the removal of a U. S. attorney for an improper reason. But, you know, the way he describes his involvement in the process is really a bird's eye view sort of thing. So some lawmakers are not satisfied that the fact that he was unaware of any improper political influences means that, in fact, there were no improper political influences. LYDEN: This being Sunday, I'm sure they took their case to the talk shows. What are they saying? SHAPIRO: Well, they're pretty skeptical. Senator Charles Schumer of New York, a Democrat, has been leading the subcommittee that's headed up this investigation, and he said the statement doesn't advance the attorney general's cause at all. His quote was, \"not a single important question we have asked is answered in his opening statement. \" He points out that the attorney general, sort of, points his finger at his former chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, but Sampson has said that he wasn't the decision maker. He was just the record keeper. And Republicans are also cautious at best. Senator Arlen Specter, the top Republican on the committee that Gonzales is going to be testifying in front of, said that the attorney general has a steep hill to climb, and he even urged Gonzales to consider reinstating the eight U. S. attorneys. LYDEN: We mentioned how important this is on Tuesday. Is it a make-or-break day for Alberto Gonzales? SHAPIRO: Yeah, this could be his last, best chance to convince Congress that he deserves to keep his job. We have had a number of members of Congress from both parties calling on him to resign. At the end of the day, he serves at the pleasure of the president. And Vice President Cheney was on the Sunday talk shows. He told CBS this morning that the president has faith in Gonzales, but he said Gonzales pretty much needs to clean up this mess, go to Capitol Hill and explain what went wrong and how he's going to fix. LYDEN: NPR's Ari Shapiro, thanks very much. SHAPIRO: You're welcome.  JACKI LYDEN, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Jacki Lyden. Debbie Elliott is away.

LYDEN: I did read the attorney general's long op-ed in The Washington Post today, and one thing hasn't changed: he still dissents the decision to dismiss the eight U. S. attorneys.  SHAPIRO: Right. He said there's no wrongdoing here. He says no one was fired for improper reasons. The quote from his testimony is: I did not and would not ask for a resignation of any individual in order to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan, political gain. I also have no basis to believe, he says, that anyone involved in this process sought the removal of a U. S. attorney for an improper reason.  But, you know, the way he describes his involvement in the process is really a bird's eye view sort of thing. So some lawmakers are not satisfied that the fact that he was unaware of any improper political influences means that, in fact, there were no improper political influences.  LYDEN: This being Sunday, I'm sure they took their case to the talk shows. What are they saying?  SHAPIRO: Well, they're pretty skeptical. Senator Charles Schumer of New York, a Democrat, has been leading the subcommittee that's headed up this investigation, and he said the statement doesn't advance the attorney general's cause at all. His quote was, \"not a single important question we have asked is answered in his opening statement. \" He points out that the attorney general, sort of, points his finger at his former chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, but Sampson has said that he wasn't the decision maker. He was just the record keeper.  And Republicans are also cautious at best. Senator Arlen Specter, the top Republican on the committee that Gonzales is going to be testifying in front of, said that the attorney general has a steep hill to climb, and he even urged Gonzales to consider reinstating the eight U. S. attorneys.  LYDEN: We mentioned how important this is on Tuesday. Is it a make-or-break day for Alberto Gonzales?  SHAPIRO: Yeah, this could be his last, best chance to convince Congress that he deserves to keep his job. We have had a number of members of Congress from both parties calling on him to resign. At the end of the day, he serves at the pleasure of the president. And Vice President Cheney was on the Sunday talk shows. He told CBS this morning that the president has faith in Gonzales, but he said Gonzales pretty much needs to clean up this mess, go to Capitol Hill and explain what went wrong and how he's going to fix.  LYDEN: NPR's Ari Shapiro, thanks very much.  SHAPIRO: You're welcome. ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

This past week, residents of the nation's capital won a victory in their battle for representation in Congress. To this day, Washington's half a million-plus residents have only a single non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. By Thursday, the House passed a bill that would give the district its first full seat in Congress. The District of Columbia, of course, is not a state or part of a state. And the bill's Republican opponents cite Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution, which declares that members of the House should be chosen, quote, \"by the people of the several states. \" Thursday's House debate was heated especially when California Republican David Dreier tried to interrupt the D. C. delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton. Representative ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (Democrat, District of Columbia): I will not yield, sir. The District of Columbia has spent 206 years yielding to people who would deny them the vote. I yield you no ground. Not during my time. Representative DAVID DREIER (Republican, California): I haven't yielded you (unintelligible). Rep. NORTON: You have had your say, and your say has been that you think that people who live in your capital are not entitled to a vote in their House. Shame on you. ELLIOTT: And Representative Norton joins me in the studio now. Welcome to the program. Rep. NORTON: Oh, glad to be here. ELLIOTT: That was a very passionate speech you made on Thursday. How long have you been working to get D. C. a vote in the Congress? Rep. NORTON: Well, I've been in the Congress for 16 years and I've worked to get the district democracy by whatever means necessary, to have a statehood. I've had a bill for a vote in the House and the Senate. And this is a bill, a minimalist bill, actually, for a vote only in the people's House, which is all we can get at this time. Shame on us, but that's all we can get. After 206 years we'll take it. ELLIOTT: You know, a federal district court in D. C. has ruled on this issue and said that the Constitution makes clear, quoting now, \"how deeply constitutional representation is tied to the structure of statehood. \" How do you get around this argument from your opponents that this bill is unconstitutional? Rep. NORTON: Well, the courts have not, in fact, ruled on this specific bill. This bill is about a House vote only. And we get around it because the Congress and the Supreme Court itself has, quote, \"gotten around it. \" The district has been ruled, has been understood to be a state for virtually all purposes - for treaties, for the presidia of verse(ph), diction(ph). The full understanding of what the frameworks(ph) were about was not to deprive the people, any people. These were the people who vote, who made a revolution for representation. The full understanding was that they didn't want the district to be in a state so they made it the District of Columbia. And, in fact, assumed and in the words of the Constitution and the first Congress that wants those who lived here and understand where they live before, they were then residents in Maryland or Virginia. Signers of the Constitution for Maryland and Virginia contributed the land. Think about it. Would they have contributed the land to form the District of Columbia where their residents were then residing, if in fact they were agreeing to deprive them of the vote right after they had staged a revolution for representation? Hardly. And we've had very conservative constitutional scholars. For example, former Court of Appeals Judge Kenneth Starr to testify the bill is constitutional. Viet Dihn, Professor Viet Dihn, President Bush's former point man, assistant attorney general for constitutional matters in the Ashcroft Justice Department. I think we're on very solid footing. ELLIOTT: So you'd like to see this get through and if it ends up in the courts, let that court decide this issue. Rep. NORTON: Virtually every bill ends up in the court in one form or fashion. So we're not afraid of a court suit. ELLIOTT: You know, now in order to win passage of your bill in the House, you had to make a little bit of a political deal with the Republicans because they were concerned that a largely Democratic city would be gaining a seat, so you offered you another seat to the State of Utah, which is a Republican state. Rep. NORTON: My good friend Tom Davis, a Republican, is the co-sponsor of this bill, and it was his idea to bring a Republican state along. And he brought the most Republican state in the union and that was the state that will particularly agree. Because they believe that they should have gotten an extra seat in the last census because we had - they had some missionaries out of state who weren't counted. And as Governor Jon Huntsman said when he came to testify: Look, we feel aggrieved for 10 years. We can't imagine what it must be like for the District of Columbia to be without a vote for 200 years. ELLIOTT: Well, now this is moving on to the U. S. Senate where vote counters have said you have an obstacle there. That it's unlikely that the Senate would pass this. And even if the Senate does pass it, President Bush has said he would veto the legislation. What would be your backup plan? MS. NORTON: Well, not to worry. First of all, we're going to make it. The reason we're going to make it is because we have two Republican Utah senators who know that the people of Utah desperately want this seat five years ahead when they made all the words(ph) (unintelligible) because all kinds of benefits comes the state by getting a new seat. And moreover, it should be easier than it's been on the House because the tradition of the Senate is that if a matter affects only one state, it doesn't cost any money, this kind of bill is passed by senatorial courtesy. ELLIOTT: Why has this been so hard to achieve? MS. NORTON: It's been hard to achieve for reasons having to do with proprietorship, in the sense that, you know, this somehow was the possession of the Congress. To frankly raise, the city had a large African-American population in the 19th century. It was a majority black until the late 1950s. But I have quoted from Alabama senator who said the only way now to keep these people - these Negroes from getting the voters to deny, and to quote him, \"every single human being who lives in the district the vote. \" Today, of course, it has more to do with politics than anything else. ELLIOTT: Well, NPR is not the only broadcaster that seems interested in covering this D. C. voting rights issue. I saw you recently on the comedy channel on \"The Colbert Report\" talking about this. Let's listen to it a little bit. (Soundbite of \"The Colbert Report\" episode) Mr. STEPHEN COLBERT (Host, \"The Colbert Report\"): I am going to nail you here. I checked your voting record. You have not voted once while you've been in office. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. COLBERT: You want to defend that? MS. NORTON: Yes. I think now I'm going to be on Colbert for the fourth time coming up. And you know what? Colbert has done more than any single human being to let our citizens in this country know that we don't have voting rights. If 82 percent say we should have voting rights, that same poll says something close to 75 percent thought we already had it. That's the most frustrating, particularly when we have young men report in every war including the war that established the republic, that's why our license plates say, taxation without representation, because we're the last place left with taxation without representation. ELLIOTT: Eleanor Holmes Norton is the Washington, D. C. , delegate to the House of Representatives. Thank you for coming in. Ms. NORTON: My pleasure.

And, of course, many of Baghdad's children have been injured and killed. We all assume that many of these children are being harmed by war even if they are not injured. But a survey conducted by the Iraq Ministry of Health documents that damage. About 2,500 children, chosen randomly from the middle-income part of north Baghdad, participated in the survey.

When we spoke with him this week from Baghdad, he explained that these children were asked a standard set of 10 questions based on an international questionnaire used to determine stress levels. Dr. MOHAMMED AL-ABOUDI (National Mental Health Adviser, Iraq): We asked about difficulty in speech and reading difficulties. Well had they decline in school performance (unintelligible).

WERTHEIMER: From the children's answers to those questions, Dr. al-Aboudi and his colleagues determined that 70 percent of the children surveyed currently suffer from stress and trauma due to their exposure to the Iraq war.

But in a country ravaged by war without reliable basic services like electricity and clean water, psychological counseling is a near impossibility. Dr. AL-ABOUDI: You know, even the past regime, these services were neglected, I mean, the social workers in the schools.

Reid also said: winning this war is no longer the job of the American military. Since Senator Reid says the president is in a state of denial when he sees progress in Iraq, I asked him what sees. Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada; Senate Majority Leader): I see statistics that come out, showing that in the three months since the so-called escalation or surge has taken place, things are getting a lot worse, not better. We're at a rate of killing four Americans a day. We're wounding thousands - as you know, where 27,000 now or so have been wounded in that war - a third of them grievously wounded with missing limbs. We have 2,000 double amputees from that war. It's like a balloon you squeeze. Things have maybe calmed down a little bit in Baghdad, but it's just squeezed out in other areas. Today, there has been violence in the Kurdish area, which we haven't seen before, a couple of dozen people killed up there in one bomb blast. So the president simply is headed in the wrong direction, which is the same direction he's been going for four-plus years and then some more. We've got to change direction. BLOCK: Now, you're going to be meeting this week with the commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus. If he tells you - as he has said before - that he sees progress with the increase in U. S. troops and that he needs more time, what will you tell him? Sen. REID: We'll tell him to show me the facts. I know General Petraeus, and he's obviously very smart. But he's got a very, very tough job over there. And I think it's going to be hard to make the case that things are going to get better to the American people. BLOCK: Would you be undercutting the mission, though, that he came in pledging to put into effect? And you, in fact, voted for his confirmation. All Democrats who voted unanimously confirmed him as the general there. Sen. REID: All you have to do is go back and quote what General Petraeus said: \"The war cannot be won militarily. \" He said 20 percent of the war is military, the other 80 percent is political, diplomatic and economic. BLOCK: Senator Reid, last week, you told reporters, I believe that this war is lost - words that drew a lot of criticism from many quarters. And you didn't repeat those words in your speech today. Do you still believe that the war in Iraq is lost? Sen. REID: I have been saying for several months now that we must change course. We can all talk about a choice of words. But I go back to what General Petraeus said, and that's what I was talking about last Thursday. I and the Democrats have supported the troops without any question. We're the first one to call for more body armor, for up arming in Humvees. In the supplemental appropriation bill, we've put in this bill $4. 3 billion for something the president should have thought about a long time ago in putting the bill, and that is military medicine, support for the veterans when they come home. So we're supporting the troops. The president needs to change the course of the war in Iraq. It's not working. BLOCK: Let's talk about the bill that Congress will send to the president this week. You said today that it will include a date of October 1st of this year for the start of a troop withdrawal, and then a goal of a complete pullout by April 1st of next year. You're going to be running smack into a promised presidential veto that you don't have the votes to override. So what happens, then, after that veto comes? Sen. REID: Oh, I would hope the president and his folks would read what we've put in this legislation. It's fair. It's reasonable. It takes care of the troops. It gives us every possibility of being able to win in Iraq to establish that fledging democracy in a permanent basis. If he vetoes this, I would hope the president will sit down and talk to us. One of the things the president has to realize - he hasn't had to realize the past six years - there is another branch of government called the legislative branch of government, the Congress. And for six years, he hasn't had to worry about it because he's had a big rubber stamp up here that the Republican-dominated Congress are giving him everything he wants. We're not going to do that. BLOCK: Well, he has had no timetable, though, so I guess what I'm wondering is how you will get to something that the president will sign that will fund these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sen. REID: Well, I've been involved in the legislative process of the government for a long time, and these arrangements can be made here. Legislation is the art of compromise. The president needs to understand that also. BLOCK: Would it maybe mean that you draw up a timetable and keep in the idea of benchmarks for the Iraqi government, and that might be something that Democrats could sign on to? Sen. REID: I'm not negotiating with you, but I will be able and willing to negotiate with the president. BLOCK: Do you run the risk, though, of losing Democrats if you end up with a bill that is too watered down, Democrats who would've wanted something stronger? Sen. REID: Well, we always lose - I guess a better way to say this is: It's always very hard -to hang onto people you got one time when you move the ball. But that's part of our job. That's what legislators do. So we're going to have to come up with something that is in keeping with our efforts to make sure the troops get everything they need, that there is hope for success in Iraq, and that changes direction because unless we change direction, that is not accomplishable. BLOCK: Senator Reid, you talked about the need for compromise on both sides here. But you did deliver a speech today that was very sharply critical of this administration. I wonder, in terms of setting a tone, if the tone for compromise is being set now in Washington. (Soundbite of laughter) Sen. REID: Well, I only focused on the Iraq War. You know, we could talk about other things, about this administration that I think is a little awry. We could talk about Gonzales and Medicare and Leave No Child Behind. But I only focused on Iraq. So this administration has not been good for the American people and there was no reason for me to go into this speech that I gave today, thinking it's all an easy task. I said that it's a long road. He has dug a deep hole for us, and we'll work with him to get us out of the hole. His continually digging it deeper is not helping. BLOCK: Senator Reid, thanks for talking with us. Sen. REID: You bet. BLOCK: Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, is the Senate majority leader.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  In his speech today criticizing the president's Iraq policy, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said: our president is wrong and the new Congress will show him the way. Reid also said: winning this war is no longer the job of the American military.  Since Senator Reid says the president is in a state of denial when he sees progress in Iraq, I asked him what sees.  Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada; Senate Majority Leader): I see statistics that come out, showing that in the three months since the so-called escalation or surge has taken place, things are getting a lot worse, not better. We're at a rate of killing four Americans a day. We're wounding thousands - as you know, where 27,000 now or so have been wounded in that war - a third of them grievously wounded with missing limbs. We have 2,000 double amputees from that war. It's like a balloon you squeeze.  Things have maybe calmed down a little bit in Baghdad, but it's just squeezed out in other areas. Today, there has been violence in the Kurdish area, which we haven't seen before, a couple of dozen people killed up there in one bomb blast. So the president simply is headed in the wrong direction, which is the same direction he's been going for four-plus years and then some more. We've got to change direction.  BLOCK: Now, you're going to be meeting this week with the commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus. If he tells you - as he has said before - that he sees progress with the increase in U. S. troops and that he needs more time, what will you tell him?  Sen. REID: We'll tell him to show me the facts. I know General Petraeus, and he's obviously very smart. But he's got a very, very tough job over there. And I think it's going to be hard to make the case that things are going to get better to the American people.  BLOCK: Would you be undercutting the mission, though, that he came in pledging to put into effect? And you, in fact, voted for his confirmation. All Democrats who voted unanimously confirmed him as the general there.  Sen. REID: All you have to do is go back and quote what General Petraeus said: \"The war cannot be won militarily. \" He said 20 percent of the war is military, the other 80 percent is political, diplomatic and economic.  BLOCK: Senator Reid, last week, you told reporters, I believe that this war is lost - words that drew a lot of criticism from many quarters. And you didn't repeat those words in your speech today. Do you still believe that the war in Iraq is lost?  Sen. REID: I have been saying for several months now that we must change course. We can all talk about a choice of words. But I go back to what General Petraeus said, and that's what I was talking about last Thursday. I and the Democrats have supported the troops without any question. We're the first one to call for more body armor, for up arming in Humvees. In the supplemental appropriation bill, we've put in this bill $4. 3 billion for something the president should have thought about a long time ago in putting the bill, and that is military medicine, support for the veterans when they come home.  So we're supporting the troops. The president needs to change the course of the war in Iraq. It's not working.  BLOCK: Let's talk about the bill that Congress will send to the president this week. You said today that it will include a date of October 1st of this year for the start of a troop withdrawal, and then a goal of a complete pullout by April 1st of next year. You're going to be running smack into a promised presidential veto that you don't have the votes to override. So what happens, then, after that veto comes?  Sen. REID: Oh, I would hope the president and his folks would read what we've put in this legislation. It's fair. It's reasonable. It takes care of the troops. It gives us every possibility of being able to win in Iraq to establish that fledging democracy in a permanent basis. If he vetoes this, I would hope the president will sit down and talk to us.  One of the things the president has to realize - he hasn't had to realize the past six years - there is another branch of government called the legislative branch of government, the Congress. And for six years, he hasn't had to worry about it because he's had a big rubber stamp up here that the Republican-dominated Congress are giving him everything he wants. We're not going to do that.  BLOCK: Well, he has had no timetable, though, so I guess what I'm wondering is how you will get to something that the president will sign that will fund these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Sen. REID: Well, I've been involved in the legislative process of the government for a long time, and these arrangements can be made here. Legislation is the art of compromise. The president needs to understand that also.  BLOCK: Would it maybe mean that you draw up a timetable and keep in the idea of benchmarks for the Iraqi government, and that might be something that Democrats could sign on to?  Sen. REID: I'm not negotiating with you, but I will be able and willing to negotiate with the president.  BLOCK: Do you run the risk, though, of losing Democrats if you end up with a bill that is too watered down, Democrats who would've wanted something stronger?  Sen. REID: Well, we always lose - I guess a better way to say this is: It's always very hard -to hang onto people you got one time when you move the ball. But that's part of our job. That's what legislators do. So we're going to have to come up with something that is in keeping with our efforts to make sure the troops get everything they need, that there is hope for success in Iraq, and that changes direction because unless we change direction, that is not accomplishable.  BLOCK: Senator Reid, you talked about the need for compromise on both sides here. But you did deliver a speech today that was very sharply critical of this administration. I wonder, in terms of setting a tone, if the tone for compromise is being set now in Washington.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Sen. REID: Well, I only focused on the Iraq War. You know, we could talk about other things, about this administration that I think is a little awry. We could talk about Gonzales and Medicare and Leave No Child Behind. But I only focused on Iraq. So this administration has not been good for the American people and there was no reason for me to go into this speech that I gave today, thinking it's all an easy task.  I said that it's a long road. He has dug a deep hole for us, and we'll work with him to get us out of the hole. His continually digging it deeper is not helping.  BLOCK: Senator Reid, thanks for talking with us.  Sen. REID: You bet.  BLOCK: Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, is the Senate majority leader.

Welcome to the program. Senator MITCH McCONNELL (Republican, Kentucky; Senate Minority Leader): Glad to be with you. SIEGEL: We now have a spending bill with conditions and a veto to come, what role can you play next in this process? Sen. McCONNELL: Well, obviously, the veto is going to be sustained, and then we'll have to get serious about providing funding for the troops. The surrender date needs to come out. The pork needs to come out, and we need to send the president a bill he can sign. And I'm optimistic that that will be done relatively soon. I've had good preliminary conversations with Senator Reid about the next round. And I'm hoping that we can reach an agreement that's satisfactory to all of the parties. SIEGEL: Would an agreement satisfactory to all of the parties have to include some sort of language about, say, reporting from the White House to the Senate on how well certain milestones are being reached in Iraq. Sen. McCONNELL: Well, I think so-called benchmarks or something that both sides are open to - even General Petraeus earlier this year said depending upon how its - such benchmarks might be worded, it could potentially even be helpful to him. So I think there's a possibility for bipartisan agreement on some kind of benchmarks. What is unacceptable is any kind of surrender date, any kind of date that indicates to the terrorists on the other side - if you could just hang on until this particular day, you get to win. SIEGEL: Surrender date, we should say, is your characterization of the withdrawal date that the. . . Sen. McCONNELL: Yeah. I mean a withdrawal date is a sign of surrender. I mean, it's saying, you know, if you can hold on until this particular day, that's when we're going to give up. SIEGEL: Where is that. . . Sen. McCONNELL: That is not acceptable and that isn't going to be in a bill that gets signed by the president. SIEGEL: But it seems to me, you're saying that the milestones language could be - and is there any bright line that can't be crossed as far as you're concerned? That is - could it compel the administration to come and report to the Congress on progress? Sen. McCONNELL: Well, that's possible. I mean none of us are satisfied with the Iraqi performance. I've been one of the president's stronger supporters on this whole effort, but I said to the Iraqis the oil law needs to be passed. It needs to be passed now. They haven't gotten that done yet. There are a number of things that we know and they know they need to do on the political side that have not yet been accomplished. Our patience is not endless. And that's a message that I've sent to the Iraqis as someone who has been a strong supporter of the effort to stay on offense on the war on terror from the beginning. SIEGEL: But what good is the message if there are no consequences attached to the failure to achieve that oil bill, say? Sen. McCONNELL: The problem with telling them what we may do if they don't measure up is you also tell the enemy. And look, it's no secret - al-Qaida is in Iraq. Our Democratic friends seem to think it's okay to fight al-Qaida in Afghanistan but somehow not okay to fight them in Iraq. Al-Qaida is al-Qaida, whether they're operating out of East Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq or somewhere else. This is the same gang that hit us on 9/11. It's no accident that we haven't been attacked again since 9/11 - it's because we've been on offense. SIEGEL: Of course someone might say that this is a - this is essentially a locally led group that applied for and got the franchise to be al-Qaida in Iraq. Sen. McCONNELL: Al-Qaida is in a number of different countries. And right now, bin Laden says that Iraq is where they are focusing their efforts. This is the same crowd that killed 3,000 Americans, innocent Americans, on one day back in 2001. We need to stay after them, or they will be back here. SIEGEL: Senator McConnell, one other topic. Many Senate Republicans have been blunt to scathing on the subject of Attorney General Gonzales, whom the president says he still supports. Is there a message to be delivered by GOP senators to the White House about the loss of effectiveness of the attorney general? Sen. McCONNELL: Well, the president indicated Monday that he still has confidence in the attorney general. The attorney general works for the president, and I think that probably ends the matter right there. SIEGEL: Do you think that it's an accurate judgment that a year and a half of the Justice Department, whose leader is under attack, is preferable to confirmation hearings for a new attorney general ran by a Democratic majority? Sen. McCONNELL: Look, you know, the president in the end decides who he wants in his Cabinet. And so far, he has confidence in the attorney general. And as far as I'm concerned, that's probably the last word. SIEGEL: And to return to Iraq just for a moment, what have you heard from General Petraeus this week that makes you confident that. . . Sen. McCONNELL: It was an excellent briefing. It was an excellent briefing. SIEGEL: What tells you that there's progress being made right now? Sen. McCONNELL: Well, it's a mixed victory. He was very candid. It's certainly not all good news. There's been progress made, particularly out in Anbar province, where a number of the Sunni sheikhs are now allied with us against al-Qaida. The picture in Baghdad is mixed. This is a murky situation, which is why so many Americans are unhappy with where we are, including me. I mean I wish we were in better shape in Iraq than we are, but I'm sure glad we haven't been hit again here in the United States for the last six years. SIEGEL: Well, Senator McConnell, thank you very much for talking with us once again. Sen. McCONNELL: Thank you. SIEGEL: Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. A great, old TV cop show that was shot in New York used to begin with the line: There are eight million stories in the naked city. In fact the number of stories swells to about 10 million every workday and they are stories that vary greatly in terms of energy efficiency. Many New Yorkers take the subway to work. (Soundbite of subway) SIEGEL: And for a variety of reasons, some brave the surface traffic of midtown Manhattan, many in buses and, unlike just about everywhere else in the country, very few in their own cars. The very few might be still fewer if the city adopts Mayor Michael Bloomberg's far-reaching plan for saving energy and reducing emissions. It's called PlaNYC and it would increase mass transit while charging people for driving to Manhattan's south of 86th Street. (Soundbite of traffic) SIEGEL: Joining us from our bureau in New York City is Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Welcome to the program. Hi, Mr. Mayor. Mayor MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (Republican, New York): Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: And thanks for coming to our new facility on 42nd Street where if you caught the view, you would look at over Bryant Park, the public library and look straight at the Empire State Building. In the year 2030, if PlaNYC has made a change in New York, how different would that prospect be? Mayor BLOOMBERG: Well, for one thing, if we could get all three million New York households to replace just one standard light bulb with one of these more efficient light bulbs, the energy savings would be enough to power three Empire State Buildings, including the lights on the top. SIEGEL: Let's talk about transportation and the traffic down below and what's going to be different if the plan takes effect. You're in midtown Manhattan right now. Mayor BLOOMBERG: Midtown Manhattan, the traffic is bad. In the end, the real answer is mass transit. You've got to give people an incentive to take mass transit and you've got to be able to have the money. You've got to invest in mass transit and make it better. Now the truth of the matter is the subway is the best way in New York City to get to any place. We, unfortunately, don't have subways in all parts of the city and so we have to look to aboveground mass transit. And I think things like rapid bus lanes and light rail are the only practical things. We are building a couple of new subways in New York City but in this day and age, they're phenomenally expensive. SIEGEL: Yeah, I was wondering about that. How many new commuter rail lines, actually, can be added before you're way past Big Dig levels of construction costs? Mayor BLOOMBERG: Well, you can - the No. 7 Line extension, which will open up the whole Westside of Manhattan is being done with city money rather than state money. And the economic benefit will be enormous and the extra taxes the city will get will more than pay for the subway line. We're trying to build a, what we call Eastside access. And we want to be able to have people get to Kennedy Airport and Jamaica and points to the east, without having to make a number of changes in the mode of transportation. SIEGEL: Now extending subways and adding express bus routes and the like, those are familiar. Those are elements of commuting that we know about today and you would be improving or expanding them. But I want you to flash forward to the age of E-ZPass, which for those who don't have them, they're little devices one puts onto one's windshield connects to a transponder and you can fly through tollgates up and down the East Coast of the U. S. and elsewhere with them. This would actually be a device that would track cars as they're entering and leaving midtown Manhattan in the future. Mayor BLOOMBERG: There's a number of different technologies you could use. But regardless of how you collect the information of where the car is at a given point in time, then you can have a set of decision rules. For example, you could charge differently depending on the time of the day or the day that you come in or leave. But the first issue is: Are you going to have a system where we use economic incentives to get people to take their car or take mass transit? SIEGEL: But here the interesting point is really the disincentive that is, the cost that would be attached to driving your car. . . Mayor BLOOMBERG: Well, it depends. . . SIEGEL: . . . south of 86th Street, let's say. Mayor BLOOMBERG: That's - but you've only looked the part of the economics. . . SIEGEL: Yes. Mayor BLOOMBERG: . . . because I would argue that yes, we're going to charge you to go south of 86th but we're going to offset that with the tolls you pay elsewhere. So for some it's not going to be much money at all. But also the economic incentives include the benefits of being able to get where you want to go much quicker. SIEGEL: Just a couple of quick points. In preparing this plan, New York City studied commuter patterns into midtown Manhattan, say, and you came up with some interesting numbers. . . Mayor BLOOMBERG: With every district in New York City. SIEGEL: Yeah. It's interesting how few people are actually driving to work in midtown Manhattan. Mayor BLOOMBERG: Yeah, I think the numbers are roughly five percent of the people that work in mid - in New York City, south of 86th Street and live outside of that area, only five percent drive. Now, if you go and you take the moneys and improve mass transit, a lot of people will do what I do. I don't take the subway because I like it. I take the subway because it gets me there quickly, efficiently. People are always nice in the subway. I managed to read three papers. You know, only one time has anybody ever screamed at me on the subway in the six years that I've been in office. This big, hulking guy screamed at me as the doors closed - fix the Knicks. Now I can do a lot of things but that was something I could not do. (Soundbite of laughter) Mayor BLOOMBERG: Truth of the matter is, I grew up in Boston. I was a Celtics fan. (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: You have no interest in doing so. Mayor BLOOMBERG: I'll get booed the next time I go to a Knicks game. But my daughter's a Knicks fan. SIEGEL: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, thanks a lot for talking with us. Mayor BLOOMBERG: Thank you for having me.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block.

Now, if you go and you take the moneys and improve mass transit, a lot of people will do what I do. I don't take the subway because I like it. I take the subway because it gets me there quickly, efficiently. People are always nice in the subway. I managed to read three papers. You know, only one time has anybody ever screamed at me on the subway in the six years that I've been in office. This big, hulking guy screamed at me as the doors closed - fix the Knicks. Now I can do a lot of things but that was something I could not do.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mayor BLOOMBERG: Truth of the matter is, I grew up in Boston. I was a Celtics fan.  (Soundbite of laughter)  SIEGEL: You have no interest in doing so.  Mayor BLOOMBERG: I'll get booed the next time I go to a Knicks game. But my daughter's a Knicks fan.  SIEGEL: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, thanks a lot for talking with us.  Mayor BLOOMBERG: Thank you for having me. ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Debbie Elliott. As the casualties mount in Iraq, the U. S. Congress and President Bush offered a standoff over funding the war. The president is planning to veto legislation approved by Congress this week that attaches timelines for the withdrawal of U. S. troops to funding. The Democrats do not have enough votes to override the veto. Yesterday, President Bush indicated he'd like to see some sort of compromise. To find out where Democrats and Republicans might find common ground, I spoke earlier today with two members of the House - first, Democrat John Tanner of Tennessee. I asked him if House Democrats would be willing to eliminate all mention of timelines. Representative JOHN TANNER (Democrat, Tennessee): I think, how you define the timeline is important here, now, when we go into the second round, and that is if the timeline is one of goals that the Iraqis must meet by a certain date. That's far different than a requirement on our own military commanders. As a military guy myself, I don't think that's wise for Congress to do. ELLIOTT: Let me just make sure I understand what you're saying. You're saying that it's important to have dates for certain goals\u2026 Rep. TANNER: Goals that the Iraqis must make\u2026 ELLIOTT: \u2026that the Iraqis should make. But you\u2026 Rep. TANNER: \u2026but what I think\u2026 ELLIOTT: \u2026but you don't think\u2026 Rep. TANNER: \u2026but I should I say\u2026 ELLIOTT: \u2026that there should be specific dates that U. S. troops should come out. Rep. TANNER: That we will, at least, consider redeployment out of the streets of Baghdad if they don't perform certain goals. ELLIOTT: Are you saying that if you change the language from a hard troop pullout date and just say, we consider redeployment of troops if you don't meet these goals, do you think that's something that Republicans would accept? Rep. TANNER: Well, I would hope so. The military has won a war. It's our refusal that will hold the Iraqi's civilian leadership that we put in into elections accountable for their government. ELLIOTT: But I think that some Democrats believe that the only way to put that pressure is by attaching some, sort of, a fixed date. Do you think you're going to be able to get compromise legislation that does not include that? Rep. TANNER: I think there'll have to be some dates that may be will waivable(ph). That's a date to the Iraqis but it's not a date to us. I think that's a legitimate way to go about this. ELLIOTT: You know, the commander in the field, General David Petraeus, has said that he and Defense Secretary Gates will be assessing progress in Iraq come September. Why not just wait until then, you know? It might emerge from their assessment that pulling out and setting benchmarks at this point is the wrong thing to do. Rep. TANNER: Well, I think that's probably a matter of legitimate discussion in this next round, to be honest with you. ELLIOTT: Is there some wiggle room here, as far as the $21 billion of extra spending that Congress added in this bill? You know, the administration has characterized it as pork. Rep. TANNER: Well, they've taken some of it out already. Some of it is legitimate agricultural emergency spending\u2026 ELLIOTT: But would you\u2026 Rep. TANNER: \u2026some of it - none of it was in there to be truthful. ELLIOTT: When congressional Democrats go to the White House next week or wherever they're going to meet, what do you think the bottom line is that the president will hear from Democrats about this issue? Rep. TANNER: That there has to be a substantive message sent to the Iraqis whether it is a waivable timeline, whether it's a goal, there has to be some substantive change in our strategy in terms of how the Iraqis perceive what's going on in Washington and how everyone gets there is, I think, that's the bottom line the Democrats will probably insist on. ELLIOTT: Congressman John Tanner of Tennessee is a chief deputy whip for the Democrats. Thank you for speaking with us, sir. Rep. TANNER: Thank you very much. ELLIOTT: Congressman Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, joins us now from member station WCBU in Peoria. Thank you for being on the program, sir. Representative RAY LaHOOD (Republican, Illinois): Thank you. ELLIOTT: When members of Congress sit down to start to negotiate this bill after the president's veto, where do you think you're going to find common ground? Rep. LaHOOD: Getting the money to the troops and making sure that the benchmarks that have been set by President Bush and General Petraeus are clear in the sense that we know that they'll be a report in September. ELLIOTT: We spoke earlier with one of your colleagues, a Democrat, Congressman Tanner, and he suggested that the Democrats might be willing to compromise on the language of the bill, saying something like the U. S. would consider redeploying its troops from Iraq if the Iraqi government failed to meet certain goals to promote national reconciliation. Would that language be acceptable to Republicans in the House? Rep. LaHOOD: Well, I think not. I think at this point, we want to give every advantage we can to General Petraeus, to the men and women that are doing the hard work everyday and in particular, to Prime Minister Maliki. And I think what we ought to do is pass a bill that will allow for the money for our troops and then look very carefully at what General Petraeus can tell us in September. ELLIOTT: Back in February, you said that Iraqis need to continue to take control of the security situation. You said, we will provide additional manpower and resources to calm the violence, but it's time for the Iraqi government to take bold action. That was February, now it's almost May. Are you seeing the kind of action that you'd hoped for? Rep. LaHOOD: I think the difference between now and February is that we're sending 20,000 more troops there - six per dates. We have new people. We have new players. We have more military. And now I think\u2026 ELLIOTT: But that's only with U. S. side. You said the Iraqi government needs to take bold action, do you think that's happening? Rep. LaHOOD: I think they're trying. And I think we're going to help them even more with the effort that's being put forth now. This period of time, between now and September, is the most critical period of time since we've in Iraq. ELLIOTT: Why is it so hard to talk about what the consequences should be if the Iraqi government does not make progress? Rep. LaHOOD: Look, we know that the Iraqi government is having a difficult time. Maliki is having a difficult time. They're having a difficult time getting the oil fields open. They're having a difficult time getting the insurgency under control in Baghdad. They need our help. To put any more undue pressure on this government at this time, I think, is not fair. And I believe that's the reason that leadership is resistant to those kind of benchmarks. ELLIOTT: Administration officials seemed to be dampening expectations of the progress in Iraq. When General Petraeus briefed Congress this past week, he said something like Prime Minister Maliki isn't Tony Blair. Do you think that Republican members of Congress are willing to be as patient with the Iraqi government as the administration has been? Rep. LaHOOD: I think the patience of all members of the House and Senate is wearing thin. Not only patience of the American people, but I think that is reflected in the members of Congress. ELLIOTT: Congressman Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois. We spoke with him from Peoria. Thank you so much, sir. Rep. LaHOOD: Thank you very much.

But the New York Times obtained a copy in advance and on Friday the newspaper reported that Mr. Tenet says his remark that evidence showing Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction was, a quote, \"slam dunk\" had been taken out of context. John McLaughlin was deputy CIA director under Mr. Tenet, and he was at that White House meeting. Mr. McLaughlin joins us from Washington. Thanks so much for being with us, sir. Mr. JOHN McLAUGHLIN (Former Deputy Director, Central Intelligence Agency): Good morning, Scott. SIMON: And, well, is that how you heard it? Mr. McLAUGHLIN: Well, you know, to hear it described, you would think this was a meeting in which George Tenet said slam dunk and then everyone stood up and said, great, let's go to war. It wasn't that way at all. This was a meeting that was intended to review some intelligence that might be declassified to help explain why analysts at that time thought - now, we know wrongly - that Saddam had WMD. And when George said those two words, I think he was saying them to convey the idea that there's more intelligence that can be declassified that we put on the table here. I actually personally do not remember him saying those words. There were three or four of us there from the agency. One person remembers him saying them. And that person I think would dispute the idea that he said it in the way it's been described. It's been described that he jumped up from the sofa, threw his arms in the air, kind of, like a referee and yelled slam-dunk. It was an offhand, casual comment that, frankly, none of us thought about after we left that meeting. SIMON: So to try and understand the absolutely context in which Mr. Tenet reportedly made that remark, slam dunk, obviously, some people are now representing it as saying that in fact, he - the director of the CIA - doubted the veracity of the evidence. But the way you explained it, it doesn't seem to be quite that way? Mr. McLAUGHLIN: No. I don't know why they would say that. That isn't what he was saying at all. It has been portrayed as a pivotal moment in the path to war. The context of the Times, though, is that this meeting took place about two weeks after the first military deployment orders had been issued to send troops to the Middle East. It took place after the war resolution had been voted in Congress. It took place after the president's U. N. speech. It took place at a moment when things were very well advanced, a lot of things were moving. And this was a presentation that the administration was seeking to put together to explain why people thought there was WMD in Iraq. SIMON: But when you say why people thought there were weapons of mass destruction, at that point, it did include the CIA? Mr. McLAUGHLIN: Of course. Analysts believe there were weapons of mass destruction there. SIMON: Mr. McLaughlin, reportedly, Mr. Tenet's book also says that there wasn't - wasn't any real debate, as you would understand the term at the White House level, over whether or not to go to war in Iraq. Is that how you remember it? Mr. McLAUGHLIN: Well I think George will have to speak for himself on that. What he's saying I think is that he was not present in meetings where the fundamental question of whether we should do this was debated in a kind of close-the-door, roll-up-your-sleeves, let's-sweat-this-out type of way. Yes, to be sure, there were meetings about how we should do it. There were meetings about the kind of things one would have to think about if you did this. You know, how would the currency be affected, will there be outflows of refugees, that kind of thing. But the fundamental question of whether the merits of doing this and the potential downsides of doing this, I think he's saying in his presence that was not something that was thoroughly debated. SIMON: What about the relationship between the White House and the intelligence community? What was it like at that time? Mr. McLAUGHLIN: Well, bear in mind, George Tenet was director of Central Intelligence for seven years. We were both nominated and confirmed in the Clinton administration and we continued into the Bush administration. So at the early part of the Bush administration I think, fairly, they were taking a look to see if this team and this leadership of the intelligence community was the right one. They evidently concluded it was. When 9/11 occurred, the CIA was the first to put a workable plan on the table that ultimately was the heart of what became Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. And in the first year or two after Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan was regarded as quite a success, and I think the relationship between the White House and the intelligence community was very strong at that point. But tensions began to grow as differences opened up between the administration and the intelligence community on a number of issues, chiefly on the question of whether there was a relationship between Iraq, Saddam and somehow, 9/11, which we stoutly(ph), firmly dismissed as a possibility. And there were many people in the administration who saw it differently. SIMON: Did you see any lasting harm that's come to the CIA other this whole episode? MR. McLAUGHLIN: I wouldn't say lasting harm, but certainly the inadequate work on WMD dealt a blow to credibility. I often say, though, that the CIA had to do about five things on Iraq, and it did one of them very badly and did the other four, pretty well. The thing that it didn't do well was WMD, as we all now know. It also had to help portray the battlefield for troops who were going in. They did that pretty well. It had to estimate what would be the consequences of such an invasion. There were papers that made clear that in the event of a prolonged occupation without restoration of services, there would be some serious problems in this country that would amount to a revolt against the occupation. It had also to gauge the relationship between Saddam and al-Qaida and whether there was a connection at 9/11. It had to understand what was going on, on the ground once the war began. On all of those scores, I think the CIA and the intelligence community did pretty well. But clearly, it did not do well on WMD. You know, when you're in the intelligence business and you make a mistake, the only thing you can do is stare it in the face, understand what happened and take corrective action. One of the things I would say to you and to the American public is the CIA did this better than any other institution in our government. And after all, there had been about four commissions now that have looked deeply at the intelligence community's performance with the full cooperation of the intelligence community. Intelligence community itself, George Tenet and I personally hired two people, David Kay and Charles Duelfer, to go out and find the truth about WMD, and we supported their efforts and published what they found and turned it all over to the WMD commission - Silberman and Rob - which then used it as the basis for their report and as the basis for recommendations that amount to corrective action that ultimately over time will improve the tradecraft and performance in the intelligence business. I don't know that there had been comparable looks at performance and corrective action by the Congress, the media(ph), the policy world. The intelligence world is one of the few worlds where, because you're dealing with the future and you're dealing with risky situations, which by definition will mathematically, certainly produce error from time to time, you have to have a tradition of figuring out what went wrong and how you check corrective action. And that's been done. SIMON: Mr. McLaughlin, thanks so much for your time. MR. McLAUGHLIN: Thank you, Scott. It was a pleasure to talk to you. SIMON: John McLaughlin was deputy CIA director under George Tenet, speaking with us from Washington. This is NPR News.

Intelligence community itself, George Tenet and I personally hired two people, David Kay and Charles Duelfer, to go out and find the truth about WMD, and we supported their efforts and published what they found and turned it all over to the WMD commission - Silberman and Rob - which then used it as the basis for their report and as the basis for recommendations that amount to corrective action that ultimately over time will improve the tradecraft and performance in the intelligence business.  I don't know that there had been comparable looks at performance and corrective action by the Congress, the media(ph), the policy world. The intelligence world is one of the few worlds where, because you're dealing with the future and you're dealing with risky situations, which by definition will mathematically, certainly produce error from time to time, you have to have a tradition of figuring out what went wrong and how you check corrective action. And that's been done.  SIMON: Mr. McLaughlin, thanks so much for your time.  MR. McLAUGHLIN: Thank you, Scott. It was a pleasure to talk to you.  SIMON: John McLaughlin was deputy CIA director under George Tenet, speaking with us from Washington.  This is NPR News.

In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep on MORNING EDITION tomorrow, the U. S. commander in Iraq discusses the challenges of fighting insurgents, militias, death squads and al-Qaida. STEVE INSKEEP: Do you believe that the way the war is being fought now that you're following the advice of the counterinsurgency manual that you supervised the production of before you came to Iraq? General DAVID PETRAEUS (U. S. Army Commander in Iraq): Well, we're certainly trying to do that, yeah. I would point out the counterinsurgency in Iraq is a mix of many different types of operations. It's actually counterterrorism when it comes to al-Qaida and some of the other extremists, and by that, I mean precise operations, intelligence driven; but you do, certainly, classical counterinsurgency when it comes to dealing with perhaps the Sunni rejectionists, as you call them, or the old - the Saddamists. There's also almost counter-gang operations countering criminals who are taking advantage of the absence of the rule of law. INSKEEP: When you look at that manual, it gives a rule of thumb for the number of troops you need, as you know well. Gen. PETRAEUS: Mm-hmm. INSKEEP: It says roughly, for every thousand people in the population, you need 20 soldiers. Gen. PETRAEUS: Yeah. INSKEEP: You do the math on that for Iraq, it would say you need half a million troops\u2026 Gen. PETRAEUS: Well, you don't\u2026 INSKEEP: \u2026which you don't have. Gen. PETRAEUS: Yeah, you don't need to do that everywhere in Iraq by any stretch of the imagination.

Five million people, you'd need 100,000. Gen. PETRAEUS: Baghdad would be somewhere around\u2026 INSKEEP: Do you have 100,000? Gen. PETRAEUS: What we have with coalition and Iraqi forces, just those alone, is about 80,000. And you then actually have to factor in some other interesting contributors, and of all things, private contractors are among those. Let me give you an example. The embassy is secured by private contractors. The airport is secured by it. So you carry this across, there are tens of thousands, security contractors, just in Baghdad alone, performing missions that would otherwise have to be performed by Iraqi or coalition forces.

Welcome to the program once again. OLYMPIA SNOWE: I'm delighted to be on the program. Thank you. SIEGEL: And perhaps you can explain to us what your bill would require if, in fact, some of those benchmarks for example, Iraq assuming control of its military or passing a law to disarm the militias or an oil law - what if, say General Petraeus came back in four months and said that has not happened? SNOWE: Well, I think, at that point then he would be required to submit a plan for a phase redeployment of those troops that are associated with the surge in Baghdad, and in addition, to have a plan for the change of mission for all of the other troops. Because at that point, if the political solutions that are obviously critical to the future of Iraq in achieving national reconciliation hasn't been accomplished by the Iraqi government then it's clear that they're not demonstrating a good phase effort. SIEGEL: Now to distinguish your bill from a spending bill that calls straightaway for a withdrawal or sets a date next year - is it correct to say that your bill says give the administration four months and give the Iraqis four months to show that current plans are succeeding, and if they can't, then start redeploying as much as you'd have to under the other bill? SNOWE: So, in four months whether that could be accomplished, the surge will be fully implemented in July with all the forces. And they would have the summer in which to pass these initiatives, you know, in their council of representatives. SIEGEL: How would this satisfy President Bush's stated objections to what he calls a rigid and artificial deadline for withdrawal? That is, it would push it down the road four months but at that point if you didn't hear what you wanted to hear there would be a deadline. SNOWE: Well, I think the president has to understand, you know, deadlines do serve a purpose. And we now have to see a demonstration - a good phase effort on part of the Iraqi government that they are prepared to do what is going to require to achieve a political consensus. And General Petraeus has indicated that by early September, we will know whether or not the surge has been a success. SIEGEL: Do you feel, at all, uncomfortable about the provision that you wrote into this bill by which effectively the Congress would be ordering the general who's commanding forces in Iraq? Because that would be a rather novel arrangement in terms of who the general is reporting to. Obviously, you feel it's necessary - you wrote the bill. Do you have any qualms at all about that? SNOWE: No, not at this stage of the Iraq war. I think that General Petraeus has been very forthcoming and very straightforward. He himself has indicated that there's really no military solution that's going to address the problems in Iraq. That really does have to be a political resolution. Even in his own counterinsurgency manual he indicates a host nation has to win it on its own. And so I think at this point, the time has come. And I think, he understands that and has an obligation, not only to the president of the United States, but to the American people. SIEGEL: And would you imagine that the benchmarks you've spelled out - for example, passing a law to disarm and demobilize the militias - that there is wiggle room there? I mean, and that even doesn't say that militias must be disarmed and demobilized but (unintelligible) the law has been passed to that effect. But if there's a law that's winding its way through the Iraqi parliament when it's time to report, is there some room here for saying, ah, they're - well, they're moving in the right direction even if they haven't achieved their benchmark? SNOWE: We hope to have an independent analysis so that we can best discern as to whether or not they are truly achieving those objectives by all accounts is a measure of whether or not they're moving towards national reconciliation. SIEGEL: But you're opening up the discussions, say, for four months down the road that, hey, they got four and half out of six. Let's not invoke the redeployment clause because there's some motion here. SNOWE: Well, at this point we think that each of those benchmarks are essential - individually and collectively. So we would expect results on all o them. SIEGEL: Well, Senator Snowe, thank you very much once again for talking with us. SNOWE: Thank you. SIEGEL: So Olympia Snowe, Republican senator from Maine.

Welcome back to the program. Mr. TONY SNOW (Press Secretary, White House): Thanks, Robert. SIEGEL: And good to know you're back on the job. How are you, by the way? Mr. SNOW: I'm doing fine. And glad to be back on the job. SIEGEL: Well, as the White House and Congress attempt to negotiate a compromise spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan, there's a lot of talk about benchmarks. And I like to know first of all, would the president sign a bill that spells out some specific goals that have to be achieved over the coming months? Mr. SNOW: I know this is going to be deeply frustrating. But just as Senator Reid said yesterday before reporters, we're not going to negotiate publicly on this. The one thing we want to do is to work to make sure that this government of Iraq succeeds. And obviously, there are a number of key things they need to do in terms of political reconciliation, economic development. We certainly know that the Iraqis need to make progress. And I think a lot of the conversations between White House negotiators and Democrats and Republicans on the Hill are going to be designed, first, to make sure that we get money and flexibility for our forces in the field right now. So they can continue doing their job effectively. And some of these other discussions are certainly going to take place but I neither want to characterize them nor prejudge them. SIEGEL: But is there a bright line for President Bush when it comes to attaching foreseeable consequences to Iraq's performance in meeting those benchmarks? Mr. SNOW: As I said, I - you know, I warned you already I was going to frustrate you on this. One of the things that's important to realize is that you do want to have success in Iraq, and also when you're talking about what they need to do and how they need to do it you have to make sure that you're going to do it in a way that actually is going to produce constructive action as opposed to encouraging them to conclude that the United States is getting out, and as a consequence, really putting an end to effective action by the part of the United States government. SEIGEL: When President Bush yesterday spoke of al-Qaida in Iraq as the same bunch that's causing havoc in Iraq were the ones who came and murdered our citizens. Clearly al-Qaida in Iraq is a group that is affiliated with al-Qaida. They've seemed to have gotten the franchise for operations in Iraq. But he's -let me just make this clear, he's not implying that there was a pre-9/11 link now between Iraq and al-Qaida, is he? Mr. SNOW: Well, there was certainly were some al-Qaida members in Iraq before September 11th. Let me make it clearer because he said it many times as early as 2002, right after September 11th, we do not have any information about a link between Saddam Hussein and September 11th. And that is another accusation that's been placed at the doorstep of this administration that's simply false. So, there is no information about Saddam Hussein having an operational relationship with al-Qaida with respect to 9/11. SEIGEL: But when he said, yesterday, al-Qaida has ratcheted up its campaign of high-profile attacks. Al-Qaida is the group that plotted, planned and trained killers to come and kill people in our soil. The same bunch that is causing havoc in Iraq. . . Mr. SNOW: Yeah. SEIGEL: . . . were the ones who came and murdered our citizens. So there's an attempt to. . . Mr. SNOW: Well, he's talking about al-Qaida. You keep in mind what we are talking about here, Robert. Al-Qaida members in Iraq are not native Iraqis. They're foreign fighters who have come from abroad, who pledged fealty and then in many cases put together videos saying that in fact that this continues to be orchestrated by Ayman al-Zawahri and Osama bin Laden. So what you're looking at now is the fact that there are al-Qaida members on Iraqi soil. That does not mean that the Iraqis themselves were intimately involved in the September 11th planning, but it does mean that members of al-Qaida are now in Iraq trying to destabilize their government. And for them, this really is the central front of the war in terror. Senator Lieberman was very precise and very passionate about this in a recent op-ed piece in The Washington Post and he's been so on the floor of the Senate as well. SEIGEL: Well, it's good to talk with you. And this task of having to answer questions from the White House press corps, and nuisances like me, every day, and work all these hours, this makes sense to you at this particular moment in your life? Mr. SNOW: You know what? People don't understand this but I love this job. It is stimulating and it's fun. And one final note, much to the surprise maybe of a lot of folks around the country, Democrats and Republicans and members of the press, and a lot of folks in this town have been an extraordinary source of help and comfort for me. And it's one of the dirty little secrets about Washington. It's a small town, but there're an awful lot of good people in it. SEIGEL: Okay, let's not get the word around too fast.

But boxing enthusiasts are hoping a fight tonight in Las Vegas could change that. The bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather has been touted as the fight of the decade and is being hyped accordingly. In the lead up to the pay-per-view match tonight, HBO has been running a reality series, following the boxers as they train, and the characters are classic. Squeaky-clean Hollywood heartthrob De la Hoya, up against the arrogant, money-flashing Mayweather. (Soundbite of HBO's \"De La Hoya/Mayweather 24/7\") Mr. OSCAR DE LA HOYA (Boxer): It takes a great deal to get my motors running. But when you get them going, you don't want to make me your enemy. Mr. FLOYD MAYWEATHER (Boxer): That boy (unintelligible) away from you. Unidentified Man: The unprecedented access, the unvarnished truth. ELLIOTT: To find out if this fight can really save the sport, we turned to Jackie Kallen, a boxing manager and promoter who has known both fighters since they started their careers. She joins us from Detroit. Thanks for being with us. Ms. JACKIE KALLEN (Promoter; Boxing Manager; Author, \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot: A Fight Plan for Dealing With All of Life's Hard\"): My pleasure. ELLIOTT: So how can this fight raise the profile of boxing? Ms. KALLEN: Well, this fight is the most exciting match-up that we have had in years in boxing. You see, we've lost a lot of our audience to mixed martial arts - UFC. ELLIOTT: When you say UFC, you're talking about Ultimate Fighting Championship, and this is where people do more than box when they're in the ring? They have to use their feet, their arms. Ms. KALLEN: Their elbows, basically, no-holds barred. It's just, for some reason, caught on and it outsells boxing in every market. ELLIOTT: Do you that's the only reason that boxing has been on the decline, or are there other reasons that boxing. . . Ms. KALLEN: Well, there's other reasons too. I mean, boxing has been on the decline because we don't have any real stars right now in the sport. The most significant champion that we have in the heavyweight division is Russian. ELLIOTT: Let's talk a little bit about these two fighters. First, we have Oscar De La Hoya who is known as the Golden Boy, a nickname he earned - 21 gold at the '92 Olympics in Barcelona. And he has been a popular figure in boxing ever since, has he not? Ms. KALLEN: Well, he's an absolute doll anyways. He used to fight - his early fights were on the undercards of James Toney, a fighter that I used to manage. So we saw a lot of Oscar in his early years. His early problems were that the Mexicans didn't consider him a Mexican fighter because he is Mexican American born in America. So when he would fight a fighter like Julio Cesar Chavez who was a true Mexican fighter, they weren't pulling for Oscar. But now that Oscar is fighting an African-American, all the Mexican Americans are a hundred percent behind Oscar. So right now, he has really developed a strong fan base among Latinos and Hispanics. And conversely, Floyd Mayweather, who's the antithesis of him in every way, has more of a street following, more of the hip-hop crowd. And so all of his followers love the fact that he is fresh. He is right out there, wears all the bling, and he really puts himself out there. So they really love that. But that makes for a really, really good match-up because in every good match-up, you have the good guy that you're pulling for and you have the bad guy. And they've each become, defined, as the good guy, Oscar, and bad guy, Floyd. So I think that's. . . ELLIOTT: Is that for real, though, or is this all just part of a hype? Ms. KALLEN: No. It's pretty much - I know them both. I've known Floyd for years. We're both from Michigan. He's a nice kid. He is a really nice kid. But he does have that street edge to him. You know, a lot of it's because Oscar is a very successful, wealthy businessman. He runs his own promotional company now. Floyd, who's also made not as much as Oscar, but he's made a lot of money, lives a very lavish lifestyle. He's just flashier about it. So if you like that kind of flash, you like Floyd. If you don't, then you want to see him get his head knocked off. ELLIOTT: Now, he doesn't get his head knocked off very often. He's unbeaten. Ms. KALLEN: Floyd Mayweather is undefeated but he's never been in with anybody quite like Oscar De La Hoya. So I think that he's in for a real lesson tonight in adversity. I really wouldn't sell Oscar short. A lot of people are, you know, clear-cut predicting that Floyd's going to totally annihilate him, and that seems to be the popular opinion. But knowing both of them and knowing boxing, the fight could go one or two ways. If Floyd boxes him, you know, jabs and moves and stays on his, what they call in boxing, stay on your bicycle and just keep pedaling back, it could be a very boring fight with Oscar trying to chase him all night, and one round blending into another. And I can't see that as being a fabulous fight that people are going to talk about for months. But if Oscar can get him to stand still on one spot and engage with him in actual, you know, hand-to-hand combat and he gets on the inside and they start brawling, then I think you're going to see a hell of a fight, because I think they are both going to really dig deep and try to knock each other out. ELLIOTT: Jackie Kallen, thank you for speaking with us. Ms. KALLEN: My pleasure. Enjoy the fight tonight. ELLIOTT: Jackie Kallen is a boxing manager and promoter, and the author of \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot: A Fight Plan for Dealing With All of Life's Hard Knocks. \"  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:  Boxing is no longer the staple of American sports when the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and Sugar Ray Leonard were household names. But boxing enthusiasts are hoping a fight tonight in Las Vegas could change that.  The bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather has been touted as the fight of the decade and is being hyped accordingly. In the lead up to the pay-per-view match tonight, HBO has been running a reality series, following the boxers as they train, and the characters are classic. Squeaky-clean Hollywood heartthrob De la Hoya, up against the arrogant, money-flashing Mayweather.  (Soundbite of HBO's \"De La Hoya/Mayweather 24/7\")  Mr. OSCAR DE LA HOYA (Boxer): It takes a great deal to get my motors running. But when you get them going, you don't want to make me your enemy.  Mr. FLOYD MAYWEATHER (Boxer): That boy (unintelligible) away from you.  Unidentified Man: The unprecedented access, the unvarnished truth.  ELLIOTT: To find out if this fight can really save the sport, we turned to Jackie Kallen, a boxing manager and promoter who has known both fighters since they started their careers. She joins us from Detroit.  Thanks for being with us.  Ms. JACKIE KALLEN (Promoter; Boxing Manager; Author, \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot: A Fight Plan for Dealing With All of Life's Hard\"): My pleasure.  ELLIOTT: So how can this fight raise the profile of boxing?  Ms. KALLEN: Well, this fight is the most exciting match-up that we have had in years in boxing. You see, we've lost a lot of our audience to mixed martial arts - UFC.  ELLIOTT: When you say UFC, you're talking about Ultimate Fighting Championship, and this is where people do more than box when they're in the ring? They have to use their feet, their arms.  Ms. KALLEN: Their elbows, basically, no-holds barred. It's just, for some reason, caught on and it outsells boxing in every market.  ELLIOTT: Do you that's the only reason that boxing has been on the decline, or are there other reasons that boxing. . .  Ms. KALLEN: Well, there's other reasons too.

Thank you for being with us. DOUGLAS MASSEY: A pleasure to be here. SIMON: What are some of the factors at play, do you think, that led to this? MASSEY: Well, I think in the United States race is what sociologists call a master status, so people see race and they see very little else. So when admissions officers are searching for black students to adhere to their commitments to affirmative action, they simply saw well-qualified black students. And they didn't ask how they came to be qualified or where they came from. They don't observe immigrant origins necessarily. And this all happened, kind of, under the radar without people even being aware of it. SIMON: When you refer to immigrants in the black student population, maybe we ought to be specific, you mean a combination of African students or youngsters coming from Caribbean families? MASSEY: About 43 percent of the students that we interviewed in our study were from the Caribbean region, about 29 percent were from Africa - or their parents were - and about seven percent from Latin America. SIMON: Did you find any significant differences when you looked at, let's say, the high school records of youngsters from immigrant families versus African- American students? MASSEY: Immigrant origin black students were much more likely to go to private schools and much more likely to go to parochial schools. And the schools that they attended were somewhat more integrated than native origin African-Americans. SIMON: And any differences in records once they're in college? MASSEY: Once they're in college, they seem to earn comparable grade rates. The grades they earn are about the same as other African-American students, and both groups display significantly lower grades than whites and Asians. SIMON: Any feeling you have as to what some of the factors that might be responsible for that are? MASSEY: And their family networks, even while they're in school, extend back into a segregated world where violence and disorder are more common.

Many had no obvious or direct connection with al-Qaida. Newsweek investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff says that fact makes a case like the one we're hearing about today no less worrisome to antiterrorism investigators. Mr. MICHAEL ISIKOFF (Investigative Correspondent, Newsweek): There's no evidence of any contact between this group and anybody overseas associated with al-Qaida or anybody else. But this is, in fact, the phenomenon that actually most worries counterterrorism analysts and security specialists at this point. It's the homegrown phenomenon of people who - motivated by their anger and fury at the United States or Western interests - plot on their own, taking inspiration from videos that they download off the Internet. It's very hard to identify those people because they don't connect up with people who al-Qaida leaders who have been captured can identify. They are people cropping up all the time on our soil, as well as elsewhere in Western Europe. SIEGEL: Putting today's case in the context of other antiterrorist convictions or investigations, what's the record so far for federal authorities, roughly? Mr. ISIKOFF: The record is mixed. The Justice Department counts something like over 260 terrorism prosecutions in the United States. When you look at those under a microscope, you'll find that many of them are actually for lesser charges, and they say they're terrorism-related. There have been a number of high-level cases - high-profile cases that have led to convictions, most famously the Lackawanna Six in Buffalo, New York - people who went overseas for training in Pakistan and then came back to the United States. Others involving the paintball case in Virginia, again those people. . . SIEGEL: It was called the paintball case because they were supposedly practicing playing paintball. Mr. ISIKOFF: Right. Right. Those cases have led to convictions for - in many cases, lengthy prison sentences for the defendants. But critics say that they never actually involved active terrorist plots in the United States. So how you count those, or how significant you count those, is really left to individuals. SIEGEL: In the timeline of this case that we were talking about today, a video is spotted in January 2006. By March of 2006 or April, at least, there is a confidential informant within this group. So the group was infiltrated pretty quickly after that. We have an idea. . . Mr. ISIKOFF: Right. The FBI, using its standard tactics, infiltrates using a confidential informant and then monitors the activity as it goes along. It goes on for quite some time. In fact, in the affidavit, the discussions about attacks continues right through to March of 2007 - just a couple of months ago. SIEGEL: If and when cases like this go to trial, a common defense tactic is to say that that informant - that is the one who is telling the FBI - that was really the instigator. He was really the guy who made the whole thing happen. But for him, we were just going off into the woods and practicing and playing games. Do you know what the line is - how far can somebody who is being an informant go in these cases? Mr. ISIKOFF: The key is there has to be a predicate. The government has to prove that these people were predisposed to engage in criminal conduct before the informant infiltrates the group; before the informant actually tapes them doing something that is then used as incriminating evidence. If there's sufficient predicate established, then the later evidence is admissible and can be quite probative. SIEGEL: One aspect of this that may attract some political comment is that there were some illegal immigrants among the group - people who were here. Mr. ISIKOFF: Right. Exactly, and that is sure to be seized on by the critics of U. S. immigration policy as further evidence of the threat that illegal immigrants can pose to the country. Although, ironically. . . SIEGEL: And living here for some time. Mr. ISIKOFF: And have been living here for some time.

In years of standoffs, Republicans have long been seen as a scrappier bunch, the party willing to do whatever it takes to win. That impression is starting to change because of this man: Representative RAHM EMANUEL (Democrat, Illinois; Chairman, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee): I'm surely not going to be a Democrat who, I believe, loves the moral victories - that is, losing. I'm just not into that. You got to find somebody else who likes a string of losses. That ain't me. NORRIS: That's Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic congressman from Illinois. He, more than any other individual, is cited as the architect of the Democrats' campaign to regain control of the House. As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee known as the DCCC, Emanuel handpicked tough and telegenic candidates. And like Muhammad Ali before a prizefight, he taunted GOP incumbents in vulnerable races with press releases and verbal jabs. And he also irritated some fellow Democrats with his my-way-or-the-highway attitude. We wanted to learn more about how Emanuel exercises power and the challenges he now faces because of that victory. He is now fourth in line in the House leadership, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. But he's been a force in Washington since he arrived in the early '90s as a staffer for President Clinton. Emanuel once sent a dead fish to a pollster. In D. C. , he's both revered and feared. Mr. NAFTALI BENDAVID (Editor, Chicago Tribune; Author, \"The Thumpin'\"): I think his leadership style could be described as scorched earth, as full bore, I mean, whatever adjective you want to use to describe somebody who never stops. NORRIS: Naftali Bendavid is an editor with the Chicago Tribune. He shadowed Emanuel for months and wrote about it in a new book called \"The Thumpin'. \" Mr. BENDAVID: Some of the bigger fights were with people in his own party. He was always talking to candidates, yelling at them, cursing at them, trying to get them to raise more money, have more press conferences, sharpen their message, whatever it might be. And his big criticism of the Democratic Party was that the party had forgotten how to win. They didn't know what it took. They were more interested in having the right position or being good people rather than doing what it took no matter how much sacrifice it took and how ruthless you had to be. And his goal is to kind of instill that winning attitude in the Democratic Party. NORRIS: Now, the question many ask is: Can that warrior become a consensus builder? We spent some time with Congressman Emanuel on Capitol Hill, and I should say, before you follow this man around, you had better eat your Wheaties. (Soundbite of steps) Rep. EMANUEL: You getting dizzy? NORRIS: I'm getting a workout. (Soundbite of laughter) NORRIS: At 47 years old, Emanuel is thin and wiry and energetic, a walking exclamation point. We hustled past a line of bronze statues, up a wheelchair ramp, and then a sharp left down a little flight of stairs to a doorway that looks like it might open to a broom closet. (Soundbite of door opening) NORRIS: After pressing a secret code, we enter a space known as his hideaway. It's a cozy little office, with butter-colored walls covered all over with photos of his wife, Amy, and their three children. One politician privately said it's like a prizefighter putting smiley faces around the boxing ring where he spars with and psyches out his opponents. Rep. EMANUEL: I am direct. NORRIS: Uh-huh, direct. Okay, that would be one way to say it. Rep. EMANUEL: That's one way - and fortunately direct. Sometimes, it comes off the wrong way, and sometimes it comes out appreciated that there's no dancing around. I mean, I think you could tell people what they want to know or tell people what they need to know, and sometimes you have to do one, sometimes you have to do the other, or you do it both. NORRIS: Well, you say that you're direct. Rep. EMANUEL: Uh-huh. NORRIS: If you go through and read profiles that have been written about you -and there are many\u2026 Rep. EMANUEL: Uh-huh. NORRIS: \u2026you have been described as a bulldozer. Rep. EMANUEL: Uh-huh. NORRIS: As Tony Soprano with indigestion. Rep. EMANUEL: Uh-huh. NORRIS: As somewhere between a toothache and a hemorrhoid, and that was Paul Begala, who considers you a good friend. Now as I describe this, you're smiling. You're not flinching. Many people would flinch if they heard those things. Rep. EMANUEL: I mean, look - I like winning. I think winning is important, especially when your job is to win. And I'm aggressive about fighting for what I believe in and not just to win for the sake of winning. NORRIS: What's your definition of leadership? Rep. EMANUEL: First of all, leadership contains more than one thing. Different people and different context require different types of leadership. But if you think that there is only one tool in that toolbox, you don't understand leadership. You know, sometimes, a member needs persuasion. Sometimes, they need leadership, and sometimes they need inspiration. And sometimes, you have to provide that inspiration by creating a context and an argument that people didn't have before. NORRIS: After helping to push Republicans out of power, Emanuel is despised by some, yet few will speak ill of him on the record. Rob Simmons is a former Republican congressman from Connecticut who lost his seat in a tight mid-term race. Mr. ROB SIMMONS (Former Republican Representative, Connecticut): One of the problems, I think, the Democrats have that Rahm Emanuel has not helped them with is their fundamental core values and beliefs. It's all very fine to come up with new strategies, new tactics, fundraising, or blogging or this kind of stuff. But if you don't have a strategic vision about what your party is all about, what you want America to be in 15 or 20 years, then you still have substantial weaknesses. NORRIS: Emanuel's biographer, Naftali Bendavid, said the congressman is very aware of his rabid reputation and uses it to good effect. Mr. BENDAVID: In certain ways, he's like some kind of a fictional character, almost. You know, he has - half of his right middle finger has been cut off, and that creates this kind of tough-guy image. He did a stint working out for the Israeli army in a civilian capacity during the first Gulf War, and things like that that make him seem like a killer. And then he's got this ballet thing in his background, and he makes no bones about it. In fact, he likes to use it to kind of throw people off their assumptions about him. NORRIS: What are his insecurities? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. BENDAVID: Well, it's funny because for a guy who is so intense and seemed so certain, I think he does have insecurities. And, you know, so he'll let himself go, you know. He'll have some kind of a little bit of a tirade. But then afterwards, he'll be a little bit chastened about it or he'll sort of wonder how he came off. You know, he had this one phrase that I quote in the book, where he said sometimes I wake up and I hate myself too. And it was such a rare moment of insight for him to express that and I try to get him to elaborate on that but he kind of wouldn't go any further with it. But to me, it was a little bit of window into the fact that he does know that there are people who really resent him in certain quarters. And I think that is something that bothers him sometimes. NORRIS: Former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers has known Emanuel since the first Clinton campaign. She says he has mellowed a bit. Ms. DEE DEE MYERS (Former Press Secretary, White House): I think he's become better able to deal with people to take a longer focus to it. He not only gets what he wants in the short term, but doesn't, you know, cause himself trouble in the long term. I remember on the Clinton campaign in 1991, Rahm's job in that campaign was to raise money and so, as the deadline approached, you know, Rahm was literally standing on top of his desk and screaming obscenities at funders on the phone. Telling them what ever they are willing to contribute wasn't enough and they had to give more. By God, he got to $3 million; of course, I think he, you know, ruffled more than one feather on the way there. But he got to where he was going. I don't think Rahm would hail that in quite the same way now. He'll still get to the three million, maybe he'd get to three and a half million under the same circumstances. But I think he's become better able to back off a little bit. NORRIS: How does someone who is trying to raise money yell at a potential donor? How does that work? Ms. MYERS: Not just yell, but yell spewing obscenities. It's part of Rahm's particular charm. I think he has a good instinct for how much - how hard he can push people without pushing them completely away. NORRIS: Colleagues say Emanuel is evolving. He holds regular bipartisan dinners and works hard to yell less, listen more and work with fellow Democrats - particularly in the House leadership. Even so, some fellow lawmakers still call him Rambo. Few things make this guy squirm, but listen to what happens if you ask him about his political ambitions and what they mean for his kids and all those family dinners he misses. But you miss a lot of those dinners not because\u2026 Rep. Emanuel: Don't go there. NORRIS: \u2026you're here in Washington. (Soundbite of laughter) NORRIS: I have to. They're all big children. They're all around me. I have to go - they're so - do you\u2026 Rep. Emanuel: Don't you go. NORRIS: Fact is, the congressman is going to miss a lot more family time as the battle between Congress and the White House, between Democrats and Republicans continues. The impasse highlights Rahm Emanuel's new challenge. Can the man known as a pit bull emerge as a political peacemaker?  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  In Washington, the battle over a timetable for a withdrawal from Iraq pits Republicans against Democrats. In years of standoffs, Republicans have long been seen as a scrappier bunch, the party willing to do whatever it takes to win. That impression is starting to change because of this man:  Representative RAHM EMANUEL (Democrat, Illinois; Chairman, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee): I'm surely not going to be a Democrat who, I believe, loves the moral victories - that is, losing. I'm just not into that. You got to find somebody else who likes a string of losses. That ain't me.  NORRIS: That's Rahm Emanuel, a Democratic congressman from Illinois. He, more than any other individual, is cited as the architect of the Democrats' campaign to regain control of the House. As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee known as the DCCC, Emanuel handpicked tough and telegenic candidates. And like Muhammad Ali before a prizefight, he taunted GOP incumbents in vulnerable races with press releases and verbal jabs. And he also irritated some fellow Democrats with his my-way-or-the-highway attitude.  We wanted to learn more about how Emanuel exercises power and the challenges he now faces because of that victory. He is now fourth in line in the House leadership, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. But he's been a force in Washington since he arrived in the early '90s as a staffer for President Clinton. Emanuel once sent a dead fish to a pollster. In D. C. , he's both revered and feared.  Mr. NAFTALI BENDAVID (Editor, Chicago Tribune; Author, \"The Thumpin'\"): I think his leadership style could be described as scorched earth, as full bore, I mean, whatever adjective you want to use to describe somebody who never stops.

I'm Andrea Seabrook. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Congress is still wrestling with the question of founding the Iraq war. The House has already passed a bill that would parcel out funds in installments. And this week, the Senate will probably vote on a bill of its own. For the last week, one of the most prominent Iraqi political leaders has been in Washington meeting with lawmakers. His name is Barham Salih, he's a Kurd, and he's one of Iraq's deputy prime ministers. Salih's been hearing firsthand from members of Congress why many of them are running out of patience with Iraq's leaders. And he's also been explaining why he thinks that an early U. S. pullout would be disastrous. Dr. BARHAM SALIH (Deputy Prime Minister, Iraq): I can understand that perhaps the present posture of American troops in the urban centers of Iraq and American kids in humvees wandering the streets of Baghdad may not be an image that Americans can tolerate for much longer. I can understand this thing. But this is a battle against an enemy called al-Qaida and international terrorism that is transcending borders and it is attacking here in the United States - is attacking us in Iraq. We cannot afford - we have to adopt in a way that we can win it in time. It is important that we enter a different level of partnership between the Iraqi government and Iraqi leadership and the United States. Because ultimately, it is about Iraqi leadership. I can tell you this readily, and I said this back in Baghdad - Americans cannot deliver for us, we have to delver for own country. NORRIS: You say Iraq needs to deliver for itself, to stand on its own. Until its able to do that, if you are against any kind of timetable for withdrawal, how long do you think the U. S. should or would be involved in Iraq? Dr. SALIH: I think more and more reliance will have to be placed on the Iraqi side. And we are witnessing that when we assumed sovereignty in 2004 - June 2004 - we had no forces. Now, Iraqi police and Iraqi military are nearly 400,000 or so. In terms of time, I can tell you the vision that we have and this is something that we in the administration are on accordant on this matter is that we build Iraqi forces. As more Iraqi troops come on line, they assume more responsibility and our reliance on the Americans will be less than before. I hope we will reach a stage where Americans will not be needed for daily combat operations. Where the Americans will be redeployed to a strategic posture, where they will be there as an asset to fight in a strategic sense, where they are needed to fight the extremists and the terrorists, or to deter regional interferences. I think that is not impossible to imagine in the foreseeable future. NORRIS: Now, Dr. Salih, I didn't hear in that answer a timeframe. Because for many Americans\u2026 Dr. SALIH: I\u2026 NORRIS: \u2026what they're uncomfortable with is this open-ended commitment. Dr. SALIH: I don't think there should be an open-ended commitment. The reason I'm avoiding a timeframe per se is because I don't want that the enemy know what the timeframe will be, and I don't want them just to simply wait us out. If people think that this can be fixed in any given American cycle - political cycle - they will be proven wrong. This is very much like the Cold War. This is a long-term struggle. We need to be honest about it, clear about it. But I am readily willing to accept that the present posture of American deployment in Iraq may not be sustainable from a domestic point of view. How can we change that process so that it will be sustainable, so that we can win it, and not let time be used against us. NORRIS: Is the surge working? Dr. SALIH: On a security level, yes. Many districts of Baghdad have been cleared of terrorist and militias, many important discoveries of weapon caches and bomb factories, a new phase of the operation have started, and I have to remind you also that the full deployment of forces had not taken place yet. And the surge gives us the time to lock in a political settlement, a power sharing arrangement that could create the political coalition needed to defeat in al-Qaida and supporting and enhancing our military capabilities. The surge, so far so good, buy we need to do better on the political track. NORRIS: If the political framework is so important - there's one issue that has left many members of Congress scratching their heads - why are lawmakers planning a two-month summer break when so much key legislation is still on a stalemate. Dr. SALIH: Well, there's a saying that one has to be always careful what one wishes for. We wished for a democracy in our part of the world, an independence of the legislature and our legislature is powerful and have a mind of their own - actually 275 minds of their own. These are the numbers of Iraqi parliamentarians. I'm glad to tell you that I spoke to the speaker of parliament a couple days ago, he told me that he and the prime minister have had a discussion about this thing. They have decided to postpone their recess. So that they will remain in session in July, awaiting proposed legislation to go to them from the government. NORRIS: I want to return to something you had said. In your estimate, you're saying the surge is working, but might this be a temporary breakthrough in the areas where they've actually been able to actually provide come measure of security if the extremists or the insurgents, or whatever you call them, are merely leaving the area and planning wait out the U. S. and Iraqi forces and return the minute they let up pressure? Dr. SALIH: That is the danger. How can we sustain the military gains. It's not just a matter of clearing a neighborhood for a day and then we're leaving it and creating a vacuum. And we are working now on measures by which these military victories, these security measures, could be sustained beyond the search. NORRIS: What is the message that you leave with after your visit here and your many meetings\u2026 Dr. SALIH: I leave with a message and it is a helpful message, by the way, it will help me debate this issue in the Iraqi cabinet and with my parliamentarian colleagues - one of frustration and one of waning patience with this transitionary walk - tat we need to do better. We need to demonstrate progress on a different scale. The world's greatest democracy is helping us - want to help us - but we need to demonstrate that they have a much more effective partner in that. I believe it's a positive message - it's not dammed. And I have not heard, by the way, from anybody that they want to throw in the towel with these guys as such. I mean\u2026 NORRIS: But are you getting a message that patience is wearing thin? Dr. SALIH: It's wearing thin, but they need to see progress. And Americans should understand it is not only the government of Iraq at the other end receiving this message, other interested parties are also receiving this message. Some of whom are liking it and they want to feed your frustration, and want to escalate the conflict in Baghdad or in Diyala or in (unintelligible) so that they can grow this frustration in the United States. The question is how we win thing. The fate of the Iraqi is not only important for Iraqis, it is important for the rest of the region, as well. NORRIS: Dr. Salih, thank you for coming in to talk us. Dr. SALIH: Thank you for this opportunity. NORRIS: That was Barham Salih, the deputy prime minister of Iraq.  ANDREA SEABROOK, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

The House has already passed a bill that would parcel out funds in installments. And this week, the Senate will probably vote on a bill of its own.  For the last week, one of the most prominent Iraqi political leaders has been in Washington meeting with lawmakers. His name is Barham Salih, he's a Kurd, and he's one of Iraq's deputy prime ministers. Salih's been hearing firsthand from members of Congress why many of them are running out of patience with Iraq's leaders. And he's also been explaining why he thinks that an early U. S. pullout would be disastrous.  Dr. BARHAM SALIH (Deputy Prime Minister, Iraq): I can understand that perhaps the present posture of American troops in the urban centers of Iraq and American kids in humvees wandering the streets of Baghdad may not be an image that Americans can tolerate for much longer. I can understand this thing. But this is a battle against an enemy called al-Qaida and international terrorism that is transcending borders and it is attacking here in the United States - is attacking us in Iraq.  We cannot afford - we have to adopt in a way that we can win it in time. It is important that we enter a different level of partnership between the Iraqi government and Iraqi leadership and the United States. Because ultimately, it is about Iraqi leadership. I can tell you this readily, and I said this back in Baghdad - Americans cannot deliver for us, we have to delver for own country.  NORRIS: You say Iraq needs to deliver for itself, to stand on its own. Until its able to do that, if you are against any kind of timetable for withdrawal, how long do you think the U. S. should or would be involved in Iraq?  Dr. SALIH: I think more and more reliance will have to be placed on the Iraqi side. And we are witnessing that when we assumed sovereignty in 2004 - June 2004 - we had no forces. Now, Iraqi police and Iraqi military are nearly 400,000 or so. In terms of time, I can tell you the vision that we have and this is something that we in the administration are on accordant on this matter is that we build Iraqi forces. As more Iraqi troops come on line, they assume more responsibility and our reliance on the Americans will be less than before.  I hope we will reach a stage where Americans will not be needed for daily combat operations. Where the Americans will be redeployed to a strategic posture, where they will be there as an asset to fight in a strategic sense, where they are needed to fight the extremists and the terrorists, or to deter regional interferences. I think that is not impossible to imagine in the foreseeable future.  NORRIS: Now, Dr. Salih, I didn't hear in that answer a timeframe. Because for many Americans\u2026  Dr. SALIH: I\u2026  NORRIS: \u2026what they're uncomfortable with is this open-ended commitment.  Dr. SALIH: I don't think there should be an open-ended commitment. The reason I'm avoiding a timeframe per se is because I don't want that the enemy know what the timeframe will be, and I don't want them just to simply wait us out. If people think that this can be fixed in any given American cycle - political cycle - they will be proven wrong. This is very much like the Cold War.  This is a long-term struggle. We need to be honest about it, clear about it. But I am readily willing to accept that the present posture of American deployment in Iraq may not be sustainable from a domestic point of view. How can we change that process so that it will be sustainable, so that we can win it, and not let time be used against us.  NORRIS: Is the surge working?  Dr. SALIH: On a security level, yes. Many districts of Baghdad have been cleared of terrorist and militias, many important discoveries of weapon caches and bomb factories, a new phase of the operation have started, and I have to remind you also that the full deployment of forces had not taken place yet. And the surge gives us the time to lock in a political settlement, a power sharing arrangement that could create the political coalition needed to defeat in al-Qaida and supporting and enhancing our military capabilities. The surge, so far so good, buy we need to do better on the political track.  NORRIS: If the political framework is so important - there's one issue that has left many members of Congress scratching their heads - why are lawmakers planning a two-month summer break when so much key legislation is still on a stalemate.  Dr. SALIH: Well, there's a saying that one has to be always careful what one wishes for. We wished for a democracy in our part of the world, an independence of the legislature and our legislature is powerful and have a mind of their own - actually 275 minds of their own. These are the numbers of Iraqi parliamentarians. I'm glad to tell you that I spoke to the speaker of parliament a couple days ago, he told me that he and the prime minister have had a discussion about this thing. They have decided to postpone their recess. So that they will remain in session in July, awaiting proposed legislation to go to them from the government.  NORRIS: I want to return to something you had said. In your estimate, you're saying the surge is working, but might this be a temporary breakthrough in the areas where they've actually been able to actually provide come measure of security if the extremists or the insurgents, or whatever you call them, are merely leaving the area and planning wait out the U. S. and Iraqi forces and return the minute they let up pressure?  Dr. SALIH: That is the danger. How can we sustain the military gains. It's not just a matter of clearing a neighborhood for a day and then we're leaving it and creating a vacuum. And we are working now on measures by which these military victories, these security measures, could be sustained beyond the search.  NORRIS: What is the message that you leave with after your visit here and your many meetings\u2026  Dr. SALIH: I leave with a message and it is a helpful message, by the way, it will help me debate this issue in the Iraqi cabinet and with my parliamentarian colleagues - one of frustration and one of waning patience with this transitionary walk - tat we need to do better. We need to demonstrate progress on a different scale. The world's greatest democracy is helping us - want to help us - but we need to demonstrate that they have a much more effective partner in that.  I believe it's a positive message - it's not dammed. And I have not heard, by the way, from anybody that they want to throw in the towel with these guys as such. I mean\u2026  NORRIS: But are you getting a message that patience is wearing thin?  Dr. SALIH: It's wearing thin, but they need to see progress. And Americans should understand it is not only the government of Iraq at the other end receiving this message, other interested parties are also receiving this message. Some of whom are liking it and they want to feed your frustration, and want to escalate the conflict in Baghdad or in Diyala or in (unintelligible) so that they can grow this frustration in the United States.  The question is how we win thing. The fate of the Iraqi is not only important for Iraqis, it is important for the rest of the region, as well.  NORRIS: Dr. Salih, thank you for coming in to talk us.  Dr. SALIH: Thank you for this opportunity.  NORRIS: That was Barham Salih, the deputy prime minister of Iraq. ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mr. STEPHEN OHLEMACHER (The Associated Press): Illinois' racial mix matches that of the nation more closely than any other country. The education levels in Illinois are very similar to that of the country - age distribution very similar. Incomes are a little bit higher than the country. It's a little bit more urban. But if you look at the number of immigrants, the mobility of the population, it all matches the country very closely. NORRIS: So you set out to do this because the changing primary schedule? Mr. OHLEMACHER: Well, as more states are voting to move early in the primary process, one of the arguments that I keep hearing, other than the fact that they just want to increase their influence, was that my state looks more like America than Iowa or Illinois. I heard those arguments out of Florida, California. You could hear it being made for New York, New Jersey. So I decided to figure out which state looks the most like the rest of America. NORRIS: So Illinois tops the list, you know, there's that old saying if it plays in Peoria. Mr. OHLEMACHER: I'm told that's true. (Soundbite of laughter) NORRIS: At least according to your rankings, it appears to be true. Mr. OHLEMACHER: Well, that's actually is, a lot of companies still use Peoria as a test market to test their products. NORRIS: And now we know why. Mr. OHLEMACHER: Yes. NORRIS: Stephen Ohlemacher says that right behind Illinois you will find Oregon, Michigan, Washington and Delaware. And as it happens, the House and Senate in Illinois voted just this week to move up the state's primary date to February 5th. Ohlemacher also told us the 2006 Census data included a startling finding: about one-third of all people in America count themselves as minorities.

Well, a new announcement today about a new initiative came from Gulf Coast Hurricane Recovery Coordinator Donald Powell and Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu. It's designed to keep kids occupied, entertained and off the street. ANDREA SEABROOK, host: Two hundred AmeriCorps volunteers will be spending the summer in New Orleans helping out with recreational and educational programs that will benefit some 4,000 children and teenagers. The VISTA Summer of Service, as it's called, is getting federal, state and local funding. The money and resources will go towards enhancing existing after-school and summer programs. NORRIS: Federal and state investigators have been taking a hard look at the $85-billion student loan industry, questioning lenders about currying favor with the universities by providing gifts, trips, meals and financial incentives in exchange for business. Last week, the House passed legislation that bars student loan companies from offering such perks. The bill also calls for increased federal oversight, something critics say has been lacking. This morning, I sat down with Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings. She says she's been working to clean up the student loan industry for the last two years, and she says that not all lenders fall within her jurisdiction. Ms. MARGARET SPELLINGS (Secretary, Department of Education): People need to understand that, particularly, since costs have grown so dramatically, there's been such a demand for true private loans, which look more like regular consumer loans, like a car loan or a home equity loan or other sorts of financing systems, and those are completely outside of the jurisdiction of this department. That - those jurisdictions are with the SEC and the FTC and the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and that's why I have taken it upon myself to convene the leaders of those organizations so that we can get a more holistic view of enforcement around this issue. NORRIS: With the growing reliance, though, on private loans - why not push for more oversight in that area? Or at least raise a hand at some point and say, you know - we no longer have control or oversight of these industries and so many of these loans are now private. Ms. SPELLINGS: Well, that's one of the things that I think we need to look at carefully because there's, you know, a myriad of laws that may or may not be vigorous enough or are on target enough. And, you know, I think anytime you have a lot of jurisdictional oversight and overlap, there's the potentiality for confusion on the part of the institution and possibly some slippage with respect to the borrower. And I think that's - this is what we call in education, a teachable moment, a chance for us to look again, particularly in light of these changing dynamics of rapidly increasing costs, a lack of transparency and information, and a high level of demand for higher education. NORRIS: There are a lot of people who, right now, are looking back and saying, you know, I wish I would have done this or I wish I would have looked closer. I'm wondering if you have any regrets or wish that you might have done something else to try to head this off at the pass - sit down with lenders, sit down with schools and say, you know, this doesn't look good. Maybe you ought to rethink how you're doing business here. Sec. SPELLINGS: Well, I - you know, I am, you know - feel very good about the aggressive role I have taken in pursuing higher education policy. And it's not just this issue. We can't just pick off this one, you know, when someone got a, you know, quail or a lamb chop on the Hudson River and we're springing into action. I mean it's really much more serious and more profound than that. Is there more we can and should do? The Congress has failed to act on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act six times, and I am bound by the law that they have written. So, I am very hopeful that we will set the record straight. That we will frame where we need improvements and that we will get to work together - the Congress and the administration - to improve this system for our kids. I mean, it's a raging fire in American public policy and we have to fix it. NORRIS: There is one case in particular regarding a Nebraska lender called Nelnet, which was found to have crossed the line. The department decided not to try to recoup some $278 million in federal subsidy payments, and at the time you had said that the department decided not to try to recoup this money because it might lead to litigation that could cause the federal government three times that much money - up to $900 million. And after making that decision, I'm wondering if that sends a perverse message to lenders or other companies. Does it send a message that the government is afraid of. . . Sec. SPELLINGS: No, clearly not. I mean what it sends a message is, that we're going to follow the law and we're going to enforce the law. Now anyone can second-guess the settlement of a lawsuit, no doubt about it. But I made the decision that the best course of action was to, once and for all and finally, end this practice, and that's what I did. NORRIS: Secretary Spellings, thank you for your time.

The Illinois Democrat grabs a cart and heads into the grocery store. Schakowsky is one of four members of Congress doing what they call the food stamp challenge. JAN SCHAKOWSKY: Now I'm hoping with the money I have left to buy a chicken. So right now, I'm hopeful as I head toward the meat department to see if there's a chicken I could buy, and then eat for the rest of the week. SEABROOK: Schakowsky is spending only $21 this week for all her meals because that's what the average person on food stamps gets. SCHAKOWSKY: Do you know where the chicken would be? Unidentified Man: Chicken? Yes, right back down here. How are you doing today? SEABROOK: The congresswoman clutches a piece of paper where she scrolled math problems. She's carefully subtracting each grocery item from her budget. Now she figures she has $7. 90 left to spend and that she's craving some proteins. SCHAKOWSKY: Six dollars, enough for breast tenderloin. That's seems like an extravagance. Ah-ha, let's see, leg quarters, $6. 18. Maybe I can - I'll do that. SEABROOK: Why are you doing this? SCHAKOWSKY: Well, I think that you - even though it's just for a week, and that's clearly not understanding the challenges of eating on food stamps, you really do get a sense of how hard it is. In fact, I think, how impossible it is. And that's why as we reauthorized the Food Stamp Program, this is just not reasonable to ask people to live on an average of a dollar a meal. SEABROOK: Well, the Food Stamp Program is meant to supplement, isn't it? I mean, it's not really - people aren't meant to live on just food stamps, correct? SCHAKOWSKY: Well, that - I supposed that's true but food stamps don't cover things like toilet paper that you might need. So there are plenty of things that you're not even allowed to buy with food stamps that you need to supplement with. There's about 36 million people in our country that do have a hard time feeding themselves. This is the richest country in the world. I think that there's a moral issue here. So let's see if I can buy anything here. SEABROOK: On to the produce section, we're tailed closely by two members of her staff - one snapping pictures. SCHAKOWSKY: I have some lettuce left, so I was thinking more like a tomato or two and a couple more bananas. SEABROOK: I have to ask you a few questions about the politics of this. It occurs to me that it's a little bit of a gimmick, isn't it? SCHAKOWSKY: Oh, sure. It is a gimmick but there's a reality to it right now. You know, there is, you know, it's obvious I have a microphone in my face, that this isn't a real life experience in some ways. But nonetheless, this is what I am eating on for a week and I have a new appreciation. In that sense, it's not a gimmick. SEABROOK: Schakowsky and others would like to add $4 billion to the food stamp program and bump the average amount per person from $21 to $24 a week. She's a co-sponsor of legislation to do that. Three dollars more may not seem like a big difference but Congresswoman Schakowsky could have used it. As we headed for the check out, she was a dollar over budget. So tell me what you have in front of you. SCHAKOWSKY: Okay. I have one tomato. I have three bananas. I have a dollar pack of carrots and I've got the chicken for $6. 18. Now I what I may do - let's see, I've got one, two, three, four, five - I may prorate this just a little because I may not eat all of that chicken. I mean, and then I'll have to not eat all that chicken and not just pretend I'm not going to eat all that chicken. SEABROOK: Critics of the Food Stamp Program generally oppose it on ideological grounds, calling it a big government program or part of a welfare state. But it's also one of the most successful nutrition initiatives in government. There are more than 25 million Americans on food stamps and supporters say that subsidies keep poor families out of hunger. For Congresswoman Schakowsky, it's just an exercise. But as she picks up her grocery bags and heads out of the store, she says it's always better when writing new legislation to collect real stories about real people affected by the law. And now, she says, maybe in a small way she has a story of her own. ANDREA SEABROOK, Host:  Bright and early one morning this week, I went shopping with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.

So right now, I'm hopeful as I head toward the meat department to see if there's a chicken I could buy, and then eat for the rest of the week. SEABROOK: Schakowsky is spending only $21 this week for all her meals because that's what the average person on food stamps gets. SCHAKOWSKY: Do you know where the chicken would be? Unidentified Man: Chicken? Yes, right back down here. How are you doing today? SEABROOK: The congresswoman clutches a piece of paper where she scrolled math problems. She's carefully subtracting each grocery item from her budget. Now she figures she has $7. 90 left to spend and that she's craving some proteins. SCHAKOWSKY: Six dollars, enough for breast tenderloin. That's seems like an extravagance. Ah-ha, let's see, leg quarters, $6. 18. Maybe I can - I'll do that. SEABROOK: Why are you doing this? SCHAKOWSKY: Well, I think that you - even though it's just for a week, and that's clearly not understanding the challenges of eating on food stamps, you really do get a sense of how hard it is. In fact, I think, how impossible it is. And that's why as we reauthorized the Food Stamp Program, this is just not reasonable to ask people to live on an average of a dollar a meal. SEABROOK: Well, the Food Stamp Program is meant to supplement, isn't it? I mean, it's not really - people aren't meant to live on just food stamps, correct? SCHAKOWSKY: Well, that - I supposed that's true but food stamps don't cover things like toilet paper that you might need. So there are plenty of things that you're not even allowed to buy with food stamps that you need to supplement with. There's about 36 million people in our country that do have a hard time feeding themselves. This is the richest country in the world. I think that there's a moral issue here. So let's see if I can buy anything here. SEABROOK: On to the produce section, we're tailed closely by two members of her staff - one snapping pictures. SCHAKOWSKY: I have some lettuce left, so I was thinking more like a tomato or two and a couple more bananas. SEABROOK: I have to ask you a few questions about the politics of this. It occurs to me that it's a little bit of a gimmick, isn't it? SCHAKOWSKY: Oh, sure. It is a gimmick but there's a reality to it right now. You know, there is, you know, it's obvious I have a microphone in my face, that this isn't a real life experience in some ways. But nonetheless, this is what I am eating on for a week and I have a new appreciation. In that sense, it's not a gimmick. SEABROOK: Schakowsky and others would like to add $4 billion to the food stamp program and bump the average amount per person from $21 to $24 a week. She's a co-sponsor of legislation to do that. Three dollars more may not seem like a big difference but Congresswoman Schakowsky could have used it. As we headed for the check out, she was a dollar over budget. So tell me what you have in front of you. SCHAKOWSKY: Okay. I have one tomato. I have three bananas. I have a dollar pack of carrots and I've got the chicken for $6. 18. Now I what I may do - let's see, I've got one, two, three, four, five - I may prorate this just a little because I may not eat all of that chicken. I mean, and then I'll have to not eat all that chicken and not just pretend I'm not going to eat all that chicken. SEABROOK: Critics of the Food Stamp Program generally oppose it on ideological grounds, calling it a big government program or part of a welfare state. But it's also one of the most successful nutrition initiatives in government. There are more than 25 million Americans on food stamps and supporters say that subsidies keep poor families out of hunger. For Congresswoman Schakowsky, it's just an exercise. But as she picks up her grocery bags and heads out of the store, she says it's always better when writing new legislation to collect real stories about real people affected by the law. And now, she says, maybe in a small way she has a story of her own.", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Debbie Elliott. This weekend, President Bush is pushing to win congressional approval for his sweeping reform of the nation's immigration laws. Thursday, the administration worked out a deal with senators from both parties. The Senate will take up the compromise Monday. In his radio address today, the president acknowledged it will be a tough sell. (Soundbite of radio address) President GEORGE W. BUSH: I realize that many hold strong convictions on this issue and reaching an agreement was not easy. I appreciate the efforts of senators who came together to craft this important legislation. This bill brings us closer to an immigration system that enforces our laws and upholds the great American tradition of welcoming those who share our values and our love of freedom. ELLIOTT: The legislation would allow immigrants here illegally to legalize their status after paying a fine. It would also create a guest-worker program. But first, additional security measures must be in place - new stretches of border fence constructed and additional border patrols deployed. One of the Republicans who helped craft this compromise is Arizona Senator Jon Kyl. He joins us from Phoenix. Welcome. Senator JON KYL (Republican, Arizona): Thank you. ELLIOTT: Senator Kyl, last year, you were adamantly against any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. This bill would now allow them to eventually become citizens. What changed your mind here? Sen. KYL: Nothing changed my mind. I remain opposed to automatic citizenship or an automatic path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. My dilemma was the following: Democrats now control the House and Senate; a bill was being written; the president was likely to sign a bill that was within certain boundaries, and I suspect they could have crafted one that he would have signed, that I still would have opposed. And I have a choice to make. Do I stand on the sidelines and complain about it? Or do I get in a room and do my best to have it reflect the principles that my constituents want me to try to include in such legislation. And I chose the latter course. The bottom line for the Democrats was that people who are here illegally today needed, at some point, under some conditions, to be able to have the hope that they could become citizens. In order to get the things that we insisted on in the legislation, we had to concede that point. ELLIOTT: What things did you want to have? Sen. KYL: We had a couple of things that related directly to that automatic path to citizenship. And it's no longer automatic. There are a variety of things that they have to do, including applying for the green card from outside the country, the country of their origin, and also not getting ahead in line of anybody else, in addition to the fines and the other features. Secondly, my constituents complained about the fact that if these illegal immigrants are allowed to become citizens, they will simply chain migrant all of their distant relatives into the country, which they can do under the law today. We have eliminated chain migration in the law for everybody forevermore. And finally, just to mention one of the key things that we wanted to be sure, is that the temporary worker program that's established in the legislation is, indeed, temporary. In other words, people come here and they work for a couple of works and then they return home. There is no automatic green card for the temporary workers. ELLIOTT: Now, I understand some business interests are not exactly pleased with the idea of a guest-worker program that caused people to work for two years, then go home for a year and then come back for two years because of the stability issue. Wouldn't this be a problem for, say, agri-business in Arizona? Sen. KYL: No. As a matter of fact, I've been very closed to the agri-business folks here. I just spoke to the Agri-Business Council yesterday. What we've established here is a temporary worker program that you properly describe. Say, you could either have a seasonal worker who comes here for 10 months and then returns home for two years and then comes back again. Or, you can get a two-year visa, and then you have to go home for a year, and you can renew that twice. It is true that many businesses would rather simply have a worker come here and stay here forever. That however would recreate the situation we have today, and what we wanted and what the Mexican government wanted was circularity. That is to say, workers coming from a country like Mexico to earn some money, learn a skill and then return back to their home country and apply that money and skill to make their own country better, not to set down a stake here in the United States. ELLIOTT: Senator Kyl, this bill is a real break with American tradition, in a way, it will determine who can get on the path to citizenship. You get points for certain things, weight given to education, to English skills, to other high technical skills, and less important is being put on family ties. Aren't immigrants most needed, however, for unskilled work in this country? Forty percent of farm workers are immigrants, for example. Twenty-seven percent of construction workers are immigrants. Sen. KYL: In sheer volume, there are probably more unskilled workers than there are skilled workers. That's one of the reasons why we have a temporary work program. They will predominantly be peopled by the lesser skilled and lesser skilled, but they are only here to earn some money for their family back home and then they return home. Our immigration laws have always recognized the importance of family. In fact, we have been unique in that regard and in about 70 percent of our visas were used by family migration rather than employment migration. Most of the countries in the world have that flipped. After this bill is over, it's going to be above 50-50. It will still be about 51 percent family. ELLIOTT: Senator Cornyn of Texas, another border state, was a negotiator on this deal, but had second thoughts and now does not embrace it. You served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. You're in a leadership position. How are you going to bring him in and other fellow Republicans on this bill? Sen. KYL: First of all, I'm not going to try to bring anybody. We will present all of the facts and members can make up their own minds and they each have their own constituency. And they need to do what they think is best within their own conscience. Senator Cornyn, who you mentioned, is actually the vice chairman of the conference. And what he has said is that he wants to wait to see the language. And he's right. The language was only finished just a little before midnight last night. And it better reflect the agreement as I understand it, or I wouldn't support it. And if it doesn't accurately reflect the agreement, then I think you'll see a lot of people decide that they can't support it. ELLIOTT: So senators will be spending this weekend going over that language? Sen. KYL: Well, probably their staffs will, and then they'll show up Monday morning and say, okay, staff, what does it say? ELLIOTT: Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, thank you for speaking with us. Sen.

Ten years ago yesterday, in a commencement address, then President Bill Clinton set the goal of developing an HIV vaccine in a decade. President BILL CLINTON: And it cannot come a day too soon. If America commits to find an AIDS vaccine and we enlist others in our cause, we will do it. ELLIOTT: Today, doctors still cannot immunize people against HIV infection, and researchers are beginning to shift their understanding of what a possible vaccine might look like. To better understand the current state of HIV vaccine research, we turn to Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That's the division of the National Institutes of Health responsible for AIDS research. Welcome to the program, Dr. Fauci. Dr. ANTHONY FAUCI (Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Thank you very much. It's nice to be here. ELLIOTT: It's been 10 years since President Clinton announced his goal. But it's actually been 20 years since the first HIV vaccine tests were conducted. Why has it been so difficult to devise an HIV vaccine - one that completely prevents infection? Dr. FAUCI: The reason is that the virus itself is really very unique in how it interacts with the body's immune system. Generally, when you make vaccines to common often very serious illnesses like polio or smallpox or measles, what you do is you mimic with your vaccine the way the body naturally responds to these viruses because at the end of the day, the bodies does, generally, very well even though people get sick and some people die. So you design a vaccine to induce the same kind of immune response that the body would do against the natural infection. Unfortunately, with HIV, that's not the case. Because HIV is not handled very well, ultimately, by the body at all, in fact, it's virtually the only infection we know where the body is just incapable of eradicating it after the infection gets established. So we have to do something a little bit different. And that's what the scientists have been talking about lately is what we call getting away from the classical paradigm of developing a vaccine and doing something that would aim at a little different goal, perhaps, not necessarily preventing initial infection but actually blocking the progression of disease and keeping the level of virus low so that people can go for extended periods of time without therapy and perhaps even decrease the possibility that they'll infect others. So that's a whole new different way because HIV is really a very different kind of a virus. ELLIOTT: We don't hear as much about the search for an AIDS vaccine as we used to. But we do hear a lot about the success of new drugs that allow people with HIV to live longer lives. Has that at all taken pressure off researchers who were looking for a vaccine? Dr. FAUCI: No, not at all. You haven't heard about it because they haven't been the kinds of major breakthroughs that have occurred with therapy, where you actually get a combination of good drugs and you could completely transform the lives of people who are HIV infected. We know now the results are really astounding. And even better drugs are coming along. What we're seeing with the HIV vaccine research, it's steadily progressing clearly in the right direction, but not any big breakthrough that's transforming that would capture the attention or the imagination of the general public. ELLIOTT: When we talk about a vaccine that is not in the classic sense of what we all think of when we go get our children their immunization shot, what are we talking about? How would this affect people and who would you give it to? Dr. FAUCI: Well, you would give it to the same people who are in relatively high-risk category. So that would not change whether you have a classical vaccine or what we're calling the non-classical. Now, the first step towards success may be that you actually vaccinate someone may not necessarily prevent them getting infected but you would prevent the inexpiable development of serious disease, not necessarily eliminate it but delay it. Importantly, the vaccine might in fact blunt the level of virus so that when people are infected, they don't have high levels of virus, which make it more likely that they would infect others. We know very clearly that there is a direct relationship between the level of virus circulating in person's body and the probability of their infecting someone else. It's not the homerun you want, but it's the first step towards where we want to be. ELLIOTT: Isn't there a bit of a risk there that if this type of a vaccine were developed and it only offers a limited protection, that that could give people some sort of false sense of security? Dr. FAUCI: Yeah. That's certainly is, and that's why a major part of the program of this type of development of the vaccine is the education that it cannot be a stand-alone countermeasure. If you get a vaccine like this, it has to be part of a very comprehensive prevention program so that you cannot say I'm vaccinated therefore I'm good to go, I'm free of getting infected. It has to be part of the same kind of preventive measures that you would use even if you were not vaccinated. ELLIOTT: Are researchers still looking for that silver bullet? Do you think there ever will be a classic vaccine for HIV? Dr. FAUCI: Undoubtedly, there's no question about it, and we emphasize this whenever we discussed the non-classical approach. This is not a substitute for the trying - for getting the homerun that I talked about. Research is still gauged at trying to get a vaccine that would completely prevent infection. Do I think we, ultimately, will get a vaccine? I think so. I don't know how many years from now, but that would be that we get the typical, classical vaccine. But I do think we can say there is some cautious optimism that we'd be able to get some effect from a non-classical approach. ELLIOTT: Dr. Anthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Thank you for speaking with us. Dr. FAUCI: Thank you. You're quite welcome.

And while the names in play may be familiar only in particular Washington circles, their various policy priorities are bound to influence efforts to reduce global poverty. To help us understand the World Bank's role in fighting poverty around the world, we've called Jeffrey Sachs. He is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the author of \"The End of Poverty. \" He joins us from an airport in Vancouver, British Columbia. Thanks so much for being with us. Mr. JEFFREY SACHS (Director, Earth Institute, Columbia University; Author, \"The End of Poverty\"): A pleasure to be with you. ROBERTS: To begin with, what essential role does the World Bank play in fighting global poverty? Mr. SACHS: The bank was set up to provide finance, money, to help poor countries and originally, the post-World War II countries in disarray to invest their way out of disaster. The reconstruction phase ended decades ago, but unfortunately, the challenge of extreme poverty remains with us today. So the bank's main role is to help the poorest places in the world to make the investments, to get out of poverty. ROBERTS: And Paul Wolfowitz' tenure was marked particularly by his concentration on fighting corruption. How important is that as a policy goal? Mr. SACHS: Well, I think his period was basically a failure, but it continues a fairly long stretch of World Bank disarray. The bank is, I think, basically misguided for many, many years in failing to step up to core investments. It went off on many, many different angles - corruption crusades being one of them - rather than focusing on how to get the job done of the basic investments that desperately poor people need so that they will no longer be desperately poor, whether it's in roads, or electricity to reach villages or bed nets and medicines to fight malaria. ROBERTS: So if Wolfowitz' successor veered from the anticorruption priority, that would not break your heart? Mr. SACHS: Well, I think the key question is whether the World Bank continues simply parroting the ideology of the U. S. to privatize everything it can find to make the poor pay for their health or education, or to try to make roads, power, water, all private sector paying concerns, which is something that might make sense when you're a developed country to an extent, but it makes no sense at all when we're dealing with the world's poorest people. ROBERTS: Well, then that begs the question whether the World Bank is relevant at all anymore. I mean, during the Wolfowitz brouhaha, there were murmurs from European countries that maybe they'd just bypass the bank and do it on their own. Could that happen? Mr. SACHS: It will happen progressively if the bank doesn't change direction. The bank is potentially, extremely important. It still has the core need that it had when it was established way back at the end of World War II. But it's not doing a good job. And given the poor job it's doing, it is marginalizing itself. Part of the problem is that one president after another has not been properly trained and experienced in development. Wolfowitz was an appointment that absolutely never should have been made. It's been one banker after another or one political crony of the president. And the result of all of this is that the bank has really lost direction and has most importantly been ineffective for many, many years. ROBERTS: Do you think there was a time when they were more effective when they focused on larger capital projects? Mr. SACHS: There was a time when the bank did better, but there has never been a time when the bank could potentially do as well as it can do right now. The tools - whether to fight hunger or to fight disease or to extend power, to expand infrastructure - are better than ever. So the potential to enable every place in the world stuck in extreme poverty to get out of the poverty trap is as strong as it's ever been. And if the next bank president knows what he or she is doing, there is a tremendous opportunity to do good. If it's yet another political appointee without the background and experience, the bank will dig itself deeper into irrelevance. ROBERTS: Jeffrey Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the author of \"The End of Poverty. \" Thanks so much, go catch your plane. Mr. SACHS: Yeah, thank you very much. Great to talk to you. (Soundbite of music) ROBERTS: You're listening to NPR News.  REBECCA ROBERTS, host:  The ink was hardly dry on World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz' resignation when international development experts began handicapping his potential successors. And while the names in play may be familiar only in particular Washington circles, their various policy priorities are bound to influence efforts to reduce global poverty.  To help us understand the World Bank's role in fighting poverty around the world, we've called Jeffrey Sachs. He is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the author of \"The End of Poverty. \" He joins us from an airport in Vancouver, British Columbia. Thanks so much for being with us.  Mr. JEFFREY SACHS (Director, Earth Institute, Columbia University; Author, \"The End of Poverty\"): A pleasure to be with you.  ROBERTS: To begin with, what essential role does the World Bank play in fighting global poverty?  Mr. SACHS: The bank was set up to provide finance, money, to help poor countries and originally, the post-World War II countries in disarray to invest their way out of disaster. The reconstruction phase ended decades ago, but unfortunately, the challenge of extreme poverty remains with us today. So the bank's main role is to help the poorest places in the world to make the investments, to get out of poverty.

Based mostly on two classified reports, it showed that many of the predictions made by U. S. intelligence agencies in the months before the invasion were accurate - that post-Saddam Iraq would face sectarian violence, that al-Qaida and Iran will try to exploit the situation, and that building a democracy in Iraq would be a long and difficult process. Several other predictions, however, proved untrue including expectations that Iraq's oil supplies would boom and that terrorism would dissipate in three to five years. Senator Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. And he joins us by phone. Thank you senator for you time. Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER (Democrat, West Virginia; Chairman, Senate Intelligence Committee): Oh, thank you. HANSEN: What do you think this report shows? Sen. ROCKEFELLER: I think it shows that the intelligence community as a whole, all 18 branches in the government of the intelligence, gave the administration plenty of warning about the difficulties that we would face in Iraq. These warnings were widely distributed to the highest levels and I think the administration either didn't read them or certainly didn't follow their advice. HANSEN: Isn't hindsight 20/20 though? I mean, some of the predictions were not so accurate. And there are several Republicans who are saying that this report cherry-picks certain issues. Sen. ROCKEFELLER: Yeah, and I - and that will always happen. But the cherry picking, in fact, was done - of intelligence was done by the president. I mean, they wanted to go to war in Iraq. They wanted to take down Saddam. And they had to create or ignore the intelligence that would make that possible. HANSEN: The central question whether or not the intelligence on Iraq was manipulated publicly to make a case for war - can that question really be addressed fairly by the committee? Senator Kit Bond, the Republican from Missouri, says that the committee's work has become embroiled in politics and partisanship. Sen. ROCKEFELLER: All during the whole process of this people never said that. People never said this is a partisan - we're arguing this in the partisan way. It was all focused on the content. And in fact, we didn't even give our own formal conclusions, because we decided that we want to let the intelligence speak for itself. HANSEN: What difference does this information make to the situation on the ground in Iraq now? Sen. ROCKEFELLER: Intelligence is at the head of the spear of war fighting. You don't fight a war until you know the intelligence; you know what the circumstances are going to be. We do this not because we expect to change present policy. We do this because we never want any administration to avoid the discipline of professional intelligence people who spend their whole lives working on different areas of the world and give us better intelligence than we could get from anywhere else. HANSEN: You voted for the resolution. Did you have any access to any of this information beforehand? Sen. ROCKEFELLER: I voted for the - enabling the president to go to war. Earlier in 2002 when I got to see the intelligence, a lot of which they withheld from us, remember this was classified, people think that through on the intelligence committee that you get everything which is classified - you don't. You don't get it unless the administration tells you that you can have it, that they decide to give it to you. With respect to the October vote, really, none of that intelligence was possessed by the people who voted for that war. And that's kind of shocking in itself.

I'm Debbie Elliott. The FBI says it has foiled a terrorist plot to attack John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Authorities have arrested three men and are seeking a fourth suspect. It's the second report of a homegrown terrorism plot disrupted in this country in the last month. NPR's FBI correspondent Dina Temple-Raston is here with the details. Dina, what was this plot? DINA TEMPLE-RASTON: Well, the FBI complaint alleges that four men, Russel Defreitas, Abdul Kadir, Kareem Ibrahim and Abdel Nur, all wanted to attack JFK by planting explosives around fuel tanks and a pipeline there. What worries investigators about this plot was it had an international flavor. The group allegedly had tapped into an international network of Muslim extremists from the United States, Guyana and Trinidad. The FBI even says that they presented this plan to the senior leadership of this extremist group called Jamaat al Muslimeen or JAM. And they were actually responsible for a bloody coup attempt in Trinidad in 1990. ELLIOTT: According to the FBI, how close were they to actually carrying out this plan? TEMPLE-RASTON: Not all that close. The FBI has been really quick to say that there was never any danger to the airport or the neighborhood around the airport because they'd infiltrated this group when the plan was first hatched. One of the men actually recruited a man who was an FBI informant. So that gave him someone on the inside, basically from the beginning. And also the group didn't have the explosive they need to carry out the attack. They'd done a lot of surveillance, but they really didn't the tools they needed to go through it. Although, one FBI agent told me that they were very determined and very methodical as they started setting up to plan. ELLIOTT: How much is known about these suspects? TEMPLE-RASTON: We don't know an awful lot. We know they were Muslim. We know one, Russell Defreitas, was an American citizen from Brooklyn. And he'd worked at JFK apparently in their cargo area. Abdul Kadir was a citizen of Guyana and had actually been a mayor and a parliamentarian there, and his connections were one of things that really worried FBI investigators. Kareem Ibrahim was a citizen of Trinidad and is custody there. And then this fourth defendant, Abdel Nur, is also in Guyana, but he's still at large. ELLIOTT: Dina, is there any link between this alleged plot and the one announced last month involving men from New Jersey who were suspected of planning an attack on Fort Dix? TEMPLE-RASTON: No, there's no link. But what they have in common is that they're both homegrown terrorism groups. And this is a sort of new phenomenon. One of my law enforcement sources called this group Fort Dix Light. And you recall that last month, the FBI arrested those men for allegedly planning an attack against Fort Dix soldiers. And that group was largely made up of Albanian brothers and their friends. And they'd actually purchased guns to attack the base. And the FBI had again infiltrated the group ahead of time and had been tracking their movements. This latest alleged plot is different because the men did not buy weapons or explosives they needed to carry out the attack. And then there's this very specific foreign component - not al-Qaida - but foreign and it's connected to Guyana. And this Caribbean connection is really new to the FBI. This is something that they'll be looking at in the coming days. ELLIOTT: NPR's Dina Temple-Raston. Thank you. TEMPLE-RASTON: And my pleasure.

I'm Jacki Lyden. Debbie Elliott is on assignment. After protests in Italy yesterday, President Bush received a warm reception from the people of Albania. As he neared the end of his eight-day European tour, Mr. Bush met with Albania's prime minister. They discussed the thorny issue of the future status of Kosovo; and Mr. Bush pledged continued support for Albania, a formerly communist country as it attempts to build a democracy. NPR's Don Gonyea reports from the capital city of Tirana. DON GONYEA: This is something that has never happened before in Albania. (Soundbite of song, \"Star Spangled Banner\") GONYEA: The playing of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" as a sitting U. S. president pays a visit. Ceremonial cannon fire accompanied the music. (Soundbite of cannon fire) GONYEA: Albania is one of the poorest nations in Europe and it's still new to democracy. It's emerging from decades of rule by an oppressive dictator after World War II, and from a period of domination by the Soviets. It held its first-ever democratic election for president in 1992. This country is intensely pro-American. This week, it renamed the street in front of the Parliament after President Bush. It has also issued a series of postage stamps bearing his likeness. President Bush had no big public speech during this visit. The average person could, at best, hope for a glimpse of the motorcade. Thousands did line the streets and gather in the city square to mark the day. They waved American and Albanian flags; some wore tall, Uncle Sam-style top hats. Fifty-year-old Lujaran Alba(ph) was there. Mr. LUJARAN ALBA (Resident, Albania): For me personally and for Albanian people, the U. S. state is a dream country. There is no question; U. S. is a dream country, right? GONYEA: That sentiment was voiced by many in the crowd and it was echoed by Prime Minister Sali Berisha at a joint news conference with the president. He spoke through an interpreter. Prime Minister SALI BARISHA (Albania): (Through translator) Today is a great day, historic for all Albanians. Among us is the greatest and most distinguished guest we have ever had in all times. GONYEA: Prime Minister Berisha and President Bush talked about independence for neighboring Kosovo where the population is mostly ethnic Albanian. Kosovo is technically still part of Serbia. It's lived under U. N. administration since NATO forces intervened in 1999 to stop Serbian repression. Now, President Bush is pushing for a United Nations process by which Kosovo would gain independence. And today, he voiced some frustration over the pace of things at the U. N. President GEORGE W. BUSH: At some point in time, sooner rather than later, you got to say, enough's enough, Kosovo is independent. And that's the position we've taken. GONYEA: Among those who opposed Kosovo independence is Russia. Another topic today was Albania's bid to join the NATO alliance. Berisha said it's a priority. He said military reforms are underway and that they are working toward meeting all of NATO's requirements for admission. President Bush said he hopes to soon see the day when he can welcome Albania to NATO. One big reason for this trip was for the president to thank Albania for sending a few hundred troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. The prime minister told President Bush, he could continue to count on whatever modest contributions his country can make in the fight against international terrorism.

(Soundbite of cannon fire)  GONYEA: Albania is one of the poorest nations in Europe and it's still new to democracy. It's emerging from decades of rule by an oppressive dictator after World War II, and from a period of domination by the Soviets. It held its first-ever democratic election for president in 1992. This country is intensely pro-American. This week, it renamed the street in front of the Parliament after President Bush. It has also issued a series of postage stamps bearing his likeness.  President Bush had no big public speech during this visit. The average person could, at best, hope for a glimpse of the motorcade. Thousands did line the streets and gather in the city square to mark the day. They waved American and Albanian flags; some wore tall, Uncle Sam-style top hats. Fifty-year-old Lujaran Alba(ph) was there.  Mr. LUJARAN ALBA (Resident, Albania): For me personally and for Albanian people, the U. S. state is a dream country. There is no question; U. S. is a dream country, right?  GONYEA: That sentiment was voiced by many in the crowd and it was echoed by Prime Minister Sali Berisha at a joint news conference with the president. He spoke through an interpreter.  Prime Minister SALI BARISHA (Albania): (Through translator) Today is a great day, historic for all Albanians. Among us is the greatest and most distinguished guest we have ever had in all times.  GONYEA: Prime Minister Berisha and President Bush talked about independence for neighboring Kosovo where the population is mostly ethnic Albanian. Kosovo is technically still part of Serbia. It's lived under U. N. administration since NATO forces intervened in 1999 to stop Serbian repression. Now, President Bush is pushing for a United Nations process by which Kosovo would gain independence. And today, he voiced some frustration over the pace of things at the U. N.  President GEORGE W. BUSH: At some point in time, sooner rather than later, you got to say, enough's enough, Kosovo is independent. And that's the position we've taken.  GONYEA: Among those who opposed Kosovo independence is Russia. Another topic today was Albania's bid to join the NATO alliance. Berisha said it's a priority. He said military reforms are underway and that they are working toward meeting all of NATO's requirements for admission. President Bush said he hopes to soon see the day when he can welcome Albania to NATO.  One big reason for this trip was for the president to thank Albania for sending a few hundred troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. The prime minister told President Bush, he could continue to count on whatever modest contributions his country can make in the fight against international terrorism.

But first, let's kick things off with headlines. Today, we start in Sudan where the conflict in Darfur continues. Today, the Baltimore Sun ran a story saying we are more buddy-buddy with the Sudanese government than you might think. President Bush has issued new sanctions against Sudan, but the Sun says the CIA is still working with Sudanese intelligence officials. Why? Well, to penegrate - penetrate insurgence groups in Iraq. Sudan is a predominantly Sunni Arab country. Many foreign fighters heading to Iraq pass through Sudan that makes intelligence gathering far easier for them than for us. That is also why the State Department recently called Sudan, quote, \"a strong partner in the war on terror. \" But it makes for an awkward conflict of interest too, as the Sun points out. If Sudan feeds our intelligence needs, will the U. S. not argue as forcefully that their government changed its policy in Darfur? That's a tough question that only history will answer. Our next headline hits a little closer to home, Montpelier Station, Virginia, that is, home of one of America's founding fathers, James Madison. According to today's Washington Post, it was an unusual reunion at Madison's Estate this weekend. The Montpelier Slave Descendants Reunion gathered descendants of those thought to hail from the more than 100 slaves owned by Madison. But one woman, Bettye Kearse, a 64-year-old pediatrician, believes she's not just descendant from one of Madison's slaves, she says that she has descended from Madison himself. And this weekend she offered up her DNA to prove it. A link can't be confirmed, though, without a swab from a known male descendent of Madison's. The founding father had no children with his wife Dolly, but Kearse believed he fathered a child out of wedlock with the slave cook named Doreen(ph). Kearse recently found the descendant of one of Madison's brothers. She hopes he's willing to offer up a DNA swab, and perhaps, open a new page in American history.

S. , we're joined by retired Four-Star Army General Barry McCaffrey. General McCaffrey, thanks for being with us. General BARRY P. McCAFFREY (U. S. Army, Retired): Yeah. Good to be with you. NORRIS: Now, earlier, General Joseph Fil, commander of the U. S. Forces in Baghdad, said last week in an interview with MORNING EDITION that his nightmare, the thing that keeps him up at night was a failure of Iraqi security forces to somehow catastrophically, mixed with a major mosque-type catastrophe, and that's exactly what we're seeing today. What does this meant to the U. S. military? Gen. McCAFFREY: Well, we're about to find out in the next 10 to 30 days. There's already a rather bitter Civil War going on in Iraq. I mean, it's hard to characterize it as anything but that. And it's exacerbated by a perception, certainly among the Sunnis, that the Iraqi police, the national police in particular, and much of the Iraqi army in their view are Shiite militants in uniform. And in terms of the national commando police are largely responsible for the vicious ethnic cleansing that's already occurred in Baghdad. Basically, the Sadr gang, the Mahdi Army, has ethnically cleansed much of the mixed neighborhoods of Baghdad. So, you know, one looks at this kind of provocative event - and without question, probably carried out by al-Qaida in Iraq, a largely extremist Iraqi organization - as just another accelerant to a firestorm that's already raging in Iraq. NORRIS: Well, and a firestorm that the U. S. is trying to put out with this so-called surge. And during this period, Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army has largely laid low. And if he decides or if they decide to sort of step up action following this, what can the U. S. do? How much harder can they press their thumb on the city? Gen. McCAFFREY: Well, it's a very troublesome situation. You're quite right. The jam - the al-Mahdi Army did indeed go into low profile. Many of their leaders moved south into Shia areas near Basra. Sadr himself has alleged to have gone to Iran. There's a good argument that he purposely gave up to coalition authorities -the renegade elements of his forces - for us, the U. S. , to go in and prune these commanders. And there's a good argument. He's been basically holding his fire waiting for the ultimate struggle that will come in the coming 24 months as we withdraw form Iraq. And withdraw, we will. So I think it's inevitable that Sadr and his - he's got the largest armed force in Iraq that response to, you know, a single direction. So, we'll have to see. I think it's a cause of enormous concern right now. If Sadr City goes up in flames, it'll be extremely difficult for General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to continue all these political reconciliation talks which have been showing some promising signs in the last 90 days. NORRIS: Gen. Petraeus has called this a test of wills with a barbaric and adaptable enemy. How does the U. S. military deal with this situation where two sides seemed to be itching and eager to get to an open Civil War rather than a simmering one, where both sides seems to be eager, and perhaps even more eager now, to ramp up, to escalate the tension? Gen. McCAFFREY: Well, it's hard to imagine that U. S. Armed Forces alone will be the principal element to have these people draw back from all out savage Civil War. I think they can and will - we're obviously seeing some objective evidence that there's an - 14,000 Sunni boys went down and joined the Iraqi police out in Anbar province. There has been undoubtedly a cut of some 50 percent in the so-called sectarian torture murders that were up around a hundred a day. So you know, there's been some good arguments that the enhanced presence - we're up to 20 U. S. combat brigades in Iraq now - has given some level of enhanced security. But inside that bubble of security, allegedly, Mr. Maliki and his government would form a greater political consensus. That doesn't appear to have happened. So, so far, the jury is out. But I think there's tremendous levels of understandable anxiety in the part of the U. S. Armed Forces who, I might add, are losing now probably a battalion a month, killed and wounded U. S. Army and Marines and Special Operations Forces, a very costly exercise for these brave young troops. NORRIS: General, you've argued on op-ed pages recently that the U. S. military needs one last chance to succeed in Iraq. You've said that by the beginning of next year that the U. S. be forced to downsize its deployment because of strain that the Army might actually begin to unravel if they don't do that. Gen. McCAFFREY: Right. NORRIS: Do you think that there's still hope that the U. S. can win in Iraq? Gen. McCAFFREY: Well, I can. I'm not sure I would designate it as a win. I do think it's possible that Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus and 160,000 brave troops might give the Iraqis the opportunity to back away from all out Civil War. I sure hope that's the case. Twenty-nine thousand killed and wounded and $300 billion. And there's a huge downside if we don't succeed. NORRIS: General Barry McCaffrey is a retired four-star general.

Conyers entered the House of Representatives in 1964, it was the peak of the civil rights movement and racial tensions ran high. That same year in Mississippi, two black teenagers Henry Dee and Charles Moore disappeared. Their bodies we're discovered weeks later dumped in a channel of the Mississippi River. Late yesterday, reputed Klansman James Ford Seale was convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy in connection with their deaths. For more on the case, we've got Emily Wagster Pettus, a reporter for the Associated Press. Welcome. Ms. EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS (Reporter, Associated Press): Thank you. CHIDEYA: So Seale was convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy, why wasn't he charged with murder? Ms. WAGSTER PETTUS: Actually, I'm not sure that the persecutors - maybe didn't try to get a murder charge brought before the grand jury. But, this is what they were able to get, and they did say in their closing argument, that there's no statute of limitations on kidnapping that results in somebody's death. CHIDEYA: So can you describe the atmosphere in the courtroom and who was there? Ms. WAGSTER PETTUS: It was an interesting time in the courtroom. There were about half-dozen members of Mr. Seale's family who sat behind him on one side, and there were a couple of dozen siblings and cousins and other relatives of the victims who sat on the other side. And there was very little interaction between the two groups. Let me tell you something about the courtroom where they had the trial. This is something that I think might have been lost on a lot of people, but in this courtroom there is velvet curtain across the top of the front behind the judge. And that curtain covers up a 1938 Works Progress Administration mural that is essentially an allegory of white supremacy. You have for the protector figure of the white man in the center, and you have black people picking cotton and one of them playing a banjo. Now, this has been covered up by order of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals since the late '70s or early '80s. And a lot of people don't actually know what's up behind that curtain, but it's just, sort of, an interesting quirk of history that this mural is still there and it's now in a courtroom where the chief judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, Judge Wingate, is of course, African-American. And he's presiding in this courtroom. Judge Henry Wingate is a native of Jackson, grew up here, went to undergraduate school at Grinnell in Iowa, and he got his law degree from Yale. He is African-American. He was appointed to the bench in 1985 by President Reagan. And he's very thorough and methodical. CHIDEYA: And who were the compelling witnesses in this case? Ms. PETTUS: The star witness for the government was a confessed Klansman named Charles Marcus Edwards. He had known Mr. Seale basically all of their lives. They grew up in the same, very rural area. And Mr. Edwards was granted immunity from prosecution. He testified that he and Mr. Seale both took part in these deadly attacks and he gave lots of details and he named some names. CHIDEYA: You know, it's been a situation where a lot of murders or deaths from the past have turned into convictions for older men. What does the community think about a case like this? Ms. PETTUS: There are a lot of people who think that really they should just let bygones be bygones and let these old men just go on about their lives, but there are a whole lot of other people who think that it's never too late to pursue justice in cases like this. CHIDEYA: Speaking of justice, what do you see as the possible outcomes in terms of prison? What's on the table for this man? Ms. PETTUS: He faces up to life in prison for each of these three counts that he was convicted on. And, you know, it's really anybody's guess how the judge will sentence him, but I think a lot of people will be surprised if he got anything less than life. CHIDEYA: How significant would a strong sentence be in this case? Ms. PETTUS: I think that it would be very significant if he got life in prison. I think it would the message that, you know, like the families were saying yesterday, it's never too late to pursue justice. And I feel like - of course, the victims' families would think that the strongest sentence would be very appropriate. CHIDEYA: Is there a timeline from here on out in terms of him proceeding to the sentencing phase, and do you know if his lawyers are planning to appeal? Ms. PETTUS: They will appeal and the sentencing is August 24th. CHIDEYA: Emily, thank you so much. Ms. PETTUS: You're welcome. CHIDEYA: Emily Wagster Pettus is a reporter for the Associated Press.

ELLIOTT: Do you know who's responsible for Wednesday's bombing? Maj. Gen. MIXON: I do know that the Security Guard Force that was present at the mosque and had responsible has been detained by the Iraqi government and I'm sure from that we will learn specifically who is responsible. ELLIOTT: So there is a sense that the very people who were in charge of guarding this mosque could have been part of the group that attacked it? Maj. Gen. MIXON: Well, we don't know that for sure. But certainly they had the responsible. They were present at the time of the bombing. There were no shots fired to cause them to flee the scene so it has to be investigated. The Iraqis are doing this and I'm sure they will find out ultimately who's responsible. ELLIOTT: Who was in charge of protecting the shrine? Maj. Gen. MIXON: There are Iraqi security forces located at every shrine and mosque that are of significance around the country. The Iraqis do this, of course, obviously these are holy places that we respect and they guard them. So these are guard forces that are trained to guard these particular areas. ELLIOTT: There had been reports as well that some other mosques have been attacked, some Sunni mosques in reprisal for this. And witnesses are saying that security forces are not responding to those attacks. What does this whole picture say about the ability of Iraqi forces to provide security? Maj. Gen. MIXON: Oh, I have not seen anything like that in my area of responsibility. What I have seen is Iraqi security forces from the prime minister on down went immediately to Samara. They moved additional forces into that area. I was in Samara today, meeting with those security forces, and they have the situation in Samara in the surrounding areas well enhanced. So, well, at least in that case, they reacted firmly, quickly and took control of the situation. I have seen reports that some mosques have been vandalized and attacked in southern Iraq. But we're watching that very closely, along with Iraqi security forces and we will keep an eye out to see if we have any escalation. ELLIOTT: What makes you so confident that this is an isolated incident and that it doesn't have something broader to say about Iraqi security forces? Maj. Gen. MIXON: Well, I wouldn't call it an isolated incident per se. But what causes me to be positive about this is the quick reaction of the Iraqi security forces. You know, these kinds of things are going to happen. But when you see the Iraqi security forces respond very positively, it makes you feel good about what they're capable of doing. ELLIOTT: General Benjamin Mixon is the U. S. commander for northern Iraq. He joined us from Tikrit. Thank you so much. Maj. Gen. MIXON: Thank you. Have a good day. (Soundbite of music) ELLIOTT: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:  In Baghdad today, the commander of U. S. forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus announced a new push to root out al-Qaida strongholds.  General DAVID PETRAEUS (Commander, Multinational Force Iraq): We have in fact just launched offensive operations in a number of areas around Baghdad in particular to go in to areas that were sanctuaries in the past of al-Qaida and from which they have launched car bombs and so forth.  ELLIOTT: General Petraeus conferred today with Defense Secretary Gates who was visiting Baghdad. Secretary Gates also met with Iraqi leaders urging them to move more quickly toward political reconciliation.  The prospect of reconciliation seemed to dim this week when a major Shiite shrine in Samara was bombed for the second time in 16 months. Several Sunni mosques have been targeted in apparent reprisal attacks. Last year's bombing in Samara sparked a surge in sectarian fighting in Iraq and U. S. officials have said another such attack would be their nightmare scenario.  Here to talk with us about Wednesday's bombing and the security situation there is Major General Benjamin Mixon, the U.

Welcome to the program. Mr. BOB BARR (Former Republican Representative, Georgia): Good morning, great to be with you all. YDSTIE: In the Journal, you make the case that letting gays served openly in the military is consistent with true conservative political philosophy. Talk a little bit about the conservative argument on the philosophical level for making this change. Mr. BARR: True conservatives - and I do consider myself a true conservative, I'm very active these days with the Libertarian Party - but true conservatives purport to believe that one ought to advance and one ought to have those opportunities based on the merits of one's capabilities, especially in the military, which is supposed to be a meritocracy. And that does not mean that their advancement or their staying in the service should be dependent on their own personal, sexual preferences. YDSTIE: And you suggest that a Zogby poll reports that the majority of returning servicemen from Iraq and Afghanistan are comfortable with gays in the military. Mr. BARR: This is something that has impressed me greatly. Back when this issue was hotly debated in the early and mid-1990s and, even though I was not in the Congress at the time the initial policy was implemented, I came in shortly thereafter. But at that time, there was not a great deal of either factual study, historical study on the issue of how gays in the military would be perceived and worked with by others in the military. And what we're seeing in recent years is a growing and deep acceptance of gay men and women in the military so long as they adhere, as all military personnel are required to do, to the rules and regulations regarding one's behavior, then those with whom they serve apparently are very comfortable with them serving and see no problem with it. YDSTIE: You also argue for letting gays serve openly as a practical matter. I mean, the services are just having a hard time recruiting. I want to quote what you say here: \"The military is firing badly needed, capable troops simply because they're gay and replacing them with a hodgepodge that includes ex-cons, drug abusers and high school dropouts. \" That's pretty strong language. Mr. BARR: I think we saw this very clearly illustrated in the Abu Ghraib scandal over in Iraq a couple of years ago. On the one hand because of the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy, we are removing people from the military or not even recruiting people with very important and high educational level skills. And on the other hand, we seemed to be continuously lowering our standards in bringing people in to meet the number needs of our military that really don't have the appropriate skills to handle the high-pressured jobs that we're putting them into. YDSTIE: Are you optimistic that the next president, whether it's a Republican or a Democrat, will change the policy on gays in the military? Mr. BARR: Based on those that took a position at the recent Republican so-called debate, I wouldn't say I'd be optimistic at this point, although even Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney seem to leave the door open a little bit. On the Democrat side, I'd say almost certainly the policy would be altered more in the direction of the liberalization and open policy.

Here's a hint - videogames, not so bad. BROOKS: But first, firefighters in Charleston, South Carolina are mourning nine of their own today. The firefighters were killed overnight when flames tore through a furniture warehouse, sending a roof crashing down on them. They'd already rescued one warehouse employee before the roof came down. It's the highest firefighter death toll since the 9/11 terrorists attacks.  Joining us now from Charleston is Ray Gorham, a captain with the St. Andrews Fire Department, which responded to the fire. He knew some of the men who died. And Captain Gorham, thanks for joining us. I know this is a tough day for you, but we appreciate having you on. Captain RAY GORHAM (Firefighter): Thank you for having me. BROOKS: Can you talk, first of all, a little bit about the men you knew who were lost in the fire? Capt. GORHAM: Well, they were nice, good family men, Christian men, you know, being in the South, a lot of people are churchgoing. I was told even one - it was just his second day on duty. And the captain that I knew, he was two months away from retirement. BROOKS: Tell us what you know about how this fire started. Capt. GORHAM: That part is still under investigation, so I don't have a lot of details. We do know that there was still one employee in the building. From what I've been told, it is not a suspected arson fire at this time.  BROOKS: You mentioned that before the roof came down, firefighters rescued one employee in the warehouse. Can you tell us something about that? Capt. GORHAM: Yes, we were told - actually, the 911 call came from an employee in the back warehouse. And that particular building has the aluminum-siding walls. He was banging on the walls, so we were able to pinpoint his location and cut a hole in the wall and pull him to safety. BROOKS: Now, can you give us something about your understanding of what happened to the nine firefighters, how these nine firefighters were trapped? Capt. GORHAM: They were making an interior attack on the fire. Some windows were busted out or blown out, in which introduced oxygen to the heat. And it flashed over and caused the roof collapse and pretty much trapped the firefighters in there. BROOKS: Captain, obviously firefighting is dangerous work, but this is pretty unusual, a roof collapsing like this and killing nine men all at once. Do firefighters always face this kind of risk when they move into a burning building? Capt. GORHAM: Not always, because there was a lot of combustible materials in there. So that fire heated up very rapidly, and that makes conditions kind of touch and go. But being under the assumption that there were victims inside, you know, they were just doing what any firefighter would have done. BROOKS: But can anything be done to reduce or minimize this kind of risk? Or is this just part of the job that you accept each day? Capt. GORHAM: Well, to a certain degree it's part of the job. But with any tragedy, of course, it's going to bring change. BROOKS: Well, again, Captain Gorham, I want to thank you for talking to us today. I know it's a tough day for you. Thanks very much. Capt.

I just arrived with my attorney and we're just about to walk in. ADAMS: Mr. Almeida, would you please go back many years and give us a brief summary of your experience with the sexual abuse? Mr. ALMEIDA: Well, it happened at a church in Los Angeles, St. Teresa of Avila in Silver Lake. I was about - I was 11 years old. It was 1974. And the abuse was from '74 to '77. I was an altar boy at the school. Father Clinton Hagenback(ph) had come to our church. And immediately after Hagenback got to the church, I became one of his favorite altar boys. ADAMS: And so three years there at a very formative age - how traumatic was it for you? Mr. ALMEIDA: It was very traumatic. The abuse was traumatic and also the years, you know, up till today have been traumatic. It's affected my life, my whole life. ADAMS: In what way? Mr. ALMEIDA: In regards to relationships. I've been married twice, been divorced twice. I have four children. I've broken up two families. My work was - has been also affected. Just a problem with authority. Just several things, just me getting on my life, just at school, just a lot of different things that have affected me. And I, you know, I learned that through therapy and that. ADAMS: Mr. Almeida, can you, without being too personal about this, can you explain why the abuse would have caused two marriages to end? Other people get divorced. It's quite common. Mr. ALMEIDA: Well, what I was told that from the effect, being at a young age, the trauma of losing my trust and my purity to Father Clinton Hagenback, it affected me with trusting other people. I would always push out because I wanted to protect myself. And so I - that was just my thing. I would push away and I would want people to leave me alone because I was given my corner and I wouldn't want anybody to hurt me, just like he did.

And so many children are being protected. And I am so grateful for being a part of that. It's just - I mean I'm getting chills right now because I feel that's what I felt so great about, is that those children out there aren't going to be having lives like - there are a large children out there that have been saved.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: I'm Robert Siegel. And in this part of the program, Colin Powell talks about the war in Iraq and some other matters. NORRIS: Over the past several weeks, the former secretary of state has spoken with increasing openness about the nature of the war, about what went wrong, and the about the limitations of the current strategy. Sometime ago, Powell apologized for presenting an inaccurate case to the U. N. on Iraqi weapons. As you'll hear, he does not support congressional efforts to bring the troops home, but he does say the troops will have to start coming home next year because the military is stretched too thin. SIEGEL: Gen. Powell, welcome to the program. Mr. COLIN POWELL (Former Secretary of State; Retired General, U. S. Army): Thank you. SIEGEL: In recent interviews, you've said that given the lack of political progress in Baghdad the surge of U. S. troops is only likely to hold the lid on something that will boil over just the same. Given that, right now, let's say if you have a vote in the U. S. Senate, would you support a resolution that said let's change the mission, let's start getting out in a few months? Mr. POWELL: No, I would not do that. I think what's happening in the Senate now is interesting but none of this legislation is going to pass. And I think we - we're in a position where you have to let General Petraeus continue with his work and come back and report to us, but I will be more interested in what Ambassador Crocker has to say about the political situation. The way I've characterized this is that we have a civil war that's taking place. Some people don't agree with it, but that's what I think it is. And our military troops can keep a lid on this boiling pot of sectarian stew. But the main attack, as I would say as an infantry officer, has to be Iraqi political progress. And it is not sustainable for our troops just to stay over there for an indefinite period at 180,000-person strength unless there is improvement in the conditions that generate what I consider to be a civil war. So we have to have progress from the Iraqi political side. SIEGEL: How much longer can the Army and the Marine Corps, for that matter, continue to do multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan? Mr. POWELL: I'm no longer in a position to make a definitive judgment, but my experience as somebody who used to have to deal with such matters is that they probably can't keep this up at this level past the middle of next year, I would guess. This is a tremendous burden on our troops and on our families. And remember, if the Army and the Marine Corps that are carrying this burden and they have not been increased in size with these additional burdens that they are now carrying, and now that you surged them and you've extended their tours to 15 months, do you have another group just as large ready to go in. And I think it's going to be hard to do that. SIEGEL: So regardless of what the votes are and the resolutions are, you would say, if your estimate is right, mid-2008, we're going to have to start bringing down the number of troops. Mr. POWELL: I think that's right. And I don't think I am inventing any new concept. You've heard it from our military leaders. You've heard it from civilian leaders in the Department of Defense. It is not sustainable for an indefinite period at this level. SIEGEL: I want you to take us back to the run-up to the war in Iraq. You've described a meeting in August 2002 with President Bush. Two and a half hours where you outlined, as you saw them, the dangers of occupying an Arab country. On the other hand, when it was time to go to war in Iraq you say - you supported going to war. How do we get your role right? How do we best describe your position to it? Mr. POWELL: Well, you just described it. My job was to make sure the president took into consideration all of the issues that would be involved in a conflict in Iraq. And at that meeting, I laid out to him the problems we would face. We would have broken a civil government. And suddenly, we're not only the liberators, we're the occupiers. And under international law, we become the government and that's going to be expensive. It's going to take a lot of our troops for a long period of time. And it would be a political burden for a number of years. The president listened carefully, he asked me to brief his chief of staff and some others the next day, which I did. And he asked me how should we deal with this and I said let's take it to the United Nations - they are the offended party - and see if we cannot find a solution to the United Nations. And I said this may well mean that we change the nature of the regime so it is not a threat to us anymore, but we don't actually change the regime. Saddam Hussein might still be there. SIEGEL: You could have lived with Saddam Hussein - are you\u2026 Mr. POWELL: Well, nobody wanted to live with Saddam Hussein if it could be avoided. But the cost of removing him was going to be considerable. And so let's see if we can find a way through the U. N. to solve this problem. And if we got a resolution - the resolution from the U. N. didn't say go to war. It said let's see if we can get Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions that have been previously passed. And it was in my mind, all along, that if that route did not work and the president decided that military force was necessary, then I would support it. There was never a question in my mind about that. You can't say to the president, here's the alternative that you ought to try now, but if that doesn't work and you're the one who makes the judgment as to whether it's working or not then I won't be there for you on the other route. I was there. And frankly, we have to remember that on the 9th of April 2003, when Baghdad fell to our troops, everybody was thinking this was a good outcome. SIEGEL: Looked pretty successful at that time. Mr. POWELL: It was. SIEGEL: The mistake in planning for Iraq that you've discussed is that not enough troops were there to cope with the worst case. And by 2006, the bombing in Samarra and the turn to mass sectarian violence, the worst case eventuated, and the U. S. was not there in adequate force. Who, in the end, is responsible for having missed that, for having not sent enough troops over? Mr. POWELL: Well, I would say the administration has to bear the responsibility. We did not impose our will throughout the country after the fall of Baghdad. There was an expectation that things would sort of click back into place quickly. I think it was a misplaced expectation. But my colleagues in the Pentagon, who were in charge of that phase of it and should have been in charge, that is the job of the military. But I don't think it was well understood that you had to impose your order as the new government, as the occupier. And we started to cutoff the flow of troops going to Iraq. And therefore, it made it more difficult to impose order. But we also didn't demonstrate the political understanding and will needed to impose order. We thought that in a period of, oh, 90 days of consultants coming in, a government would come back in place. Or we would find a way to pass it off to the Iraqis, but that turned out not to be the case and an insurgency started. And for several months, we wouldn't acknowledge that it was an insurgency. And then I think the whole thing fundamentally changed. Long after I left, when we had the bombing of the Golden Mosque in early 2006. That fundamentally changed a difficult insurgency into sectarian conflict, which I believe meets the standard of a civil war. SIEGEL: But when I hear, when I put together your expectations of when the armed forces are just too strapped to keep on extending deployments and the lid on the boiling pot metaphor, it sounds like at some point there will be a situation in Iraq that we don't like. I mean, it will be worse than what we want to see in Iraq, but we'll have to accept it. Mr. POWELL: I think at the end of the day there will be a Shia-dominated government. That's been a given from the very beginning because the Shias are 60 percent of the population. It more than likely will be more fundamentalist a government than we would like to see, with a closer relationship with Iran than we would like to see, but it won't be dominated by Iran. The difference between Iraqi Arabs and Iranian Persians, they had a war for eight years, we have to remember. And so I hope that this government can come into being with an understanding of the need to give the Sunnis part of the power and to allow them to participate in the government. That may come about through exhaustion as a result of this sectarian conflict or they find political solutions. But right now, while we are doing a great job with our surge - and I'm so proud of our soldiers that are doing it - we do not find that the Iraqi political leadership is stepped across the line of departure and started to do what they need to do in order to reduce the source of this conflict, the disagreements that exist. We still see militias at work. We still see weaknesses in the armed forces and police forces. And those have to be dealt with and they ultimately have to be dealt with by the Iraqis. SIEGEL: A couple of other topics. First, in the Middle East peace process, would you talk to Hamas right now? Mr. POWELL: I think you'd have to find some way to talk to Hamas. I don't want to insert myself into what Secretary Rice is doing or what the president is doing. But they are not going to go away. And we have to remember that they enjoy considerable support among the Palestinian people. They won an election that we insisted upon having. And so as unpleasant a group as they may be, as distasteful as I find some of their positions, I think that through the Quartet or through some means, Hamas has to be engaged. I don't think you can just cast them into outer darkness and try to find a solution to the problems of the region without taking into account the standing that Hamas has in the Palestinian community. SIEGEL: Another matter. In dealing with Iran, should it be, either implicit or explicit, that the U. S. would resort to some kind of military strike against an Iranian target if they proceeded with a nuclear program? Mr. POWELL: No president ever will say there is no military option. That's not wise. You always want to keep maximum flexibility. But as I look at the situation, I don't see any circumstances right now that would suggest that there is any imminence of a military strike or that there are any conditions that exist that would suggest a military strike is forthcoming in the near future. SIEGEL: One other subject. From time to time, I talk with groups of voters about issues and politics, and it's now become predictable - whether it's in Virginia or Ohio or wherever - I ask people, utterly openly, are there any leaders around whom you find truly impressive and inspiring and you really would follow? And frankly, one name comes up and it's yours. It's not from everyone in the room, but it's from people who vote Democrats, vote Republicans. What do you make of this, which has now trailed you for a significant number of years? Mr. POWELL: Twelve to be precise. SIEGEL: Twelve years in which you've been considered a putative president. Mr. POWELL: I'm touched and frankly, kind of humbled that some people anyway, not all, it's not as universal as you might suggest\u2026 SIEGEL: No, no but\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) SIEGEL: \u2026there are not lots of other people mentioning other people is what\u2026 Mr. POWELL: No, I\u2026 SIEGEL: You have your detractors, but there are lots of other names you hear like that. Mr. POWELL: I'm touched, but it's kind of easy to have that sort of status when you're not out there every day like our politicians fighting over every imaginable issue from agricultural subsidies to ethanol, to you name it, and sort of be somewhat offstage. But I'm, nevertheless, touched and humbled that people would feel that way. But I am not going to be a political candidate ever. It's not in my genetic makeup. And I thought about 12 years ago. It was a very difficult period in my life, the life of my family, who went through this. But at the end of the day, you have to do what you think is the right thing for you and the country. And my wife and I, and my family and I, found other ways to serve the nation outside of political life. SIEGEL: General Colin Powell, thank you very much for talking with us. Mr. POWELL: Thank you. A pleasure. SIEGEL: Former Secretary of State Retired General Colin Powell speaking with me earlier today. Elsewhere in our program, Michele speaks with the current secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. Unlike Powell, Rice says the U. S. should not talk with Hamas. NORRIS: And on tomorrow's program, we'll hear from Iraq's ambassador to the U. S. and a top American commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus. (Soundbite of music) SIEGEL: New developments in the case against Marines charged in the deaths of Iraqis in Haditha. That is just ahead on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Michele Norris.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  I'm Robert Siegel.  And in this part of the program, Colin Powell talks about the war in Iraq and some other matters.  NORRIS: Over the past several weeks, the former secretary of state has spoken with increasing openness about the nature of the war, about what went wrong, and the about the limitations of the current strategy.  Sometime ago, Powell apologized for presenting an inaccurate case to the U. N. on Iraqi weapons. As you'll hear, he does not support congressional efforts to bring the troops home, but he does say the troops will have to start coming home next year because the military is stretched too thin.  SIEGEL: Gen. Powell, welcome to the program.  Mr. COLIN POWELL (Former Secretary of State; Retired General, U. S. Army): Thank you.  SIEGEL: In recent interviews, you've said that given the lack of political progress in Baghdad the surge of U. S. troops is only likely to hold the lid on something that will boil over just the same. Given that, right now, let's say if you have a vote in the U. S. Senate, would you support a resolution that said let's change the mission, let's start getting out in a few months?  Mr. POWELL: No, I would not do that. I think what's happening in the Senate now is interesting but none of this legislation is going to pass. And I think we - we're in a position where you have to let General Petraeus continue with his work and come back and report to us, but I will be more interested in what Ambassador Crocker has to say about the political situation.  The way I've characterized this is that we have a civil war that's taking place. Some people don't agree with it, but that's what I think it is. And our military troops can keep a lid on this boiling pot of sectarian stew. But the main attack, as I would say as an infantry officer, has to be Iraqi political progress. And it is not sustainable for our troops just to stay over there for an indefinite period at 180,000-person strength unless there is improvement in the conditions that generate what I consider to be a civil war. So we have to have progress from the Iraqi political side.  SIEGEL: How much longer can the Army and the Marine Corps, for that matter, continue to do multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan?  Mr. POWELL: I'm no longer in a position to make a definitive judgment, but my experience as somebody who used to have to deal with such matters is that they probably can't keep this up at this level past the middle of next year, I would guess.  This is a tremendous burden on our troops and on our families. And remember, if the Army and the Marine Corps that are carrying this burden and they have not been increased in size with these additional burdens that they are now carrying, and now that you surged them and you've extended their tours to 15 months, do you have another group just as large ready to go in. And I think it's going to be hard to do that.  SIEGEL: So regardless of what the votes are and the resolutions are, you would say, if your estimate is right, mid-2008, we're going to have to start bringing down the number of troops.  Mr. POWELL: I think that's right. And I don't think I am inventing any new concept. You've heard it from our military leaders. You've heard it from civilian leaders in the Department of Defense. It is not sustainable for an indefinite period at this level.  SIEGEL: I want you to take us back to the run-up to the war in Iraq. You've described a meeting in August 2002 with President Bush. Two and a half hours where you outlined, as you saw them, the dangers of occupying an Arab country. On the other hand, when it was time to go to war in Iraq you say - you supported going to war. How do we get your role right? How do we best describe your position to it?  Mr. POWELL: Well, you just described it. My job was to make sure the president took into consideration all of the issues that would be involved in a conflict in Iraq. And at that meeting, I laid out to him the problems we would face. We would have broken a civil government. And suddenly, we're not only the liberators, we're the occupiers. And under international law, we become the government and that's going to be expensive. It's going to take a lot of our troops for a long period of time. And it would be a political burden for a number of years.  The president listened carefully, he asked me to brief his chief of staff and some others the next day, which I did. And he asked me how should we deal with this and I said let's take it to the United Nations - they are the offended party - and see if we cannot find a solution to the United Nations. And I said this may well mean that we change the nature of the regime so it is not a threat to us anymore, but we don't actually change the regime. Saddam Hussein might still be there.  SIEGEL: You could have lived with Saddam Hussein - are you\u2026  Mr. POWELL: Well, nobody wanted to live with Saddam Hussein if it could be avoided. But the cost of removing him was going to be considerable. And so let's see if we can find a way through the U. N. to solve this problem. And if we got a resolution - the resolution from the U. N. didn't say go to war. It said let's see if we can get Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions that have been previously passed.  And it was in my mind, all along, that if that route did not work and the president decided that military force was necessary, then I would support it. There was never a question in my mind about that. You can't say to the president, here's the alternative that you ought to try now, but if that doesn't work and you're the one who makes the judgment as to whether it's working or not then I won't be there for you on the other route. I was there. And frankly, we have to remember that on the 9th of April 2003, when Baghdad fell to our troops, everybody was thinking this was a good outcome.  SIEGEL: Looked pretty successful at that time.  Mr. POWELL: It was.  SIEGEL: The mistake in planning for Iraq that you've discussed is that not enough troops were there to cope with the worst case. And by 2006, the bombing in Samarra and the turn to mass sectarian violence, the worst case eventuated, and the U. S. was not there in adequate force. Who, in the end, is responsible for having missed that, for having not sent enough troops over?  Mr. POWELL: Well, I would say the administration has to bear the responsibility. We did not impose our will throughout the country after the fall of Baghdad. There was an expectation that things would sort of click back into place quickly. I think it was a misplaced expectation. But my colleagues in the Pentagon, who were in charge of that phase of it and should have been in charge, that is the job of the military.  But I don't think it was well understood that you had to impose your order as the new government, as the occupier. And we started to cutoff the flow of troops going to Iraq. And therefore, it made it more difficult to impose order. But we also didn't demonstrate the political understanding and will needed to impose order. We thought that in a period of, oh, 90 days of consultants coming in, a government would come back in place. Or we would find a way to pass it off to the Iraqis, but that turned out not to be the case and an insurgency started. And for several months, we wouldn't acknowledge that it was an insurgency.  And then I think the whole thing fundamentally changed. Long after I left, when we had the bombing of the Golden Mosque in early 2006. That fundamentally changed a difficult insurgency into sectarian conflict, which I believe meets the standard of a civil war.  SIEGEL: But when I hear, when I put together your expectations of when the armed forces are just too strapped to keep on extending deployments and the lid on the boiling pot metaphor, it sounds like at some point there will be a situation in Iraq that we don't like. I mean, it will be worse than what we want to see in Iraq, but we'll have to accept it.  Mr. POWELL: I think at the end of the day there will be a Shia-dominated government. That's been a given from the very beginning because the Shias are 60 percent of the population. It more than likely will be more fundamentalist a government than we would like to see, with a closer relationship with Iran than we would like to see, but it won't be dominated by Iran. The difference between Iraqi Arabs and Iranian Persians, they had a war for eight years, we have to remember.  And so I hope that this government can come into being with an understanding of the need to give the Sunnis part of the power and to allow them to participate in the government. That may come about through exhaustion as a result of this sectarian conflict or they find political solutions. But right now, while we are doing a great job with our surge - and I'm so proud of our soldiers that are doing it - we do not find that the Iraqi political leadership is stepped across the line of departure and started to do what they need to do in order to reduce the source of this conflict, the disagreements that exist.  We still see militias at work. We still see weaknesses in the armed forces and police forces. And those have to be dealt with and they ultimately have to be dealt with by the Iraqis.  SIEGEL: A couple of other topics. First, in the Middle East peace process, would you talk to Hamas right now?  Mr. POWELL: I think you'd have to find some way to talk to Hamas. I don't want to insert myself into what Secretary Rice is doing or what the president is doing. But they are not going to go away. And we have to remember that they enjoy considerable support among the Palestinian people. They won an election that we insisted upon having.  And so as unpleasant a group as they may be, as distasteful as I find some of their positions, I think that through the Quartet or through some means, Hamas has to be engaged. I don't think you can just cast them into outer darkness and try to find a solution to the problems of the region without taking into account the standing that Hamas has in the Palestinian community.  SIEGEL: Another matter. In dealing with Iran, should it be, either implicit or explicit, that the U. S. would resort to some kind of military strike against an Iranian target if they proceeded with a nuclear program?  Mr. POWELL: No president ever will say there is no military option. That's not wise. You always want to keep maximum flexibility. But as I look at the situation, I don't see any circumstances right now that would suggest that there is any imminence of a military strike or that there are any conditions that exist that would suggest a military strike is forthcoming in the near future.  SIEGEL: One other subject. From time to time, I talk with groups of voters about issues and politics, and it's now become predictable - whether it's in Virginia or Ohio or wherever - I ask people, utterly openly, are there any leaders around whom you find truly impressive and inspiring and you really would follow? And frankly, one name comes up and it's yours. It's not from everyone in the room, but it's from people who vote Democrats, vote Republicans.

I'm Melissa Block. And we begin with two stories about the challenges of rebuilding in Iraq. Today, the man in charge of auditing the $44 billion the U. S. has spent on Iraqi reconstruction project issued his quarterly report to Congress. He is Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. And he joins us here in our studio. Thanks for coming in. Mr. STUART BOWEN (Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction): Thanks, Melissa. Good to be with you again. BLOCK: Let's start by talking about the Bechtel contract that you looked at. It's the biggest one, nearly a billion and a half dollars. What kinds of projects was Bechtel contracted to do and what did you find about how they did it? Mr. BOWEN: A variety - electricity projects, a landfill, a variety of water projects. The Baghdad landfill in fact had to be cancelled. The water - rural water sustainment project didn't do as well. And we've reported before about the Basra Children's Hospital. It is now being managed by the Corps of Engineers and will be finished 18 months from now. It was supposed to be completed 18 months ago. BLOCK: And you added it up, I think you conclude that half the job orders that Bechtel had didn't meet the stated objectives. Mr. BOWEN: In the $800 million that we looked at, that's exactly right. BLOCK: One case that Bechtel had a contract for was the Doura power station. They had $90 million to get that power plant up and running. What's happened to that? Mr. BOWEN: It was supposed to be finished in April of 2004 - two units. One unit came online in April of 2006, the other unit has never worked. And after it was transferred over to Iraqi control, because of poor operations and maintenance practices, the unit burned out. The Corps of Engineers took it over earlier this year and expect to have both units online in August. BLOCK: These asset transfers you're talking about, these are projects that the U. S. is transferring, once they're completed - transferring to the Iraqi government. I think you write that there are more than 2,000 of them and the Iraqi government hasn't accepted a single completed project since last July. Mr. BOWEN: The fact is that last July, the Iraqi Ministry of Finance, which had charge of overseeing the asset transfer program, and it had been worked out before then and was working, let it simply fall into disuse. And as a result, the transfer process has been very much a patchwork - projects transferred at the local level, many projects simply transferred unilaterally. BLOCK: Transferred unilaterally, I really don't understand how that works. If the U. S. government is transferring a completed project, and the Iraqi government isn't accepting the transfer, if it's a unilateral transfer, who's in charge? Mr. BOWEN: That's why we carried out these audits and inspections because - to raise the importance of this issue and to ensure that the question of who's in charge is properly and effectively answered. BLOCK: You have a section of your report that talks about corruption. And you describe it as a second insurgency. Mr. BOWEN: Yes. BLOCK: What do you mean by that? Mr. BOWEN: What I mean is for the Iraqi democracy to prosper, the economy must rebound. And the core of that economy - 70 percent of the GDP, 95 percent of the national budget is derived from the sale of oil and gas products. There's a serious corruption problem within oil and gas sector particularly with respect to smuggling. Until that matter is resolved, it would be difficult for that economy to begin to prosper. BLOCK: Amid the problems that you have been describing for us here, where are you seeing signs of progress in Iraq? Mr. BOWEN: The course of this year has shown increases in the outputs of both the electricity and the oil sectors. Oil has gone from 1. 9 million barrels per day produced to 2. 1 million barrels per day in this quarter. And electricity has gone from thirty-eight hundred megawatts generated on the grid to forty-two-hundred-and-thirty megawatts generated. Those trends are in the right directions. Still below pre-war levels, but progress no doubt. BLOCK: How far below pre-war levels are they? Mr. BOWEN: The pre-war level of electricity was forty-five hundred megawatts. So it's about a little under 300 megawatts below. So if the Al-Doura plant comes online, it will rise above pre-war. And the - in the oil sector, it was 2. 5 million barrels a day. So gradually getting about 400,000 short right now. BLOCK: Stuart Bowen is the special inspector general for Iraq Reconstruction. Thanks very much. Mr. BOWEN: Thank you, Melissa.

Born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Simic and his family immigrated to this country after World War II. As a teenager, he learned English and began writing poetry. Simic has published more than 20 books of poetry including \"The World Doesn't End,\" a collection of prose poems for which he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1990. A professor emeritus at the University of New Hampshire, Charles Simic joins us now from New Hampshire Public Radio. So good to have you with us. Professor CHARLES SIMIC (15th U. S. Poet Laureate; Professor Emeritus, University New Hampshire): Thank you. It's nice to be here. NEARY: And congratulations. Last week was a pretty amazing week for you. You also received the $100,000 Wallace Stevens Award for mastery in poetry from the Academy of American Poets. Have you recovered yet from this double whammy? Prof. SIMIC: No, not at all. I mean, I'm still, kind of, overwhelmed. I go to sleep very tired at night and then I wake up and just, sort of, think about my good luck. And I'm almost frightened to get out of bed. Too much good luck in one week. (Soundbite of laughter) NEARY: You're worried. Prof. SIMIC: Yeah, you know, you always feel that it should be balanced by some, you know, amount of bad luck, you know. I'll break my leg or, you know, something. (Soundbite of laughter) NEARY: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about how you began writing poetry because as I understand, you were 15 years old when you began speaking English. And pretty quickly thereafter began writing poetry in English, which seems pretty amazing for a teenage boy, I have to say. Prof. SIMIC: Well, you know, I started writing in high school. In Oak Park, Illinois. In my last semester, I had a very good English class - reading a lot of literature, not so much poetry, but, you know, fiction and I found that two of my friends were writing poems. And they were, you know, not only writing them to, sort of, please themselves, but they were also using them to seduce young ladies - impressionably young women. And this all - this seemed to be like a very good idea. And - but then it became, you know, more complicated because what happens is that, you know, we write something, you think it was great, you like it, and then you realize, you know, shortly after that it's terrible, embarrassing. And so you know, I started going to bookstores and library to find out what poetry is really like and, you know, taking out anthologies or books of poems. So, you know, that's how it began. NEARY: Did it help you to learn English better? I guess it must have then. Prof. SIMIC: Oh, it certainly did. But (unintelligible) I was asked that question: When did I, sort of, stop, you know, taking in Serbian and - I don't know. I don't have its date. But I remember when I first writing poems, and I was writing it in English for the simple reason that the women that I wanted to impress are American. I mean, I couldn't read them poems in Serbian and tell them this is a beautiful poem, but too bad you can't understand it. And so\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) NEARY: No, but I bet the accent helped. Prof. SIMIC: Well, it probably helped. But anyway, I used to - I would write an English word down and right away, I mean, the Serbian word too are, kind of, equal, you know, translation. A simultaneous translation would occur. So there were these two languages, you know, side by side. But at some point, I no longer heard Serbian in my head when I was writing. NEARY: That's interesting. You know, I think it's really fascinating that given your background that you have been named poet laureate and in this country at a time when there's so much debate and discussion going on around our immigration policy. And I wonder, how does poetry speak to those kinds of public controversies, political discussions? Prof. SIMIC: Usually, it doesn't. Poetry really for me, as long as I'm concerned, I mean, it's an affair between two individuals - the poet and the reader. This is one place where human beings, as individuals, they are experience of their own life, their existence. You know, it's a place where you can say something about it. So what we find the other poets - well, as we read them, we find someone who has been, you know, struggling with these eternal questions. The kind of questions that in some years ask themselves. NEARY: Well, you know, a lot of people are, kind of, afraid of poetry. They think it's hard to understand. But I think a lot of your poems are really quite accessible. And I wonder if you'd like to pick one to read that, sort of, illustrates that. Prof. SIMIC: Well, here's an old one that has been in many anthologies. It's called \"Stone. \" (Reading) Go inside a stone that would be my way. Let somebody else become a dove or gnash with a tiger's tooth. I am happy to be a stone. From the outside the stone is a riddle. No one knows how to answer it. Yet within, it must be cool and quiet. Even though a cow steps on it full weight, even though a child throws it in a river, the stone sinks, slow, unperturbed to the river bottom where the fishes come to knock on it and listen. I have seen sparks fly out when two stones are rubbed. So perhaps it is not dark inside after all. Perhaps there is a moon shining from somewhere, as though behind a hill, just enough light to make out the strange writings, the star-charts on the inner walls. NEARY: That's a good place for someone to begin perhaps. Just imagining what it's like to be a stone. A poem that's just imagines what it's like to be a stone. Prof. SIMIC: I think they use that hatched(ph) in grade school is this poem. Just for - precisely in that way. They say, well, you think of something and imagine, you know, being inside it. And that's what the little kids - they write. (Soundbite of laughter) NEARY: So you're not afraid to take this challenge on to promote poetry in the United States right now? Prof. SIMIC: No. I don't have a clear plan. I've been amusingly getting from friends and e-mails who - suggesting some very interesting ideas of what I should propose as a poet laureate. NEARY: What's the best one you've gotten so far? Prof. SIMIC: I got it from someone that I know. And she said, I think you should give tax breaks to everyone who memorizes 12 poems a year. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. SIMIC: So they can recite to their lover or parent or dog. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. SIMIC: And the lover, parent or dog should get an even bigger tax break for listening. NEARY: That's a good one. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. SIMIC: I like that. NEARY: Yes. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. SIMIC: I don't know if the library's going to like it, but I like it. NEARY: Charles Simic has just been named the new U. S. poet laureate. He joined us from New Hampshire Public Radio in Concord, New Hampshire. Thanks so much for being with us. It was fun talking with you. Prof. SIMIC: Well, thank you for having me.  LYNN NEARY, host:  America's new poet laureate is Charles Simic. Born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Simic and his family immigrated to this country after World War II. As a teenager, he learned English and began writing poetry. Simic has published more than 20 books of poetry including \"The World Doesn't End,\" a collection of prose poems for which he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1990.  A professor emeritus at the University of New Hampshire, Charles Simic joins us now from New Hampshire Public Radio.  So good to have you with us.  Professor CHARLES SIMIC (15th U. S. Poet Laureate; Professor Emeritus, University New Hampshire): Thank you. It's nice to be here.  NEARY: And congratulations. Last week was a pretty amazing week for you. You also received the $100,000 Wallace Stevens Award for mastery in poetry from the Academy of American Poets. Have you recovered yet from this double whammy?  Prof. SIMIC: No, not at all. I mean, I'm still, kind of, overwhelmed. I go to sleep very tired at night and then I wake up and just, sort of, think about my good luck. And I'm almost frightened to get out of bed. Too much good luck in one week.  (Soundbite of laughter)  NEARY: You're worried.  Prof. SIMIC: Yeah, you know, you always feel that it should be balanced by some, you know, amount of bad luck, you know. I'll break my leg or, you know, something.  (Soundbite of laughter)  NEARY: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about how you began writing poetry because as I understand, you were 15 years old when you began speaking English. And pretty quickly thereafter began writing poetry in English, which seems pretty amazing for a teenage boy, I have to say.  Prof. SIMIC: Well, you know, I started writing in high school. In Oak Park, Illinois. In my last semester, I had a very good English class - reading a lot of literature, not so much poetry, but, you know, fiction and I found that two of my friends were writing poems. And they were, you know, not only writing them to, sort of, please themselves, but they were also using them to seduce young ladies - impressionably young women. And this all - this seemed to be like a very good idea.  And - but then it became, you know, more complicated because what happens is that, you know, we write something, you think it was great, you like it, and then you realize, you know, shortly after that it's terrible, embarrassing. And so you know, I started going to bookstores and library to find out what poetry is really like and, you know, taking out anthologies or books of poems. So, you know, that's how it began.  NEARY: Did it help you to learn English better? I guess it must have then.  Prof. SIMIC: Oh, it certainly did. But (unintelligible) I was asked that question: When did I, sort of, stop, you know, taking in Serbian and - I don't know. I don't have its date. But I remember when I first writing poems, and I was writing it in English for the simple reason that the women that I wanted to impress are American. I mean, I couldn't read them poems in Serbian and tell them this is a beautiful poem, but too bad you can't understand it. And so\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  NEARY: No, but I bet the accent helped.  Prof. SIMIC: Well, it probably helped. But anyway, I used to - I would write an English word down and right away, I mean, the Serbian word too are, kind of, equal, you know, translation. A simultaneous translation would occur. So there were these two languages, you know, side by side. But at some point, I no longer heard Serbian in my head when I was writing.  NEARY: That's interesting. You know, I think it's really fascinating that given your background that you have been named poet laureate and in this country at a time when there's so much debate and discussion going on around our immigration policy. And I wonder, how does poetry speak to those kinds of public controversies, political discussions?  Prof. SIMIC: Usually, it doesn't. Poetry really for me, as long as I'm concerned, I mean, it's an affair between two individuals - the poet and the reader. This is one place where human beings, as individuals, they are experience of their own life, their existence. You know, it's a place where you can say something about it. So what we find the other poets - well, as we read them, we find someone who has been, you know, struggling with these eternal questions. The kind of questions that in some years ask themselves.  NEARY: Well, you know, a lot of people are, kind of, afraid of poetry. They think it's hard to understand. But I think a lot of your poems are really quite accessible. And I wonder if you'd like to pick one to read that, sort of, illustrates that.  Prof. SIMIC: Well, here's an old one that has been in many anthologies. It's called \"Stone. \"  (Reading) Go inside a stone that would be my way. Let somebody else become a dove or gnash with a tiger's tooth. I am happy to be a stone. From the outside the stone is a riddle. No one knows how to answer it. Yet within, it must be cool and quiet. Even though a cow steps on it full weight, even though a child throws it in a river, the stone sinks, slow, unperturbed to the river bottom where the fishes come to knock on it and listen.

For the last 10 years, women have entered medical schools across the nation at the same rate as men. So you might be surprised to learn that none of the nations top medical school has ever had a woman dean. But that's changing with the appointment of Dr. Nancy Andrews to head the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Andrews joins me now from member station WGBH in Boston. Hello there, thanks for being with us. Dr. NANCY ANDREWS (Incoming Dean, Duke University School of Medicine): Hello. It's a pleasure to be here. ELLIOT: Now in the last decade, many large corporations have named women as CEOs, you've heard of women making strides in many fields, why do you think it's taken this long for a woman to lead a top medical school? Dr. ANDREWS: Well, I think it's complex, but at least part of the reason is that usually the way deans of medical schools are selected, they come from the pool of usually clinical department chairs in medical schools. And still, in 2007, there are very few women chairs of clinical departments. At the most, some of the larger schools might have four or five women chairs out of 25 or 30 altogether. ELLIOT: What qualities do universities search committees look for when they are looking for people to head their medical schools? Dr. ANDREWS: It's a different mix in different places. But usually, search committees look for some administrative experience, some experience dealing with a large and complicated organization. And I think it's an asset to have experience both in the clinical world and in basic science research. My previous administrative experience was heading a program for students who are earning both their MD and PhD at the same time. I'm a graduate of that program at Harvard and have been very invested in it for many years. ELLIOT: When medical students are making these decisions, whether to go on and pursue a PhD, is it more attractive for women decide instead to go into the practice of medicine rather than taking an academic route? Dr. ANDREWS: I think that there are a number of factors that tend to push women towards clinical medicine instead of academics. The obvious one that gets a lot of talk is that getting your career established in academic medicine usually happens during the peak childbearing years. And so it takes some juggling. It's certainly not impossible. I think most of the women physicians, scientists, colleagues who I know have children and have gone through that, but I think that that discourages young women often. A second thing is that physician, scientist careers are thought to be more competitive and I think women worry that feeling they've always had to be as good as or better than their male counterparts to get where they are. I think they start to worry that at more advanced level, it's going to be hard to compete in that way. ELLIOT: Are they right? Dr. ANDREWS: Well, I think that they probably are right. And they get very little encouragement to go into scientific careers. I'd had number of people over the years who just assumed that I was going to go into clinical medicine or even actively push me that way. ELLIOT: Why do you think people discouraged you and pushed you on another direction? Dr. ANDREWS: Well, I remember interviewing for the MD-PhD program and a famous American University back about thirty years ago. And I had an interviewer who said to me you're a every strong candidate, but obviously you like people too much to be in the lab and so I'm sure you're not going to stick with research. And, you know, it's kind of hard to know what to say when your interviewer says that to you. All I did was to withdraw my application from that school. ELLIOT: I'd like to ask you a broader question now. About the way we educate doctors in this country, with all the public debate about the delivery of health care in our society, the numbers of people who are not insured, the pressures insurance companies are putting on, physicians. Will medical students now have to think about these broader questions along with their anatomy classes? Dr. ANDREWS: Yes. I think so. And I think that there's a trend among medical schools to broaden the education to thinking about economic and social issues more than really happened in the coursework when I was a student. Kids in college see all of the pressures that are on people doing clinical medicine, and it's a tough time to get funding for biomedical research right now. And interestingly, historically, at times when medicine becomes a less appealing specialty, the proportion of women in medical school classes increases. Not that there are more women, but that the men are going off to choose other careers. ELLIOT: Dr. Nancy Andrews was just named the new dean of the Duke University School of Medicine. She begins in October. Thank you for talking with us. Dr. ANDREWS: It's been a pleasure.

Buried deep in the Green Zone on the banks of the Tigris River, the 104-acre compound is by far the biggest embassy the U. S. has built abroad. Encircled by blast walls, the facility is designed to be entirely self-sufficient. It has its own utilities, apartment buildings, even a shopping mall. Congress appropriated more than half a billion dollars for its construction and it's estimated that it could cost a billion dollars a year to operate. As the embassy nears completion, we thought we take a look at the diplomatic landscape in Iraq. Joining us is former Ambassador Edward Peck. He served as the chief of mission in Baghdad from 1977 to 1980. Thank you for coming in. Mr. EDWARD PECK (Former U. S. Ambassador to Iraq): I'm honored. ELLIOTT: What do you think this new embassy conveys to Iraqis? Mr. PECK: Well, you know, it's always difficult for us to assume how they look at it but I personally would say that it was a terrible mistake to build it in the Green Zone. ELLIOTT: Why is that? Mr. PECK: Well, that's where Saddam operated. And if you're trying to convey the idea of change, that's just psychologically and culturally wrong. ELLIOTT: It sounds like this is very much like a fortress with the big walls around it. What is that image? Mr. PECK: Well, that operation bares no resemblance to any embassy that I've ever been associated with. When you have diplomats and other people working in an embassy, in theory, they are there to carry out two functions. One is to tell the host government how America feels about a wide range of issues. And the second is to tell America how the host country feels about a whole range of issues. And you develop that second part by being able to walk around and look and talk to people. And in Baghdad, you can't do that. You're crouched down behind the blast walls and the barbed wire. ELLIOTT: Now, certainly, we should note there are security concerns here. Let's go back now to the late '70s when you were posted in Iraq. Mr. PECK: Yes. ELLIOTT: Saddam Hussein took over the presidency when you were there. Mr. PECK: Yes. ELLIOTT: So, can you paint a picture for us of how you operated? Mr. PECK: Oh, I lived a perfectly normal life. But in Iraq, people were very careful about getting too close to the Americans because we did not have the world's best relationship. I could visit ministries, talk to government officials. I could travel about the country if I were up north, in the Kurdish areas, and here comes an army or patrol moving across the trail that I was on, I could stop and talk with them about this and that, what was going and how things were. And as a reasonably experienced Middle East observer, you can look at people and get a pretty good idea of how things were going. Economically, are the things in the shops. Are the shops good? Are the streets safe? Do the people move around without fear? Yes, all of those things. ELLIOTT: What would you say that Ambassador Crocker should be doing? Mr. PECK: What\u2026 ELLIOTT: What is his role? Mr. PECK: Ambassador Crocker's role is two-fold. He conveys to Prime Minister al-Maliki, Nouri al-Maliki, and his government what America feels about various things. But he doesn't do it as a diplomat there. He does it as a pro-counsel. It isn't like, you know, I have called on the heads of states of other governments where you convey very quietly what it is we think should be done about this and that, and this is our view on the international wailing convention, whatever it is. But Mr. Crocker doesn't have that relationship there. He comes in essentially with an armed guard to say, hey, we got these 18 checkpoints that you're supposed to pass before we can authorize you to do this or that. And his other job, and that's the tough one, we'll find out how it works out later this month when he reports back to the president about how the situation is going. I hope that Ryan Crocker has retained one of the many virtues that made all of us admire him when he was relatively junior officer. And that is the willingness to speak truth to power. He should be able, at least in private, to tell Secretary Rice and the president and others what the situation is really like and what he really thinks should be good or bad, and pay the consequences for telling them what it really is all about because that's his job. That's the toughest part of the job, to speak truth to power. ELLIOTT: Ambassador Edward Peck was chief of mission in Baghdad from 1977 to 1980. Thank you for talking with us. Mr. PECK: Thank you very much. ELLIOTT: You can hear more about Ambassador Peck's time in Iraq at npr. org.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:  Construction crews are putting the finishing touches on the United States' new embassy in Baghdad this weekend. Buried deep in the Green Zone on the banks of the Tigris River, the 104-acre compound is by far the biggest embassy the U. S. has built abroad.  Encircled by blast walls, the facility is designed to be entirely self-sufficient. It has its own utilities, apartment buildings, even a shopping mall. Congress appropriated more than half a billion dollars for its construction and it's estimated that it could cost a billion dollars a year to operate.  As the embassy nears completion, we thought we take a look at the diplomatic landscape in Iraq. Joining us is former Ambassador Edward Peck. He served as the chief of mission in Baghdad from 1977 to 1980. Thank you for coming in.  Mr. EDWARD PECK (Former U. S. Ambassador to Iraq): I'm honored.  ELLIOTT: What do you think this new embassy conveys to Iraqis?  Mr. PECK: Well, you know, it's always difficult for us to assume how they look at it but I personally would say that it was a terrible mistake to build it in the Green Zone.  ELLIOTT: Why is that?  Mr. PECK: Well, that's where Saddam operated. And if you're trying to convey the idea of change, that's just psychologically and culturally wrong.  ELLIOTT: It sounds like this is very much like a fortress with the big walls around it. What is that image?  Mr. PECK: Well, that operation bares no resemblance to any embassy that I've ever been associated with. When you have diplomats and other people working in an embassy, in theory, they are there to carry out two functions. One is to tell the host government how America feels about a wide range of issues. And the second is to tell America how the host country feels about a whole range of issues.  And you develop that second part by being able to walk around and look and talk to people. And in Baghdad, you can't do that. You're crouched down behind the blast walls and the barbed wire.  ELLIOTT: Now, certainly, we should note there are security concerns here. Let's go back now to the late '70s when you were posted in Iraq.  Mr. PECK: Yes.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: I'm Melissa Block. And we begin this hour with an interview with the U. S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker. The Congressional hearings are over. Ambassador Crocker and General David Petraeus will soon head back to Baghdad. The president will speak to the country tomorrow night. He's expected to embrace the recommendation for a drawdown of some 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer. Congress will once again wrangle over war funding and benchmarks and a timetable. This much seems clear. By even the most optimistic assessments of what's going on in Iraq, progress is slow; gains are fragile. That was the message implied by the Ambassador Crocker yesterday when he was asked this question by Senator John McCain. Senator JOHN McCAIN (Republican, Arizona): Ambassador Crocker, what is your degree of confidence that the Maliki government will begin to do the things that we've been asking them to do for a long time? Ambassador RYAN CROCKER (U. S. Ambassador to Iraq): My level of confidence is under control\u2026 BLOCK: Ambassador Crocker joins us now from the State Department. Welcome to the program. Ambassador CROCKER: Thanks very much. BLOCK: That was not exactly a ringing endorsement of your faith in the Iraqi prime minister. What do you mean by that? Ambassador CROCKER: The Maliki government has faced a number of challenges trying to formulate legislation particularly on the benchmarks and move those to the Council of Representatives. This will continue to be difficult, not because the prime minister is not making an effort but because these are hard issues that require a lot of hard work and compromise that has been difficult to get in the current environment in Iraq. BLOCK: I think everyone accepts that this is hard work, but is Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki the right man to do that job? Ambassador CROCKER: Well, as the president just said, he considers the prime minister a good man with a very difficult job. BLOCK: I'd like to play you some reaction to your testimony before Congress. This is from a Sunni lawmaker, Salim Abdullah, who talked to our reporter Jamie Tarabay in Baghdad. And he said, your testimony glossed over real political problem. Here's what he said. Mr. SALIM ABDULLAH (Sunni Lawmaker): (Through translator) I believe it's in the interest of the American government to show that there is political progress. So Crocker didn't talk about the crisis, about the parties, which boycott the government, or how to get over these difficulties. BLOCK: Ambassador Crocker, he's talking about a crisis within the national government itself. Ambassador CROCKER: Well, Iraq faces any number of problems and indeed crises. The decision by the Tawaffuq bloc coalition of Sunni Arab parties, which I presume Mr. Abdullah was referring to, to withdraw its ministers from the Maliki cabinet at the beginning of August has certainly presented yet again a fresh challenge to the government, but the government continues. BLOCK: Ambassador Crocker, what do you make of the most recent National Intelligence estimate on Iraq, which says the Iraqi government will become more precarious over the next six to twelve months? Ambassador CROCKER: I'm not entirely sure what that is based on. Again, the government faces significant challenges including its own composition. At the same time, they do continue their executive role. One example of that was the decision by the prime minister and the cabinet to provide substantial additional resources to the province of Anbar. So, again, an important decision by the government and a step of some significance in the entire reconciliation effort. BLOCK: So you would say the assessment of the intelligence community is at odds with what you're seeing on the ground? Ambassador CROCKER: I think that the government clearly is going to face challenges. It has faced them over the six months I've been there. I am certain that it will continue to face them through the next six months and beyond. Whether that means that the position of the government becomes more precarious or not, I really couldn't predict. BLOCK: We've heard a lot about gains made in Anbar Province, the Sunni - mostly Sunni province. Sheikhs there are splitting with insurgence, siding with the United States. As provinces like Anbar gain more power, do you run the risk of splitting the country apart? Ambassador CROCKER: This is an important question. Iraq, the new Iraq, is established as a federal republic. So the supposition here is that there will be a degree of decentralization. One of the important issues that Iraqis have to resolve is just how much, and that's where the debate on provincial powers comes into play. The issues are as serious as they were in our own states' rights debates many years ago. What I think we've seen in Anbar, though, is both an assertion of responsibility and authority by provincial authorities, but also efforts by both the province and the central government to link up together. BLOCK: If you look throughout Iraq, obviously, the Kurdish population in the north, which has had some degree of autonomy for many years, Shiite population in the south, which is asserting its autonomy as well. Do you accept, on some level, that Iraq is becoming a de facto partition state? Call it soft partition, whatever you want, but that it is essentially fracturing along sectarian lines. Ambassador CROCKER: I don't see it as fracturing. I see, again, a form of federalism, but I also see the clear intention on the part of senior figures from all three communities to maintain a connection to the center and in some important respects, to be part of that center. BLOCK: One thing that did not come up in your testimony was the displacement of Iraqis. A hundred - by one estimate, 100,000 Iraqis a month have fled their homes since the surge began, and essentially going to areas where they find their own sectarian groups - Shiites fleeing to Shiite areas; Sunnis to Sunni areas. Doesn't that contribute to this notion of Iraq dividing itself? Ambassador CROCKER: Well, the problem of displacement is a serious one, both the numbers of people already displaced and the fact that in some areas displacement still continues. I think the surge has made a substantial difference in reducing those flows but they need to be stopped and then over time reversed. Very significant parts of the country, and indeed of the city of Baghdad itself, remain mixed communities. And I think it's important that we and Iraqis make every effort to ensure that those communities maintain their current composition. BLOCK: Do you see any progress on that? Ambassador CROCKER: I do, actually. I think the surge has gone a considerable distance to stabilizing conditions in Baghdad. And as conditions stabilized, I think, the displacement rates diminished. BLOCK: Just one last question, there's been a lot of build up to this week's testimony from yourself and from - and General David Petraeus. Is there a sense of relief as you head back to Baghdad in some way? Ambassador CROCKER: Well, as I mentioned at one point in the testimony, after going through 17 hours of hearings, Baghdad is actually looking rather good. But it was actually a privilege and an honor to be part of the American democratic process and to have the chance to reflect that even, while one is in the hot seat, the fact that we have these institutions and that we have this processes is what makes us the great country we are today. BLOCK: Ambassador Crocker, thanks for talking with us. Ambassador CROCKER: Thanks very much, Melissa. BLOCK: Ryan Crocker is the U. S. ambassador to Iraq. Tomorrow on MORNING EDITION, an interview with General David Petraeus, the top U. S. military commander in Iraq. He talks about the additional troops there now and their role in reducing violence.

He was in Iowa, where he unveiled his proposal to end the war, and as he says, turn a page in Iraq. The senator says he immediately would begin pulling out combat troops, one or two brigades every month, so that all combat troops are out by the end of 2008. He wants a new constitutional convention in Iraq convened with the U. N. And he says he'll address the humanitarian disaster. Senator Obama joins me now. Thanks so much for being with us, senator. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois): Thank you, Michele. NORRIS: Now, you delivered this address in a town called Clinton, Iowa. That's a bit curious. (Soundbite of laughter) Sen. OBAMA: It was actually unintentional. My organizational staff here wanted to make sure that we reached out to the eastern portion of the state, and there's a wonderful town called Clinton. Obviously, if we get a headline that Clinton gives Obama a standing ovation, that's not a bad thing. NORRIS: Aha. Now, your plan today contains four elements, but I want to begin by asking you about your proposal to pull out all combat forces by the end of 2008. The Pentagon and many military experts say it would take up to two years to get the troops out in an orderly fashion - the troops and the equipment. So is this timetable that you spelled out realistic? Sen. OBAMA: Well, I think that those same experts have indicated that it would - we can safely remove one to two brigades per month. I believe we should start now. If we delay, then it's going to take longer. And I think it's important -even as we are withdrawing those troops - that we are ramping up our diplomatic efforts, both inside Iraq and in the region, as well as attending to some of the humanitarian issues that this administration has not dealt with. NORRIS: Now, as you would begin pulling those combat forces out, one or two brigades at a time, what about the troops left behind? If you're leaving a smaller number of troops behind on the ground, and they are still responsible for security in the country, are you putting those left behind at greater risk? Sen. OBAMA: Not if you are working with the commanders on the ground to make sure that their mission is well defined. We are not going to obviously be able to do the same policing work and refereeing of a civil war that is currently being accomplished by 160,000 troops. But, of course, that's true even under General Petraeus' plan, where because we can't sustain current troop levels, we're going to be dropping down to 130,000 troops. It's important that I recognize what's happened as a consequence to the president's surge. We have had 30,000 additional troops in Iraq much longer than the president had originally planned for. As a result, we have gone from the horrendous levels of violence that existed six months ago, down to the merely intolerable levels of violence that existed back in June of 2006. What that indicates is how low the bar has been set, when people claimed that somehow the surge has been successful. We are back to where we were 15 months ago, at a time when the American people had already come to recognize that this had been an enormous strategic disaster. NORRIS: Senator, I want to make sure I understand something. Are you advocating a total U. S. disengagement from Iraq? Will a President Obama basically take every last American out of Iraq? Sen. OBAMA: Of course not. We can't totally disengage from Iraq any more than we can disengage with any other critical part of the world. And we've got both strategic interests as well humanitarian interests in the region. So what my plan calls for would continue to involve U. S. troops protecting a U. S. Embassy and U. S. personnel there. We would continue to have U. S. troops who are able to strike at terrorist targets inside Iraq, although the troops themselves and the strike forces might not have to be deployed inside Iraq. If the Iraqi government comes to a political accommodation, and you've got forces that are nonsectarian that are functioning, then the United States can continue to serve in a training capacity. But all these is premised on triggering the kind of political negotiations and compromise that so far have not been forthcoming from the Iraqi leadership. NORRIS: Senator, I'm trying to determine what the U. S. footprint in Iraq would look like - say, you're in office and your commanders, your military commanders, are telling you that progress is being made. If they are saying we can win this, are you still going to draw down forces? As a commander in chief who does not have personal military experience, are you willing to look someone like David Petraeus in the eye and say you're wrong, we're going to do it my way? Sen. OBAMA: If commanders came to me and said we are making progress in reducing violence and I see continuing political progress taking place, then obviously that's going to be weighed against the need to, I believe, have some additional troops in Afghanistan, that's going to be weighed against our homeland security needs in the United States. I think that the overarching question is what is going to be needed to make the United States more secure, meet our strategic interests around the world, and make sure that we are meeting the obligations that we have towards the Iraqi people. But that is all part of a decision that the president makes in consultation with his generals, but not in deference to them. And I think one of the unfortunate aspects of the last several days and General Petraeus' testimony is the illusion that somehow General Petraeus has been setting policy, and the president has simply been accepting those recommendations. That is not what has been taking place. The president has been laying out a mission of continuing this failed course in Iraq, and General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have been trying to carry out that mission as best they could. NORRIS: So for those Democratic voters, who are trying to decide which candidate they want to back, how does your strategy now differ - your strategy for ending the war differ from that of your opponents', specifically your chief rival, Senator Hillary Clinton? Sen. OBAMA: Well, you know, I would focus on the specific aspects of our plan, the humanitarian aspects, the more detailed approach to diplomacy, including talking to foes like Iran and Syria in a much more direct way than, I think, conventional Washington thinking is dictating, and a very specific pace in terms of how we're going to withdraw our troops. I think that all of us recognize that we now have a series of bad options. We don't have good options as a consequence of the original decision that was made in Iraq. And part of what I think Democratic voters are going to be looking for is somebody who's got good judgment going forward. NORRIS: Senator Barack Obama, thanks so much for speaking with us. Sen. OBAMA: It's my pleasure. Thank you. NORRIS: That was Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, a Democratic presidential candidate. He spoke to us from Clinton, Iowa.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  Senator Barack Obama was among the Democrats talking about Iraq on the campaign trail today. He was in Iowa, where he unveiled his proposal to end the war, and as he says, turn a page in Iraq. The senator says he immediately would begin pulling out combat troops, one or two brigades every month, so that all combat troops are out by the end of 2008. He wants a new constitutional convention in Iraq convened with the U. N. And he says he'll address the humanitarian disaster.  Senator Obama joins me now.  Thanks so much for being with us, senator.  Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois): Thank you, Michele.  NORRIS: Now, you delivered this address in a town called Clinton, Iowa. That's a bit curious.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Sen. OBAMA: It was actually unintentional. My organizational staff here wanted to make sure that we reached out to the eastern portion of the state, and there's a wonderful town called Clinton. Obviously, if we get a headline that Clinton gives Obama a standing ovation, that's not a bad thing.  NORRIS: Aha. Now, your plan today contains four elements, but I want to begin by asking you about your proposal to pull out all combat forces by the end of 2008. The Pentagon and many military experts say it would take up to two years to get the troops out in an orderly fashion - the troops and the equipment. So is this timetable that you spelled out realistic?  Sen. OBAMA: Well, I think that those same experts have indicated that it would - we can safely remove one to two brigades per month. I believe we should start now. If we delay, then it's going to take longer. And I think it's important -even as we are withdrawing those troops - that we are ramping up our diplomatic efforts, both inside Iraq and in the region, as well as attending to some of the humanitarian issues that this administration has not dealt with.  NORRIS: Now, as you would begin pulling those combat forces out, one or two brigades at a time, what about the troops left behind? If you're leaving a smaller number of troops behind on the ground, and they are still responsible for security in the country, are you putting those left behind at greater risk?  Sen. OBAMA: Not if you are working with the commanders on the ground to make sure that their mission is well defined. We are not going to obviously be able to do the same policing work and refereeing of a civil war that is currently being accomplished by 160,000 troops. But, of course, that's true even under General Petraeus' plan, where because we can't sustain current troop levels, we're going to be dropping down to 130,000 troops.  It's important that I recognize what's happened as a consequence to the president's surge. We have had 30,000 additional troops in Iraq much longer than the president had originally planned for. As a result, we have gone from the horrendous levels of violence that existed six months ago, down to the merely intolerable levels of violence that existed back in June of 2006.  What that indicates is how low the bar has been set, when people claimed that somehow the surge has been successful. We are back to where we were 15 months ago, at a time when the American people had already come to recognize that this had been an enormous strategic disaster.  NORRIS: Senator, I want to make sure I understand something. Are you advocating a total U. S. disengagement from Iraq? Will a President Obama basically take every last American out of Iraq?  Sen. OBAMA: Of course not. We can't totally disengage from Iraq any more than we can disengage with any other critical part of the world. And we've got both strategic interests as well humanitarian interests in the region. So what my plan calls for would continue to involve U. S. troops protecting a U. S. Embassy and U. S. personnel there. We would continue to have U. S. troops who are able to strike at terrorist targets inside Iraq, although the troops themselves and the strike forces might not have to be deployed inside Iraq.  If the Iraqi government comes to a political accommodation, and you've got forces that are nonsectarian that are functioning, then the United States can continue to serve in a training capacity.

Greenspan is the author of a new memoir called \"The Age of Turbulence\" and he was in our studio today. Since Sunday night when you appeared on \"60 Minutes\" on CBS, you seemed to have been interviewed a few thousand times over the past - some of the past two or three days. Mr. ALAN GREENSPAN (Author, \"The Age of Turbulence\"; Former chairman, U. S. Federal Reserve): No more than two. SIEGEL: No more than two. Mr. GREENSPAN: Two thousand, I think. SIEGEL: I see. And you've provoked some critical comment. I'd like to hear you respond to it. Mr. GREENSPAN: Mm-hmm. SIEGEL: First, as for faulting the Bush administration's fiscal policies or practices, Dick Cheney says you're off the mark. You warned them of a possible recession right after the 2000 election, he says, and the tax cuts that they made are now paying off. President Bush says the federal deficit relative to the Gross Domestic Product is pretty low, and also cutting taxes helped deal with the recession and the deficit by stimulating growth. Are they right? And were the tax cuts the right move? Mr. GREENSPAN: We're talking across purposes. My concern - especially about, as I point it out, the Republican Congress, which reigned for so long - was that we had the inexorable move of a very substantial product of the baby boom generation into retirement. This is going to create an extraordinary, unprecedented rise in benefit requirements. And any evaluation done by the trustees of the Medicare fund, for example, or most economists who had tried to what these data look like, have concluded that we are very sharply underfunded. What I fault the Republican Congress in doing is not coming to grips with this issue before it becomes so difficult that it will be dangerous to the economy. The data that the president and the vice president point out are perfectly correct. It is the case that in the recent period the actual deficit, by any measure, is small. But what the problem basically is is we are moving into a wholly different period where - what I would term the cash accounting that is employed in judging the federal budget or deficit is the wrong procedure. It is what we are accruing for the future and the burdens on our children and grandchildren, which are creating huge distortions in a longer-term outlook. It is that which we are long overdue in addressing. And there's where my concern was. SIEGEL: But through the 1990s and through what turned out to be a very successful collaboration with the Clinton administration, I can say as a member of the baby boom, you seem to be putting away for my Social Security check pretty well, I seem to be thinking about the future. And then came the recession after President Bush was elected, but also, a big tax break. With hindsight, was that tax break wrong? Or was it - does it only exacerbate the problem that you're talking about in terms of Social Security? Mr. GREENSPAN: First, let me go back and rewrite history just ever so slightly. SIEGEL: Mm-hmm. Mr. GREENSPAN: The major issue that emerged just doing the campaign and right after the election was the emergence of an utterly unexpected and unprecedented surplus. SIEGEL: You're talking about the election of 2000. . . Mr. GREENSPAN: Yes. SIEGEL: . . . Right now, yes. Mr. GREENSPAN: And as a consequence of that, I, who had been a deficit hawk, as they say, began to realize that there were very important problems associated with running very large surpluses after the debt has been paid down because there is no alternative when you have, say, $500 billion surpluses, what were just wrapping and projecting. . . SIEGEL: Mm-hmm. Mr. GREENSPAN: . . . of accumulating them in private assets, which would mainly be American stocks and bonds. And having lived through Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, I was very fearful of how they would use that extraordinarily large amount of claims on American business to introduce political issues. And therefore, I was recommending in my testimony finding a glide path, which would remove the surplus at the point the level of debt went to effective zero, either Bush's tax cut or the Democrats' tax cut at the time - both would have succeeded in doing that. I was very supportive of a tax cut and I continue to be supportive in the context of what I called a trigger. And they didn't buy the trigger. SIEGEL: But it seems that they didn't quite understand the trigger, if I understand what you're writing. You feel that you were not quite heard right in your testimony, and you've been criticized there by the likes of Paul Krugman of the New York Times that you had time after that to clarify what you meant. Mr. GREENSPAN: I did. Paul wasn't reading the newspapers correctly. SIEGEL: He was writing the newspaper. Mr. GREENSPAN: He was writing newspapers. The surplus - to the surprise of all economists - disappeared far more quickly than they had expected. Consequently, what I suggested at that time, if the trigger was not in place, then so-called pagel(ph) would require that the tax cut be matched by either other tax increases or a cut in spending. The removal of part of the double taxation on dividends was a very important structural improvement. But I always made my support of tax cut contingent on they be paid for under the law, which expired in 2003. SIEGEL: Do you feel strongly about the reduction of the inheritance tax as you do about reduction of double taxation of dividends? Mr. GREENSPAN: No, I don't. The double taxation of dividends goes right to the issue of capital investment and productivity growth and standards of living. My major problem is I'm terribly concerned about the increasing inequality of income. And while I'm not in favor of taxing in a way or such I have - see that they're all benefits because I've always argued that you cannot have capitalist market economy without the support of a vast majority of the people. And the one issue, which I find very disturbing, is the rising inequality of income, which creates a backlash against what I think is - have been the most effective thing since the enlightenment. . . SIEGEL: Market capitalism. Mr. GREENSPAN: . . . of market capitalism. SIEGEL: So while you're not enthusiastic about it, the notion of redistributive taxes into some degree might be necessary to avoid the kind of income and wealth inequality that could be destabilizing or could challenge the system. Mr. GREENSPAN: Well, I prefer to get at the causes first, although I could see that there are non-market advantages which actually are required to support the system as a whole. SIEGEL: How influential was the experience of growing up through the Depression on you in terms of your approach toward the economy and toward life for that matter? Mr. GREENSPAN: When you're young, you're not aware that there's any other alternatives. I mean, I was brought up in a lower middle class family. My parents were divorced and my mother raised me. She's an extraordinarily, inherently optimistic person. And while, of course, looking back many years later, I recognized the state of what the world was in, you don't remember in those terms because relative to what? SIEGEL: But when you were a young man, before you tackled these issues academically, did you think of Franklin Roosevelt and the new deal as an intrusive, overarching bad move for the country? Were you. . . Mr. GREENSPAN: When I was a young man. . . SIEGEL: Yeah, when you're a young man, were you an enthusiast for the new deal? Did you care? Mr. GREENSPAN: I didn't care. My views were much far more parochial. Kids are sport enthusiasts and what's going on in politics or the rest of the world is really something uninteresting out there. SIEGEL: You're more interested in baseball and music in those days. Yes. Mr. GREENSPAN: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Do you still play? I mean, I know - people, I think, know that you're playing with a professional jazz band for quite a while. Yeah. Mr. GREENSPAN: Yeah. I - a wind instrument player, when you stop for a while and you start again, it doesn't sound all that good, and so you don't play for a little longer. I play on occasion just to see whether my fingers can still move the way they did. It doesn't sound anywhere near the way it did. I tend to play the piano more now than most anything else. SIEGEL: I think you're one of the, let's say, most senior high-ranking people whom I've ever read in their memoir, talking about the people who are smoking pot when they were young in the - your fellow band members back in 1940 whenever this was. Mr. GREENSPAN: In '45. SIEGEL: You're living out there in the jazz age world. You're not drawn to that at all. Mr. GREENSPAN: I never did smoke cigarettes, but I will tell you this: to this day I can spot the smell of marijuana at 50 yards. SIEGEL: Well, Alan Greenspan, thank you very much for talking with us today. Mr. GREENSPAN: It's been my pleasure of being with you.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. In Cambodia, the wheels of justice are slowly grinding closer toward the leadership of the Khmer Rouge. Over the course of four bloody years in the 1970s, Pol Pot and his followers murdered somewhere between one and a half and two and a half million of their countrymen - intellectuals, professionals, Buddhist monks, Christians, homosexuals. Anyone seen as disloyal to the Communist agrarian agenda of the regime was killed. Finally, the Vietnamese army drove Pol Pot from power and stopped the killing. Pol Pot, who was also known as Brother Number One, was never brought to trial for genocide. He died in 1998. But now, a new U. N. -supported effort to bring accountability is under way. And yesterday, Brother Number Two, a man named Nuon Chea, was arrested in northern Cambodia and flown to the capital, Phnom Penh. He's being charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Evan Osnos, who covers East Asia for the Chicago Tribune, sought out Nuon Chea last year and interviewed him. And he joins us now from southwestern China. Evan Osnos, what can you tell us about this man? EVAN OSNOS: When I met Nuon Chea, he was living in a hut with his wife and his grown children on the edge of the jungle in northwest Cambodia. He lived quietly, didn't see very many visitors, but he lived freely. He was a private citizen living among the population. And he was grandfatherly. He was polite. And he was also totally unrepentant for the genocide that he's accused of helping to design. SIEGLE: That was Nuon Chea, circa 2006. Thirty years earlier when he was head of ideology for the Khmer Rouge, what did that mean? What was he doing? OSNOS: By all accounts, it seems that he was the day-to-day architect of execution policy. That means that he was the person who was deciding which groups of people were going to be targeted and when they would be targeted and, in some cases, how they would be killed. The man who ran the most notorious prison in Cambodia, which was called S-21, says that Nuon Chea was, in his words, the principal man behind the killings. And he can recall specific orders for prisoners to be executed in order to make more room in the prisons, for instance. SIEGLE: So when you interviewed him, you heard no hint of any remorse on his part for what had happened? OSNOS: He often spoke in very general terms about how sorry he was for what had happened to his country. He was very vague about it. When the Khmer Rouge finally gave in at civil war with the government in 1998, he offered his only to-date public apology. And he apologized generally for what had happened to his country. And then, sort of cryptically, he apologized as well to the animals that had been killed in the course of the conflict. I think, in his mind, he was a participant in a much broader historical epic battle. And I think the genocide, which he is very clearly identified with - and the evidence is overwhelming - was not something that he takes a personal sense of responsibility for. SIEGLE: Why has it taken so long for this tribunal process to bring Nuon Chea to justice? OSNOS: Cambodia stayed at war for a decade after the end of the Khmer Rouge. And then even after that, it had a very hard time starting to come to grips with what had happened. A lot of Cambodians believe that's because the government today is constituted, in large part, by people who got their political start during the years of the Khmer Rouge. In fact, many of the senior leaders of today's Cambodian government were the foot soldiers of that regime. And they're not eager to see a tribunal that would begin to probe beyond the leaders of the Khmer Rouge. SIEGLE: So what happens next to Nuon Chea? OSNOS: Well, he's the second person to be arrested in recent months. The tribunal process has picked up speed recently. And he's likely to go on trial in the next few months after more evidence is collected. But in the meantime, he is in prison. And his arrest is a major moment for Cambodia because a lot of people had started to believe that he would probably never see his day in court. SIEGLE: Well, Evan Osnos, thank you very much. OSNOS: My pleasure. SIEGLE: It's Evan Osnos who's Beijing bureau chief for the Chicago Tribune. He spoke to us from Liuzhou, China. MELISSA BLOCK, Host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host:  And I'm Robert Siegel. In Cambodia, the wheels of justice are slowly grinding closer toward the leadership of the Khmer Rouge. Over the course of four bloody years in the 1970s, Pol Pot and his followers murdered somewhere between one and a half and two and a half million of their countrymen - intellectuals, professionals, Buddhist monks, Christians, homosexuals. Anyone seen as disloyal to the Communist agrarian agenda of the regime was killed. Finally, the Vietnamese army drove Pol Pot from power and stopped the killing. Pol Pot, who was also known as Brother Number One, was never brought to trial for genocide. He died in 1998. But now, a new U. N. -supported effort to bring accountability is under way. And yesterday, Brother Number Two, a man named Nuon Chea, was arrested in northern Cambodia and flown to the capital, Phnom Penh. He's being charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Evan Osnos, who covers East Asia for the Chicago Tribune, sought out Nuon Chea last year and interviewed him. And he joins us now from southwestern China. Evan Osnos, what can you tell us about this man? EVAN OSNOS: When I met Nuon Chea, he was living in a hut with his wife and his grown children on the edge of the jungle in northwest Cambodia. He lived quietly, didn't see very many visitors, but he lived freely. He was a private citizen living among the population. And he was grandfatherly. He was polite. And he was also totally unrepentant for the genocide that he's accused of helping to design. SIEGLE: That was Nuon Chea, circa 2006. Thirty years earlier when he was head of ideology for the Khmer Rouge, what did that mean? What was he doing? OSNOS: By all accounts, it seems that he was the day-to-day architect of execution policy. That means that he was the person who was deciding which groups of people were going to be targeted and when they would be targeted and, in some cases, how they would be killed. The man who ran the most notorious prison in Cambodia, which was called S-21, says that Nuon Chea was, in his words, the principal man behind the killings. And he can recall specific orders for prisoners to be executed in order to make more room in the prisons, for instance. SIEGLE: So when you interviewed him, you heard no hint of any remorse on his part for what had happened? OSNOS: He often spoke in very general terms about how sorry he was for what had happened to his country. He was very vague about it. When the Khmer Rouge finally gave in at civil war with the government in 1998, he offered his only to-date public apology. And he apologized generally for what had happened to his country. And then, sort of cryptically, he apologized as well to the animals that had been killed in the course of the conflict. I think, in his mind, he was a participant in a much broader historical epic battle. And I think the genocide, which he is very clearly identified with - and the evidence is overwhelming - was not something that he takes a personal sense of responsibility for. SIEGLE: Why has it taken so long for this tribunal process to bring Nuon Chea to justice? OSNOS: Cambodia stayed at war for a decade after the end of the Khmer Rouge. And then even after that, it had a very hard time starting to come to grips with what had happened. A lot of Cambodians believe that's because the government today is constituted, in large part, by people who got their political start during the years of the Khmer Rouge. In fact, many of the senior leaders of today's Cambodian government were the foot soldiers of that regime. And they're not eager to see a tribunal that would begin to probe beyond the leaders of the Khmer Rouge. SIEGLE: So what happens next to Nuon Chea? OSNOS: Well, he's the second person to be arrested in recent months. The tribunal process has picked up speed recently. And he's likely to go on trial in the next few months after more evidence is collected. But in the meantime, he is in prison.

I'm Jacki Lyden. More than 100 world leaders are gathering in New York over the next few days for the United Nations General Assembly. Among those attending will be the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Prince Saud Al-Faisal. The desert kingdom has been looking for ways to increase its political influence in the Middle East, most recently, by hosting an Arab summit and reaffirming its willingness to broker a deal with Israel. Prince Saud also says Saudi Arabia is keeping a close eye on the events unfolding every day in Iraq, but maintains his country is more interested in keeping the region secure from outside Iraq's borders. Prince Saud joins me now from New York. Welcome to the program. Prince SAUD AL-FAISAL (Foreign Minister, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia): Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with you. LYDEN: Let's turn to Iraq first. I'd like to ask how worried you are about the Iranian role there. Iraq is a majority Shiite country, as we know, but Saudi Arabians have many coreligionists in the former Sunni ruling class. So what do you think Iran's intentions are? Prince AL-FAISAL: Well, coreligionists, we are all Muslims there. It's one religion. And Iran admits itself that it is interfering in Iraq, but it is claiming that it's for the benefit of Iraq. And we have taken a decision, and the countries adjacent to Iraq, that we should not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. We should all work to help, in the way that the Iraqis see that we can help. LYDEN: Do you foresee anything that would change your status there of nonintervention? Prince AL-FAISAL: Well, this is something that all of us have to decide on. We must sustain ourselves. Of course, having Iraq in this situation that it is tantalizing perhaps to some and opens the way to intervention from the outside. But this is to be resisted because it can only complicate the situation. LYDEN: This month, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker told the American Congress that they see good signs emerging in Iraq. Do you see any? Prince AL-FAISAL: Well, it took two issues - the political, as well as the military. Although, he said there were some military advances. He adds the political process is not coming through, and I think he's right in that. And unless the political process comes through, we hardly think that a solution for the Iraqi situation will be achievable. LYDEN: U. S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has invited Saudi Arabia along with other Arab countries to a summit on the question of peace in the Palestinians and Israel, expected to take place in November. Will the Kingdom attend? Prince AL-FAISAL: Well, this is not very true. There hasn't been a form of invitation to anybody. What we have been told is that these details are being worked out, and for that, many details have to be worked out. LYDEN: So you're not rejecting it out of hand, but you might like to see some preconditions? Prince AL-FAISAL: Well, I wouldn't call them preconditions. We want to be assured that the meeting will deal with the general peace of the Middle East and not just take a partial position on the peace process. LYDEN: Let me ask you again about the war in Iraq. The majority of Americans' poll say that they want some sort of U. S. pullout and soon. Do you feel that this is a good idea? Prince AL-FAISAL: I think the most important issue in Iraq is the national reconciliation. Anything else is secondary to this consideration, whether it is withdrawal or any other aspects of the Iraqi problem is hinged on the national reconciliation. And unless the national reconciliation happens, you cannot conceive of any other action whether it is withdrawal or that is - it shouldn't be done. LYDEN: Many analysts have said that a likely solution is a division of the country into several parts - Shia, Sunni, Kurd. Is this something that could provide security in the region? Prince AL-FAISAL: This is a call for continuous conflict, and conflict that would not only be localized to Iraq but would pull in the country surrounding Iraq, too. This is a most dangerous suggestion. LYDEN: Because it would lead to more bloodshed. Prince AL-FAISAL: Indeed. LYDEN: Your Excellency, you are in New York. I don't know whether or not you've ever had a chance to visit the site of the attack that we call Ground Zero down\u2026 Prince AL-FAISAL: Oh, yes, I have. LYDEN: I'd like to ask you, six years on this month, how is Saudi Arabia dealing with Islamic militancy? I mean, as you know, the majority of the hijackers who attacked the U. S. that day were from Saudi Arabia. Prince AL-FAISAL: Well, first of all, let me say that it was a disaster, a catastrophe of huge size, especially, felt in Saudi Arabia because we suffer from terrorism in the same way. Our people are killed; our security forces are being killed, so we know what the feeling of terrorist attack means. And we are trying to deal with terrorism in every way we can. LYDEN: But has there been an internal reconsideration in Saudi Arabia about the way that Islam is taught? In the past, the Kingdom has supported thousands of schools throughout the Islamic world. Do you ever reflect how the teachings of Islam have gone so far as to sometimes preached violence as a solution? Prince AL-FAISAL: We have gone through a soul-searching process of every facet of life and education in Saudi Arabia. And we have done everything that we can to reform the educational system not because of its impact outside but because we want our country and our society to bear the fruit of education without the extremism that it entail. LYDEN: We've been speaking with Prince Saud Al-Faisal, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia. Thank you very much for being with us today. Prince AL-FAISAL: Thank you.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Lee Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, delivered a scathing introduction to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday when he appeared on the Columbia campus. Bollinger told Ahmadinejad that his policies made him appear to be a cruel and petty dictator, and he addressed his Holocaust denials directly. Mr. LEE BOLLINGER (President, Columbia University): In a December 2005 state television broadcast, you described the Holocaust as a fabricated legend. One year later, you held a two-day conference of Holocaust deniers. For the illiterate and ignorant, this is dangerous propaganda. When you would come to a place like this, this makes you quite simply ridiculous. You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated. Your absurd comments about the debate over the Holocaust both defy historical truth and make all of us who continue to fear humanity's capacity for evil shudder at this closure of memory, which is always virtue's first line of defense. Will you cease this outrage? SIEGEL: Lee Bollinger has since been criticized by everyone, from former U. S. ambassador to the U. N. John Bolton, to the chancellors of seven Iranian universities. And he's joining us now from Columbia. Welcome to the program, President Bollinger. How do you respond to the complaint, first, from John Bolton and others that Columbia gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad precisely what he wants and that is publicity? Mr. BOLLINGER: I think that's not really the issue of him. But when he visited here, there were many interviews on CBS and CNN and so on, and of course, his statements at the General Assembly. So he has plenty of opportunities to make his points known. I think if you're going to have someone like this with the views and the actions that he has taken and appears to continue to take, it's extremely important to speak honestly, authentically and directly to those beliefs and actions. And that's what free speech is. And there's always a risk that there'll be some set of etiquette of politeness in the event that will give this a sense of implicit endorsement. And in a real serious dialogue, which I wanted to make this, it's extremely important to have the notions right as well as the word. SIEGEL: But let me take the word beyond publicity to something that Columbia can't confer that a journalist interview might not, and that is a certain amount of dignity, that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presentation was worthy of an academic audience at a great American university. Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, remember that this invitation originated with faculty from the Middle East and also - the Middle East Studies and also, primarily, from the dean of the School of International Affairs. So when you're really training people to be diplomats and members of the Foreign Service and in government and policy positions, it's very important to know what the world is like - who's in it, what kind of views they hold and how they reason, how they present themselves. So the only reason for inviting people is in order to advance the educational and research missions of the university, and that can include inviting people whose views and thinking really don't represent what the ideal is. So it really has to be a greater sense of leeway and scope to protect academic freedom fully. SIEGEL: Well, now, let's say the criticism that you're hearing from some Iranians, including the heads of universities there, which is that unlike diplomats, who might hear out some very odious ideas and very unattractive leaders, that the tone of the presentation and the tone of your questions to Ahmadinejad were - in their view - rude. And at least one Iranian man on the street is quoted in a wire services dispatch is saying that you and the audience behave like cowboys in dealing with their president. Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, I think I would describe it as a very strong dialogue and debate. And when you have views that the Holocaust didn't occur and you hold conferences on that, and you make statements about destroying Israel, and you're threatening the world with your nuclear programs arguably, and other things, as well as repression inside the society - not to confront them in a really full hearted way, I think, is the bigger mistake. SIEGEL: After the event, are you hearing criticisms of this sort from faculty, alumni, students at Columbia? Mr. BOLLINGER: Anytime you do something like this, I'm afraid there are a range of views on every part of this on whether or not he ever should have been invited, and then whether or not the event should have been conducted in this way. I think if you were just there and you saw the students out in the main quadrangle and you saw the students inside the room and you followed the student discussions over the preceding days before that and then afterwards, I think you would reach the conclusion fairly that the - it was just an enormous benefit in terms of a rich dialogue, discussion, debates, protests and the like. So I think while there's always going to be criticism on something like this, I think the overwhelming sense of this was it was free speech at its best. SIEGEL: Any second thoughts, regrets of things that might have been done better with this visit? Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, you know, it's too soon, too quick after the event. I think one always has to be self-reflective about something like this. Basically, I'm very proud in the institution and especially of the students. And I think that free speech is hard, and engaging in robust speeches is hard and not easy. It would have been not good, I think, if this had simply been come-and-give-a-speech, answer-a-few-questions and that's the end of that. It really had to take on these issues in a very forthright and sincere and emotional way as well as intellectual way, and I think that happened. SIEGEL: Just one last point in the non - among the non-academic duties or non-scholarly duties of a university president, raising money is a big one. Have you had people say to you, that's it. I'm not contributing anymore. Or I'm rethinking that chair that I might have endowed or whatever level of objection it might be? Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, I can tell you honestly, I'm very well aware of the connection between events on the campus and fundraising. And my experience has been there are some people who will stop giving. There are some people who will give more. But fundamentally, these are the things that universities do. And people who give money to the institution realize that, and they don't allow it to interfere with their feelings about the institution in that way. SIEGEL: Lee Bollinger, thank you very much for talking with us about it. Mr. BOLLINGER: Thank you. Sure. SIEGEL: Lee Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, talking about the appearance there this week of Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

So when you're really training people to be diplomats and members of the Foreign Service and in government and policy positions, it's very important to know what the world is like - who's in it, what kind of views they hold and how they reason, how they present themselves.  So the only reason for inviting people is in order to advance the educational and research missions of the university, and that can include inviting people whose views and thinking really don't represent what the ideal is. So it really has to be a greater sense of leeway and scope to protect academic freedom fully.  SIEGEL: Well, now, let's say the criticism that you're hearing from some Iranians, including the heads of universities there, which is that unlike diplomats, who might hear out some very odious ideas and very unattractive leaders, that the tone of the presentation and the tone of your questions to Ahmadinejad were - in their view - rude. And at least one Iranian man on the street is quoted in a wire services dispatch is saying that you and the audience behave like cowboys in dealing with their president.  Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, I think I would describe it as a very strong dialogue and debate. And when you have views that the Holocaust didn't occur and you hold conferences on that, and you make statements about destroying Israel, and you're threatening the world with your nuclear programs arguably, and other things, as well as repression inside the society - not to confront them in a really full hearted way, I think, is the bigger mistake.  SIEGEL: After the event, are you hearing criticisms of this sort from faculty, alumni, students at Columbia?  Mr. BOLLINGER: Anytime you do something like this, I'm afraid there are a range of views on every part of this on whether or not he ever should have been invited, and then whether or not the event should have been conducted in this way. I think if you were just there and you saw the students out in the main quadrangle and you saw the students inside the room and you followed the student discussions over the preceding days before that and then afterwards, I think you would reach the conclusion fairly that the - it was just an enormous benefit in terms of a rich dialogue, discussion, debates, protests and the like. So I think while there's always going to be criticism on something like this, I think the overwhelming sense of this was it was free speech at its best.  SIEGEL: Any second thoughts, regrets of things that might have been done better with this visit?  Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, you know, it's too soon, too quick after the event. I think one always has to be self-reflective about something like this. Basically, I'm very proud in the institution and especially of the students. And I think that free speech is hard, and engaging in robust speeches is hard and not easy. It would have been not good, I think, if this had simply been come-and-give-a-speech, answer-a-few-questions and that's the end of that. It really had to take on these issues in a very forthright and sincere and emotional way as well as intellectual way, and I think that happened.  SIEGEL: Just one last point in the non - among the non-academic duties or non-scholarly duties of a university president, raising money is a big one. Have you had people say to you, that's it. I'm not contributing anymore. Or I'm rethinking that chair that I might have endowed or whatever level of objection it might be?  Mr. BOLLINGER: Well, I can tell you honestly, I'm very well aware of the connection between events on the campus and fundraising. And my experience has been there are some people who will stop giving. There are some people who will give more. But fundamentally, these are the things that universities do. And people who give money to the institution realize that, and they don't allow it to interfere with their feelings about the institution in that way.  SIEGEL: Lee Bollinger, thank you very much for talking with us about it.  Mr. BOLLINGER: Thank you. Sure.  SIEGEL: Lee Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, talking about the appearance there this week of Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. The White House calls the crackdown barbaric. Myanmar's Asian neighbors expressed their revulsion. And the U. N. has sent its special envoy to Myanmar to try to work out a political solution. All this as Myanmar's military government continues to suppress pro-democracy demonstrations. Earlier today, I spoke with a top U. S. diplomat in Myanmar, Shari Villarosa. Ambassador SHARI VILLAROSA (U. S. Charge d'Affaires, Myanmar): Far fewer demonstrators came out today than previous days. But this is after two days of gunfire, teargas, beatings - so far fewer people. The military was posted around the city. And as small groups of protesters started to gather, they moved very quickly to break them up. BLOCK: And when they found them, what happened? Ambassador VILLAROSA: Well, we weren't necessarily there. But reports were people were beaten. There were people shot. People were actively chased. BLOCK: Have you heard reports of any protesters being killed today? Ambassador VILLAROSA: We - again, we've heard numerous reports of shootings, so that there were some death is probably to be expected. BLOCK: The Australian ambassador to Myanmar has said that while the Burmese government had said 10 people are killed, he's heard unconfirmed reports that it's several multiples of that. Ambassador VILLAROSA: Yes. I mean, I've heard estimates up to 200. I mean, that they're admitting 10 means that's sort of the floor, but there's likely to be more. BLOCK: I'd like to ask you about what's going on at the monasteries. Troops apparently have occupied the monasteries, sealed them off to keep the monks who are protesting from getting out. What are you hearing about the situation there? Ambassador VILLAROSA: On Wednesday evening, they entered at least six different monasteries. And whether they beat up or shot, there were pictures of bloodstains on the floors. There were broken windows, broken glass. We also received reports that many monks were taken away to prisons, presumably. Probably, for that reason, we noticed yesterday that there were significantly fewer monks that came out, although still a lot of ordinary citizens came out. Today, we saw no monks. BLOCK: No monks at all? Ambassador VILLAROSA: No. BLOCK: As the U. S. charge d'affaires there, are you in direct contact with the junta leaders? Ambassador VILLAROSA: No, they live in Naypyidaw, which is about 200 miles. It's their new capital. And the senior leaders rarely meet with foreigners. BLOCK: Do you think this regime has any history of listening to outside pressure? Ambassador VILLAROSA: No. BLOCK: None at all? Ambassador VILLAROSA: They don't listen to any - they don't listen to inside pressure. BLOCK: So would there be any role for the United States or any other governments to try to work out some sort of peaceful resolution here? Ambassador VILLAROSA: Well, I think there's tremendous desire on the part of the international community to facilitate a peaceful transition, but there doesn't seem to be any willingness on the part of the generals to talk with much of anyone. BLOCK: It sounds like you're saying then that if this regime wants to launch a full-out assault on civilians who are protesting, nothing will stop them from doing that. Ambassador VILLAROSA: I would hate to see that happen. What we've seen today is that not as many people have come out. So if they have succeeded in terrifying people from coming out - we saw all of this in 1988. And, again, the protests were brutally put down. This is a military that doesn't hesitate to shoot its own people. BLOCK: It sounds like for a diplomat to be in Myanmar now as you are, this must be an extremely frustrating time, if you're dealing with a government that has no interest in listening to anything you have to say. Ambassador VILLAROSA: Yes, very frustrating, but extremely fascinating. We have an opportunity to talk to the Burmese people all the time, and that's what makes working here such a pleasure because you know how important it is, and the fact that our presence gives these people hope. BLOCK: Well, Shari Villarosa, thank you very much for talking with us today. Ambassador VILLAROSA: Thank you, and keep remembering what's going on here. Don't forget. BLOCK: Shari Villarosa is the U. S. charge d'affaires in Myanmar. She spoke with us from Yangon.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  And I'm Robert Siegel.

U. N. envoy Ibrahim Gambari is meeting with military leaders there. Much of the reporting coming out of Myanmar, also known as Burma, is coming from people who risk their lives to send information to Burmese pro-democracy advocates who are in exile. Many Burmese are turning to the broadcast at the Democratic Voice of Burma in Norway. Aye Chan Naing is the executive director. He was a student leader during anti-junta protests in 1998 and joins us from Oslo. Thanks very much for being with us. Mr. AYE CHAN NAING (Executive Director, Democratic Voice of Burma): Thank you very much. SIMON: What are some of the ways in which you get reports from Burma? Mr. NAING: We're getting lots of the time for our journalists on the ground and also our contacts who are giving us information. They are the one who are really taking the risk. We could talk to people in the crowd who have a mobile telephone. Sometimes a bit more complicated, we have to secretly record the interview in the crowd without noticing to the authority. We also talk directly to the people at home through their land phone. SIMON: What's the effect of, let's say, bloggers and text messages? Mr. NAING: That's a really big impact. Internet is still very much limited usage in Burma compared to many other countries in the world partly because it's very, very expensive and also mainly because the government restrict it a lot. But even in that situation, a lot of young people started using the Internet and now what's happening during since last week, lots of bloggers managed to publish photos, video footage taken by their mobile telephone. SIMON: Hasn't the government recently tried to crack down on Internet traffic? Mr. NAING: They have been. They have been, especially since the last week. They have been trying to restrict the use of the Internet and also the mobile phone and the landline. We have lots of experience that the people who are giving us information, their land phone was cut off or their mobile telephone will stop transmitting. They've been really striking down the information that are coming out of Burma. SIMON: Are any of the people that you work with - have they've been arrested or imprisoned for their activities? Mr. NAING: Not the ones that we are working with have been arrested. But our journalists, for example, in a very serious and dangerous situation, it has been almost three weeks that none of them go back to their home and sleep because the authority started to notice who they are. So they're sleeping and hiding in different places. SIMON: Mr. Naing, as we noted, you were one of the leaders during the protest in 1988. Are these protests of the same character? Is there something different about them this time? Mr. NAING: Interestingly, I think it's a very similar character we have seen in terms of, like, majority of the people in the demonstration are young students. They were like my age, in fact, when I was in 1988. They were, like, 20, 22. They were very much actively leading the demonstration. SIMON: When you note that the situation is very similar to what happened in 1988, do you hope for a different ending this time than what happened in 1988? Mr. NAING: I do really hope for a different ending, especially when the whole world are witnessing what happened in Burma. Back in '88, nobody's really seen it and the lots of people probably don't even know where the Burma is. Now, we have a totally different situation, and especially if this uprising ended up like in 1988, I think it would be such a shame for the international community that the whole international community can't do anything but just sit and lie back and say, sorry, we can't do anything. That would be such a shame and tragedy. SIMON: Aye Chan Naing, who is the executive director of the Voice Burma, speaking with us from Oslo. Thank you very much. Mr. NAING: Thank you very much.

I'm James Hattori. In 1988, Forbes called billionaire Chuck Feeney the 23rd richest American. But the magazine got it wrong. Feeney had been enormously wealthy, but by then he'd started giving away his money to a foundation he'd set up called Atlantic Philanthropies. Today, the foundation is worth $4 billion and Mr. Feeney intends to give all of it away over the next decade. Chuck Feeney rarely gives interviews, so we're pleased to have him with us on WEEKEND EDITION. He joins us from New York. Welcome. Mr. CHUCK FEENEY (Founder, Duty Free Shoppers Group; Founder, Atlantic Philanthropies): Thank you. HATTORI: You are notoriously publicity shy. In fact, I think you once wrote into your own employment contract that you were obligated to remain silent about your business. Yet you've cooperated with the writing of a new biography, \"The Billionaire Who Wasn't\" by Conor O'Clery. And now, you've consented to talk with us. Why the change of heart? Mr. FEENEY: Yeah, I guess it's a time and tide thing. I'm not getting any younger, I don't think. And I feel like there might be some advantage to spreading the word about giving while living and the satisfaction that people get from giving, and see if anybody agrees. HATTORI: Most people probably have never heard of you, as I said, yet many know the business you built up over the years especially one called Duty Free Shoppers. That turned out to be an incredibly lucrative opportunity. Did you know it would always be that way, and how did that get started? Mr. FEENEY: Well, we didn't know it would be as lucrative as it turned out to be, but that's that way it is in business. Sometimes you start it and it takes off and it was a time, I guess, when people were traveling, just going to travel and shopping in airports was new to them - it's not very new today - and we caught a wave. HATTORI: Why did you take this turn to give away the vast fortune that you accumulated? Mr. FEENEY: Well, I knew that it was going to be an issue that had to be dealt within at some important time and I'm not terribly turn on by money. And it was the opportunity to see how that money could be put to good use, and the method was the Atlantic Philanthropies, which has been very, very active particularly in the last 10, 15 years. HATTORI: And that foundation has funded schools, and hospitals, universities, medical research and human rights efforts in the U. S. , Ireland, South Africa, Vietnam and everywhere else. How do you choose among the many worthy causes in the world? Mr. FEENEY: Yeah. Well, that's the big challenge because the money that's given is fairly substantial and it can be very successfully invested or alternatively could prove to be a marginal result, and we have been successful in selecting. And that had to do more with the situation and the people. HATTORI: What drives you to succeed and to make these businesses what they are? Mr. FEENEY: Well, that's part of the story. There is nothing that gives me a better feeling of success than saying the result of something that we have done. And I use an example of that - I was sitting in a hospital in Vietnam and we were supporting a group from Virginia called Operation Smile, a charity that goes all over the world doing corrective surgery. And there was a little girl sitting next to her father, just in front of me. I watched her cover her face up, just leave her hands in front of her mouth. And later on I figured out why, because she had a facial deformation. I saw that girl after she went through surgery and she was smiling. And I thought oh, my god, if we could take kids who were ashamed of something that they didn't cause and put them in a position to resolve it then that's a great source of satisfaction. HATTORI: Is that the kind of thing you got from your parents? There's a story also in the book about how your mother used to take a handicapped man, pick him up in her car even though she really didn't have to go anywhere but she made the excuse to go. Mr. FEENEY: Yeah. It's a question of caring for your neighbors and my mother cared about her neighbors at all times. And if she saw anybody with a problem, she tried to interject herself to find out if she could find a solution. HATTORI: They said that money can't buy happiness. In your case, it seems to have for you and many others, especially those who benefited from the foundation. Mr. FEENEY: Yes. I think that's true, but there are some people who like to have their money. Sometimes I wonder why because all you can really do is count it, unless you do something with it. And I was determined to use money for the purpose of helping others. HATTORI: What's the next chapter in your life right now? Mr. FEENEY: Gee, I wish I knew. I - we're going to continue spending our money because it's my belief that by giving while living, it doesn't prolong your life, you can do things and make good things happen and be part in parcel of that. And so, we have taken a board decision to spend down, which means that we're going to spend the corpus of the philanthropy in a time frame of about 10 years. And that will, you know, make things happen sooner rather than following the path of most philanthropies, which limit their giving to a percentage of their asset base. HATTORI: Well, why do you suppose you turned out the way you did? I mean, most people who accumulate wealth are interested in, you know, a comfortable life or spending on their kids or something, yet you've created this foundation and done different things. Why do you suppose you turned out that way? Mr. FEENEY: Gee, that's a difficult question to answer. Clearly, the impact of your parents on your later life is undeniable. My parents raised me to think about other people and say - they instruct me often that the things that can be done with money that help people are good investment. HATTORI: Chuck Feeney of Atlantic Philanthropies. Thank you very much for being with us today. Mr. FEENEY: Thank you very much.  JAMES HATTORI, host:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.

And I thought oh, my god, if we could take kids who were ashamed of something that they didn't cause and put them in a position to resolve it then that's a great source of satisfaction.  HATTORI: Is that the kind of thing you got from your parents? There's a story also in the book about how your mother used to take a handicapped man, pick him up in her car even though she really didn't have to go anywhere but she made the excuse to go.  Mr. FEENEY: Yeah. It's a question of caring for your neighbors and my mother cared about her neighbors at all times. And if she saw anybody with a problem, she tried to interject herself to find out if she could find a solution.  HATTORI: They said that money can't buy happiness. In your case, it seems to have for you and many others, especially those who benefited from the foundation.  Mr. FEENEY: Yes. I think that's true, but there are some people who like to have their money. Sometimes I wonder why because all you can really do is count it, unless you do something with it. And I was determined to use money for the purpose of helping others.  HATTORI: What's the next chapter in your life right now?  Mr. FEENEY: Gee, I wish I knew. I - we're going to continue spending our money because it's my belief that by giving while living, it doesn't prolong your life, you can do things and make good things happen and be part in parcel of that. And so, we have taken a board decision to spend down, which means that we're going to spend the corpus of the philanthropy in a time frame of about 10 years. And that will, you know, make things happen sooner rather than following the path of most philanthropies, which limit their giving to a percentage of their asset base.  HATTORI: Well, why do you suppose you turned out the way you did? I mean, most people who accumulate wealth are interested in, you know, a comfortable life or spending on their kids or something, yet you've created this foundation and done different things. Why do you suppose you turned out that way?  Mr. FEENEY: Gee, that's a difficult question to answer. Clearly, the impact of your parents on your later life is undeniable. My parents raised me to think about other people and say - they instruct me often that the things that can be done with money that help people are good investment.  HATTORI: Chuck Feeney of Atlantic Philanthropies. Thank you very much for being with us today.  Mr. FEENEY: Thank you very much. ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: Welcome to the program, sir. MOWAFFAK AL: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: A couple of weeks ago, the U. S. Senate passed an amendment that declared Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps a foreign terrorist organization, and the Senate did that, according to the amendment, out of concern that Iran might turn Shiite militia extremists in your country, in Iraq, into a Hezbollah-like force. Do you share that concern? And in your view, would a U. S. attack on Iran be justified or advisable? AL: You see, there are mounting evidence and intelligence reports show that Iran is meddling in the internal security affairs of Iraq. And we believe that one of the national security threat to a very successful outcome of the surge is going to be Iranian threat. And we believe that we the government of Iraq and the United States government need to engage with the Iranians and need to use a two-prong policy. One to make them feel the pain inside Iraq and the other one is to use big card(ph) and engage with them - serious engagement. . . SIEGEL: You say make them feel the pain in Iraq. AL: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Not in Iran. AL: No. Any military operation inside Iran is a fatal mistake. And it's a huge mistake. It will draw the whole region into an irreversible root of deterioration in the security in the whole region. And we need to get engaged with Iran. We the government of Iraq have been engaging with the Iranians. And we are telling them to stop meddling in our internal affairs. SIEGEL: On another subject, a private company Blackwater USA and others like it. Do you acknowledge that if an American security guard under contract to the State Department were to fire his weapon recklessly and kill an Iraqi that there is no Iraqi law under which he could be arrested, charged and tried for a possible offense? AL: Well, this is a very complicated legal issue, and I will leave it to the investigation committee, which is led jointly by the State Department and the government of Iraq. SIEGEL: But the question I'm asking is about sovereignty and jurisdiction. . . AL: But it's very unfortunate. I don't want to make this as a political issue. We need to sort out this legally. We need to make compensation to those people. We need to look into the future and see how can we revise and review the rules of engagement of these private security companies and what's their rules of engagement now. SIEGEL: What do you say to a critic of the government, of you governments, well, Doctor Iyad Allawi, the former prime minister, who say that the very basis of Prime Minister Maliki's government is fundamentally flawed because it's fundamentally sectarian. People went to the poles. They voted for parties - a Shiite party if they're Shia, a Sunni party if they're Sunni, Sunni Muslims didn't vote, or a Kurdish party if they were Kurdish - and that that cannot be the makings of a unified state. AL: My humble advice to former Prime Minister Dr. Iyad Allawi is to live the reality and not live the nine out of ten of his time outside the country, and try to influence the politics inside the country by remote control. The reality on the ground is completely different. And there's no alternative to Maliki. There's one alternative to Maliki and that's Maliki. SIEGEL: Well, why is that? It is a democracy. I mean governments change. Why is there no alternative? AL: True. This is democracy. But I cannot see changing the individual will make any benefit to Iraq now. The captain of the ship is fine. He's decisive. He's determined. He's strong. He's brave. He's courageous. The ship is in. . . SIEGEL: But the ship isn't moving faster though. That's the problem. AL: Exactly. The ship is not moving the faster because there are people who are putting sticks in the wheel. That's the problem. So the partners need to come around and need to work with this government constructively and move the political process forward. SIEGEL: Well, Dr. Al-Rubaie, thank you very much for taking with us today. AL: Thank you very much for having me, Robert.

I'm Scott Simon. Coming up, the revolution that was not televised - how upheaval in America influenced Russia and France in the 18th century. But first, Monica Feria is a Peruvian lawyer who lives in London. She received refugee status from the United Kingdom after she was illegally detained and imprisoned by President Alberto Fujimori in 1992. Since 1997, she has represented the victims of brutality at the Castro Castro Prison, where she was held and has won a decision in the Inter-American Court on Human Rights last November. Because of her work, Ms. Feria will be one of three recipients of this year's Gruber Justice Prizes, which she'll receive next week in Washington, D. C. Monica Feria joins us now from the BBC Studios in London. Thanks so much for being with us. Ms. MONICA FERIA (Human Rights Lawyer; 2007 Gruber Justice Prize recipient): Thank you very much for the kind invitation. SIMON: And can you describe to us how it happened that you were imprisoned? Ms. FERIA: In 1992, I worked as an assistant producer for a program that was to be broadcasted here in the United Kingdom. And the program was a documentary about Peru and the (unintelligible) armed conflict that at the time was taking place there. So obviously, this was seen by Fujimori as a problem. We had just finished with our work. I was detained and - you know, to produce a documentary of that sort was conceived as being threatening to the interest for Fujimori because gross human rights violations were taking place at the time and the regime didn't want the world to know about it. SIMON: What were conditions like in the Castro Castro Prison? Ms. FERIA: I arrived and I was quite shocked by the entire prison conditions -lack of water, you know, it was just - you could only have, you know, almost half a glass to wash yourself in the morning. No electricity most of the day. Overcrowded in a building were 90 people should sleep, there were about 400 and something in one cellblock. The cellblock where I was taken to was a women's cellblock, which were quite unusual because this was a prison for men, basically. It was a high-security prison for the most dangerous prisoners in Peru. And I was taken - you know, it was the first time I was detained. I was a middle-class girl and I was taken to this prison and straightaway put in the cellblock where people accused of belonging to Shining Path were housed. And it was a total shock for me. SIMON: Shining Path is Sendero Luminoso, the famous guerilla group. Ms. FERIA: Correct. Yes. Yes. SIMON: I'm sorry to get so specific but were there beatings? Were there instances of brutality? Ms. FERIA: Well, the state launched a massacre. I think that was my first experience in prison as a detainee. And it was extremely violent. Prisoners were shot. The state was using elite police forces and army. And they were all shooting to kill. And they started using helicopters to throw rockets. And the building was being destroyed little by little. There were quite a few women that were pregnant. I managed to survive that first day because I crawled on my elbows to try to go to the sewerage system so that the building that was collapsing could have fallen on me. From that moment, the survivors were taken to different prisons. And as I left the massacre, I was in clothes full of blood. And that's exactly how I had to live for the next five months. I was not allowed to change clothes. Or I was not allowed to see my relatives. I was not allowed to see a lawyer. I was basically taken to Santa Monica Prison to put in a cell that was two-for-two meter square. And they used brutal force constantly. I think the incommunicado, the prolonged incommunicado measures were extremely detrimental. Many women lost their sanity. SIMON: How many - I don't know whether they refer to them as inmates or victims. I expect both - of the Castro Castro prison are you representing at the moment? Ms. FERIA: About 300 victims and also relatives of victims that died and relatives of the victims that survived because they have also been acknowledged to be victims in their own right. Like the children, for example, of some of the inmates who were affected by not being able to have contact with their parents. I mean, families were shattered and this affected entire families. It certainly affected my own family, not just me. SIMON: How important was this, the finding of the Inter-American Court on Human Rights? Ms. FERIA: It's one of the most important cases ever on (Unintelligible). The state have the responsibility to prosecute all the actors that had ordered, planned and carried out these acts, including President Alberto Fujimori. SIMON: And of course, President Fujimori has been sent back to Peru. Have you thought about what it would be like to see him in the courtroom, to talk to him? Ms. FERIA: No. I haven't thought about it. I think it's been quite an important present just, you know, to see that extradition went through. And I'm still digesting those news that is important not just for Peru but for the world. SIMON: Monica Feria will receive that 2007 Gruber Justice Prize in Washington, D. C. next week.

And by the time it's down to two pennant winners in the World Series, you will probably have heard a lot about Rafael Perez, Manny Ramirez, Fausto Carmona, Ivan Hernandez, Tony Pena, Victor Martinez, Jose Valverde, Mike Lowell, Jhonny Peralta and, of course, Big Papi, David Ortiz. Those are just some of the Latino ballplayers on the four teams that are still in it. As of last season, 29 percent of Major League Baseball players were Latino. That's twice the figure for 1991, when Major League Baseball started counting. When Tony Perez played for the Cincinnati Reds, they weren't keeping count yet, but it must have been a lot less. Perez played for the great Reds teams of the late '60s and 1970s, the Big Red Machine. The slugging, clutch-hitting, first baseman was the first Cuban-born Major Leaguer to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. And today, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation gave Tony Perez the 2007 Hispanic Heritage Award for Sports. He joins us now. Welcome to the program. TONY PEREZ: Oh, thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: Congratulations on your award. PEREZ: Thank you. SIEGEL: How much has the atmosphere around Major League clubhouses changed with Latino ballplayers between when you came up and today? PEREZ: Well, it's like being in - long time ago in Miami, when every store say, we speak Spanish. I mean, in the clubhouse now, they speak Spanish most of the time. You see a lot of players. SIEGEL: Well, when you came up with the Reds, though, were you allowed to speak Spanish in the clubhouse? Was there anyone to speak Spanish within the clubhouse? PEREZ: Yeah, I was. I got a few players - Leo Cardenas, Chico Ruiz. But, you know, you'll hear remarks, hey, speak English, you know? And some other players, that was the way they were. SIEGEL: You were named Tony Perez by Americans playing baseball. PEREZ: Right. SIEGEL: You wouldn't - you weren't called Tony when you were a child in Cuba or later in Puerto Rico. PEREZ: No, because my real name is Atanasio. And Atanasio, they call me Tany. SIEGEL: Tany? PEREZ: That's the way they used to call me. But I came down here in 1960. And they started calling me Tony, and Tony works. SIEGEL: You - you were in the Major Leagues, they could call you what they wanted to call you. Is that what you're saying? PEREZ: Right. Right. And when long ago I go to the bank and I cash my check (unintelligible). (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: I want to ask you about something controversial that Gary Sheffield told GQ magazine this year. He felt that Major League owners preferred to have Latino ballplayers to African-American players because he said, I called it years ago, what I called is that you're going to see more black faces, but there ain't no English going to be coming out. It's about being able to tell Latin players what to do, being able to control them. He seems to think that it's harder to do that with African-American players. What do you think about what Sheffield said? PEREZ: Well, I don't know what Gary frankly said. He said a lot of more players in the B League from Latin America now when it black. He may be trying to say that. They care more about it, the Latin players because they get a school down in Dominican Republic, Venezuela and some of the other Latin countries. SIEGEL: What was it like when you were signed? Did you get rich the moment you were signed for the Major Leagues? PEREZ: Rich? No way. I got a $2. 50 to get a visa to get out of Cuba to get my, you know, that's only I got, $2. 50. SIEGEL: OK. This year's league championship series. In the National League, Arizona versus Colorado. What do you think? PEREZ: Well, those two teams are hot. They really want to play and they really want to get in. And it's hard to predict who will win that one. SIEGEL: And in the American League, Medias Rojas from Boston and los Indios from Cleveland? PEREZ: Well, I think the Red Sox, to me, have the best team, I mean, the best pitching. But Cleveland, the Indians are tough ball club. Well, they give some pitching and they can hit. And you never know, but I would say the Red Sox. SIEGEL: And if it's Red Sox against Arizona in the World Series, what do you think? PEREZ: Red Sox. SIEGEL: Red Sox, Red Sox. So a question that must be posed to anybody who played with the Big Red Machine teams, should Pete Rose be admitted to Baseball's Hall of Fame? PEREZ: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Absolutely? PEREZ: Yes. I play with people a lot of years. And what he did in the field - well, it was amazing to watch. SIEGEL: But off the field, he gambled, and he lied about it. PEREZ: Well, my point of view is what he did in the field was. I don't think he's doing what - he already paid for what he did before. SIEGEL: Well, Tony Perez, once again, congratulations on your Hispanic Heritage Award today and thanks for coming in to talk with us. PEREZ: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: Tony Perez, former all-star first baseman of the Cincinnati Reds. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host:  Baseball's two league championship series begin tonight and tomorrow night. And by the time it's down to two pennant winners in the World Series, you will probably have heard a lot about Rafael Perez, Manny Ramirez, Fausto Carmona, Ivan Hernandez, Tony Pena, Victor Martinez, Jose Valverde, Mike Lowell, Jhonny Peralta and, of course, Big Papi, David Ortiz. Those are just some of the Latino ballplayers on the four teams that are still in it. As of last season, 29 percent of Major League Baseball players were Latino. That's twice the figure for 1991, when Major League Baseball started counting. When Tony Perez played for the Cincinnati Reds, they weren't keeping count yet, but it must have been a lot less. Perez played for the great Reds teams of the late '60s and 1970s, the Big Red Machine. The slugging, clutch-hitting, first baseman was the first Cuban-born Major Leaguer to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. And today, the Hispanic Heritage Foundation gave Tony Perez the 2007 Hispanic Heritage Award for Sports. He joins us now. Welcome to the program. TONY PEREZ: Oh, thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: Congratulations on your award. PEREZ: Thank you. SIEGEL: How much has the atmosphere around Major League clubhouses changed with Latino ballplayers between when you came up and today? PEREZ: Well, it's like being in - long time ago in Miami, when every store say, we speak Spanish. I mean, in the clubhouse now, they speak Spanish most of the time. You see a lot of players. SIEGEL: Well, when you came up with the Reds, though, were you allowed to speak Spanish in the clubhouse? Was there anyone to speak Spanish within the clubhouse? PEREZ: Yeah, I was. I got a few players - Leo Cardenas, Chico Ruiz. But, you know, you'll hear remarks, hey, speak English, you know? And some other players, that was the way they were. SIEGEL: You were named Tony Perez by Americans playing baseball. PEREZ: Right. SIEGEL: You wouldn't - you weren't called Tony when you were a child in Cuba or later in Puerto Rico. PEREZ: No, because my real name is Atanasio. And Atanasio, they call me Tany. SIEGEL: Tany? PEREZ: That's the way they used to call me. But I came down here in 1960. And they started calling me Tony, and Tony works. SIEGEL: You - you were in the Major Leagues, they could call you what they wanted to call you. Is that what you're saying? PEREZ: Right. Right. And when long ago I go to the bank and I cash my check (unintelligible). (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: I want to ask you about something controversial that Gary Sheffield told GQ magazine this year. He felt that Major League owners preferred to have Latino ballplayers to African-American players because he said, I called it years ago, what I called is that you're going to see more black faces, but there ain't no English going to be coming out. It's about being able to tell Latin players what to do, being able to control them. He seems to think that it's harder to do that with African-American players. What do you think about what Sheffield said? PEREZ: Well, I don't know what Gary frankly said. He said a lot of more players in the B League from Latin America now when it black. He may be trying to say that. They care more about it, the Latin players because they get a school down in Dominican Republic, Venezuela and some of the other Latin countries. SIEGEL: What was it like when you were signed? Did you get rich the moment you were signed for the Major Leagues? PEREZ: Rich? No way. I got a $2. 50 to get a visa to get out of Cuba to get my, you know, that's only I got, $2. 50. SIEGEL: OK. This year's league championship series. In the National League, Arizona versus Colorado. What do you think? PEREZ: Well, those two teams are hot. They really want to play and they really want to get in. And it's hard to predict who will win that one. SIEGEL: And in the American League, Medias Rojas from Boston and los Indios from Cleveland? PEREZ: Well, I think the Red Sox, to me, have the best team, I mean, the best pitching. But Cleveland, the Indians are tough ball club. Well, they give some pitching and they can hit. And you never know, but I would say the Red Sox. SIEGEL: And if it's Red Sox against Arizona in the World Series, what do you think? PEREZ: Red Sox. SIEGEL: Red Sox, Red Sox.

Remember, at this stage, Obama is not actually running for president, but for the Democratic nomination for president. And that means his biggest opponent right now is the candidate that's some 20 points ahead of him in national polls. That's New York Senator Hillary Clinton. We reached Senator Obama yesterday in his car, as he traveled between Iowa campaign events. I asked him if Senator Clinton is weak on some issues. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois): Well, I think that I am stronger for the kind of challenges that we're going to face in the next several years. SEABROOK: Which ones? Sen. OBAMA: Otherwise I wouldn't be running for president. SEABROOK: Which ones? Sen. OBAMA: I think that the two key challenges that we face is to bring this country together and make sure that we can actually overcome the special interest-driven politics and the partisanship in Washington to get things done on health care and on energy. And I think that I'm in a better position to bring the country together than Senator Clinton is. I also think the second big challenge is to repair the damage that's been done by George Bush when it comes to foreign policy. SEABROOK: Then let's turn to foreign policy. You and Senator Clinton, neither of you have agreed to directly pulling out troops, as some in your party would like. What's the difference between you two on Iraq, on what you would actually do now? Sen. OBAMA: Well, I think it is important to understand that I opposed this war from the start and Senator Clinton did not. That's not\u2026 SEABROOK: What difference does that make now, sir, though? Sen. OBAMA: Because what it shows is judgment. We can't anticipate what challenges we're going to face in the future. Nobody knew that in 2001, our foreign policy would fundamentally be transformed. And the question is, how are you going to react to the new challenges and the new opportunities that present themselves in the years to come? And on the most important foreign policy issue of a generation, I got it right and others did not. And that has bearing in terms of how I will approach and assess the critical choices that lie ahead. SEABROOK: There is a challenge now. So what would you do now that is different than what Senator Clinton would do? Sen. OBAMA: Well, I won't speak for Senator Clinton in terms of how she would approach it. But I think that the way you characterized me isn't quite right. I have said that we have to get our troops out, and that we have to do so as quickly as possible. The only thing that I've called for is a very limited force to provide security for our embassy and for our diplomats on the ground, as well as to carry out targeted strikes against al-Qaida operatives that may try to set up base camp in Iraq. But the most important thing that we have to do is initiate a kind of diplomacy that is going to stabilize the situation. And there, Senator Clinton and I do appear to have a difference, although it's hard to tell. I suggested that we should talk to our enemies and not just our friends, including Iran, including Syria. I got in an argument with Senator Clinton back in the summer about this, because she suggested that that approach of negotiating without preconditions could be used for propaganda purposes and would be naive. SEABROOK: But at the same time that you talk about the threat from Iran and the importance of dealing with Iran, you don't support the amendment that Senator Clinton does that would designate the Iranian al Quds force as a terrorist organization. Why don't you support that? Sen. OBAMA: Well, I would have supported a stand-alone piece of legislation identifying the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization. The problem was that it was embedded in language that suggested the president should maintain the force structure in Iraq that is needed to blunt the influence of Iran inside Iraq. And that provides an aggressive Bush-Cheney administration potentially the opening to initiate military action against Iran. You know, this is a lesson that I think Senator Clinton and others should have learned, that you can't give this president a blank check and then act surprised when he cashes it. SEABROOK: Meanwhile, General David Petraeus, the top U. S. military commander in Iraq, says the Iranian ambassador to Iraq is part of that al Quds force and that it is known \u2014 it is documented \u2014 that Iran is all mixed up in the Shia militias in the south of Iraq. How would you, as President Obama, solve the problems in Iraq without dealing with the role of Iran down there? Sen. OBAMA: Oh, we have to deal with the role of Iran. The question is whether we deal with Iran through saber rattling, or whether we deal with Iran by direct diplomatic engagement. The key for us is to engage in the sort of direct talks that we engaged in, by the way, when Iran cooperated with us in dealing with the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's that sort of direct engagement that this president has been unwilling to do, but under an Obama administration would be, I think it's top priority. SEABROOK: It sounds a little bit, sir, like you're all carrot, no stick - if I might just use a cliche. Sen. OBAMA: Well, you know, maybe that's because we haven't been talking about what kinds of military actions are available. The truth is that I've said repeatedly that military options should remain on the table. The question is do you lead with those or do you present carrots and sticks at the same time. I think Iran understands what military threats we boast. They're not surprised we could strike them and strike them hard. What we haven't suggested in anyway is what advantages they would have in acting more responsibly in the region. That's then the mission ingredient. As president, I will use whatever military force is necessary to protect U. S. citizens and interests around the globe. But what I also understand is that the military option is not the only option in the toolbox. You know, we've had administration that thinks the only tool is the hammer. And as a consequence, everything looks like a nail. And we've done incredible damage to our security and standing around the world. SEABROOK: If I could just try one last political question, sir. Georgia Congressman John Lewis endorsed Hillary Clinton. John Lewis, of course, a civil rights icon in the United States. This has got to be something of a blow to your campaign. Sen. OBAMA: Well, we have probably the majority of Georgia-elected officials, including two congressmen who endorsed us. I can't expect to be getting every single endorsement given the eight years of a Clinton presidency and the long-time relationships that he's established with leaders all across the country and the favors that he's done for political players all across the country. I promise you this that as much respect as I have for John Lewis, it's not going to have much of an impact on the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary and ultimately that's what's going to determine who the next nominee is. SEABROOK: Democratic presidential candidate and Illinois Senator Barack Obama, traveling across Iowa, campaigning for the Democratic nomination. Thank you, sir, very much. Sen. OBAMA: Thank you, Andrea.

I spoke yesterday with the French finance minister. Her name is Christine Lagarde. I asked her about recent turmoil in the financial markets and whether she and other officials fear a period of real instability. Ms. CHRISTINE LAGARDE (Finance Minister, France): I wouldn't call it a fear but certainly we are all concerned, and we share the same concern that what happened in the summer - the turbulence or the market corrections that took place and turned into a bit of a global turmoil on the financial markets do not happen again. SEABROOK: You're talking about the subprime crisis. Ms. LAGARDE: Yeah. SEABROOK: The correction in the markets\u2026 Ms. LAGARDE: Yeah. Yeah. SEABROOK: \u2026around subprime loans. Ms. LAGARDE: Absolutely. SEABROOK: Are you pushing for greater regulation of the U. S. subprime markets? Ms. LAGARDE: We're certainly pushing for accountability and regulations relating to those non-banking establishment that offer credit. And that, generally afterwards, securitize the credit so that risks are completely fragmented and dispersed in such a way that no one really knows what are the underlying behind those risks. SEABROOK: Let me turn, Christine Lagarde, to a few questions about you as a person and your work in France right now. You spent many years working as an executive with an American law firm - Baker & McKenzie. You were in Chicago for those years. And I've read that you've been referred to now back in France as The American. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. LAGARDE: Yes, that's true. I have to confess an anecdote, actually. I was presenting the budget three days ago and one of the communist member of the national assembly - we still have a few of them - actually addressed me in English just to, probably, you know, pull my legs or take the mick out of me. And his statement will not be recorded in the official gazette as not compliant with the French law requiring that French language be used in the national assembly. SEABROOK: Well, I gather that being called The American isn't an insult. Ms. LAGARDE: Oh, absolutely not. SEABROOK: A big part of your job as a member of the government of Nicolas Sarkozy is to reform the French workplace and, in fact, the French mind to have sort of a more of an American view of the workplace and the work week, in fact. Ms. LAGARDE: Hmm. Well, as you know, back some seven or eight years ago, there was a law implemented by the Socialist Party - at the time, in power - that reduced the working hours to 35 hours a week. And it's not particularly that number which actually triggered a change in the mindset. But I think it is the whole psyche of quite a lot of French people that changed at the time. And it's what we're trying to reform with President Sarkozy. His - one of his key messages during his campaign, and one of his key principles, is that work is fine and should be part of the ethics. SEABROOK: I gather that this has been met, at least recently with transit strikes now over your government's proposed reforms. Ms. LAGARDE: Yeah. That took place last week. There was a one day of massive strike because what we're also trying to do is to change the pension schemes so that people - instead of retiring after 37 years of service - retire after 40 years of service, which is the general principle applying to all workers except in the transportation sector. SEABROOK: I have to ask. There is sort of a cultural dialogue here in the United States about the fact that constantly improving productivity and working more is good for business but it takes a toll on people's lives. And I wonder, seeing it from the other side of this issue, what you see is the balance there? Ms. LAGARDE: You know, it might be a question of striking somewhere in between the American mantra and the French approach. And somewhere in between might be the right way. The French people have elected President Sarkozy to change things and bring a bit of productivity into the system and put work and labor and bit of effort back in the center of the beautiful French equation, which is not only limited to good food, good wine and a few other good things. SEABROOK: Christine Lagarde, finance minister of France. Thanks very much for your time. Ms. LAGARDE: Sure.

Ms. CHRISTINE LAGARDE (Finance Minister, France): I wouldn't call it a fear but certainly we are all concerned, and we share the same concern that what happened in the summer - the turbulence or the market corrections that took place and turned into a bit of a global turmoil on the financial markets do not happen again.  SEABROOK: You're talking about the subprime crisis.  Ms. LAGARDE: Yeah.  SEABROOK: The correction in the markets\u2026  Ms. LAGARDE: Yeah. Yeah.  SEABROOK: \u2026around subprime loans.  Ms. LAGARDE: Absolutely.  SEABROOK: Are you pushing for greater regulation of the U. S. subprime markets?  Ms. LAGARDE: We're certainly pushing for accountability and regulations relating to those non-banking establishment that offer credit. And that, generally afterwards, securitize the credit so that risks are completely fragmented and dispersed in such a way that no one really knows what are the underlying behind those risks.  SEABROOK: Let me turn, Christine Lagarde, to a few questions about you as a person and your work in France right now. You spent many years working as an executive with an American law firm - Baker & McKenzie. You were in Chicago for those years. And I've read that you've been referred to now back in France as The American.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. LAGARDE: Yes, that's true. I have to confess an anecdote, actually. I was presenting the budget three days ago and one of the communist member of the national assembly - we still have a few of them - actually addressed me in English just to, probably, you know, pull my legs or take the mick out of me. And his statement will not be recorded in the official gazette as not compliant with the French law requiring that French language be used in the national assembly.  SEABROOK: Well, I gather that being called The American isn't an insult.  Ms. LAGARDE: Oh, absolutely not.  SEABROOK: A big part of your job as a member of the government of Nicolas Sarkozy is to reform the French workplace and, in fact, the French mind to have sort of a more of an American view of the workplace and the work week, in fact.  Ms. LAGARDE: Hmm. Well, as you know, back some seven or eight years ago, there was a law implemented by the Socialist Party - at the time, in power - that reduced the working hours to 35 hours a week. And it's not particularly that number which actually triggered a change in the mindset. But I think it is the whole psyche of quite a lot of French people that changed at the time. And it's what we're trying to reform with President Sarkozy.  His - one of his key messages during his campaign, and one of his key principles, is that work is fine and should be part of the ethics.  SEABROOK: I gather that this has been met, at least recently with transit strikes now over your government's proposed reforms.  Ms. LAGARDE: Yeah. That took place last week. There was a one day of massive strike because what we're also trying to do is to change the pension schemes so that people - instead of retiring after 37 years of service - retire after 40 years of service, which is the general principle applying to all workers except in the transportation sector.  SEABROOK: I have to ask. There is sort of a cultural dialogue here in the United States about the fact that constantly improving productivity and working more is good for business but it takes a toll on people's lives. And I wonder, seeing it from the other side of this issue, what you see is the balance there?  Ms. LAGARDE: You know, it might be a question of striking somewhere in between the American mantra and the French approach. And somewhere in between might be the right way. The French people have elected President Sarkozy to change things and bring a bit of productivity into the system and put work and labor and bit of effort back in the center of the beautiful French equation, which is not only limited to good food, good wine and a few other good things.  SEABROOK: Christine Lagarde, finance minister of France. Thanks very much for your time.  Ms. LAGARDE: Sure. ", "section": "News", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2007 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He was a U. S. Marine in Guam and Okinawa during the World War II. He once took cobra venom. He was arrested on Long Island for showing too much leg. He wrote a script for at least one classic film, \"Bad Day at Black Rock\" and was co-creator of one of the most enduring characters in cartoon history: \"Mr. Magoo. \" (Soundbite of movie, \"Ragtime Bear\") Mr. JIM BACKUS (Actor): (As Mr. Quincy Magoo) Which way to Hotspots Lodge? Unidentified Man #1: (As Character) Can't you read the sign? Mr. BACKUS: (As Mr. Quincy Magoo) Well, certainly I can read the sign. What does it say? SIMON: It's a scene from the very first \"Mr. Magoo\" called \"Ragtime Bear. \" It was written by Millard Kaufman almost 60 years ago. As you may have gathered, Millard Kaufman isn't one of these young writers who works as a bike messenger for six months then writes a novel about being a bike messenger. No. Millard Kaufman is 90 years old and has just published his very first novel, \"Bowl of Cherries,\" a book that bounces around the globe and bounces words off each other with delight. Millard Kaufman joins us from our studios at NPR West. Mr. Kaufman, thanks so much for being here. Mr. MILLARD KAUFMAN (Novelist, \"Bowl of Cherries\"): Well, thank you for having me. I enjoy being here. SIMON: I have to ask you, have you been waiting to write a novel for 70 years or just - this was the last thing left for you to do? Mr. KAUFMAN: That's one good way of putting it. It was the last thing until a next thing shows up. I had spent most of my life writing pictures. And I was 88, and I remembered having heard Somerset Maugham speaking at UCLA one night. Maugham said, well, there are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, nobody knows what they are. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KAUFMAN: So I thought if no rules exist, I might as well try it. SIMON: The book concerns a frightfully intelligent young man - 14 when the book opens - named Judd Breslau. I can't explain every plot point, but he falls in love with the daughter of a very prominent Egyptologist, and the story moves from Colorado to corn studio under the Brooklyn Bridge, ultimately, a jail cell in Iraq. When you bring him through all those different locations and all those different experiences, I'm wondering, were you hoping that he would grow up? Mr. KAUFMAN: He grows up enough. He is \u2014 I think I try to make him, if nothing more despite his age one way or the other, essentially human. SIMON: Yeah. Mr. KAUFMAN: And I think he (unintelligible). But in terms of growing up, I don't know, I'm 90. I have high hopes of growing up someday, but I sure in hell haven't reached it yet. (Soundbite of laughter) SIMON: A Washington Post critic, by the way, who loved your book, says that he's never read another novel that you have to keep the dictionary open quite so much. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KAUFMAN: Well, I love fooling around with words assuming that, if I overdo it some relatively bright editor \u2014 in this case Eli Horowitz of McSweeney's \u2014 would suggest that I change it. He didn't and for a very good reason, the reason I had actually used those words. And that is here is a 14-year-old kid who's a bit of a smart ass, and as he expresses himself, he can't help flexing his muscles, showing off, and he uses all this highfalutin, multi-syllable words. And I think it has the effect of being funny. SIMON: How did you invent Mr. Magoo? Is he somebody you knew? Mr. KAUFMAN: Yes. Cartoons at that time were made up of what are called hurt gags in which you take in a protagonist like Bugs Bunny, for example, and somebody is constantly beating on him and in the last 15 seconds he emerges triumphant and it says the end. There was a director named John Hubley, who is an enormously competent man. So one day I said to him, we could in six minutes have a beginning, a middle and an end, we could tell a story. And so I came up with the idea of Magoo, who was my uncle. My uncle had no problem with his eyes. He simply interpreted everything that came across his way in his own particular manner, and he could at times be a little bit difficult, but he would only see things the way they existed highly subjectively to him. SIMON: And he's become a real signature character in the culture. I mean, somebody bumps into a wall and they say who are you? Mr. Magoo? Mr. KAUFMAN: Yeah, it's kind of interesting. We made a big mistake, John and I, in giving Magoo eyeglasses. His inability to see was entirely symbolic - that is his insistence on his own way. But by giving him glasses, we were accused, between 20 and 40 years later, of being terribly, viciously, politically incorrect, making fun of people who couldn't see. That wasn't the idea at all. SIMON: Yeah, because it was metaphorical blindness. Mr. KAUFMAN: Exactly. SIMON: Yeah. You've written so many films but certainly we mentioned \"Bad Day at Black Rock\" for which you were nominated for an Academy Award. Let's play a clip. Spencer Tracy is the World War II veteran who takes a train to a western town searching for the father of a boy who saved his life, but locals aren't exactly warm. (Soundbite of movie, \"Bad Day at Black Rock\") Mr. SPENCER TRACY (Actor): (As John J. Macreedy) All I want from you is a little information. I have to go to a place called Adobe Flat. Unidentified Man #2: (As Character) This ain't no information bureau. Mr. TRACY: (As John J. Macreedy) There's one thing about Black Rock - everybody is polite. That makes for a very gracious living. Unidentified Man #2: (As Character) Nobody asked you here. Mr. TRACY: (As John J. Macreedy) How do you know? Mr. KAUFMAN: I did all kinds of work at MGM including handling pictures which were not yet pictures. They were screenplays which fell into a deep hole. They were not done well enough to have been shot and made into movies, and they were not done poorly enough to be simply burned. So they asked me to take a look at it, and that's what I did for a while. SIMON: Well, I happened to be - the Web is a wonderful instrument - I happened to be looking at a newspaper photo of you. It must have been in 1941\u2026 Mr. KAUFMAN: Oh, god. SIMON: \u2026walking in a punishingly tight shorts on a street somewhere in Long Island, and I guess you're being arrested for baring too much leg in Long Island. You were a Newsday reporter. Mr. KAUFMAN: That's right. They decided that a certain posh, rather chic town on Long Island should be reprimanded because there was a city ordinance that said that no one could enter the city boundaries wearing shorts. So Newsday sent me and a very pretty girl reporter inside the town with shorts. They notified the cops. And of course, as soon as we crossed the line, we were arrested and the paper bailed us out. SIMON: Well, I\u2026 Mr. KAUFMAN: I didn't even notice anything about that that existed anymore, much less a picture. SIMON: While I have the chance, I have never before spoken with somebody, who has at least willingly had cobra venom, and I've been able to ask about it. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KAUFMAN: Yeah. What happened was I went to school with a young man whose father was head of Hynson, Westcott laboratories in Baltimore. This was at Hopkins. Buddy's(ph) father was experimenting with some analgesic other than aspirin, something that was much stronger, and he had come up with cobra venom. He had tested it successfully as I remember with rats and rabbits and then he wanted human beings. So Bud was in charge of asking certain schoolmates to volunteer to take this stuff. My wife volunteered, and that is how I met her. I volunteered, only I said, if they'd give me $5. And at first they raised hell then they gave me $5 and I took the stuff. Its effect on me was peculiar and I don't remember anything about it. But about two hours later, I was on the golf course in this wonderfully refreshing summer rain and all of us were absolutely naked. Now, how the hell this happened, I don't know, but that's precisely the result - the only result I ever knew of cobra venom. SIMON: Wow. It induces nudity, I guess. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. KAUFMAN: One of things it induced, which was very great, was an introduction to my wife\u2026 SIMON: Yeah. Mr. KAUFMAN: \u2026and a couple of years later, we were married. SIMON: Mr. Kaufman, it's been a pleasure talking to you. Mr. KAUFMAN: Well, it's very enjoyable talking with you.

More officers have been shot to death so far this year than were killed in all of 2006. The fatalities have occurred from New York City to Franconia, New Hampshire. John Timoney is the chief of police in Miami. He joins us from member station WLRN. Chief Timoney, thanks so much for being with us. Chief JOHN TIMONEY (City of Miami Police Department): Thank you, Scott. SIMON: Sixty police officers have been shot to death in the United States this year, which is, we're told, an increase of more than 50 percent from all of last year. What are some of the reasons that you think this might be the case? Chief TIMONEY: On quite a few of these shootings, not just automatic weapons, but assault rifles had been used, number one. Number two, there seems to be, as you look across the United States, situations where almost like a routine call, if you will - as a police officer approaches, the subject without warning just opens up on the police officer. Quite a few of them having head shots, so clearly there's a recognition that police officers wear bullet-proof vests. And then there seems to be, and this is hard to tell, if in fact there is a culture growing up that to get advantage of the police officer, shoot immediately. So it isn't this traditional situation where a police officer interrupts, you know, a bank robbery or a liquor store holdup and you have a gunfight. These are all, as best as I can tell, one-way situations where the police officer without any kind of prior notice is just shot and killed. SIMON: Is the kind of weaponry that criminals are able to acquire growing more powerful? Chief TIMONEY: Oh, without a doubt. The federal assault weapons ban went into effect 10 years ago, some said about a year and a half ago, two years ago. And certainly, in South Florida, we see in the markets here are being flooded by these assault rifles. There's so many of them on the market it's driving down the prices, so that you can get these weapons for under $300. They're much more powerful in the bullet themselves and then there's more of them. So instead of 10 shooter, you now have 30 rounds. SIMON: $300 for an assault weapon. It's cheaper than an iPod. Chief TIMONEY: It's cheaper than an iPod. It's cheaper than my Glock. And it also has this kind of macho image from television and the movies. I don't think you can underestimate the power of television and the movies in this situation. Just in my career, they've gone from Saturday night specials, all the way up to AK-47s, Tech-9s. What is the police officer going to face 10 years from now? It will be Rambo becomes reality, unless something is done and has to be done on the national level. SIMON: You're suggesting greater gun control, it sounds like. Chief TIMONEY: Absolutely. Listen, I'm fully aware Congress (unintelligible) support about the Second Amendment. But there's no way anybody can convince me that an ordinary citizen should be walking around the streets of our cities carrying a military assault weapon. I mean, that's just ridiculous. SIMON: How do you react to the argument, chief, that people who are criminals and determine to use them for violent means are always going to figure out a way to get hold of these weapons? Chief TIMONEY: Well, I don't think that's true. If you look at homicides, for example, if you look at a place like New York City where I came from - that has a pretty good gun control legislation at hand - you'll see that the proportion of homicides committed will be below 60, 62 percent, 63 maybe. You go to places where guns are easy to get - Philadelphia, which is part of Pennsylvania, which is the second highest gun state in the nation - 85 percent of the homicides will be committed by guns. So just 90 miles south of New York City, in Philadelphia, you'll see a 22 percent increase in gun homicides. SIMON: Chief Timoney, are you at all concerned that police officers across the country will have their morale affected or, even more substantially, they're going to be more reluctant to go into a dark alley, more reluctant to answer a call in certain streets? Chief TIMONEY: I don't see that right now. I don't expect to see it. Sometimes, my complaint of police officers is sometimes they're too brave for their own good. And what we're trying to do is teach them good tactics to take the extra half a second for their own safety. I think it's tactics like that and then other equipment that over the years has proved beneficial in reducing the number of police officers killed in the line of duty. Which is why, people like myself, are becoming quite concerned with this huge increase. SIMON: John Timoney, chief of the Miami Police, thanks very much. Chief TIMONEY: Thank you, Scott.  SCOTT SIMON, host:  Police officers in the United States are dying in the line of duty at an alarming rate. More officers have been shot to death so far this year than were killed in all of 2006. The fatalities have occurred from New York City to Franconia, New Hampshire.  John Timoney is the chief of police in Miami. He joins us from member station WLRN.  Chief Timoney, thanks so much for being with us.  Chief JOHN TIMONEY (City of Miami Police Department): Thank you, Scott.  SIMON: Sixty police officers have been shot to death in the United States this year, which is, we're told, an increase of more than 50 percent from all of last year. What are some of the reasons that you think this might be the case?  Chief TIMONEY: On quite a few of these shootings, not just automatic weapons, but assault rifles had been used, number one. Number two, there seems to be, as you look across the United States, situations where almost like a routine call, if you will - as a police officer approaches, the subject without warning just opens up on the police officer. Quite a few of them having head shots, so clearly there's a recognition that police officers wear bullet-proof vests.  And then there seems to be, and this is hard to tell, if in fact there is a culture growing up that to get advantage of the police officer, shoot immediately. So it isn't this traditional situation where a police officer interrupts, you know, a bank robbery or a liquor store holdup and you have a gunfight. These are all, as best as I can tell, one-way situations where the police officer without any kind of prior notice is just shot and killed.  SIMON: Is the kind of weaponry that criminals are able to acquire growing more powerful?  Chief TIMONEY: Oh, without a doubt. The federal assault weapons ban went into effect 10 years ago, some said about a year and a half ago, two years ago. And certainly, in South Florida, we see in the markets here are being flooded by these assault rifles.  There's so many of them on the market it's driving down the prices, so that you can get these weapons for under $300. They're much more powerful in the bullet themselves and then there's more of them. So instead of 10 shooter, you now have 30 rounds.  SIMON: $300 for an assault weapon. It's cheaper than an iPod.  Chief TIMONEY: It's cheaper than an iPod. It's cheaper than my Glock. And it also has this kind of macho image from television and the movies. I don't think you can underestimate the power of television and the movies in this situation.  Just in my career, they've gone from Saturday night specials, all the way up to AK-47s, Tech-9s.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. And in this segment, a conversation with the speaker of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi says House Democrats have accomplished much since they became the majority. But she says her party's inability to make President Bush change course in Iraq makes that hard for people to see. I spoke with Nancy Pelosi this morning at the Capitol. Madam speaker, welcome back to the program. Representative NANCY PELOSI (Democrat, California; Speaker of the House of Representatives): Thank you, Robert. My pleasure to be here. SIEGEL: When I interviewed you at the beginning of January, you said the following: the war in Iraq is the biggest ethical challenge facing America. It's nearly 10 months later. Would you concede that now, whether you like it or not, President Bush is going to get the Iraq policy he wants through the end of his presidency? Rep. PELOSI: President Bush is going to get a policy that is very destructive to the security of our country, that is destabilizing in the Middle East, and is undermining our military capability, unfortunately. What President Bush has done is taken our nation on a course that is a catastrophic mistake. It's hard to exaggerate. I mean, you could never exaggerate the extent of the damage he has done to our reputation in the world and the capability of our military. SIEGEL: But is it implicit in what you're saying that the Democratic majority gave it a good shot this year to try to change course and you didn't do it? Rep. PELOSI: Well, we're still doing it. When the Democrats came into power, we came with a clear mandate from the American people for a new direction. Nowhere was that direction more clearly spelled out than in the war in Iraq. We put a bill on the president's desk that would have redeployed the troops out of Iraq within the next year. The president vetoed it. Since then, we haven't been able to get a bill on his desk because the Senate rules prevent that from happening. The American people aren't interested in the Senate rules. They're interested in ending the war in Iraq. And we will, again, continue to hold him accountable for the conduct of that war, and try to put on his desk legislation that calls for the redeployment of the troops within the next year. SIEGEL: Public approval of Congress is said to be low, people who follow the polls. Why? Why do you think so? Rep. PELOSI: Because of the war. By and large, the lack of action on the war has eclipsed everything that we have done here. I come to this table in, at sort of the end of the first session of Congress with great confidence about what we have accomplished to make America safer with our 9/11 Commission recommendations, and our big increase in benefits for our veterans, making our economy stronger with our Competes Act, our innovation agenda, raising the minimum wage - first time in 10 years \u2014 the biggest package for college affordability since the G. I. Bill, a biggest ethical package in the history of the Congress. The list goes on and on about protecting the American people, restoring the American dream, and doing so in the most ethical and open manner. SIEGEL: But you're saying the inability to get something passed that would have changed course in Iraq obscures that for the American public? Rep. PELOSI: That's right. I've said most of the work that we have done in Congress to date has been eclipsed by the lack of success in ending the war in Iraq. That doesn't mean we will not continue to move strongly on our legislation for a new direction. For example, now, we're proud of what we have done. We're confident that we'll improve the lives of the American people. But there's much more that needs to be done. SIEGEL: What do you make of an explanation one sometimes hears for the low approval ratings of the Congress, which is that instead of searching for common ground with the Republicans who might be amenable to compromise on SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, or even Iraq for that matter, that in the Capitol, we're still seeing as much polarization as we did when the Republicans were in charge here? Rep. PELOSI: Well, the same people who say find common ground are those who say stand your ground when you can't find it. And that's what we do. And as a matter of fact, on every piece of legislation that we have passed and the president has signed, we have had overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact, on SCHIP, we had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate. We just don't in the House. We're 10 votes short, 10 Republicans short of 10 million American children getting health insurance. SIEGEL: So what do you do then in that case, when you're 10 votes short? Rep. PELOSI: Well, we keep fighting. And we will continue the fight because we will not compromise and negotiate away one of those children. We have listened to their concerns. We have introduced a second bill, which clarifies some of the concerns they have. But we will not say to a million children or 5 million children, as the president wants us to do, that you're not going to get health insurance, even though you're entitled to it. SIEGEL: The Associated Press reported today that the president could see signing a bill that increased the eligibility ceiling for the SCHIP program \u2014 this program to deliver health insurance for poor children \u2014 to families of four making $62,000 a year, no state exemptions. When you hear that, should Americans think that Democrats and the White House are at least within shouting distance of a compromise on SCHIP or no? Rep. PELOSI: I don't know what the president said, but I have had no overture. Senator - Republican senators and Democratic leaders have asked the president for a meeting on this subject. He refuses to meet with us. But he does communicate through the press. He knows what our legislation says. So let's be clear about this: You either share the value that 10 million children in our country who are eligible should have access to health insurance \u2014 and that's a value. It's not even an issue in our country; it's a value; it's an ethic. Over 80 percent of the American people support what we're doing. The president is in isolation on this. SIEGEL: So when I asked should we think that you're within shouting distance of a deal on a bill, I'm hearing, the short answer I'm hearing is no. Rep. PELOSI: Well, I know. I certainly hope so. But there are two places to come to agreement. One is in the Congress of the United States to be able to override a presidential veto. Or the other is for the president to agree that we will be insuring 10 million children in America. We have met the concerns that they have raised, and we have been consistent with the SCHIP as it has been enforced under President Bush to date. He shouldn't have a problem with this. SIEGEL: On to another matter, the acting chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission opposed Democratic efforts to increase her agency's funding. You called for her resignation. Rep. PELOSI: Yes. SIEGEL: Can you now negotiate with her about some level of increased funding if you've already said, off with your head and we don't want to deal with you anymore? Rep. PELOSI: Well, she's an employee, the acting chair of the commission. This is about President Bush and his policies. For too long now, they have looked the other way while food has come into our country uninspected - 1 percent of the food in our country is inspected. Much of it has come from overseas, where the safety and health standards do not exist, where products that are being sold to our children, the toys our children have, one of them I had yesterday had 200 percent of the safe limit for - of lead in it. This is about, here we are on Halloween. Our children are in costumes. They're carrying around plastic pumpkins, many of them laden with lead beyond a safe level. We're getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner, where much of the food may be imported and uninspected. We're buying toys for our children \u2014 and in my case, grandchildren \u2014 for Christmas, which can be a danger to their health. We don't want to menace people. But we do want to change the way government protects the American people. SIEGEL: We had an interview like this as you had only recently become speaker and were about to launch a 100-hour blitz that week. I'm just curious, after this time, what is it about being speaker and leading the majority that has surprised you? What are the things that have happened that you didn't expect would be true of this job? Rep. PELOSI: Well, I - the word surprise is not one that I have very much use for as speaker of the House because I have to be prepared for anything. But what I would have hoped for were that the president would have been more responsive to the wishes and the voices of the American people, who so strongly want us to redeploy our troops out of Iraq, when it is safe, honorable and responsible. And I know now where he's coming from and I didn't know this before. The president wants a 10-year - at least another 10 years in Iraq and maybe longer. He envisions a Korea-like presence there for many years to come. This will cost us trillions of dollars. I had hoped that the president was looking for common ground for a redeployment out of Iraq. I had hoped he would have been closer to our position. SIEGEL: If we were to talk again in another year and a half from now, let's say, if there were a Democrat in the White House, and you're still speaker, and there's still Democrats\u2026 Rep. PELOSI: Oh, good. SIEGEL: \u2026here, would the Democrats in the House still be passing resolutions that would require a deployment or withdrawal from Iraq or a timeline? Rep. PELOSI: Yes, absolutely. SIEGEL: If it were President Clinton in the White House, you wouldn't regard that as a constraint upon a Democratic president? Rep. PELOSI: No. First, let me say, I believe very strongly that we will have a Democratic president in the White House. And whoever he or she is, we would hope would be attuned to the wishes of the American people, to the strength of our military, to the stability of the region and the security of our country. SIEGEL: Well, Madam Speaker Nancy Pelosi, thank you very much for talking with us today. Rep. PELOSI: It's my pleasure.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.

The idea is to promote new ways of curbing global warming. Gore is becoming a partner in a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm that funds those ideas - things such as renewable energy technology, carbon markets, sustainable agriculture. I asked Al Gore whether it will take government action as opposed to private investment to make real progress on global warming. He says it takes both. Mr. AL GORE (Former U. S. Vice President; Nobel Peace Prize Winner): We've now reached a stage where this shift is going to happen with or without new government policies. We happen to believe that new government policies will be forthcoming. And whether they are or not, the business sector is ahead of the policymaker of community in recognizing that this shift toward a low-carbon economy has to take place. And the investments are, in some sense, self-fulfilling prophecies, because businesses around the world are now assuming that this shift is going to occur. BLOCK: Now that you've won the Nobel Peace Prize, what impact do you think that's had on your work? Mr. GORE: I don't know. But I've seen some evidence that individuals who might have been more skeptical of the message in the past might be a tad more willing to listen to this message. And I think that's a real consequence and I hope it is, but I really don't know. BLOCK: Hmm. What do you say to the critics who say that your work on climate change, on global warming, doesn't really fit under the rubric of world peace? And that the Nobel Peace Prize has become too politicized? Mr. GORE: Well, those are two separate questions. I think the second question is answered by the worldwide respect that is given to the committee that makes the award. And that in itself is the reason for the prize promoting the reaction that it gets. But as for the nexus between the climate crisis and peace, the secretary general of the United Nations wrote a few months ago about the connection between the crisis in Darfur and the disappearance of Lake Chad, which in turn is linked to the climate crisis. The rapid retreat of the north polar ice cap and the gearing up of navies and coast guards and the nationalistic impulses who exploit this new ocean that's now becoming ice-free is one of many, many other examples of how the climate crisis with its disruptive consequences has the potential for causing conflict. But it also has a potential for creating new areas of collaboration and cooperation. And my own work is aimed at trying to create those new opportunities. BLOCK: Mr. Gore, you've said in the past that you've fallen out of love with politics. And I wonder if you could explain just what you mean by that. Mr. GORE: It's never been a perfect world and I don't want to create false nostalgia for democracy in the past. But I do think that the world of 30-second television commercials has put more attention on Anna Nicole Smith and Britney Spears and O. J. Simpson and less attention on complex choices that our democracy has to confront. I don't bemoan that. I just recognize it. And I don't rule out the possibility at some point in the future of playing some role in the political process. I don't think that's likely. What politics has become is less attractive to me than in the past. But it still is the form in which the most important decisions are made and I recognize and respect that. BLOCK: You said you wouldn't rule it out in the future. You don't think it's likely. If you think about the 2008 presidential election coming up, why not -if you're not interested in running - why not do what you did before the 2004 election and come right out and say, I'm not a candidate? I'm not in this race? Mr. GORE: Well, I mean, I think people hear pretty clearly what I'm saying. And when they ask, why don't you make a Sherman statement? Well, you know, General Sherman said, if nominated, I will not run. If elected, I will not serve. There are some people who say, I was already elected and didn't serve. So I don't see any need to make a so-called Sherman statement. But I think people hear very clearly what I'm saying. It's most unlikely that I'll ever be a candidate again, much less in 2008. BLOCK: Al Gore, thanks for talking with us today. Mr. GORE: Thank you. I enjoyed it. BLOCK: Former vice president Al Gore. He says he'll donate his salary as a partner in a venture capital firm to the advocacy group he founded, the Alliance for Climate Protection. That would not include his stock options.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  Former vice president and new Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore announced a new green business venture today. The idea is to promote new ways of curbing global warming. Gore is becoming a partner in a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm that funds those ideas - things such as renewable energy technology, carbon markets, sustainable agriculture.  I asked Al Gore whether it will take government action as opposed to private investment to make real progress on global warming. He says it takes both.  Mr. AL GORE (Former U. S. Vice President; Nobel Peace Prize Winner): We've now reached a stage where this shift is going to happen with or without new government policies. We happen to believe that new government policies will be forthcoming. And whether they are or not, the business sector is ahead of the policymaker of community in recognizing that this shift toward a low-carbon economy has to take place. And the investments are, in some sense, self-fulfilling prophecies, because businesses around the world are now assuming that this shift is going to occur.  BLOCK: Now that you've won the Nobel Peace Prize, what impact do you think that's had on your work?  Mr. GORE: I don't know. But I've seen some evidence that individuals who might have been more skeptical of the message in the past might be a tad more willing to listen to this message. And I think that's a real consequence and I hope it is, but I really don't know.  BLOCK: Hmm. What do you say to the critics who say that your work on climate change, on global warming, doesn't really fit under the rubric of world peace? And that the Nobel Peace Prize has become too politicized?  Mr. GORE: Well, those are two separate questions. I think the second question is answered by the worldwide respect that is given to the committee that makes the award. And that in itself is the reason for the prize promoting the reaction that it gets. But as for the nexus between the climate crisis and peace, the secretary general of the United Nations wrote a few months ago about the connection between the crisis in Darfur and the disappearance of Lake Chad, which in turn is linked to the climate crisis.  The rapid retreat of the north polar ice cap and the gearing up of navies and coast guards and the nationalistic impulses who exploit this new ocean that's now becoming ice-free is one of many, many other examples of how the climate crisis with its disruptive consequences has the potential for causing conflict. But it also has a potential for creating new areas of collaboration and cooperation. And my own work is aimed at trying to create those new opportunities.  BLOCK: Mr. Gore, you've said in the past that you've fallen out of love with politics. And I wonder if you could explain just what you mean by that.  Mr. GORE: It's never been a perfect world and I don't want to create false nostalgia for democracy in the past. But I do think that the world of 30-second television commercials has put more attention on Anna Nicole Smith and Britney Spears and O. J. Simpson and less attention on complex choices that our democracy has to confront. I don't bemoan that. I just recognize it. And I don't rule out the possibility at some point in the future of playing some role in the political process. I don't think that's likely. What politics has become is less attractive to me than in the past. But it still is the form in which the most important decisions are made and I recognize and respect that.  BLOCK: You said you wouldn't rule it out in the future. You don't think it's likely.

Last April, the campus of Virginia Tech was changed forever when a gunman took the lives of 32 people. The cameras are gone now, it's off the front pages, but for the survivors it's still raw. Many are still struggling to make sense of it all. In this week's Washington Post Sunday magazine, Holly Adams Sherman tells her story. She is a mother of Leslie Sherman. She was 20 when she died. The story is called \"What Comes After. \" And Holly Adams was kind enough to join us today in our studio. Holly, thank you for being here and if I may say just how sorry I am about your loss. Ms. HOLLY ADAMS SHERMAN (Mother of Leslie Sherman): Oh, thank you very much. I'm honored to be here for two reasons: One, to talk a little bit more about the loss that I suffered but also because I am a retired naval officer and it's Veteran's Day and I'm very, very proud of that, too. MARTIN: Then I thank you for your service. Can I ask you, Holly, just to start, what - and you are obviously a very strong woman, and I'm guessing that\u2026 Ms. SHERMAN: No, that's fear that you see. It's not courage. MARTIN: I'm guessing, though, that maybe being - this feeling is new to you. You've seen so much. I mean, we were talking just before we started that, you know, you served in - you were just in Iraq for six months as an investigator. So you clearly conquered physical fear. But I'm wondering whether all this is just new to you - new territory to you - if you ever touch a big experience in all these emotions? Ms. ADAMS: I have to thank the author of the article in the Washington Post for giving away my age. So I'm going to go with that. I am a baby boomer. And of the last 53 years, 52 years, I thought I had just about seen it all. I thought I had just about felt it all. I thought I had just about seen the worst of humanity. I thought I'd witnessed the ugliest things you could possibly see. Nothing prepared me for April 16th, nothing. And I have to say that has to be the worst thing that can happen to a person is to lose a child. MARTIN: What do you think is the hardest thing about this experience that other people who have not been through it just would not understand? Ms. ADAMS: Emptiness. The emptiness. Thirty - I guess, I'd have to say 32 - 31, 32 other sets of parents, you know, including Cho's parents, went through the very, very same thing. Thirty-three families got on the roller coaster that day on April 16th. And we're stuck on this ride. The rest of the world got on the roller coaster too that day, but they got to get off. So - as the roller coaster just keeps going over and over and over again. We're, I think, at the point now where were trying to get to slow down a little so that we can take a look at the scenery around us and find another ride to take that's less impacting. It's been a very, very difficult time for me and for my husband and for my surviving daughter, and the other 32 families who got on that roller coaster with me. And there are a lot other things - a lot of things that we have in common - the families - but we all come from a different place. And it's such a eclectic group of people with such diversity that - and our approaches to handling our grief is so varied. There's a variety of hurt. MARTIN: What? There is a variety, apparently, even within your own family. One of the things that I found very moving about the article is that you and your husband don't necessarily agree about what you should do now. I mean, you're -some of the families want to pursue a lawsuit because they still feel that they aren't getting the answers that they need and want, and others just don't think that's a good idea. That must be hard. Ms. ADAMS: It's no secret that my husband and I have not agreed on everything over the last 21 years. We're a little bit - at polar ends when it comes to personality. So that's not a surprise. But yes, you're right. We - this is very, very fundamental and this is very important. This is the decision between having something flavored with salt or pepper. This is - this is real basic to the fabric of both of our beings. And, in my opinion, I don't know if we can get to the truth without pursuing what's available to further investigate what happened, leading up to April 16th. Well, my husband is thinking that this juncture is more concerned about concentrating on the celebration of life that was, and nurturing the life that we still we have with her surviving sister, Lisa. MARTIN: Does it surprise you that no one has lost his job in the wake of what happened at Virginia Tech? And if they, if someone had, do you think that would, you know, such a stupid phrase, but do you think that would make you feel better? Ms. ADAMS: I was quoted in the article saying I'd like to see Dr. Steger hang in the town square. That must have been one of my better moments. At least I didn't say anything about his genitals because that was (unintelligible). MARTIN: Well, I'm, everybody knew it was metaphor. Ms. ADAMS: Yeah. Would hanging somebody - would watching heads roll make me feel any better? No. No, that wouldn't make me feel any better. The loss is a loss. But I did learn something over the course of the last six months that I think it's important. When we, as families, ask for accountability, unfortunately accountability - the word itself implies blame. I would think now that I would rather use the word responsibility. Who accepts responsibility? And that word implies involvement. So what I would like to see would be to, over the course of Mr. Cho's timeline of his life, his twenty-some years of a lifetime - pinpoint, along that timeline - I like math so I like thinking of it in terms of one straight line - identifying the points on that line where somebody or something could have been involved. And as a result of their involvement, taken the responsibility to make a change that would further have some - modified the landscape of the massacre on April 16th. There are probably hundreds of points on that timeline that I think that - I'm not so much worried about the blame now, as I am about the responsibility. And once those points are identified, we'll have a better handle on how to prevent the same kind of thing from happening to another person, at another place, at another campus, U. S. A. MARTIN: Because you don't want anybody else to go through this, obviously. You know, you mentioned landscape. We're down to our last minute, here, and I see that you have paint on your fingers. And I understand that you've been painting - you've been rediscovering your love of art and painting, in part to remember your daughter. Can you just tell me about some of your current work and how that helps you remember her? Ms. ADAMS: Actually, I'm doing a second series of paintings. My first series was of Iraq. And I had gotten a good sale on black paint at a close-out sale from one of the art stores in the local area. So my paintings were dark and they were powerful and they were of scenes that I had remembered and interpreted in my own mind from the time that I spent in Iraq. When Leslie died, they were too dark for me to have around so I donated what I had remaining to Fort Belvoir, to the chapel that they have that they're going to, I believe, opening this year. And they're going to have a special wall for that. MARTIN: And I see you doing sunflowers now. It's what you were telling me earlier. I'd love to see one of them if you ever feel that - if you'd ever be so kind as to share them with me. Ms. ADAMS: And since - now, I'm doing pictures of things that I think Leslie would love. And she was a lover of color, so\u2026 MARTIN: That's wonderful. Ms. ADAMS: I'm doing some real\u2026 MARTIN: Okay. Ms. ADAMS: \u2026pretty, pretty things. MARTIN: Pretty things. Holly Adams Sherman is the mother of Leslie Sherman. She was killed during the Virginia Tech shootings in April. She's featured in this weeks Washington Post's Sunday magazine story, What Comes After. She was kind enough to join me here in the studio. And if you want to read the story in its entirety, you can go to our Web site, npr. org/tellmemore. Thank you so much, Holly. Ms. ADAMS: You're welcome.

I'm Farai Chideya. If you're just tuning in, today we're talking about how to survive family tensions during the holidays with Karen Hudson, co-author of \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times,\" also La Joyce Brookshire. She's a minister, naturopathic doctor and author of the upcoming \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love. \" Thanks again. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\"): Thank you. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\"): Thank you. CHIDEYA: So Karen, you are someone who has not only multiple generations of living family in the same city, you also are in the family business. You must have had to work a lot of stuff out in order to be able to have your sustained, civil discourse with all the members of your family. What happened or helped you at moments when your tempers were frayed? Ms. HUDSON: I don't know that it's temper as much as frustration. And I worked for my brother at Broadway Federal Bank, and it's the kind of thing where, you know, sometimes it's not a decision I want made. I come from a family who's very chauvinistic and, you know, the men sort of run things when it comes to business. But, on the other hand, my brother has been very generous in allowing me in my creativity, allowing me an opportunity to participate in decision making. So it's frustration that never carries over. CHIDEYA: Do you have any advice if you have lost your temper, and I'm not saying you ever have, but if you do lose your temper, what's the protocol then? Ms. HUDSON: Well, I've had and I've also worked with other relatives, you know, not at the bank necessarily, but you lose your temper. And I don't think it's any different than any other situation. There's a way to handle everything. For me, it's not cussing and fussing. I will make my point known. I will make it known at the appropriate time. And the one thing with family business is you don't do it with an audience. I think it says what Joyce said earlier: You take it aside, you do it in different position. My brother is generous enough that it's not even if you don't disagree, it's like we didn't get that assignment, and he's never going to ask me about it in the family dinner. Never. CHIDEYA: So, LaJoyce, what about you? If you happen to get hot under the collar about something that a kin has done, what do you do to open up after that -reopen communications? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: We tackle it head on. We call family meetings. We - we're scattered about the country, so we don't have the luxury of being in the same city. There are a nest of us that are still in Chicago. I'm not in Chicago anymore. But - and they do see one another regularly, but we are a family who has always been encouraged to let it out, let it go and let God. And so in that, we don't - with my immediate family - I have six brothers and two sisters and I have probably 32 nieces and nephews and 10 great nieces and nephews. So we are crew. And, you know, when ever one is hot under the collar and in a family situation and when we are together, it's like the whole room filled with tension. So something a person in the family will hold the other person - the two people's hands who were at odds - and drag them off to a room and we know what's happening back there, that they are forced to work it out. CHIDEYA: What about kids? You have a 5-year-old daughter with your second husband. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Yes. CHIDEYA: And I'm sure there's a lot of young kids in your family. Do you feel that you can reach out and touch someone who's not your child, or do you feel -and I don't mean necessarily here - I just mean, what's the protocol around that for you at holidays if you see some kid acting out? Do you feel like you can go up and approach them about it? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: No, absolutely. We believe that it takes an entire village to raise a child, and I was - grew up in a unique neighborhood in Chicago on the South side. Our block, we still have several families who were there when I was raised there and the children have now bought houses on the block. And if people die, they still buy - other people in the families buy the houses. So we have a very tight-knit community. And as you say that, I - it comes to mind of our block-club party when I was home in Chicago this summer in July. And you know, the kids were cutting up. Well, one person, Ms. Alice from down the block, had four of the children, like our kids, by the hands bringing each of them to the center of the street and made them apologize and, you know, for the infraction that they had created. And we just sat around and said, um, Ms. Alice took care of that. And because - but now the problem is that the oldest don't step in enough because they are afraid that, you know, A, they might get shot, they might get told off. You know, there are lots of reasons why the village doesn't raise the children anymore, but we are firm believers of still doing that. Ms. HUDSON: You know, I grew up on the same block. It just happened to be in Los Angeles. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Mm-hmm. Ms. HUDSON: I went to a funeral a month ago of the woman who lived three doors down from us when I was a child, and the neighborhood is still very much the same. It was very interesting, at the funeral, afterwards the repast, we had that conversation about how blessed we were that everyone was looking out for us. We knew the teachers, our parents, you know, the principal was the same one at the school forever, (unintelligible) he'd change every year. And that's something, you know, I don't have children, but I will do it in an appropriate way, but I will say something. You know, and maybe in a friendly way like the etiquette police are out. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: That's right. (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. HUDSON: Will you cut that out. Or and the worse offense is to me is how some of these young children dress and\u2026 Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Absolutely. Absolutely. CHIDEYA: Well, it's about time for us to wrap up. I just want to give each of you a chance for any final thoughts that will carry people through that vast holiday season stretching from Thanksgiving all the way through the New Year. La Joyce? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: I would have to say that if there is anything that you're harboring against the family person, you cannot conquer what you don't confront and understand honestly and the goodness that the truth will make you free. CHIDEYA: Karen? Ms. HUDSON: Carry yourself like your grandmother is looking over your shoulder every day of your life. CHIDEYA: Well, Karen, LaJoyce, thank you so much. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Thank you. Ms. HUDSON: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving. CHIDEYA: Happy Thanksgiving. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: One to you too. Bye. CHIDEYA: We've been speaking with LaJoyce Brookshire, a minister, naturopathic doctor and author. Her upcoming book is \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love,\" also Karen Hudson.

CHIDEYA: So Karen, you are someone who has not only multiple generations of living family in the same city, you also are in the family business. You must have had to work a lot of stuff out in order to be able to have your sustained, civil discourse with all the members of your family. What happened or helped you at moments when your tempers were frayed?  Ms. HUDSON: I don't know that it's temper as much as frustration. And I worked for my brother at Broadway Federal Bank, and it's the kind of thing where, you know, sometimes it's not a decision I want made. I come from a family who's very chauvinistic and, you know, the men sort of run things when it comes to business. But, on the other hand, my brother has been very generous in allowing me in my creativity, allowing me an opportunity to participate in decision making. So it's frustration that never carries over.  CHIDEYA: Do you have any advice if you have lost your temper, and I'm not saying you ever have, but if you do lose your temper, what's the protocol then?  Ms. HUDSON: Well, I've had and I've also worked with other relatives, you know, not at the bank necessarily, but you lose your temper. And I don't think it's any different than any other situation. There's a way to handle everything. For me, it's not cussing and fussing. I will make my point known. I will make it known at the appropriate time. And the one thing with family business is you don't do it with an audience. I think it says what Joyce said earlier: You take it aside, you do it in different position. My brother is generous enough that it's not even if you don't disagree, it's like we didn't get that assignment, and he's never going to ask me about it in the family dinner. Never.  CHIDEYA: So, LaJoyce, what about you? If you happen to get hot under the collar about something that a kin has done, what do you do to open up after that -reopen communications?  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: We tackle it head on. We call family meetings. We - we're scattered about the country, so we don't have the luxury of being in the same city. There are a nest of us that are still in Chicago. I'm not in Chicago anymore. But - and they do see one another regularly, but we are a family who has always been encouraged to let it out, let it go and let God. And so in that, we don't - with my immediate family - I have six brothers and two sisters and I have probably 32 nieces and nephews and 10 great nieces and nephews. So we are crew.  And, you know, when ever one is hot under the collar and in a family situation and when we are together, it's like the whole room filled with tension. So something a person in the family will hold the other person - the two people's hands who were at odds - and drag them off to a room and we know what's happening back there, that they are forced to work it out.  CHIDEYA: What about kids? You have a 5-year-old daughter with your second husband.  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Yes.  CHIDEYA: And I'm sure there's a lot of young kids in your family. Do you feel that you can reach out and touch someone who's not your child, or do you feel -and I don't mean necessarily here - I just mean, what's the protocol around that for you at holidays if you see some kid acting out? Do you feel like you can go up and approach them about it?  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: No, absolutely. We believe that it takes an entire village to raise a child, and I was - grew up in a unique neighborhood in Chicago on the South side. Our block, we still have several families who were there when I was raised there and the children have now bought houses on the block. And if people die, they still buy - other people in the families buy the houses. So we have a very tight-knit community.  And as you say that, I - it comes to mind of our block-club party when I was home in Chicago this summer in July. And you know, the kids were cutting up. Well, one person, Ms. Alice from down the block, had four of the children, like our kids, by the hands bringing each of them to the center of the street and made them apologize and, you know, for the infraction that they had created. And we just sat around and said, um, Ms. Alice took care of that.  And because - but now the problem is that the oldest don't step in enough because they are afraid that, you know, A, they might get shot, they might get told off. You know, there are lots of reasons why the village doesn't raise the children anymore, but we are firm believers of still doing that.  Ms. HUDSON: You know, I grew up on the same block. It just happened to be in Los Angeles.  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Mm-hmm.  Ms. HUDSON: I went to a funeral a month ago of the woman who lived three doors down from us when I was a child, and the neighborhood is still very much the same. It was very interesting, at the funeral, afterwards the repast, we had that conversation about how blessed we were that everyone was looking out for us.  We knew the teachers, our parents, you know, the principal was the same one at the school forever, (unintelligible) he'd change every year. And that's something, you know, I don't have children, but I will do it in an appropriate way, but I will say something. You know, and maybe in a friendly way like the etiquette police are out.  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: That's right.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Ms. HUDSON: Will you cut that out. Or and the worse offense is to me is how some of these young children dress and\u2026  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Absolutely. Absolutely.  CHIDEYA: Well, it's about time for us to wrap up. I just want to give each of you a chance for any final thoughts that will carry people through that vast holiday season stretching from Thanksgiving all the way through the New Year. La Joyce?  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: I would have to say that if there is anything that you're harboring against the family person, you cannot conquer what you don't confront and understand honestly and the goodness that the truth will make you free.  CHIDEYA: Karen?  Ms. HUDSON: Carry yourself like your grandmother is looking over your shoulder every day of your life.  CHIDEYA: Well, Karen, LaJoyce, thank you so much.  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Thank you.  Ms. HUDSON: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving.  CHIDEYA: Happy Thanksgiving.  Dr. BROOKSHIRE: One to you too. Bye.  CHIDEYA: We've been speaking with LaJoyce Brookshire, a minister, naturopathic doctor and author. Her upcoming book is \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love,\" also Karen Hudson.

I'm Farai Chideya. We all know Thanksgiving is supposed to be a time of family fellowship. But some see Turkey Day and other holidays as grounds to spark or rekindle a family feud. Sibling rivalry, ex-spouses and the nutty uncle who packs food to go before dinner begins - all problems that can spoil the fun. So how can you have a drama-free holiday? Is there such a thing? Joining us to give a few pointers are Karen Hudson, co-author of \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times,\" and LaJoyce Brookshire. She's a minister, a naturopathic doctor and author of upcoming \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love. \" Welcome ladies. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\"): Thank you. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\"): Thank you for having me. CHIDEYA: So, La Joyce, you wrote the novel \"Soul Food\" and in the film, we see a lot of family drama. You also counseled people on their relationships. So why are the holidays such a stressful time? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Well, I think because it forces us to confront things that we don't want to. And it starts to build a month before the dread, the fearfulness, the, you know, have I lost enough weight, the do I look like I'm doing all right enough? You know, those kinds of things are stressors that press on us and cause us not to enjoy the holiday as much as we should because these are the things that we needed to probably confront even prior to the holiday, but we have not. CHIDEYA: Is any of your family in \"Soul Food\"? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Oh yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, I enjoyed family gatherings. In my family, I would never run from the table when we had the tourist conversation. You know, they always let me stick around for some reason. And I got to learn a lot about life. And when cousin Sheila(ph) had her problems and when cousin Sheila came around, I knew that we were going to, A, air dirty laundry and solve her problems. But what somebody would ultimately end up doing is - after the wisdom flew around the table, with all the gray hairs, then someone will go get the Bible to see what God had to say about it. So that's how all of the problems were solved in our family. CHIDEYA: Well, Karen, you may have a slightly different solution. \"Basic Black,\" the book that you wrote - when you think about the book that you wrote, trying to bring a little bit of order to the modern chaos around manners, how does that apply during the holidays? Is it any tougher, any different? Ms. HUDSON: Well, I think it's tougher because the holidays represent the best and the worst of our childhood. It's all the food that we were happy to eat, and everybody comes home for, you know, grandma's sweet potato pies and somebody's macaroni and cheese. But it also has all the heartache and the things you remember about how somebody treated you when you were a child, and now you're an adult and you're coming home on a different kind of atmosphere. I come home a very different experience because I'm blessed to be a third generation living in the same town where the rest of my family is. So I see them on a regular basis. And I do not have one holiday where there was ever drama at the table. And perhaps that is because we were raised to care ourselves, like our grandmother was looking over our shoulder. As long as we did that\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. HUDSON: It was a pretty calm day. CHIDEYA: So what does that mean to you to have a civil and civilized holiday? What constitutes that? Ms. HUDSON: A lot of good food and, just, you know, even though I see my family on a regular basis. It's a time of celebration. And particularly, Thanksgiving is a time where you really do take note of what you're thankful for. And I think that one of the other things that I firmly believe is that, you know, we do need to take the commercialism out of the holiday season. I think that adds to a lot of the angst and a lot of the stress. You know, can I buy a good enough present? Do I get something for everybody? Is somebody going to buy me something? Am I going to ditch what they got me? But the other part of it for me is Christmas Day is my mother's birthday. So\u2026 CHIDEYA: Mine too. Ms. HUDSON: Really? Wow. And so, you know, we look at it a different kind of way. It is really a time of celebration. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Karen brought up something poignant, if I may interject, that you think about your treatment from childhood, which goes back to what I said about dealing with things that we have yet to confront, and that if you are really carrying something from childhood that Uncle Jimmy(ph) did to you that you have yet to confront and you dread going to Thanksgiving dinner because you know Uncle Jimmy(ph) will be there, it's time to confront it and let it go. CHIDEYA: But in what circumstances do you do which? I'm going to ask both of you that. LaJoyce, when is it appropriate, you think, to confront something? Is it\u2026 Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Not at the dinner table. CHIDEYA: Right. Dr. BROOKSHIRE: I think that it's something - if it's something that comes up at every holiday it's obviously something that troubles you, and I think that it's maybe Uncle Jimmy needs a letter if you can't discuss it. Maybe Aunt Suzie(ph) needs to have a phone call and, you know, and then you could scream your guts out one on one without any other interaction or anyone else around. Or maybe you can do it civilly and invite them out for a meal on neutral turf so that, you know, you're not at either person's house. However, you choose to do it, but you know, those are the enemies of our past that allow - don't allow us to move forward. And so I would like for my child and my husband to have a relationship with Uncle Jimmy, but every time somebody mentions them, I can't. You know, so I think that those are the things also that help stop us from having a happy Thanksgiving and something to be thankful for and getting together with family be they far or near. Ms. HUDSON: You know, I have to take issue with the - whatever it was - scream your guts out with Aunty so and so. I don't ever think that solves anything. And I think that what we have to be mindful of, I think, your very own point when you talk about this and things we have to deal with. I think we have to deal with them with ourselves first before we ever confront - if that's the right term - the offending family member. And my thing is, don't do it during the holidays. There are 11, 12 other months that, you know, we can look at things. (Unintelligible) on Independence Day. Write that letter then. You know, call them, invite them to dinner, whatever you have to do - and particularly if you're not on the same city. And you have a concern about your children, And particularly now they're in the same city and you have a concern about your children particularly if it's a concern that might have to do with some prior abuse or something like that, you know, then you distance yourself a different kind of way. CHIDEYA: We've had conversations during the course of this series on the family about when you just have to burn the bridges behind you. LaJoyce, I guess, on a personal level, you've had a very - you had a very difficult relationship with your former husband. You had to nurse him through an illness, and he had lied to you. Why don't you just tell us a little bit about that and did you burn the bridge behind you, or did you stay in touch with him? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Okay. Well, in 1990 I married a man who swept me off my feet and who came into my life like prince charming. And two years into the relationship, I discovered he had full-blown AIDS. And it wasn't until he was almost dead that I found out he knew he always had AIDS that he was always infected. I am victoriously negative. And - also, I didn't know until after he was dead that he was on the down low. So, yes, I burned the bridges because, well, he died and, you know, I refused to allow him to strangle me from the grave. I refused to not forgive him because, obviously, he didn't know any better, and because I'm God's girl for real, and to be exposed to the virus multiple occasions and to not become infected, I am completely God's girl. And so in that I knew that I couldn't harbor on to un-forgiveness. Also in my work as a naturopathic doctor, I understand that un-forgiveness is the emotional component of cancer. And so, it wasn't worth holding on to this piece of something from - for a dead man. So I also buried his family when I buried him, especially his sisters who knew that he was infected when they stood up in my wedding. So I forgive them and have watched their lives completely fall apart. And so there are a few people in his family who I have chosen to have relationship with. And it is very comforting and a nurturing relationship on both parties as we have. And we enjoy each - one another's company. CHIDEYA: I bring this up for two reasons. One is because your upcoming book is on this topic, but secondly, when we think about holidays, we think about memories. And what do you do with the memories of the holidays that you spent with your former husband? Do you try to erase them? Do you just acknowledge them and move on? Dr. BROOKSHIRE: Mm-hmm. I acknowledge them and move on. Because the holiday season for him was tumultuous, so he brought in those feelings. His uneasiness and his conflict that was unsettled in his family, he brought that in - with him into our relationship. See that's the part about teaming up and marrying someone who you know him but you don't know him. So all of those of things would have uncovered themselves if I would not have been in such a hurry to get to the altar if you will. We met and married within 11 months. So, you know, when you take the time to find out what a man's relationship is with his momma, you know, what his relationship with his sibling, and why do they have such a horrible, venomous relationship, and it's obviously because of family secrets, which ultimately steal, kill and destroy. CHIDEYA: Let me go to you, Karen, your mother being born on Christmas day as mine was, and we celebrate every year, does that add a level of expectation to the holiday that weighs it down or does it lift it up and make it something different? Ms. HUDSON: Clearly, lifts it up. I think that when my mother after about 50 years said I'm not doing Christmas anymore so I inherited it. And every year, it's like how can I make it more special for mom. And mom grew up, you know, like your momma I'm sure never had a birthday party on her birthday with her friends. And my grandfather, my mother's father, just spoiled her rotten with the Christmas presents and the birthday presents. And when he passed, even though she was an adult, it was like, you know, the little kid in her came out. And so we go to great lengths to have a birthday cake to do all the things that she never had as a child. CHIDEYA: Well, I want to share more about family stories, family wisdom and just plain good manners, but we have to take a break. Thank you so much for this beginning of the conversation.

Mr. ROBERT LUDDY (President, Brandy Station Foundation): Oh, in some cases, yes. And so what's looking at on the wall is a series of signatures, names, drawings, just expressions by the soldiers as they walked through. SEABROOK: The modeled gray paint and white wash has been chipped back, revealing scrawls and sketches made from fireplace pole. It's not fine art. More like the 19th century version of George was here. But there is folk art -a picture of a horse, its ears perked up, flowing wings of angel? Part of the wall has been destroyed. And so the rest of the picture is lost. And then there are women. Let's look at this lady on wall over here. There's a picture of a woman with big dress on - if I can make it out correctly. And looks like she has a two-inch waist. She's real synched in at the waist, as was the style\u2026 Mr. LUDDY: As was the style. That's absolutely right. She is crossing over a plank. She doesn't want to get her dress dirty so she takes her hands. She pulls up on her skirt, showing us high top shoes, shins, petticoats. Will be dancer here. Now, what's more important thing for us is she leaves us a message. SEABROOK: What does it say? Mr. LUDDY: The whole message reads: I am turned over to Lieutenant Gale. And we've come to the conclusion that the right Gale is Lyman Gale of the 10th Vermont Infantry, whose unit camped literally across the road here in a vacant field outside the house during the winter encampment here. And so we think Lyman was the right guy. SEABROOK: Luddy takes the clues he gets from the walls and tries to piece together the history of this house. Before the winter encampment of Union soldiers, it had been a Confederate field hospital. The house was also at the center of one of the biggest cavalry battles of the Civil War - the Battle of Brandy Station. And so the graffiti scrawled across the walls comes from both sides. But it's hard to recreate the exact history - not just because records are spotty and the references sometimes oblique - but because the walls themselves are falling to pieces in places. Cracks spider across, meeting others, breaking some walls into large chunks, held up only by horse hair. That's right. Horse hair. This house have a skeleton of wood and lass(ph) slathered with a plaster that's mixed with horse hair as a thickener. Now, the hair is the only thing holding the wall together in some places. (Soundbite of train) SEABROOK: And there is the daily traffic of commuter and heavy freight trains out back that send tremors through the house, Luddy says. Mr. LUDDY: It's almost like its won mini version of tectonic plates. They move back and forth across one another with the vibrations from the train. And as they move and they rub, then the plaster breaks down and you wind up with the white dust that just falls to the floor. SEABROOK: This stuff. This makes the job of uncovering the house's hidden messages all the more delicate. And that job belongs to Kirsten Travers. She's a restoration and paint removal specialist, hired in the summer to test ways of removing the multiple layers that cover the historic graffiti. Before Kirsten can even start in area of this room, she has to test the wall's strength. (Soundbite of knocking) SEABROOK: Tell me what you're doing when you tap the wall. Ms. KIRSTEN TRAVERS (Restoration and Paint Removal Specialist): Well, I lay my left palm flat on the wall. And then with my two fingers on my right hand, I tap the wall around my left hand. SEABROOK: What do you hear there? Ms. TRAVERS: I hear a few different variations of thudding sounds. But what I feel is what is more important to me. I can actually feel how the vibration travels up and down the crack here. And that's really what's happening when every train goes by - the vibrations. They're just travelling all over the wall, travelling through each crack and, you know, the wall is really losing adhesion little bit by little bit every time a train goes by. SEABROOK: Kirsten Travers, you're still uncovering graffiti in here. I mean, there are big parts of the walls where there is that old gray modeled paint that you're off? Ms. TRAVERS: I'm working up in this corner - upper corner of this plaster wall. And there's about two square feet of white wash and paint that are still covering the graffiti though the rest of the surrounding area has already been exposed. So there's bares plaster and on top of it is graffiti paint of - drawn in charcoal and pencil. And what you can see around the area that I'm going to work on is the letters R-E-G-T, which is Regiment; N-Y-E, which is New York Engineers. Mr. LUDDY: I think so. Mr. TRAVERS: Pontoon train and Bob believes I'm going to find the number 50. Mr. LUDDY: Bob hopes. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. LUDDY: Bob hopes. (Soundbite of laughter) SEABROOK: Well, why do you think the number 50 is it. Mr. LUDDY: Well, we know that the 50th New York Engineers were here in Brandy Station or the Brandy Station area during the winter of '63 to '64. And we also know they were in charge of the Federal Pontoon train. We have about a half a dozen pictures downstairs from the Library of Congress' Archive of the Civil War showing the camp site and the Pontoons of the 50th New York Engineers. So if we could actually have their signature on the wall, that would be super duper. But we will never know until Kirsten gets underneath that paint layer. And who knows? I mean, we may all get surprised if it turn out to be somebody totally different. But that's part of this venture of cleaning the walls. SEABROOK: Kirsten Travers dragged her stepladder to the corner of the room. She takes a spray bottle and mists the walls to loosen the top layer of paint. Ms. TRAVERS: We'll just take a straightedge razor blade. And applying a certain pressure, I'm able to get just underneath the white wash layer that's covering the graffiti. And I'm able to pop it off. There looks like there's a number emerging. SEABROOK: Oh, it's a five, just like we were expecting. But we haven't seen a zero so far. Ms. TRAVERS: No. But there's something. Let's see what these marks are going to bring us to. SEABROOK: If you could just stand here, watch this, it's like\u2026 Ms. TRAVERS: That's what people do when (unintelligible) come to the house and I'm working. It's like I look behind me and there's this crowd of people watching. But I just get into this zone because my face is six inches away from the wall the day. SEABROOK: I mean, I'm just standing here with my jaw open, sort of like watching this history be uncovered for the first time. Mr. LUDDY: Yeah. (Soundbite of paint peeling) Ms. TRAVERS: Yes, so were all the first people to see this in one hundred and\u2026 Mr. LUDDY: \u2026forty-three years. Ms. TRAVERS: Yup. SEABROOK: One hundred forty-three years. Is it a one? Is it\u2026 Ms. TRAVERS: It might be a one. It looks like it\u2026 Mr. LUDDY: It could be 157. SEABROOK: Looks like it\u2026 Mr. TRAVERS: Oh, that's true. It could be a seven but it looks more like a oen to me. Mr. LUDDY: Well, everyday, you learn something new. Mr. TRAVERS: Okay. So\u2026 Mr. LUDDY: Well, now\u2026 SEABROOK: 15th Regiment. Mr. LUDDY: And now, we'll look for more pictures. (Soundbite of laughter) SEABROOK: They expected to find the 50th Regiment and they found the 15th. But that's no disappointment for Bob Luddy. It's just the next clue in a historical treasure hunt. It's what makes working here - Travers and Luddy both say - so exciting. It seems like as you, Kirsten Travers, are reconstructing what was written on these walls, you, Bob Luddy, are reconstructing the history. Mr. LUDDY: Absolutely true. Absolutely true. This house has a history all by itself. And this house deserves to be more than just a museum composed of dead things of a bygone age. This house is really a living being in it of itself. SEABROOK: A living time machine, Luddy says, that transports you into the lives and thoughts American soldiers, north and south. And the scrawls on the walls of this Graffiti House tell a different story from what you'll find in a history book, Luddy says. This is no bronze statue of a commander on a house. This house gives a glimpse of the foot soldier, the every man, the rural lady and, especially, the young men who fought against each other in America's only Civil War. (Soundbite of music) Seems fitting to have our parting words tonight come from Abraham Lincoln. In his deeply beautiful second inaugural address, Lincoln urged the country. (Reading) Let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  ANDREA SEABROOK, host:  You might think of graffiti as a blight on buildings, trains, bathroom stalls. Or maybe you see it as a hip urban artform. But in the tiny town of Brandy Station, Virginia, graffiti is history. It sends messages from the Civil War.  Robert Luddy heads the Brandy Station Foundation, which is trying to restore the Graffiti House. He leads me inside the old, red clapboard house, upstairs to a bright sunny room.  (Soundbite of footsteps)  SEABROOK: This room is - got this big plank, old wood floors. Big, almost floor to ceiling windows in the rooms, which is gorgeous. And the paint has chipped away on the walls - on some of the walls. And there's this graffiti but it's much bigger than I would have expected. I mean, the letters are a foot high.

He spoke with Robert this afternoon at his Washington hotel. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: Prime Minister Olmert, welcome. Thank you for talking with us. Prime Minister EHUD OLMERT (Israel): Thank you very much. SIEGEL: Prime Minister Olmert, in your address today, you spoke of coming negotiations, and you said, we will not avoid any subject. And while this will be an extremely difficult process for many of us, it is nevertheless inevitable. Are you prepared, at some point over the next year if you hear the right concessions and negotiations, to go before the Israeli public and say it's time to withdraw from the West Bank, for the Palestinians to have a capital in East Jerusalem and for us to make peace on terms acceptable to Mr. Abbas? Prime Minister OLMERT: Mr. Siegel, what you actually propose is that instead of waiting and going through the motions and negotiate with the Palestinians and come to the necessary conclusions, that I'll start it by making an announcement right now in your program and disclose the whole thing. I think it's a little bit too early, but I still don't want to avoid your question. I said it in the past, when it was not very comfortable politically for me, I said things which lots of people didn't like, some of them may have liked. I said my beliefs, my truth and my convictions, and that's how I am going to continue to do in the future. What exactly we will agree with the Palestinians remains to be seen. As I said, I believe that if we are serious in our mutual attempt to make peace, that will require painful compromises from both sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis. And if we reach that stage and if we will make an agreement, then of course I'll come to the Israeli public and I will share with the Israeli public everything, because I live in a democracy. Israel is a democracy. SIEGEL: I didn't ask you about a Palestinian right of return to Israel. I assume that's a compromise you expect the other side to make at some point in these negotiations. But territorial compromise obviously is going to be on the table for you over the coming year? Prime Minister OLMERT: That's definitely true. I think it's not new. We have said it many times in the past that we are prepared to make a territorial compromise, even a painful territorial compromise. Exactly how, what shape it will take, what will be the exact borders and so on, this is something that we have to leave for negotiations, and this is too early to say. SIEGEL: What do you say to people who look at this conference in Annapolis today and say, we have a Palestinian president who's lost control of the Gaza Strip, we have an Israeli prime minister with low approval ratings, we have an American president in the last year of his presidency, we don't have three strong political leaders here prepared to make important compromises. Prime Minister OLMERT: You know, politicians are strong to the extent that they are ready to take serious decisions and fight for it. And in this respect, I think that we will be measured not by the ratings, but by the courage that we are prepared to manifest in pursuing the fulfillment of our national goals. That was my belief. And I think that we have a long way to go, but nothing will deter me from moving forward in this direction, and I want to believe that nothing will deter President Mahmoud Abbas. SIEGEL: But how can you negotiate an agreement with President Abbas if he doesn't have control of the Gaza Strip? Prime Minister OLMERT: At the end of the day, of course, Gaza will have to be part, not only of the agreement, but also of the implementation. In other words, if everything is subject to the implementation of the road map commitments, then the implementation of the road map commitments with regard to Gaza means that Gaza will have to be terror-free, and that will be incumbent on the Palestinians to carry out. The reason that we are moving on this pattern is we are first going to negotiate the political horizons, the essential elements that may help create a two-state solution. Implementation will be subject - of this dream, of this solution, will be subject to the implementation of the road map commitments. So there is a long way. We are not trying to suggest that it can be done within a week or within a year, but you have to start somewhere. And we are committed, absolutely, to help start it. We don't want to waste time. We don't want to gain time. We want to move forward. SIEGEL: But isn't it a fair observation that various groups of Israelis and Palestinians, official and otherwise, have been going off for years and figuring out what a solution is supposed to look like, what the final settlement is to be. The whole problem is implementation, isn't it? Prime Minister OLMERT: No, it's a very important part, of course, of the program. But first and foremost, it's the understanding of what is the solution. And I don't know that until now, there was an agreed pattern of solution between the leaderships. There were volunteers from our side, from their side. There were all kinds of self-appointed messengers that were meeting with each other, which is natural, it happens. But it's incumbent on the leaderships, on those who hold the formal responsibility for their people, those who represent their countries. This is what I am doing. This is what Mahmoud Abbas is doing. We have to sit down and negotiate and reach an agreement, and that is what we are trying to do now. SIEGEL: Are there steps to be taken now by both sides as demonstrations of commitment to this process? For example, for you, is it time to dismantle outposts, illegal outposts, outside West Bank settlements as a demonstration of commitment to the process? Prime Minister OLMERT: It's part of the road map commitments. And I say today, as you will read in my speech, that we will accomplish all of our commitments of the road map. SIEGEL: Conditionally, after the Palestinians have done other things? Or can you go home and say, here is a step that we have to start taking right now? Prime Minister OLMERT: I'm not holding the negotiations with you. I think I made it clear. SIEGEL: You're not going to negotiate with me here in Washington. Prime Minister OLMERT: You know, I don't put conditions. I don't make conditions. I don't create unnecessary obstacles. There are parts that we have to accomplish. We will accomplish. There are parts that they have to accomplish. They will have to accomplish. SIEGEL: I appreciate your not wanting to negotiate with me here in Washington, D. C. Are you negotiating with President Abbas at this point? And are there real, concrete discussions about what should happen now? Prime Minister OLMERT: I'm talking with President Abbas. We started to talk a few months ago on a regular basis, very interesting, very revealing discussions which led us into what happened today. So this is a landmark, this is not an end of the process. But we started to negotiate before and we made a commitment today to carry on these negotiations on a regular basis, continuously, in order to try and reach an agreement within a year. I don't know that we will succeed to do it, but we will definitely and seriously and genuinely try. SIEGEL: Well, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, thank you very much for talking with us. Prime Minister OLMERT: Thank you. BLOCK: We also requested an interview with either the Palestinian president or prime minister, but both declined our request.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  Now, our interview with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. He spoke with Robert this afternoon at his Washington hotel.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  Prime Minister Olmert, welcome. Thank you for talking with us.  Prime Minister EHUD OLMERT (Israel): Thank you very much.

We have to sit down and negotiate and reach an agreement, and that is what we are trying to do now.  SIEGEL: Are there steps to be taken now by both sides as demonstrations of commitment to this process? For example, for you, is it time to dismantle outposts, illegal outposts, outside West Bank settlements as a demonstration of commitment to the process?  Prime Minister OLMERT: It's part of the road map commitments. And I say today, as you will read in my speech, that we will accomplish all of our commitments of the road map.  SIEGEL: Conditionally, after the Palestinians have done other things? Or can you go home and say, here is a step that we have to start taking right now?  Prime Minister OLMERT: I'm not holding the negotiations with you. I think I made it clear.  SIEGEL: You're not going to negotiate with me here in Washington.  Prime Minister OLMERT: You know, I don't put conditions. I don't make conditions. I don't create unnecessary obstacles. There are parts that we have to accomplish. We will accomplish. There are parts that they have to accomplish. They will have to accomplish.  SIEGEL: I appreciate your not wanting to negotiate with me here in Washington, D. C. Are you negotiating with President Abbas at this point? And are there real, concrete discussions about what should happen now?  Prime Minister OLMERT: I'm talking with President Abbas. We started to talk a few months ago on a regular basis, very interesting, very revealing discussions which led us into what happened today. So this is a landmark, this is not an end of the process. But we started to negotiate before and we made a commitment today to carry on these negotiations on a regular basis, continuously, in order to try and reach an agreement within a year. I don't know that we will succeed to do it, but we will definitely and seriously and genuinely try.  SIEGEL: Well, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, thank you very much for talking with us.  Prime Minister OLMERT: Thank you.  BLOCK: We also requested an interview with either the Palestinian president or prime minister, but both declined our request.

I'm Robert Siegel. Now, some developments regarding subprime mortgages. Today, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a measure to reform the Federal Housing Administration - and help some owners who were at risk of foreclosure. The House passed a version of that bill earlier this year. For its part, the administration has been hard at work on its Hope Now proposal. In addition to FHA reform, the administration wants banks to voluntarily freeze interest rates on their adjustable loans. But there are limits to their plan. It only covers people who obtained a loan between certain dates, and those who've remained current on their payments. I spoke today with Robert Steel, who's undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, and I asked why keep everything voluntary? Why not allow for government intervention? For example, Chairman Barney Frank of the House Financial Services Committee says, give bankruptcy courts the authority to restructure mortgages that could keep people in their homes. Mr. ROBERT STEEL (Undersecretary for Domestic Finance, Treasury Department): I think that from our first perspective is focusing on current households that are troubled and providing relief where we can keep people in their homes. We believe the Hope Now proposal that we've been working hard with, along with FHA, goes a long way to doing that. I think the issue of bankruptcy and the different approaches is something that's generally been in the lane of the Justice Department, and the prospect(ph) that they've worked with, and it's been less in Treasury's lane. SIEGEL: But, you know, the sort of Democratic criticism of the administration here is that a voluntary approach involving all of the lenders \u2014 the mortgage lenders and the people who hold their securities \u2014 that helps them, as opposed to a plan that could go straight to the people who are hurting most of all, who might be losing their homes in foreclosure right now. Mr. STEEL: Well, your point is a right one. And that is, the person we're trying to help is the homeowner, period. And the president said that on August 31st, when he first began talking about this issue. And it's been the mantra that we've been focused on all along. And we start with a homeowner. If I can remind you, I think our approach was first to identify these people, and then to make sure they had independent counselors working with them to help them devise the best strategy. And now, we're talking about what products are the best to those people who can stay in their home in a sustainable way, what are the right products. And that's really the next step for Hope Now. SIEGEL: The right products - in this case that we're talking about, what kind of mortgage or refinanced mortgage should they have to permit them to stay in the house? Mr. STEEL: And the process, Robert, to achieve that. You know, if you look, we've identified that there are about 1,200,000 people that will be in the range of people that can be helped by the program that we're describing. And in some cases, those will be people where mortgages could be modified, they can refinance, or in some cases, we've described a process by which the initial rate of interest would be maintained for up to five years so that there'd be a period of time where they could be in their home and working through this and finding a longer-term structure. But the goal should be to find long-term solutions that work for each homeowner. SIEGEL: But that idea of keeping the introductory rate \u2014 some would say the teaser rate \u2014 of the mortgage where it is rather than having it reset, that's something that's entirely voluntary. And that's something you're proposing that banks should offer or the holder of mortgages should offer to their borrowers. It would be dramatic to say, a moratorium on resets for a year until we sort out where the mortgage market is. Mr. STEEL: Yeah, I'm comfortable that our approach is the right way for us to work with this now. SIEGEL: Let me read some scary numbers to you that the New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman cites today on the Op-Ed Page of the New York Times. He's citing estimates that if home prices in America fall 20 percent \u2014 and he's working on the assumption that the housing market has been vastly overvalued \u2014 there will be 13. 7 million homeowners with negative equity, 13. 7 million people who owe more on their house than what it's actually worth. And if home prices fall 30 percent, that number would rise to more than 20 million. These numbers, whether they are 13 million or 20 million, sound very alarming, with that many people in debt over their house. A crisis for the country if we hit a situation like that? How would you describe it? Mr. STEEL: Well, I think, let's look at what's going on. I think for me to speculate on what might happen or react to specific scenarios isn't really the right way for us. Let me talk about what we're doing and how we're thinking about it. You know, in America, we have over 50 million Americans that have enjoyed homeownership. The process of homeownership and financing homes in America is the envy of the rest of the world. We have very high homeownership numbers. And it's been successful. I think that, now, our focus is keeping people in their homes and doing what we can to make sure that happens. Basically, there are always some number of people who are successful - a very large number in the high 90 percent - and historically, we have a number of people that are unsuccessful - people that go into foreclosure every year primarily because of personal circumstances, change in condition, financial condition, things like that. And so, I think if we can focus on the million-two that we've identified, that should be the role for us to be focused on. SIEGEL: Robert Steel, undersecretary of the Treasury, thank you very much for talking with us today. Mr. STEEL: Robert, thank you for having me.

When BBC correspondent Alan Johnston was kidnapped last spring, heartfelt calls for his release came from BBC listeners around the world. Johnston was the only Western journalist actually living in Gaza at the time. Freed in July, he recalls his experience in the new book \"Kidnapped and Other Dispatches. \"  Alan Johnston joined us from London. Welcome. Mr. ALAN JOHNSTON (BBC): Hello. MONTAGNE: What exactly happened the day you were kidnapped?  Mr. JOHNSTON: I came out of our BBC bureau in the center of Gaza City. And on that afternoon, I remember getting into my car, which is parked across the street - and I've got just a couple of alleyways - and then a wide car surging past me, forcing me to stop. And almost immediately, a young guy with a pistol, standing in front of my car and then a man with a Kalashnikov too, emerging from the kidnapers' car. Very quickly, I was bundled into the back of the white car and we were off, moving fast through the streets. And the kidnappers, laughing as they went through my pockets. And they put a black hood over my head. But through the wool of the hood, I could see the sun flickering behind the high-rise buildings. And I knew that we were heading east and south towards the rougher parts of Gaza City.  MONTAGNE: You described the first place you were being held in captivity is a cell-like room with a sagging bed and a couple of plastic chairs. The only relationships you could have at all were with your guards. Mr. JOHNSTON: Sure. The guards had come in with food and so on. But other than that, it was an entirely isolating experience, a vast sensation that you'll be buried alive, and a fear that the world would simply move on. But on the 17th night, the guards came in with a radio, which I've been asking for since the beginning of the kidnap, and suddenly there was that lifeline, that outlet to the outside world. I began to realize that many, many people around the world were starting to notice my trouble, if you like. And it was the great psychological boost. MONTAGNE: You know, one of the most intriguing aspects of your kidnapping is actually your release, effectively, because Hamas took over Gaza. And of course, Hamas is a group that the U. S. and the European Union consider a terrorist organization. But for you, it made the difference between your being captive and free. Mr. JOHNSTON: Absolutely. Hamas is determined to control the Strip. And part of that process was putting the sort of people that had captured me out of business. MONTAGNE: Being actually released. That seemed to be the closest you've got to being killed by your captors or being killed with them. Mr. JOHNSTON: The last night was certainly the blackest, the most frightening period. The kidnappers seemed to blink or crack or whatever and decided to let me go. And that began the most terrifying ride of my life. The guards were furious - angry, no doubt - that the whole kidnap had come to nothing. And they were violent for the first time.  And I remember, as we approached the Hamas check points, the guards just decide themselves with rage. And at one point, through this black hood that had been put over my head, I could see the muzzle of the Kalashnikov just an inch or two from my eye, and I heard the guards screaming the Arabic words for praying. And it was clear that he was saying, if the Hamas men didn't get back, then I would get a bullet in the brain, I guess.  But eventually, they got through and pulled up in an alleyway, and I was hold out of the car and they drove off. But I turned the corner, and there standing in the dark was my old friend and colleague, Fayed Abu Shammala, from the BBC Arabic Service. And in that instant, I knew that it was over and that I was free.  MONTAGNE: You're back in the U. K. now. Do you have any plans to return to Gaza? Mr. JOHNSTON: I am really very, very well known in Gaza that if I went back now after becoming as well known as I did, I can imagine that there's a lot of people coming out to have a look at the guy who got kidnapped, who has come back. And sadly, I will have to steer clear of Gaza for a good long while, I think. MONTAGNE: Thank you for joining us to talk about this. Mr. JOHNSTON: Thanks very much, indeed.

On the short list of places known for creating the world's oldest writing systems, Africa doesn't often make the cut. But for thousands of years, people across the continent have made and used a rich variety of alphabets and symbols. A new exhibition called \"Inscribing Meaning: Writing and Graphic Systems in African Art\" explores the ancient and modern ways that Africans manipulate the written word to express sacred and secular ideas. The show is open now at the Fowler Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles. Later, I'll speak with an artist and a historian who contributed to the exhibition. But first, I had to go see things for myself. So I went over to the Fowler and got a quick tour from the show's co-curator Polly Nooter Roberts. We're standing in front of a work with vultures carrying arms and people carrying arms. Can you describe it a little bit more and tell me what I'm looking at? Ms. POLLY NOOTER ROBERTS (Co-curator, Fowler Museum): Sure. This is an appliqued flag from Ghana, from the Fanti speaking people of South Central Ghana. And it belonged to a kind of a military association called an Asafo Company. These are centuries-old military associations, but they still serve today in civic functions. And on it what you see are several levels of literacy all at once because you see the appliqued figures and the vultures. These guys with their rifles and then facing three carrion-like birds with rifles also and you see the emblem of the Ghanaian flag. But on the right hand side, you see a proverb that's written in Roman letters. But alphabets like Roman and Arabic have been appropriated by Africans for their own local uses. So the reason you can't understand what this says is that it's transcribing the local language of Twi. And furthermore, the Twi writing that you see is referring to a proverb, yet another level of literacy in Ghana. And so what the proverb is saying is all our enemies are vultures. So it's a kind of attack on the enemy to show that not only are we the dominant military company but literacy is part of the reason why. CHIDEYA: Why don't you lead us on to some of the other sections of the museum? Ms. ROBERTS: Let's go over here. CHIDEYA: Now, we're going into a space where I can see video. Ms. ROBERTS: Yes. The work that you're referring to is by Sue Williamson. She's a very well-known South African artist. And this work in video and the work next to it, it's a series of prints by Kim Berman, another South African artist, are both about the truth and reconciliation commission that was formed after the dissolution of the apartheid regime. But what's really amazing about this interactive piece by Sue Williamson is that she has gained access to two cases that show both the perpetrator and the victim when they were in the same room during questioning. And she records -you have to actually engage with the mouse in order to make it speak. So as you're scrolling along, you'll see these inscriptions coming up on the surface of the video that are their words, their dialogue and this gap of memory. CHIDEYA: Well, I want to go see what happens when I press the buttons and looks like there's a track ball here. (Soundbite of interactive artwork by Sue Williams) Unidentified Man: I cannot remember specifically. I can't remember it - I cannot remember that. If I could\u2026 I cannot remember\u2026 CHIDEYA: It's like a remix. Ms. ROBERTS: Right. As you hit the - so these are the transcripts of the interviews, and as you scroll over them, you hear their voices. Unidentified Man: I cannot remember it specifically. CHIDEYA: So now we're back to the very last gallery. What do you want to show us here? Ms. ROBERTS: The two very colorful works here are by Wosene Worke Kosrof. He's an Ethiopian artist who lives in the Bay Area. And he is very inspired by the traditional script called Ge'ez that was used for healing and it's still used today in the churches of Ethiopia. But what he does is to take the letters and also the letters of modern day Amharic and deconstructs them and places them in a grid where he explores their other sensory dimensions like the smell and the taste of letters and their references to music. He loves jazz. And so he's looking at these multilayered dimensions of letters and words. CHIDEYA: Polly, thank you so much for this tour. Ms. ROBERTS: Thank you so much. It's been great to talk with you. CHIDEYA: And with me now is one of the artists featured in the \"Inscribing Meaning\" exhibition, Wosene Kosrof. Wosene, welcome. Mr. WOSENE KOSROF (Artist): Thank you very much. CHIDEYA: And we also have Konrad Tuchscherer. He's associate professor of history at St. John's University in New York. He also worked on the exhibition. How are you? Dr. KONRAD TUCHSCHERER (Associate Professor, History, St. John's University): I'm fine. Thank you very much. CHIDEYA: So thanks, gentlemen. And Wosene, let me start with you. We got to see one of your pieces that was laid out on a grid. And it has some symbols that look like Amharic. But it also has symbols that look - I remember symbols male, female genitalia. You have other symbols that are charts - to something that looks like a chart. How do you mix up images and language? Mr. KOSROF: Well, you know, the image actually - the genitalia seems simply an image. But it's really a letter. The circle chart also is a food cooking menu. It's almost like a book. It's almost like depicting a classical Ethiopian icon paintings that I have somehow picked up. CHIDEYA: Konrad, let me go to you. When you hear Wosene talk about his work, which is modern but has some roots in some ancient work, how do you think of that in the context of this exhibition that you helped put together? Dr. TUCHSCHERER: Well, I think it's really amazing. I think it provides insight, perhaps, into the minds of some of those early geniuses that invented scripts and systems of graphic symbolism in Africa because they were drawing from their cultural environments. But also, they were creative individuals, geniuses like Wosene. CHIDEYA: Now, when you tell people that you study African writing systems, do people say I didn't know Africa had any writing systems? Dr. TUCHSCHERER: Very true. There's a mythology that circulates and it's even penetrated African studies that Africans don't have writing and that Africa is an historically illiterate continent. But not only did writing, perhaps, originate on the African continent - in Egypt - but Africa, in all parts of the continent, has different writing systems and systems of graphic symbolism that communicate and record information. And some of them are still thriving today. And they're generally understudied by scholars. CHIDEYA: Wosene, you speak English, obviously, Amharic and you've been in the U. S. for 30 years. You still work with your native language. Why is that important to you after you've become so rooted in the U. S. art world? Mr. KOSROF: Well, I tell you, you know, when you grow up, the fact I lived here little longer than I lived in Ethiopia. I have always been impressed and interested by the culture that I lived in at the time, and I still carry that with me. And my, also, American culture is really fully embedded in myself and my always thinking. And I think I become also, you know, somehow, you know, in a crossroad to connect with this writing as a way that I can define who I am as a person but also how the global environment also look through that. CHIDEYA: Konrad and Wosene, thank you so much. Dr. TUCHSCHERER: Farai, thank you very much. Mr. KOSROF: Thank you very much to you. CHIDEYA: We were joined by Konrad Tuchscherer. He's an associate professor of history and director of the department of Africana Studies at St. John's University in New York. He joined us from our NPR studios in New York. And Wosene Kosrof is an artist based in Berkeley, California. His work is featured in the exhibition \"Inscribing Meaning: Writing and Graphic Systems in African Art\" at the Fowler Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles. You can see some of Wosene's work and pieces by other artists in the exhibition at our Web site, nprnewsandnotes. org.  FARAI CHIDEYA, host:  I'm Farai Chideya and this is NEWS & NOTES.  On the short list of places known for creating the world's oldest writing systems, Africa doesn't often make the cut. But for thousands of years, people across the continent have made and used a rich variety of alphabets and symbols. A new exhibition called \"Inscribing Meaning: Writing and Graphic Systems in African Art\" explores the ancient and modern ways that Africans manipulate the written word to express sacred and secular ideas. The show is open now at the Fowler Museum at the University of California, Los Angeles. Later, I'll speak with an artist and a historian who contributed to the exhibition.  But first, I had to go see things for myself. So I went over to the Fowler and got a quick tour from the show's co-curator Polly Nooter Roberts.
